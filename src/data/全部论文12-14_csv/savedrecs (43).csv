In the model, these effects are endogenously determined in a rational expectations equilibrium. For the effect of an interest rate shock, they have the opposite signs and the indirect risk premium effect can dominate the direct risk premium effect under reasonable parameters. This means that domestic short-term bonds and foreign bonds are complements in the model even though domestic long-term bonds and foreign bonds are substitutes. This model, focusing on the indirect risk premium effect and on the term structure of interest rates, can be combined with a small sample bias approach to explain stylized facts about the forward premium anomaly, which is found for short-term interest rates, but not for long-term interest rates.","[Lim, Hyoung-Seok] Korea Inst Finance, Seoul 100021, South Korea; [Ogaki, Masao] Keio Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Ogaki, M (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Dept Econ, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",hslim@kif.re.kr; mogaki@econ.keio.ac.jp,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Adopting Lee and Chinn (1998, 2006) approach as well as Chinn et al (2007), two results stand out. First, we confirm that the behavior of the real exchange rate has altered since 2000. Identifications show that permanent shocks are the primary causes for the movement of the real exchange rate after 2000, while in the period before 2000, the Indonesian real exchange rate changes are characterized by greater dominance of temporary shocks. The apparent change in the real exchange rate behavior may be strongly justified by the implementation of free-floating exchange rate system since August 1997. Second, the shift of the real exchange rate behavior after 2000 does not necessarily affect the current account dynamics. Empirical evidence confirms that the variance of current account post 2000 remains largely due to temporary shocks. Albeit having increasing influence, permanent shocks have insignificant effect in explaining fluctuations of the current account. In this sense, the current account surplus after 2000 is attributed largely to nominal variables such as price increase, while the impact of productivity improvement is still limited.

Hence Process Standardization is targeted to address the digital society in general and business community in particular for satisfying the needs of inter-enterprise integration standards that provide real-world value (as mentioned in the Object Management Group Mission statement). For this purpose a unified model that allows a better understanding on the nature and significance of strategic alignment in theory and practice called 'Abstraction Standardization Customization Personalization model' is conceived based on Abstraction-Standardization-Concretization Methodology. It considers the use of contemporary state-of-the-art, new management technologies such as Business Process Management (BPM), Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Cloud computing to address the end-users, government agencies, business community belonging to e-governance and e-business domains. The purpose of bringing out any unified strategic alignment model should be in a position to address a broad spectrum in a comprehensive and coherent manner without leaving the ground or base line.

This paper as a first step applies a cointegrated VAR framework to test for stationary real exchange rates and linear adjustments in prices and nominal exchange rates. As a second step, ESTR error correction models are fitted to test whether nonlinear error correctional behaviour characterizes the data. The results clearly indicate that the nominal exchange rate is responsible for the nonlinear mean reverting behaviour in real exchange rates and also mainly drives overall adjustment. Applying dynamic stochastic simulations based on the estimated models, this study also confirms recent results that the half-life times of real exchange rate shocks are significantly smaller than the consensus benchmark of 3-5 years.

This is determined by legislation. While achieving customer value through quality, food supply is the core logistical purpose. Food-product traceability as such is seldom regarded as a core purpose. Food-product standards are a key resource in developing connectivity between information systems operated by different firms in a supply network using numerical product codes. This study couples the technical characteristics of a food-product standard with the organizational characteristics of a supply network. The common purpose is to achieve customer value in the supply network. Alderson's (1965) marketing-channels (transvection) model of product supply is applied to analyze potential multiple uses of the TraceFish product standard in its supply network. The case study of North Sea herring supply involves following raw material from in Norway to finished product in the Netherlands. Analysis of this empirical data exposed variation in TraceFish standard use, including coupling it with GTIN product codes. This facilitated seamless electronic information exchange between firms for a range of supply-network purposes, including tracing food. This perspective is possible when multiple functions and professions that are equally involved in operating and managing business processes are allowed to handle not only operation, but also develop information systems.","Molde Univ Coll, Dept Econ Informat & Social Sci, N-6402 Molde, More & Romsdal, Norway",Molde University College,"Engelseth, P (通讯作者)，Molde Univ Coll, Dept Econ Informat & Social Sci, POB 2110, N-6402 Molde, More & Romsdal, Norway.",peen@himolde.no,,,Norwegian Research Council (NRC); NRC,Norwegian Research Council (NRC)(Research Council of Norway); NRC(National Research Centre (NRC)),"This research was financed by the Norwegian Research Council (NRC).

Our approach for stock selection is based on knowledge discovery in large databases technologies; more specifically, we build techniques that allow one to discover hidden price patterns which are capable of predicting the direction of stock prices. The base of the whole system is a novel pattern mining algorithm from time-series data, which involves highly compute-intensive aggregation calculations as complex but efficient distributed SQL queries on the relational databases that store the time-series. This algorithm follows similar path to Association Rule Mining algorithms (such as the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms) but with major differences. First, it has one step more at initialization which uses a rule-based generator algorithm that transforms relations and data structures in a binary string format. These patterns contain mixed information of small price patterns (3, 4 or 5 candlesticks) and trading signals/filters produced by technical indicators. As output, instead of generating association rules, it produces probabilities (varies between 60% and 95%) about the future stock price direction such as within next 5 periods, price will increase (or decrease) more than 2%. Then, the stock selection system exploits all this information and uses it to find those stocks that appear to form patterns which have the highest accuracy in predicting prices. Each time period (finest interval length being 10 minutes), the stock selector system, having the support of trading systems, examines and decides which stocks should be replaced in current portfolio by other more profitable stocks.

The share of the gross nominal average wage in agriculture of its national economy counterpart is about only about 78% in 2011, which is not so much lower than the percentage in the year 2000 and the years when the Czech Republic started to draw the support from the pre-accession EU programs. The objective of the research is to depict the effect of changes in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on the wage differentials in agriculture and on the labor productivity in the Czech Republic in the period with a starting point of pre-accession help of the EU funds until 2012. So the research question of this paper is whether and to what extent the CAP changes do have any effect on wage differentials in agriculture in terms of the differences between the gross nominal average wage in agriculture and the one in the national economy and on the labor productivity differences in terms of average product per employee. Simple linear regression models (LRM) to map the relationship between the chosen variables are applied on the datasets from the databases Czech Statistical Office (CSO) and Eurostat and is estimated by the ordinary least square (OLS) method, using the variable of wage differences, in terms of the differences between the gross nominal average wage in agriculture and the one in the national economy, and the variable of labor productivity in agriculture as endogenous, and changes in the CAP and national support as exogenous. The expected results of this paper are very small positive effects of the changes in the CAP and also of the changes of national support on the level labor productivity and very small negative or even negligible effects on wage differences in agriculture. However, the results seem ambiguous showing rather opposite impact on the wage differentials.","Czech Univ LifeSci Prague, Dept Econ, FEM, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Grycová, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ LifeSci Prague, Dept Econ, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",grycova@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,42,54,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300004,0

But, despite the ever-increasing importance of the topic, few studies have investigated this behavior among senior citizens. The handful of studies that have been conducted have produced conflicting results and focused on gains as opposed to losses. These conflicting results may in part be due to demographic confounds and the inherent variability that comes with aging. Here, demographic confounds and variability due to aging were minimized by studying three groups: middle-aged, unimpaired older, and impaired older adults. Participanti were asked to choose between sooner smaller and later larger monetary rewards and losses: Results indicated that impaired older adults discounted the future more than unimpaired older adults. Interestingly., middle-aged adults discounted future gains at a similar rate as impaired older adults, but discounted future losses less than impaired older adults (and similarly to unimpaired older adults). This may suggest that unimpaired older adults have developed a compensatory mechanism that leads to more cautious, patient choices.

Further, we consider the least weighted squares estimator, which is a highly robust estimator based on the idea to down-weight less reliable observations. We compare various versions of the Durbin-Watson test for the least weighted squares estimator. The asymptotic test is derived using two versions of the asymptotic representation. Finally, we investigate a weighted Durbin-Watson test using the weights determined by the least weighted squares estimator.

While development (commercial, industrial and residential) potential of farmland affects agricultural land values in all countries, its impact is potentially more acute in Newly Industrialised Countries where development pressure is strong and planning law is often weakly enforced. In the Malaysian land market, which epitomises this situation, State Authorities have approved a large number of applications to convert land from agriculture to development, such that the market is inclined to behave as if planning control lacks credibility. To investigate the influence of 'development potential' on land legally designated as agricultural in Malaysia, an extensive dataset of over 2,000 land sales has been assembled. Using this database we attempt to estimate the effect - the development rent - on land price, which turns out to be high, exceeding 400% of agricultural value in some cases. From there, we draw some conclusions regarding the efficacy of existing planning controls and the implications of such a high premium.","[Khalid, Haniza] Int Islamic Univ Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Lloyd, Timothy Adrian; Morgan, Christopher Wyn] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Khalid, H (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management Sci, POB 10, Kuala Lumpur 50728, Malaysia.",hanizamv@iium.edu.my,,"Khalid, Haniza/0000-0003-2250-0500",,,,,29,1,1,0,7,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The two models show contradictory results in the case of the impact of tax uncertainty. When using the tax quota, it shows a positive influence on growth, which contradicts the theoretical assumptions, while the use of the WTI leads to results consistent with theory and shows that the impact of tax uncertainty on economic growth is negative.","[Kotlan, Igor] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,igor.kotlan@vsb.cz,"Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020","Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216",,,,,40,8,8,0,3,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

It also addresses an identifiable gap in the relevant literature which is the extent to which the recent so called shift from e-government to e-governance systems takes place in European governments. Sixteen different national European cases are considered. The findings support the view that policy makers should exercise careful consideration of e-government pressures and implementation that is performed via the different e-governance strategies for purposes of consistency and alignment with the planned outcome and the human capacities involved.","[Orelli, Rebecca Levy; Padovani, Emanuele; del Sordo, Carlotta] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Forli Campus,15 Piazzale Vittoria, I-47121 Forli, FC, Italy; [Katsikas, Epameinondas] Univ Kent, Accounting, Sch Business, Chatham ME4 4AG, Kent, England",University of Bologna; University of Kent,"Orelli, RL (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Forli Campus,15 Piazzale Vittoria, I-47121 Forli, FC, Italy.",rebecca.orelli@unibo.it; emanuele.padovani@unibo.it; carlotta.delsordo@unibo.it; E.Katsikas@kent.ac.uk,,"PADOVANI, Emanuele/0000-0003-4429-4381; Orelli, Rebecca Levy/0000-0001-8154-1033",,,,,17,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,713,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500069,0

In this revitalized awareness, a particular and fundamental role is played by sugar. The sugar market is far from being a peaceful and conventional one, bringing more challenges and unrest on its own. An unusual mixture of free and protected markets, special trade agreements and outstandingly volatile prices differentiate the trade of this product from other agricultural commodities. Historically, sugar has been one of the most volatile agricultural commodities, constituting a real challenge both for market participants and for policymakers to deal with its instability. In addition, with regard to domestic markets, sugar prices can differ substantially from country to country, generally registering higher levels than the world sugar prices. The Romanian economy manifests an increased responsiveness to external shocks, as a consequence of the processes it is traversing in the recent decades. The sugar market is consequently affected by the external instability while also facing other internal problems and challenges. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the particularities of the sugar market and their implications, by describing, modeling and analyzing the recent sugar price volatility on the Romanian market in comparison to the international one. After establishing the corresponding econometric models the paper compares the estimated conditional variance on the two markets, emphasizing the situation of the Romanian market and commenting on its implications.

However, the effect of alcoholic intoxication over the willingness to take risks is complex and still remains unclear. We conduct an economic field experiment in a natural, drinking, and risk-taking environment to analyze how both actual and self-estimated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels influence subjects' choices over monetary lotteries with constant expected value. Our results reveal a negative impact of both actual and self-estimated BAC levels on risk taking. However, for male and young subjects, we find a positive relationship between BAC underestimation (a pattern of estimation error that mainly occurs at high BAC levels) and the willingness to choose riskier lotteries. Our findings suggest that a risk compensation mechanism is activated only when individuals' own intoxication level is consciously self-perceived to be high but not underestimated. We conclude therefore that human propensity to engage in risky activities under the influence of alcohol is not due to an enhanced preference for risky choices. In addition to the suggestion in the existing literature that such propensity is due to a weakened ability to perceive risks, our results indicate that an impaired self-perception of own intoxication level may also be an important factor.","[Proestakis, Antonios] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Hlth & Consumer Protect, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; [Espin, Antonio M.] Univ Granada, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Granada, Spain; [Exadaktylos, Filippos] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, BELIS, Murat Sertel Ctr Adv Econ Studies, TR-34060 Istanbul, Turkey; [Cortes Aguilar, Alexandra; Palacio, Luis A.] Univ Ind Santander, Escuela Econ & Adm, Bucaramanga, Colombia; [Oyediran, Olusegun A.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Albacete, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Granada; Istanbul Bilgi University; Universidad Industrial de Santander; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Exadaktylos, F (通讯作者)，Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Santral Kampusu,E5-10, TR-34060 Istanbul, Turkey.",ph.exadaktylos@gmail.com,"Exadaktylos, Filippos/HKV-5069-2023; Espin, Antonio M./AAB-1273-2020; Exadaktylos, Filippos/ABB-3381-2020; Proestakis, Antonios/GVS-0537-2022","Exadaktylos, Filippos/0000-0001-7339-8847; Espin Martin, Antonio Manuel/0000-0002-1174-0771; Cortes Aguilar, Alexandra/0000-0002-6866-6488; Proestakis, Antonios/0000-0002-7395-4150; Palacio Garcia, Luis Alejandro/0000-0001-9056-6216",,,,,73,12,16,0,19,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

In particular, univariate volatility models like traditional ARCH model and its extensions will be object of our interest. Selection of the best suitable model may be usually based on in-sample or out-of-sample criteria. In empirical studies, we usually favour model that can capture real features of the data analysed and, in addition, can provide the most accurate out-of-sample forecast quality. In this paper, we focus just on out-of-sample comparison of linear and nonlinear ARCH family models which may follow two different approaches. In first approach, alternative models are contrasted by different loss functions based directly on variance forecast and Diebold-Mariano type tests. The second approach includes indirect evaluation methods which consider using of alternative variance forecasts. In our study, we deal with the evaluation of alternative ARCH family models within a VaR framework. Empirical comparison of the methods discussed above will be demonstrated on illustrative example using sample data from U. S. stock market.

However, if extraction becomes more costly as reserves are depleted, such policies also shorten the fossil fuel era, induce more fossil fuel to be left in the earth, and thus curb cumulative carbon emissions. These consequences are relevant, as global warming depends primarily on cumulative emissions. There is no green paradox for a specific carbon tax that rises at less than the market rate of interest. Because this is the case for the growth of the optimal carbon tax, the green paradox is a temporary second-best phenomenon. There is also a green paradox if there is a chance of a breakthrough in renewables technology occurring at some random future date. However, there will also be less investment in opening up fossil fuel deposits, and thus cumulative carbon emission will be curbed.","[van der Ploeg, Frederick] Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van der Ploeg, F (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,17,18,5,43,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

This current paper aims to investigate the effects of such socioeconomic factors on the probabilities of farm growth, decline and exit relative to retaining the previous farm size. The survey and agricultural registers' data are used for multinomial logit estimation. The results indicate that the farm growth probability is highest in the 40-49 year age group. The availability of successors significantly reduced farm exit probability, and the level of education of the farm operator increased the farm growth probability. While off-farm work was more probable in smaller farms and in cases of more educated and younger farm managers, it was evident that the off-farm employment of the farm operator significantly increased the probability of farm exit. While the larger farms have a higher probability of remaining in business, and lower probability to exit or decline, they do not have higher growth probability. Participation in a semi-subsistence farming scheme reduces the exit probability. It has been shown that farms founded during the beginning of transition due to restitution have lower decline and growth probabilities, indicating that such farmers are emotionally more inclined to maintain the farms of their forefathers.","[Viira, Ants-Hannes; Poeder, Anne; Vaernik, Rando] Estonian Univ Life Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Viira, AH (通讯作者)，Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Kreutzwaldi St 1, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",ants.viira@emu.ee,"Poder, Anne/A-9600-2014","Poder, Anne/0000-0003-1402-1948",,,,,44,11,12,0,24,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Although trade reduces markups in both countries in our framework, its impact on variety depends on their relative position in the world income distribution: product diversity in the lower income country always expands, while that in the higher income country may shrink. When the latter occurs, the richer consumers in the higher income country may lose from trade because the relative importance of variety versus quantity increases with income. Using data on GDP per capita and population, as well as on the U.S. income distribution, our theoretical results are illustrated in two different contexts: the hypothetical bilateral trade liberalization between the U.S. and 188 countries; and the historical sequence of U.S. free trade agreements since 1985.

J,"Carley, S",,,,"Carley, Sanya",,,Energy demand-side management: New perspectives for a new era,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EFFICIENCY; SELECTION; STATES,"Over the past decade and a half, state governments have assumed greater responsibility over demand-side management (DSM) operations. Whereas DSM programs formerly were initiated primarily by utilities or state public utility commissions, they are now becoming increasingly state-initiated and incentivized through funding mechanisms or efficiency-level mandates. The supporting literature, however, has yet to respond to these changes and to verify that DSM funding or mandates are effective policy mechanisms. Furthermore, the supporting literature has yet to resolve some of the research design and methodological challenges that traditionally plague DSM evaluations. As states continue to expand their energy and climate policy efforts, and the federal government considers the possibility of national decarbonization policies, of which DSM is a key strategy, the need for empirical research on the effectiveness of DSM programs will grow. This essay describes the current status of DSM efforts in the U.S. and explores how these programs affect electricity operations. The relationship between DSM policy and program efforts and the amount of saved electricity is tested with a methodological approach aimed at minimizing the selection bias that is inherent in the nonexperimental research design. Results confirm that state-run DSM efforts contribute to electricity savings across the country. Public benefit funds coupled with performance incentives are found to encourage utility participation in DSM programs. Energy efficiency portfolio standards and performance incentives effectively promote electricity savings, but public benefit funds without the support of other DSM policies are not significant drivers of either DSM program participation or total DSM electricity savings.

Using a panel of developed and emerging economies from 1970 to 2007, it is shown that in the two years following the beginning of a capital inflow surge the credit-to-GDP ratio increases by about 2 percentage points. The effect is reversed in the medium-term with the credit-to-GDP ratio decreased by almost 4 percentage points seven years after the initial surge. The paper also finds that the effect is different depending on the type of flows characterising the episode (debt vs. portfolio equity vs. FDI), with large capital inflows that are debt-driven having the largest effect. The results of the paper also suggest that the short-term effect of capital inflow surges on domestic credit depends on countries' macroeconomic policy stances. In particular, it is found that this effect is lower in countries with higher real exchange rate flexibility and fiscal policy counter-cyclicality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Using a detailed database and performing several panel data regression models, we find that family firms exhibit better financial performance on average than non-family firms when the founder is still involved in operations, although this effect decreases with firm size. With heirs in charge, there is no statistical difference in financial performance. Both direct and indirect ownership (control through pyramidal ownership structures within family business groups) affect firms' financial performance positively. However, this positive effect decreases with firm size. The results suggest that some kinds of family involvement appear to make firm growth expensive. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Defining the difference between the marginal revenue and cost of reducing GHG emissions as the net benefit, which is endogenously characterized by various factors, we estimate a switching regression model where the sign of the net benefit determines the relationship between GHG emissions and profitability. Our empirical analysis focuses on ISO 14001 adoption, market competition, uncertainty, financial flexibility, and share ownership structure as the factors, and indicates that firms with low firm-specific uncertainty, high financial flexibility, and a high proportion of large shareholders tend to have a nonnegative net benefit, so that the positive relationship between their GHG emissions and profitability is mitigated. On the other hand, although ISO 14001 adoption is generally considered to be an indicator of a firm's stance on environmental proactiveness, it does not provide a sufficient incentive to reduce emissions. Factors such as uncertainty, financial flexibility, and share ownership structure are more important to GHG emission reductions.","[Hatakeda, Takashi; Kokubu, Katsuhiko; Kajiwara, Takehisa] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Nishitani, Kimitaka] Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Kobe University; Kobe University,"Hatakeda, T (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, 2-1 Rokkodai Nada, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",hatakeda@kobe-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,46,57,59,3,75,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

While maintaining the Internal Model Approach based on Value-at-Risk, a stressed VaR calculated over highly strung periods is to be added to present directives to constitute Minimum Capital Requirements. Consequently, the adoption of the appropriate VaR specification remains a subject of paramount importance as it determines the financial condition of the firm. In this article I explore the performance of several models to compute MCR in the context of Emerging and Frontier stock markets within the present and proposed capital structures. Considering the evidence gathered, two major contributions arise: (a) heavy-tailed distributions - particularly Extreme Value (EV) ones-, reveal as the most accurate technique to model market risks, hence preventing huge capital deficits under current measures; (b) the application of such methods could allow slight modifications to present mandate and simultaneously avoid sVaR or at least reduce its scope, thus mitigating the impact regarding the enhancement of capital base. Therefore, I suggest that the inclusion of EV in planned supervisory accords should reduce development costs and foster healthier financial structures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An important contribution of the paper is the application of the recently developed Phillips and Sul (2007a) panel convergence methodology which has not hitherto been employed in this area. This method analyses the degree as well as the speed of convergence, identifies the presence of club formation, and measures the behaviour of each country's transition path relative to the panel average. In addition, this is the first empirical paper that analyses the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis on the European retail banking integration process. The empirical results point to the presence of convergence in all deposit and lending rates to non-financial corporations up to 2007. In contrast, the null of convergence is rejected in all deposit and credit markets after the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. Although we still find slow convergence in a few sub-clusters of countries, the transition paths become very divergent, with the credit market being far more heterogeneous than the savings market.

Here, firm-level data are used, collected on 900 formal and informal businesses in the capitals of Benin, Burkina Faso and Senegal. Data from these surveys, complemented by semi-structured interviews of major stakeholders in the three cities as well as data from national accounts, document huge enforcement problems, leading to the emergence of large informal actors coexisting with smaller informal businesses.

In the context of a rational learning model, which we show better matches the empirical relations between future fund-raising and current performance than behavioral alternatives, we estimate that indirect pay for performance from future fund-raising is of the same order of magnitude as direct pay for performance from carried interest. Consistent with the learning framework, indirect pay for performance is stronger when managerial abilities are more scalable and weaker when current performance is less informative about ability. Specifically, it is stronger for buyout funds than for venture capital funds, and declines in the sequence of a partnership's funds. Total pay for performance in private equity is both considerably larger and much more heterogeneous than implied by the carried interest alone.

As access to knowledge resources is crucial for the growth and survival of knowledge-based start-ups, we argue that an individual's decision in favor or against becoming an entrepreneur should critically depend on the multilevel context providing her with access to strategically relevant knowledge. A unique dataset for German students and regions allows us to analyze a variety of personal and regional determinants of entrepreneurial intentions among students. At the individual level we find that role models facilitating the transfer of tacit knowledge and the expectation that strong ties will provide know-how and know-who positively impact entrepreneurial intentions. At the regional level we find that a high regional start-up rate in knowledge-based industries and a high growth rate of regional knowledge production positively influence entrepreneurial intentions.","[Dohse, Dirk] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Walter, Sascha G.] Univ Kiel, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Dohse, D (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",dirk.dohse@ifw-kiel.de; sascha.walter@bwl.uni-kiel.de,,"Walter, Sascha/0000-0002-0414-1770",,,,,94,88,97,2,110,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We use survey data on 809 foreign affiliates in five transition economies.

Variables that predict the real economy as well as the equity premium - in particular dividend-price ratio, default spread, relative T-Bill rate and consumption-wealth ratio - are related to fund flows and can account for the correlation of flows and market returns. Furthermore, consistent with the information-response hypothesis, mutual fund flows are forward-looking and predict real economic activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The equilibrium amount behaves procyclically when aggregate consumption is low but countercyclically when it is high. The varying size of the credit market modifies the amount of risk sharing, which in turn influences asset prices such as expected stock returns, stock return volatility, and the term structure of interest rates.

Despite the importance of this topic from a policy point of view, most studies are descriptive and explore a limited number of characteristics of fast-growth firms. The existence of some correlation between two or more of the determinants of fast growth could yield, however, spurious results. To avoid that problem, this paper performs a multivariate analysis of the determinants of fast growth using a panel of Spanish firms. The variables explored include sector of activity, region and newness of the firm as well as access to external finance and firms' human resource practices. We control for the presence of unobserved time-invariant, firm-specific heterogeneity as well as for the possible existence of state dependence. We find that past extreme growth episodes increase the probability of current fast growth, which is in contrast to previous findings on the topic. We also find that human resource practices, such as employing qualified personnel or the mix of contracts offered, are important determinants of fast growth. Lastly, newness and access to credit are found to be important to explain firm growth, but they are not significant determinants of fast or extreme employment growth, thereby reflecting the existence of non-linearities in the growth process of firms.","[Lopez-Garcia, Paloma; Puente, Sergio] Banco Espana, Madrid 28014, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Lopez-Garcia, P (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",paloma.lopez-garcia@bde.es; sergio.puente@bde.es,,,,,,,33,74,82,3,68,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This analysis examines how the Interstate Highway System has changed since its inception in 1938, first map in 1947, and the beginning of construction in 1956. The mileage has grown considerably, allowing for many new routes, and the spatial coverage of the network has been extended to allow many new metropolitan areas to be connected. This has lowered connectivity but increased the metropolitan population served. A GIS dataset was created for the 1947 network, allowing it to be compared to the current network using standard accessibility measurement techniques. This research shows that the Interstate System has not kept up with population shifts in the South and West, and there is no correlation between accessibility change and population change. The greatest improvements have in fact taken place in the densest part of the network, not where population or traffic growth has been greatest. It has therefore reinforced advantages held by places already well placed on the original 1947 network. The old American Manufacturing Belt continues to provide an effective regionalization for capturing variations in the Interstate network, though it has become the Rustbelt and is of declining importance within the country.

These losses cast doubt on the effectiveness of regulations and risk management systems based on a single Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraint. While some researchers have recommended using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to control tail risk, VaR remains popular among practitioners and regulators. Accordingly, our paper examines the effectiveness of multiple VaR constraints in controlling CVaR. Under certain conditions, we theoretically show that they are more effective than a single VaR constraint. Furthermore, we numerically find that the maximum CVaR permitted by the constraints is notably smaller than with a single constraint. These results suggest that regulations and risk management systems based on multiple VaR constraints are more effective in reducing tail risk than those based on a single VaR constraint.

As policy makers and academics have increasingly appreciated the importance of innovation, they have sought to improve how they understand and measure it. This has proven to be a deceptively difficult task, as innovations are by definition, novel. As a result, innovations do not all necessarily share a common set of features (Smith, 2006). This fundamental feature of innovation complicates analysis and measurement. A key theoretical advance in addressing innovation was developed by Nelson and Winter (1982), who saw innovation as something that largely occurs within heterogeneous firms. These firms perceive the world differently, have different routines, make different strategic choices, and act accordingly. A large body of research, often in business and management studies, has developed these ideas further, to explore the heterogeneity of firms as knowledge-based organizations, with diverse capabilities, that perceive and act in the world in diverse ways that generate a range of path-dependent outcomes. Increased interest in firms as the knowledge-based organizations that drive innovation has led to more extensive efforts to collect data on firm-based innovative activities, as governments have sought to improve their innovation policies.","[Nightingale, Paul] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Fagerberg, Jan] Univ Oslo, Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Mowery, David C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business 1930, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Sussex; University of Oslo; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Nightingale, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Sussex House, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",jan.fagerberg@tik.uio.no; mowery@haas.berkeley.edu; P.Nightingale@sussex.ac.uk,,"Nightingale, Paul/0000-0002-4155-0880","ESRC [ES/H008705/1, ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J008427/1, ES/H008705/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,9,14,16,3,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

It explores the advantages and disadvantages of local and non-local search, discusses organizational responses, and identifies potential exogenous triggers for different kinds of search. It argues that the initial focus on local search was a consequence, in part, of the attention in evolutionary economics to path-dependent behavior, but that as localized behavior was increasingly accepted as the standard mode, studies began to question whether local search was the best solution in all cases. More recently, the literature has focused on the trade-offs being created, by firms having to balance local and non-local search. We account also for the apparent variety paradox in the stylized fact that organizations within the same industry tend to follow different search strategies, but end up with very similar technological profiles in fast-growing technologies. The article concludes by highlighting what we have learnt from the literature and suggesting some new avenues for research.","[Laursen, Keld] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, DRUID, DK-2000 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Laursen, Keld] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Strategy & Management, Ctr Serv Innovat, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Copenhagen Business School; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Laursen, K (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, DRUID, Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Copenhagen, Denmark.",kl.ino@cbs.dk,"Laursen, Keld/A-3441-2009","Laursen, Keld/0000-0002-2763-3989",,,,,166,185,206,2,144,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We prove that China's efforts to upgrade its industries generate a negative employment shock on mid-aged peasant workers, forcing some of them to return to their home villages. The current lump-sum land acquisition system, however, will neither help peasant workers deal with the adverse employment shock nor promote land centralization for industrial and urban uses. On the contrary, land cooperation, an emerging land centralization system, will help peasant workers mitigate the adverse employment shock and centralize rural land for nonagricultural purposes.

This paper considers the impact of gasoline prices on subjective well-being, as captured by survey questions on happiness and life satisfaction. Using rich data from the DDB Worldwide Communications Life Style (TM) survey, we document a negative relationship between gasoline prices and self-reported life satisfaction over the period 1985-2005. The estimated reduction in well-being, moreover, is found to be nearly twice as large among groups of likely car owners. Interestingly, although rising gasoline prices lead to an immediate deterioration in subjective well-being, analyses of lagged prices suggest that well-being almost fully rebounds 1 year later and changes very little each year thereafter. Our contemporaneous estimates imply that rising gasoline prices generate well-being losses comparable to faltering labor market conditions, and likely offset some of the physical health benefits found in previous research.

Nationally, the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller house price index more than doubled in nominal terms during the boom and has fallen by roughly a third subsequently. During the boom, housing prices tended to rise much faster in metropolitan areas in the East and West Coast regions than in the country's interior. After adjusting for inflation, 7 of 19 metropolitan areas have experienced real declines in housing prices from the start of the boom to the present. Although lower-priced houses showed a larger percentage increase during the boom, higher-priced houses fared relatively better over the boom and bust. Changes in land prices, which are not easily measured, appear to have driven housing prices to a greater extent than changes in the prices of housing structures. Internationally, seven countries experienced housing booms and busts; however, these countries tended to have larger booms and smaller absolute busts than the United States.","[Cohen, Jeffrey P.] Univ Hartford, Hartford, CT 06117 USA; [Coughlin, Cletus C.; Lopez, David A.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",University of Hartford; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Cohen, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Hartford, Hartford, CT 06117 USA.",,"Coughlin, Cletus/K-6860-2016","Coughlin, Cletus/0000-0002-8304-2796; Cohen, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5467-7584",,,,,32,19,26,0,18,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

In response, we designed a methodology that uses the concepts of accessibility and affordability as a complementary means for evaluating public transport investment, and identifying transport disadvantages and priorities for project generation. This is based on the calculation of accessibility levels to the labour market for different zones of a given city, by introducing a function of impedance composed by travel time budget and the percentage of income spent on transportation. The characteristics of time and percentage of income spent for accessing work obtained from transportation surveys define the real accessibility to employment for all the zones of a city. Then, a stated preference survey was applied in order to determine the desired expenditure in both variables, and the accessibility to jobs in this new situation was subsequently calculated. We calculated a third type of accessibility, using standard values of travel time and expenditure budget. This methodology is therefore used to evaluate different policies in Bogota, corresponding to changes in the fare structure of the existing public transport system, by proposing the development of cross subsidies, and carrying out an appraised on the impact of the development of a new Bus Rapid Transit line. The results show that depending on the population, its location and purchasing power, the impact of a redistributive fare with respect to accessibility to the labour market can be greater than the expansion and improvement of the public transport network.

We use the theory of conservation implicit in the Hotelling model of non-renewable resource pricing to analyze the problem, distinguishing between the benefits to countries where conservation takes place, and to other countries. We estimate models for three taxonomic groups, and find that while individual countries value conservation within their borders, in poor countries this effect is dominated by the negative impact of income growth. International concessional financial contributions to conservation in poor countries are found to be statistically insignificant. We conclude that countries care about the biodiversity within their national borders, but only when development priorities permit, and only when it becomes scarce enough that its value grows more rapidly than the return on alternative assets. There is little evidence that high income countries yet care sufficiently about biodiversity in the places where it is most threatened to affect conservation outcomes there.","[Perrings, Charles] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Halkos, George] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Volos 38333, Greece",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Thessaly,"Perrings, C (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, POB 874501, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Charles.Perrings@asu.edu; halkos@uth.gr,"HALKOS, GEORGE/AAE-4772-2020","HALKOS, GEORGE/0000-0002-2772-5306",,,,,59,20,21,2,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

However, the linear correlation is unable to capture the dependence structure among financial data. Moreover, given the reality of fat-tail or skewed distribution of financial data, normality assumption for risk measure may be misleading in portfolio development. This paper proposes the use of conditional extreme value theory and time-varying copula to capture the tail dependence between the Australian financial market and other selected international stock markets. Conditional extreme value theory enables the model adequacy and the tail behavior of individual financial variable, while the time-varying copula can fully disclose the changes of dependence structure over time. The combination of both proved to be useful in determining the tail dependence. The empirical results show an outperformance of the model in the analysis of tail dependence, which has an important implication in cross-market diversification and asset pricing allocation.

However, when we estimate conditional idiosyncratic volatility either by EGARCH or AR Models, the relationship turns positive. Introducing unexpected idiosyncratic volatility as an explanatory variable to control for any unexpected returns uncovers the true relationship between expected idiosyncratic volatility and expected returns. The evidence turns out to be robust for return reversals and other control variables. Moreover, the pricing of idiosyncratic risk is less evident in higher country governance and seems to be unrelated to the degree of financial development. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The indicators show that pension funds' strategic portfolio choices are often based on coarse and less sophisticated approaches. First, most pension funds round strategic asset allocations to the nearest multiple of 5%, similar to age heaping in demographic and historical studies. Second, many pension funds invest little or nothing in alternative, more complex asset classes, resulting in limited asset diversification. Third, many pension funds favor regional investments and as such do not fully employ the opportunities of international risk diversification. Our indicators are correlated with pension fund size, in line with the expectation that smaller pension funds are generally less sophisticated than large pension funds. Using the indicators for investor sophistication, we show that less sophisticated pension funds tend to opt for investment strategies with less risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Individual depositors have private information about their personal consumption types and receive noisy private signals about the quality of the bank's portfolio. Depositors make publicly observable withdrawal decisions in sequence. Computed examples indicate that the optimal contract contingent on withdrawal histories can tolerate bank runs. These runs are triggered by unfavorable signals about a bank's portfolio, and early liquidation of unsuccessful investments can avoid future losses. Because the signals are private, a depositor's action is the only way to partially reveal his private information. A run-admitting bank contract allows information to be revealed. However, if signals are too noisy, bank runs may occur too often when fundamentals are strong. In this case, a bank would offer a run-proof contract. Given the relevant role of information, a policy that makes private information public would be useful to improve welfare and eliminate bank runs.

Futures contracts have been the most commonly used tool to this end. Meanwhile, the coincidence of sharp price movements in commodity markets with the increased interest of financial agents in commodity futures markets has led to a perception of speculation as a factor that causes price increases through various channels. This study aims at introducing the theories that attempt to analyze the crude oil yield curve as well as offering discussions on these theories' implications, in light of data and a statistical tool. Findings of this study reveal that the crude oil yield curve is considerably sensitive to inventories whereas there is no systematic relationship between the yield curve and the positions of speculative investors. Therefore, we believe that it would be more appropriate to relate the recent price increases to developments related to real sector, and to consider the conditions specific to commodity futures markets while using futures contracts for price forecasts.","[Tuncel, Cem Okan] Uludag Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Iktisat Bolumu, Bursa, Turkey",Uludag University,"Kalafatcilar, MK (通讯作者)，TCMB, Idare Merkezi Arastirma & Politikasoi Genel Mudur, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",Koray.Kalafatcilar@tcmb.gov.tr; Ahmet.Degerli@tcmb.gov.tr; cotuncel@uludag.edu.tr,,,,,,,17,0,0,4,10,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

As a test vehicle we use the well-known endowment effect. Even though our goods are entirely virtual, our results confirm earlier results that individuals with more trading experience are less likely to exhibit status quo behaviour in trade. However, we also find evidence that highly experienced individuals are more likely to swap the item rather than keep it - i.e. there appears to be a propensity to 'truck, barter and exchange'. A further experiment suggests that this feature is robust and is unlikely to be due to subject misperception or experimenter demand effects. However we are unable to eliminate selection effects as the source of our correlation between experience and propensity to trade.

Since 1950s, indicators are being developed to evaluate accessibility and safety of different types of road users like non-motorized transport (NMT) and public transport (PT) users. However, the application of the indicators is still limited to evaluate the impacts on one type of road user only. The paper proposes indicators to evaluate the impact of a transport project on all types of road users and on the society as a whole. Both conventional and proposed indicators are applied to evaluate the Delhi-BRT corridor stretch of 5.8 km. The conventional approach showed reduced personal vehicular speed and delays at junctions. Whereas, the proposed indicators of accessibility measured number of relevant destinations that are within reach of different types of road users which were not within the reach before and the number and type of road users for whom the accessibility has increased. The safety indicators evaluated the change in interaction between different road users and safety of different types of road users. The indicators also evaluated the change in competitive position of different modes that may result in causing modal shift. The proposed indicators are suggested to be used along with the traditional indicators for complete evaluation of transport projects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this article is to investigate preference heterogeneity for agri-environmental contracts among farmers in order to discuss potential policy improvements utilising heterogeneity. We used a choice experiment to elicit farmers' stated preferences for afforestation contracts. Four attributes are investigated: purpose of afforestation, option of cancelling the contract, monitoring, and compensation level. All attributes present a potential conflict between farmers' and authorities' interests, which emphasises the importance of knowing how to handle these interests. A random parameter logit model shows that having the option to cancel the contract decreases farmers' required compensation level and monitoring increases it. Furthermore, farmers are willing to accept a lower compensation when the aim is to protect biodiversity and ground water relative to recreation. Latent class models with class probability variables reveal discrete heterogeneity and support a division into four groups with divergent preferences. For example, a group of farmers who already have forest areas does not find the option of cancelling the contract important, whereas another group relying on the farm for income requires higher compensation. The findings indicate potential for efficiency gains from targeting the contracts.","Univ Copenhagen, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Vedel, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",sve@life.ku.dk,"Vedel, Suzanne Elizabeth/HJI-0637-2023","Vedel, Suzanne Elizabeth/0000-0001-6001-6846",,,,,57,121,135,3,88,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

During 2001-2005, approximately 30 million debit accounts were involuntarily closed for excessive over-drafting. We focus on multiple factors to explain this phenomenon: household economics and financial decision-making ability, social capital, bank policies, and the alternative financial services sector. Involuntary closures are more frequent in US counties with a larger fraction of single mothers, lower education levels, lower wealth, and higher unemployment. Closures are higher in communities with high property crime rates and low electoral participation. Bank policies have an independent relation to closures, with counties having more competitive banking markets and more multi-market banks experiencing higher closure rates; bank structure also seems to affect the speed at which banks adjust their policies to changes in household income. Finally, using both national data and a state-level shift in regulation, we find evidence that access to payday lending leads to higher rates of involuntary account closure. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

Experience as a result of having previously worked in a firm in the same industry before starting a business was related to productivity, but there is no relation with profitability. There is a link between performance and inclusion of other CEO-owners in the founder's inner circle of advisors.

Next, we conduct the first empirical analysis of life settlement fund return distributions as well as a performance measurement, including a comparison to other asset classes. Since the funds contained in our data set cover a large fraction of this relatively young segment of the capital markets, representative conclusions can be derived. Even though the empirical results suggest that life settlement funds offer attractive returns paired with low volatility and are virtually uncorrelated with other asset classes, we find latent risk factors such as liquidity, longevity, and valuation risks. Since these risks did generally not materialize in the past and are hence largely not reflected by the historical data, they cannot be captured by classical performance measures.

J,"Power, A",,,,"Power, Anne",,,"Social inequality, disadvantaged neighbourhoods and transport deprivation: an assessment of the historical influence of housing policies",JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transport; Urban neighbourhoods; Disadvantage; Environment; Connections,,"This paper argues that the drive to build housing and to clear crowded slums has led to the dispersal of population. The building of large subsidised housing estates as replacement housing for former slums has compounded social problems by concentrating low income households in cut-off communities. Low income households in poorer neighbourhoods have far lower levels of car ownership than average and yet suffer higher levels of traffic and environmental damage because the dispersal process encourages the growth of car traffic and the polarisation of neighbourhoods. Based on evidence from longitudinal studies of families bringing up children in low income neighbourhoods, and of unpopular housing estates in Britain and Europe, the author argues that social, economic, locational, and environmental problems interact in disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods with negative consequences for families and other vulnerable households. Current patterns of dispersal and low density building encourage the segregation of communities and at the extreme, the creation of 'ghettos' as the US demonstrates. Yet the built environment evolves only slowly, and urban communities are locked into patterns of settlements, energy use and inequality that are hard to change. More collective transport modes would reduce environmental damage while enhancing social integration. It is costly to introduce new transport infrastructure but essential if we are to equalise conditions and opportunities. There are alternatives to the prevailing pattern of outer suburban building and population dispersal: more compact, more mixed-use city neighbourhoods. Denser, more people-friendly, less traffic-dominated neighbourhoods would be more integrated and offer more opportunity. Their energy requirements and environmental impact would be lower, and low income families would not suffer such unequal conditions and their consequences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The technique effect caused by changes in input mix, sector energy intensity, fuel mix and carbon coefficients effectively offset part of the scale effect during the entire period but failed to do so during some sub-periods.

We define a community's market niche by the ties linking a community to the industries on which it depends for growth. We then hypothesize that the extent to which a community's market niche is occupied by other communities is a source of constraint and opportunity depending on the geographical locations of the communities that occupy the same market niche. Geographically distant communities occupying similar market niches are hypothesized to experience primarily constraint arising from competition for opportunities of exchange. Geographically proximate communities occupying similar market niches are hypothesized to face constraint arising from competition for exchange opportunities, as well as opportunity arising from access to valuable resources associated with the existence of similar others. Empirical analyses of firm foundings and exits across US communities support these hypotheses.

We employ mixed data sampling (MIDAS) to estimate a portfolio's conditional beta with the market and with alternative risk factors and innovations to well-known macroeconomic variables. The market risk premium is positive and significant, and the result is robust to alternative asset pricing specifications and model misspecification. However, the traditional 2-pass ordinary least squares (OLS) cross-sectional regressions produce an estimate of the market risk premium that is negative, and significantly different from 0. Using alternative procedures, we compare both beta estimators.

While the relative prices of a number of nontradable service items such as housing consistently rise, the relative prices of several durable items such as furniture tend to fall in response to the remittance shock. Furthermore, remittances explain substantial variation in prices for a large number of consumer durables and services at various time horizons.

Analyzing life histories of 1891 organizations that experience protracted mortality processes, we find support for our arguments. Reducing engagement increases the mortality hazard for venture capital firms by reducing the firm's appeal to co-investors, but gradual reductions attenuate the effects of reduced engagement on both mortality and appeal.

Overall, the results support the hypothesis that interjurisdictional differences are determinants of vertical inequity.","Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Ross, JM (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,"Ross, Justin/AAJ-5926-2020","Ross, Justin/0000-0001-6875-3234",,,,,31,9,14,0,12,UNIV WISCONSIN,MADISON,"SOCIAL SCIENCE BLDG, MADISON, WI 53706 USA",0023-7639,,,LAND ECON,Land Econ.,FEB,2012,88.0,1,,,,,28,42,,10.3368/le.88.1.28,0.0,,,15,Economics; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,881DE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299459900003,0

Male wage inequality is high in Turkey. While it declined at the lower end of the wage distribution it increased at the top end of wage distribution. Education contributed to higher wage inequality through both within and between dimensions. The within-groups inequality increased and between-groups inequality decreased over the study period. The latter factor may have dominated the former contributing to the observed decline in the male wage inequality over the 19942002. Further results are provided for the wage effects of experience, public sector employment, geographic location, firm size, industry of employment and their contribution to wage inequality. Recent increases in foreign direct investiment inflows, openness to trade and global technological developments are discussed as contributing factors to the recent rising within-groups wage inequality.","[Bodur, Fatma Bircan] Karaelmas Univ, TR-6700 Zonguldak, Turkey; [Tansel, Aysit] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey",Bulent Ecevit University; Middle East Technical University,"Bodur, FB (通讯作者)，Karaelmas Univ, TR-6700 Zonguldak, Turkey.",atansel@metu.edu.tr; Bircanf@gmail.com,"TANSEL, Aysit/H-8096-2012; Bodur, Fatma Bircan/AAD-3146-2021","TANSEL, Aysit/0000-0001-9556-2396;",,,,,51,36,41,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

First, I examine whether a string of relatively high (low) stock return performance that is measured over short periods ranging from the past two to four months triggers a market overreaction that gradually reverts to fundamentals. Second, I assess whether these two mispricing patterns, i.e., the momentum and reversal effects, are empirically linked. Results reported in this paper show that a zero-investment strategy that is long on consistent winners and short on consistent losers earns substantial average monthly abnormal returns that continue to be economically and statistically significant over the next twelve months. Subsequently, however, the return for the zero-investment portfolio in Years 2 to 5 is negative, resulting in a reversal of the bulk of the initial momentum profit. This evidence suggests that the return momentum and the price reversal anomalies are likely to be driven by the same investor psychology. This finding remains robust to the four-factor regression (the Fama-French three-factor model extended by the momentum factor) and various sensitivity tests. My evidence is consistent with the spirit of the psychology-based models. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the simulation experiments, the transition from individual to uniform per-hectare rates at the country level was explicitly modelled. The results show significant income shifts only for single products, such as durum wheat. Moreover, income was redistributed away from traditional Grandes Cultures crop production to fodder production, an effect primarily caused by the capitalisation of decoupled premiums on previously unsubsidised land.

Design/methodology/approach-The most effective knowledge management in Higher Education allows access to information from different documents and databases, and also allows it to be continually improved, through students' application of the skills and knowledge learned in universities. Explicit knowledge management is objective and relational knowledge that can be expressed through a formal and systematic language with words, numbers, formulas, etc. The authors elaborate on the educational, managerial and quantity aspects of knowledge management in a university setting. Findings-The organizational knowledge management model, driven by pre-specified plans and goals, aimed to ensure optimization and efficiencies is based primarily on building consensus, convergence and compliance. Practical implications The quality of knowledge can be estimated by its ability to assure a progress for the knowledge management. Also the knowledge will produce solutions faster and more effectively in universities. The authors encourage knowledge claims, having a degree of utility, as well as a degree of satisfaction. Originality/value-This paper draws on our experience in implementing knowledge management in Higher Education, in order to support scientists to discuss their best practices.

This trend has led to increased popularity of Corporate Sustainability Reporting - a tool regarded by many as means for companies to create additional value by implementing such aspects as social and environmental performance. This study examines social and environmental accounting disclosures in the annual reports of companies listed at Tallinn Stock Exchange in order to determine the current trend in CSR reporting. The survey was conducted among 15 companies representing various industry sectors. Authors have analyzed English web-published annual reports for years 2007-2010. In the course of the survey the authors have discovered that during the research period many companies included separate sections in their annual reports covering corporate sustainability reporting, but this information was also included in the Letter from Member of the Management Board, Brief Introduction of the Company or in any other section. The study demonstrated continuous uptrend in the number of social and environmental accounting disclosures, and a fairly low number of issued standalone CSR reports. In authors' opinion, this demonstrates that Estonian companies show strong intention to integrate sustainability reporting into their annual reports. These findings emphasize the fact, that sustainability reporting is not a stranger in the night for Estonian companies but a friend, one would like to spend more time with. It also seems obvious that more efforts should be made in Estonia to provide all possible support to companies with regards to sustainability reporting. This support may include: distribution of latest CSR publications, participation in worldwide conferences and seminars on the CSR, training and guidance in preparing social and environmental reports in accordance with modern corporate accountability standards.

According to Shefrin and Statman [1993], framing and risk aversion can help justify its attractiveness to investors. Applying prospect theory and hedonic framing, these authors predict that in a world of frame dependence an investor that is sufficiently risk averse in the domain of gains will prefer a covered call position over a stock only position and that certain covered call designs will be preferred despite identical cash flows. To date, the relationship among framing, risk aversion, and covered call writing has not been empirically tested. We gather empirical evidence to complete this gap in the literature. We find highly significant empirical evidence for a pronounced framing effect with respect to different covered call designs with equal net cash flows as well as covered calls in general. We find only scarce empirical evidence for a relationship between risk aversion in the domain of gains and a preference for covered calls. In order to observe a positive relationship between risk aversion and covered call writing, investors with above average risk aversion seem to be required.","[Hoffmann, Arvid O.

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the discussion on the role and use of global private partnerships in coping with sustainability as a wicked problem. For this purpose we have constructed and used a theoretical framework on complex decision-making processes with a grounded theory that explains diversity of private governance networks in terms of rivalry and exclusion. Focusing on five partnerships that promote sustainable production of soy in Brazil, the paper concludes that their development is highly interdependent and dialectical. One of the five partnerships is the Round Table on Responsible Soy. Both the start and development of this global private partnership have not ended but fuelled rivalry between different partnerships, herewith reproducing the wickedness of governance of sustainable production of soy. Managing sustainability as a wicked problem requires an understanding of the dialectical development of partnerships. Instead of embracing one partnership as the best or the benchmark, it may be wiser for policymakers to invest in managing interactions and articulating relationships between different partnerships at the global and national level.","[Hospes, Otto] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [van der Valk, Olga] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, LEI, NL-2502 LS The Hague, Netherlands; [van der Mheen-Sluijer, Jennie] Wageningen Int, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Hospes, O (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",Otto.Hospes@wur.nl,,"van der Valk, Olga M.C./0000-0001-5457-2117",,,,,32,14,14,0,16,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

In federal securities regulation, the EMH has offered a theoretical construct to accompany the general belief in the value of accurate and complete information that has animated the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since its creation. Specific applications of the EMH have been straightforward and predictable: For instance, its tenets as to market processing of public information helped motivate the streamlining of procedural requirements as to corporate disclosures and, more controversially, as to private securities class action lawsuits. In state corporate law, the EMH has influenced developments as to takeovers and the corporate objective. In contrast, the EMH and related learning have failed to sufficiently inform governmental actions to address financial illiteracy. Belief in the EMH and the value of efficient markets has weakened in the face of recent market anomalies and stress. The May 2010 flash crash is not easily reconciled with the EMH, and related phenomena such as high frequency trading involve an equity market microstructure far different from the microstructure at the time the EMH emerged. Actions motivated by the global financial crisis (GFC), such as the SEC short-selling ban in September 2008, arguably suggest a greater willingness to subordinate market efficiency in favor of other governmental goals. A range of important EMH-related issues loom beyond those associated with financial illiteracy, the equity market microstructure, and governmental goals. Foremost are those relating to the informational predicate on which market efficiency rests. One key aspect of the informational predicate relates to the disclosure challenges associated with financial innovations (such as asset-backed securities) and business entities heavily involved in financial innovation activities (such as certain money center banks). The intermediary depiction model that the SEC has always used is inadequate in financial innovation-related contexts. Another key aspect relates to the massive amounts of information that the Dodd-Frank Act requires to be provided to governmental bodies.","Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, Austin, TX 78705 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Hu, HTC (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, Austin, TX 78705 USA.",hhu@law.utexas.edu,,,,,,,154,11,11,0,46,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4804-5,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

In the end, several recommendations are made for small and medium-sized companies to achieve a healthy and sustainable development.","[Jin Xin; Zhang Keyi] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,,,"zhang, xiang/JJD-7003-2023",,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5611-7073-1,,,,2012,,,,,,,474,478,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEW73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318443600029,0

This directive is primarily aiming at water protection and may have advantages for the water regime in sensitive areas. Nevertheless, it may also involve economic disadvantages for agricultural enterprises. In this paper we analyze the economic implications of the WFD for farmers using irrigation, i.e., the negative economic consequences for farms resulting from a reduction of water withdrawal permits in the north-east of Lower Saxony. In a whole farm risk programming approach we show how much benefit farmers loose if the amount of water withdrawal permits is reduced. To avoid solutions that would possibly exceed the farmers' risk tolerance, the apparently accepted standard deviation of the program's total gross margin is used as an upper bound in the optimization. This should represent an observable reflection of the individual risk attitude of the farmers. The results demonstrate that deterministic approaches do not consider all economic impacts caused by the reduction of water withdrawal permits as well as that risk has to be considered.","[Kellner, Ulla; Musshoff, Oliver; Battermann, Henning W.] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Musshoff, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fak Agr Wissensch, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Arbeitsbereich Landwirtschaftl Betriebslehre, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,32,6,6,0,7,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

This study applies a stochastic frontier production function approach to measure farm-specific technical inefficiency using the 2011 farm-level cross-sectional survey data of Thai durian farms in a single estimation technique applying the maximum likelihood estimation method. The non-negative technical inefficiency effects are modelled as a function of farm-specific socio-economic, organic production practice and other production management factors. The empirical results suggest two important findings. First, there is confirmation that producer's education, the application of organic farm system and soil improvement practices influenced the technical inefficiency of durian farms. Second, the considerable variability of fertiliser types does not have different impacts on technical inefficiency in Thai durian production in different farms. The results indicate advantages in increasing years of schooling and using organic farm practices in Thai durian farms. Therefore, the policies on encouraging farmers to increase continuing education and suggesting the farmers to use organic production practices in Thai durian farms are recommended to increase technical efficiency in durian production in Thailand.

The main hypothesis of this paper states that contrarian investors are more prone to the disposition effect than are momentum traders. The model proposed by Dacey and Zielonka [2008] plays a crucial role in formulating this hypothesis.

However, like clubs elsewhere in Europe, French clubs are currently facing some hurdles. The expenditure levels of some of these clubs are considered excessive. What is more, results on the field are not always forthcoming, especially at the pan-European level. We may thus wonder whether resources devoted to football in France are used efficiently. This is the issue we address in this paper, where we study the efficiency of French football clubs in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 over a period spanning the 2002-03 and 2007-08 seasons. To accomplish this, we use a DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) model and measure the technical efficiency and scale efficiency of French professional clubs. Our results reveal that, overall, French clubs are inefficient, using more resources than necessary to attain their objectives. Moreover, clubs in Ligue 1 are less efficient than those in Ligue 2, and efficiency has declined over time in both leagues. Finally, we observe that inefficiency seems to be more associated with managerial problems than with the size of the clubs.","[Miningou, Elise Wendlassida; Vierstraete, Valerie] Univ Sherbrooke, GREDI, Dept Econ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",University of Sherbrooke,"Vierstraete, V (通讯作者)，Univ Sherbrooke, GREDI, Dept Econ, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",Valerie.Vierstraete@USherbrooke.ca,,,,,,,42,5,5,1,35,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

However, for the farmer to switch from the flock breeding system to the small-camp system, an investment in fencing material is required. The main aim of this study is to find out if the higher expected productivity and resulting higher income due to genetic selection could compensate for the investment in fencing material. Typical farm models for the study area were developed for this purpose.

It documents that a country's equity market value has significant out-of-sample predictive ability for the future global commodity price index for several primary commodity-exporting countries. The out-of-sample predictive ability of the equity market appears around 2000s. The results are robust to using several control variables as well as firm-level equity data. Finally, the results indicate that exchange rates are a better predictor of commodity prices than equity markets, especially at very short horizons.

The results show that in the short-run, the Granger causality runs from income to energy consumption for Iran, Iraq, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia while for the rest of the OPEC countries the reverse is true, i.e. the Granger causality runs from energy consumption to income. However, in the long run there is not any Granger causality relationship for all the OPEC countries. In the case of Qatar and the Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, energy, economic growth and prices aren't mutually causal. Results show, that even for these countries which the energy consumption has an effect on economic growth, the effect is very minimal. The direction of causation between energy consumption and economic growth has significant policy implications. If there exists unidirectional Granger causality running from income to energy, it may be implied that energy conservation policies may be implemented with little adverse or no effects on economic growth.

The paper is focused on the relation between the effectiveness of internal controls and risk fraud, involving either misappropriation of financial assets or fraudulent reporting. We based our research on the assumption that an increase of internal controls effectiveness results in diminishing risk fraud involving financial assets. We attend to identify significant weak points in the chain of internal controls related to financial assets, capable to increase risk fraud and implicitly to alter the reliability on financial reporting process.

We document that post-bailout changes in sovereign CDS explain changes in bank CDS even after controlling for aggregate and bank-level determinants of credit spreads, confirming the sovereign-bank loop.","[Acharya, Viral; Drechsler, Itamar; Schnabl, Philipp] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Acharya, Viral; Drechsler, Itamar; Schnabl, Philipp] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Acharya, V (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,"Acharya, Viral V./HCH-4349-2022",,,,,,47,390,433,15,183,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Our results demonstrate that a subsidiary's reduction in lending is strongly related to its parent bank's lending via the interbank market. While subsidiaries that were dependent on interbank financing increased their credit supply prior to the crisis, they reduced their lending activities during the crisis. Additionally, we observe that interbank-dependent subsidiaries tried to change their funding strategy when they were unable to increase their deposit growth significantly during the crisis. During the crisis, subsidiaries could not rely on their parent banks' support via the interbank market and encountered problems in attracting new depositors, which could explain the significant decline in lending during the financial crisis. These findings highlight the need to regulate and monitor multinational funding strategies, especially in the interbank market. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Under public production, public goods are produced by the government. Under public finance, the same amount of public goods is produced by cost-minimizing private providers With the government financing their costs. When the Model is solved numerically using fiscal data from the UK, a switch from public production to public finance has substantial aggregate and distributional implications. Public providers cannot beat private providers, in terms of productive efficiency, even if they both act as cost minimizers. The following mix of reforms is found to be Pareto improving: (i) a transition to cost-minimizing private providers that allows the government to achieve efficiency savings, (ii) a reduction in distorting income taxes made affordable by these efficiency savings, and (iii) a mechanism to compensate the ex public employees. All these results hold if private producers use a more capital intensive production technology than public producers, or, even in the case in which they use the same technology, if capital is a relatively important productive factor quantitatively.

We document the widespread promotion and adoption of these reforms, and conclude that decentralization made it difficult to insulate service provision in practice.

Thus, under-researched process innovation strategies are analyzed, and their antecedents and innovative performance implications explored. The results show that process innovation strategy is mainly shaped by the acquisition of embodied knowledge, which acts as a key mechanism for countering firms' weak internal capabilities. As process innovation is mainly production oriented, performance consequences are measured using the production process indicators of cost reduction, flexibility and capacity improvement, avoiding traditional misguided measures based on sales, which are more product oriented. Drawing on information for 2,412 firms taken from Spanish CIS data, our results suggest that R&D efforts are not positively related to production process performance, but that the latter is improved by the synchronous co-adoption of organizational and technological innovation. SMEs conducting a process innovation strategy rely heavily on the acquisition of external sources of knowledge in order to complement their weak internal innovative capabilities, and their pattern of innovation shows clear-cut differences from traditional R&D-based product innovation strategies. The article uses a resource-based view framework to generate hypotheses.","[Hervas-Oliver, Jose-Luis; Sempere-Ripoll, Francisca; Boronat-Moll, Carles] Univ Politecn Valencia, Management Dept DOE, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Hervas-Oliver, Jose-Luis] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Hervas-Oliver, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Management Dept DOE, Campus Vera S-N 7D, Valencia 46022, Spain.",Jose.hervas@omp.upv.es,"Boronat-Moll, Carles/E-3271-2018; HERVAS, JOSE/ABA-7256-2021; Sempere-Ripoll, Francisca F/R-8188-2018; Boronat-Moll, Carles/GLS-3560-2022; HERVAS-OLIVER, JOSE LUIS/R-6200-2018","Boronat-Moll, Carles/0000-0003-4714-9200; HERVAS-OLIVER, JOSE LUIS/0000-0001-6438-5497",,,,,82,123,142,4,145,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In the model, default has an option value derived from the randomization over ex-post default regimes, which depends on country-specific productivity shocks. This feature of default reduces incentives for ex-ante diversification, which would reduce exposure to the productivity shock. As a result, if the economys debt to capital ratio is allowed to cross a fixed threshold (identified in the model), the unique equilibrium exhibits an allocation of capital that is less productive in expectation and more volatile than in a benchmark model without default. The model therefore captures a number of salient features of emerging and less developed countries, where low levels of international risk-sharing have gone hand-in-hand with frequent and recurring default events.

We find that it is typically more efficient to levy an ad valorem tax downstream than upstream, while it is immaterial on which layer a specific tax is levied. We also show that tax revenues should be raised only through ad valorem taxes. Furthermore, we provide conditions under which the introduction of an indirect tax improves welfare. From a total surplus perspective, excise taxes tend to appear in a less favorable light when the full vertical supply chain is considered compared to a partial analysis which only takes into account market power at one layer.

Collected by smart card systems, smart card data surpass traditional travel survey data in providing more comprehensive spatial-temporal information about urban public transport-based (UPT) trips. However, the utility of smart card data has arguably yet to be exploited fully in terms of extracting and exploring the spatial-temporal dynamics of UPT passenger travel behaviour. To advance previous work in this area, this paper demonstrates a multi-step methodology in order to render more insightful spatial-temporal patterns of UPT passenger travel behaviour. Drawing on the Brisbane, Australia, bus network as the case study, a smart card dataset was first processed in combination with General Transit Specification Feed (GTFS) data to reconstruct travel trajectories of bus passengers at bus stop level of spatial granularity. By applying geographical information system-based (GIS) techniques, this dataset was used to create flow-comaps to visualise the aggregate flow patterns at a network level. The flow-comaps uncovered the major pathways of bus passengers and its variations over a one-day period. The differences within the flow-comaps were also quantified to produce weighted flow-comaps that highlighted the major temporal changes of passenger flow patterns along a number of stop-to-stop linkages of the bus network. The proposed methodology visually unveiled the spatial-temporal travel behaviour dynamics of UPT passengers and, in doing so, showed the potential to contribute to a new evidence base with the capacity to inform local public transport policy.

We use a hedonic model to estimate the premium paid for new houses as well as the influence of new residential construction on the selling prices of existing houses considering the number and relative size of the newly constructed houses in the area. The results indicate even atypically large new houses command a premium. Construction of houses of average size relative to the reference group has little effect on existing house prices except to create some competition for houses that were achieving relatively high prices considering their attributes. Meanwhile, construction of a concentration of larger than average size houses exerts a small positive effect on existing house prices, especially for those houses that are selling for a relatively low price.

However, the share of green power to total energy tends to be low due to the low private cost, i.e., excluding the external cost, of fossil fuels and the high production cost of green power. To reduce the total emission of CO2, it is necessary to modify the energy structure and internalize the external cost by taxing the use of fossil fuels. This study finds: 1) the economy will benefit from the development and the increasing usage of bioenergy, rather than fossil fuels, in the long run; 2) a higher energy tax will reduce the use of fossil fuels, which will yield an uncertain effect on economic growth and social welfare in the long run; 3) a rise in income tax has ambiguous effect on economic growth and social welfare in the long run; and 4) the income tax maximizing social welfare is higher than that maximizing economic growth rate, and the energy tax maximizing social welfare is also higher than that maximizing economic growth rate.

I introduce environmental policy and factor endowment differentials into a multi-country general equilibrium model of bilateral trade with random productivities and trade barriers. I calibrate the model for the OECD countries by estimating trade barriers and productivity parameters so as to match bilateral manufacturing trade shares. The calibrated model is used to analyze impacts of free trade and two types of environmental harmonization policies. I find that full trade liberalizations help to lower OECD pollution emissions by 32%, and about half of the decline in pollution is due to international productivity differences. I also show that harmonization of environmental taxes across the OECD countries is predicted to be more effective than the harmonization of pollution quotas in reducing aggregate pollution while under both policies trade impacts are relatively small.

Using panel data techniques, we examine the role of a wide set of potential drivers. To our knowledge, this paper presents one of the most exhaustive compilations of the variables used in the literature to study the behaviour of sovereign yield spreads and, in particular, to gauge the effect on these spreads of changes in market sentiment and risk aversion. We use a sample of both central and peripheral countries from January 1999 to December 2012 and assess whether there were significant changes after the outbreak of the euro area debt crisis. Our results suggest that the rise in sovereign risk in central countries can only be partially explained by the evolution of local macroeconomic variables in those countries. Besides, without exception, the marginal effects of sovereign spread drivers (specifically, the variables that measure global market sentiment) increased during the crisis compared to the pre-crisis period, especially in peripheral countries. Moreover, the increase in the significance of the banking level of indebtedness and foreign bank's claims in the public sector (mainly in peripheral countries) along with the crisis unfolding seems to highlight the interconnection between private and public debt and thus, between banking and sovereign crises.

Results suggest that when both a target firm and a peer firm provide earnings guidance, contrast effects occur such that the more accurate the earnings guidance of the target firm relative to the peer, the greater are investors' credibility assessments for the target. However, such contrast effect diminishes as the target firm's earnings guidance becomes more accurate. On the contrary, when a peer provides earnings guidance but the target firm does not, assimilation effects as opposed to contrast effects dominate investors' credibility judgments.","[Maletta, Mario J.; Zhang, Yue] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Coll Business Adm, 404 Hayden Hall,360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",yuezhang@neu.edu,,,,,,,32,0,0,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

We use plausibly exogenous variation in the supply of public information to show that firms actively shape their information environments by voluntarily disclosing more information than regulations mandate and that such efforts improve liquidity. Firms respond to an exogenous loss of public information by providing more timely and informative earnings guidance. Responses appear motivated by a desire to reduce information asymmetries between retail and institutional investors. Liquidity improves as a result and in turn increases firm value.

We estimate an arbitrage-free term structure model that explicitly includes the quantity impact of the Fed's trades on Treasury market prices. As such, we are able to estimate both the magnitude and duration of the QE price effects. We show that the Fed's QE program affected forward rates without introducing arbitrage opportunities into the Treasury security markets. Short- to medium- term forward rates were reduced (12 years), but the QE had little if any impact on long-term forward rates. This is in contrast to the Fed's stated intentions for the QE program. The persistence of the rate impacts increased with maturity up to 6 years then declined, with half-lives lasting approximately 4, 6, 12, 8 and 4 months for the 1, 2, 5, 10 and 12 years forwards, respectively. Since bond yields are averages of forward rates over a bond's maturity, QE affected long-term bond yields. The average impacts on bond yields were 327, 26, 50, 70, and 76 basis points for 1, 2, 5, 10 and 30 years, respectively.","[Jarrow, Robert; Li, Hao] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Jarrow, Robert] Kamakura Corp, Honolulu, HI USA",Cornell University,"Jarrow, R (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",raj15@cornell.edu; hl624@cornell.edu,,,,,,,27,18,18,1,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Further, banks that were able to make consumer loans did so with less security because home prices fell so dramatically. This paper argues that at least part of that recovery story is purely anecdotal and, in fact, incorrect. In spite of the precipitous decline in home prices, the original price increases were so large that many homeowners still have/had adequate equity in their homes to borrow. The paper presents evidence that the average quarterly increase in aggregate home equity line of credit (HELOC) lending after housing prices began their decline is, statistically, no different than the average quarterly increase in HELOC lending before housing prices began their downward trend. The evidence also suggests that increased HELOC lending during the recession is not correlated with higher unemployment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

One focuses on increasing the amount and quality of local government capital spending.

Impact evaluations of the two grants suggest some reasonably positive outcomes against the stated objectives. While the assessed impacts may not match the expected outputs (as argued by many performance grant enthusiasts), these impacts provide a plausible basis for the sustained development and use of such grants.

Since Georgia used a voucher-like program and Oklahoma utilized its existing public schools, the two states offer a case study of how government provision compares to government subsidization alone. Using a synthetic control group difference-in-difference estimation framework, we examine the effects of universal preschool on childcare providers. In both states there is an increase in the number of formal childcare centers. With the voucher-like program in Georgia, the overall increase in care is partly driven by an increase in the supply of formal childcare in the private sector and partly driven by new publicly-provided preschools. However, there is substantial crowd-out of private consumption of preschool. In Oklahoma, where universal preschool is publicly provided, the increase in the number of childcare providers occurred only in the public sector. The expansion of publicly-provided care seems to be driven largely by movement of employees from private centers to public settings. As such, this case-study comparison suggests that government subsidization through funding was more effective at expanding preschool than government provision. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We find that before the holding period, winners experience higher DR news than losers, which makes winners display lower ex-ante expected returns than losers. Momentum returns come from the persistently higher CF news for winners as compared to losers both before and during the holding periods. The evidence favors a behavioral explanation that the market incorporates cash flow information too slowly, which drives momentum returns. In addition, we find that the DR news, in particular that of the momentum losers, drives the time-series profitability of momentum strategies. Furthermore, by comparing price momentum with earnings momentum, we show that the relative load on past CF news as compared to past DR news affects long-run portfolio performance.

Respondents, especially women, appear to be aware of some of the qualitative relationships between risk factors and probabilities. However, on average they have very poor perceptions of the absolute probability levels as reported in the epidemiological literature. Perceptions of the level of risk are less accurate if a respondent is female and has poor numeracy skills.

We find that work experience with finance reduces genetic predispositions to investment biases.

In the promotion process, policymakers typically treat these university spin-offs like industry start-ups. However, when university spin-offs involve an employment transition by a researcher from the not-for-profit sector, the creation of a university spin-off is likely to impose a higher social cost than the creation of an industry start-up. To offset this higher social cost, university spin-offs must produce a larger stream of social benefits than industry start-ups, a performance premium. This paper outlines the arguments explaining why the social costs of entrepreneurship are likely to be higher for academic entrepreneurs, and empirically investigates the existence of a performance premium using a sample of German start-up companies. We find that university spin-offs exhibit a performance premium of 3.4 % points higher employment growth over industry start-ups. The analysis also shows that the performance premium varies across types of academic entrepreneurs and founders' academic disciplines.","[Czarnitzki, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Czarnitzki, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr R&D Monitoring ECOOM, Leuven, Belgium; [Czarnitzki, Dirk; Rammer, Christian; Toole, Andrew A.] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Dept Ind Econ & Int Management, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Toole, Andrew A.] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Toole, AA (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave SW,Mail Stop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",dirk.czarnitzki@kuleuven.be; rammer@zew.de; atoole@ers.usda.gov,"Czarnitzki, Dirk/AAV-4124-2021; Rammer, Christian/ABA-8789-2021","Rammer, Christian/0000-0002-1173-9471",,,,,62,47,51,1,104,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Predictions from the model provide potential explanations for the differing results from recent empirical studies on the impact of regulatory interventions like SOX and the extent to which the CEO's or CFO's incentives significantly impact on earnings management. The model also identifies conditions under which either a powerful or a non-powerful CEO can extract rents, which can help explain mixed empirical results on the association between CEO power and excessive compensation.

Comparing innovativeness of established research spin-offs and otherwise created firms,SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Spin-offs; R&D; Innovation; Cooperation,RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PROPENSITY SCORE; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PERFORMANCE; NETWORKS; GROWTH; BIAS,"The literature argues that research spin-offs (RSOs)-enterprises originating from a university or research institute-appear to have higher innovative potential and capabilities than other start-ups, at least in the early stages of their development. Yet, little is known about the innovative performance of these companies at later development phases. Thus, the main goal of this study is to investigate whether there are any differences in research and development (R&D) and innovation behavior between established and/or mature RSOs and otherwise created firms and, if so, to what extent they are driven by networking and cooperation activities as suggested by some scholars. To this end, we employ probit regression analysis and a matching approach using survey data on more than 6,000 East German firms, among which are 179 RSOs. Our first findings suggest that established RSOs engage in R&D and innovation activities more frequently than companies whose genesis was of another type. Nevertheless, the results obtained when accounting for collaboration measures show that the precedence of RSOs in further development stages over otherwise created firms in terms of innovation outputs is related to their higher intensity of cooperation activity and close, face-to-face interactions with universities, and not to type of firm creation. Moreover, our findings reveal that cooperating in various fields may be of different importance for specific inputs and outputs of the innovation activity. Finally, based on our results, we draw some implications for both practicing managers and public policymakers.","BSP Business Sch Berlin Potsdam, D-12247 Berlin, Germany",,"Lejpras, A (通讯作者)，BSP Business Sch Berlin Potsdam, Calandrellistr 1-9, D-12247 Berlin, Germany.",anna.lejpras@businessschool-berlin-potsdam.de,,,,,,,59,20,23,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Hierarchical linear modeling shows that, while overall networking benefits innovation, innovation is decreased by private sphere networking and increased by networking in the public sphere, especially in the professions and internationally. A further refinement is to consider entrepreneurs' endeavors as embedded in society with its system of education for entrepreneurship. We hypothesize that the quality of a national system moderates the impacts of networks on innovation by adding value to networks.

Our findings are based on an original analysis of 235 DHS and MICS surveys spanning 64 developing countries over the 1990-2011 period. We track five health status indicators and seven intervention indicators from all four health MDGs. In approximately three-quarters of countries, the poorest 40 percent have made faster progress than the richest 60 percent on MDG intervention indicators. On average, relative inequality in these indicators has been falling. However, in terms of MDG outcome indicators, in nearly half of the countries, relative inequality has been growing. Moreover, in approximately one-quarter of the countries, the poorest 40 percent have been slipping backwards in absolute terms on both MDG interventions and outcomes. Despite reductions in most countries, relative inequalities in MDG health indicators are still appreciable, with the poor facing higher risks of malnutrition and death in childhood and lower odds of receiving key health interventions.","[Wagstaff, Adam] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Bredenkamp, Caryn] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Buisman, Leander R.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",The World Bank; The World Bank; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Wagstaff, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",awagstaff@worldbank.org,"Wagstaff, Adam/A-7667-2009; Buisman, Leander/E-2151-2013","Wagstaff, Adam/0000-0003-4442-5070; Buisman, Leander/0000-0001-6767-4614",,,,,23,37,38,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

However, contrary to trading volume and open interest, information related to day trading activities is rarely available. By incorporating unexplored day trading volume in the literature, this paper demonstrates that both the expected open interest and expected day trading volume are consistently and positively correlated with returns, but that one-lagged day trading volume is negatively correlated with futures returns. Meanwhile, both expected and unexpected day trading volume are negatively correlated with volatility, suggesting that arbitrage activities related to unexpected day trading volume may accelerate the movement of futures prices to a new equilibrium. Moreover, open interest provides liquidity but increases volatility. Finally, we strongly suggest that day trading transaction information be released by futures exchanges to achieve greater transparency.","[Chen, Ming-Hsien] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan; [Tai, Vivian W.] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Puli 545, Nantou, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Chi Nan University,"Chen, MH (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, 2 Jhuoyue Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",mhchen.bau@gmail.com; whtai@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,51,4,4,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Although such ideas had hardly any practical consequences in colonial India and Algeria, they did have important repercussions in Spain, where the irrigation institutions came to resemble the image they had been given by the reporters, with the best results.

To this end, I utilize a panel unit root approach which is able to account for multiple structural breaks and cross-section dependency. The unit root analysis for 24 international commodity prices during the period 1900-2003 shows evidence in favor of the trend stationary process in the commodity prices. The results thereby imply that shocks to commodity prices are temporary in nature and tend to be corrected over time. The estimation of the trend stationary models indicates that the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis is not a universal phenomenon. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We should expect instead that, under current rules, shareholder voting will implement the preferences of the majority of large shareholders and management. This is because majority rule offers little incentive for small shareholders to vote. I offer a potential remedy in the form of a new voting rule, the Idealized Electoral College (IEC), modeled on the American Electoral College, that significantly increases the expected impact that a given shareholder has on election. The benefit of the mechanism is that it induces greater turnout, but the cost is that it sometimes assigns a winner that is not preferred by a majority of voters. Therefore, for issues on which management and small shareholders are likely to disagree, the IEC is superior to majority rule. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such persistence is well documented and represents a challenge for policy makers. If the source of the persistent deviations is real then effective policy interventions are limited. However, effective policy responses are possible when deviations are caused by nominal or market-structure shocks. The appropriate policy response depends on the cause of the disequilibrium. In this study I use a structural vector autoregression to identify the shocks responsible for purchasing power parity (PPP) deviations for 12 US dollar exchange rates. I find that aggregate demand shocks are not the primary cause of PPP deviations. Real shocks and foreign exchange shocks are much more important. Foreign exchange shocks dominate exchange rate behaviour. This suggests a policy response with greater focus on the foreign exchange market and the degree to which persistent PPP deviations represent compensation for risk-bearing or a form of micro-structure inefficiency.","Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Crowder, WJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",crowder@uta.edu,"Crowder, Bill/F-2783-2016",,,,,,19,4,4,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Frequent bettors (N = 67) and sporadic bettors (N = 63) estimated whether the bets on football games presented to them via an on-line questionnaire would be successful. The bets consisted of singles (one match outcomes) and conjunctions (two matches outcomes), and were presented either in probability or frequency terms. Both frequent and sporadic bettors showed similar levels of the overconfidence bias. However, the frequent bettors made the conjunction fallacy more often than the sporadic bettors. The presentation of the task in the frequency terms significantly reduced the overconfidence bias in comparison to the evaluations in probability terms, but left the conjunction fallacy unaffected.

Thus, a stable long-term equilibrium relationship among these two variables seems to exist. However, there is also empirical evidence for the existence of a structural break in early 2009. Following Basse, Friedrich and v. d. Schulenburg (2011) we interpret this finding as an indication that financial markets started to see a higher sovereign credit risk in Spain. The structural break may even signal some fears about the return of exchange rate risk. Given that the break date is quite early; our empirical findings could be an indication that bond markets are at least partially efficient. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We examine whether such a program increases achievement, grades, and attendance rates. We exploit quasi-random timing of program implementation that allows for a difference-in-differences identification strategy. We find that providing breakfast in class relative to the cafeteria raises math and reading achievement by 0.09 and 0.06 standard deviations, respectively. These effects are most pronounced for low-performing, free lunch-eligible, Hispanic, and low body mass index students. A lack of differences by exposure time and effects on grades suggest that these impacts are on test-taking performance rather than learning. At the same time, the results highlight the possibility that measured achievement may be biased downwards, and accountability penalties may be inappropriately applied, in schools where many students do not consume breakfast.","[Imberman, Scott A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kugler, Adriana D.] Georgetown Univ, Georgetown Publ Policy Inst, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Michigan State University; Georgetown University,"Imberman, SA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, Marshall Adams Hall,486 W Circle Dr,Room 110, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",imberman@msu.edu; ak659@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,36,46,65,1,44,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

We find that the extent of cross-firm social connection between directors and senior executives at the acquiring and the target firms has a significantly' negative effect on the abnormal returns to the acquirer and to the combined entity upon merger announcement. Moreover, acquirer-target social ties significantly increase the likelihood that the target firm's chief executive officer (CEO) and a larger fraction of the target firm's pre-acquisition board of directors remain on the board of the combined firm after the merger. In addition, we find that acquirer CEOs are more likely to receive bonuses and are more richly compensated for completing mergers with targets that are highly connected to the acquiring firms, that acquisitions are more likely to take place between two firms that are well connected to each other through social ties, and that such acquisitions are more likely to subsequently be divested for performance-related reasons. Taken together, our results suggest that social ties between the acquirer and the target lead to poorer decision making and lower value creation for shareholders overall. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Predator removal may become particularly important in the face of habitat loss, and ecosystem management strategies that ignore the influence of habitat are likely to be inefficient. Using a bioeconomic model, we show that the marginal impact of prey habitat on predators is a key factor in determining the substitutability or complementarity of habitat and removal controls. Applying the model to the case of the endangered Atlantic-Gasp,sie Woodland Caribou (rangifer tarandus caribou), we find that the first-best strategy involves extensive caribou habitat protection and a large predator cull initially, and then substituting habitat investments for predator removal as both populations begin to recover, suggesting that habitat protection and predator removal are effectively substitute controls.","[Melstrom, Richard T.] Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [Horan, Richard D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University System of Maryland; Salisbury University; Michigan State University,"Melstrom, RT (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Purdue Hall,1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",rtmelstrom@salisbury.edu; horan@msu.edu,,"Melstrom, Richard/0000-0001-6420-5425",,,,,41,4,5,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Returning home, these economists face institutional and academic gaps that limit the adoption of research-based policies. In response, the first EfD centre was founded in 2004, and six more followed. Research focuses on agriculture, climate, fisheries, parks, wildlife, forestry, energy and policy design. This has yielded 200 peer-reviewed articles.

We shed light on the question if the performance of a constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) strategy can be improved by means of a time-varying multiplier which depends on the estimated future volatility. Neglecting any inter-temporal hedging demand, the theoretical foundation of the strategies is given by maximizing the expected utility of a HARA investor in a diffusion model setup. If the risk premium is assumed to be proportional to the variance, the optimal strategy is a CPPI strategy. Otherwise, the multiple is time-varying (PPI). It turns out that even time-varying multiple strategies based on a rolling window of historical volatility estimates give a significant improvement of CPPI strategies. The out-performance is robust w.r.t. alternative performance measures and is also true for proportional transaction costs and adequate trigger trading. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Second, China's dominance as an exporter is belied by the weaknesses of its domestic firms within the governance of value chains, with important implications for firm upgrading. By analyzing millions of US Customs Bureau trade transactions, the paradoxes are resolved by examining intermediary contractors in East Asian value chains.

We find that the relationship between disagreement and future stock market returns time-varies with the degree of investor sentiment. Higher disagreement among investors' opinions predicts significantly lower future stock market returns during high-sentiment periods, but it has no significant effect on future stock market returns during low-sentiment periods. Our findings imply that investor sentiment is related to several causes of short-sale impediments suggested in the previous literature on investor sentiment, and that the stock return predictability of disagreement is driven by investor sentiment. We demonstrate that investor sentiment has a significant impact on the stock market return predictability of disagreement through in-sample and out-of-sample analyses. In addition, the profitability of our suggested trading strategy exploiting disagreement and investor sentiment level confirms the economic significance of incorporating investor sentiment into the relationship between disagreement among investors and future stock market returns.

Productivity growth is the key economic indicator of innovation, non-theless. Growth theory assumes that changes in real output are result of technological shocks within the economy. Using ARIMA modelling techniques and Beveridge-Nelson univariate decomposition this paper estimates the impact of technological shocks on GDP, GDP per capita and labour productivity (long-term) growth of OECDs' most developed countries. The study explores the global effects of the 'third industrial revolution' for 25 OECD countries over 1950-2013 periods. The impact of innovations on growth differs in intensity and time among the countries. Measured impact of technological innovation on growth is significant, and it is expected to become even more significant in the future. Economic growth is riding on the technological innovation wave but for how long and how far it is uncertain if the 'Great Decoupling' problem is to abound. Positive impact of technological innovation on growth and welfare is seriously risked by the high divergence and inequality arising from the Great decoupling problem.","[Skare, Marinko; Tomic, Daniel] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr,"Tomić, Daniel/N-7647-2019; Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019; Tomić, Daniel/AAD-8845-2020","Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096; Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692; Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096",,,,,42,14,16,0,32,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2014,16.0,36,,,,,606,624,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AT0DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344607400012,0

This paper proposes a structural approach to determine equilibrium credit which is based on the long-run through-the-cycle transaction demand for credit. Using a panel data set consisting of 49 high and middle-income countries from 1980 to 2010, we show that there exists considerable variation in the cross-country estimates of the income and price elasticities of credit and that the unit elasticity restriction implicitly imposed by the credit-to-GDP ratio is strongly rejected by the data. This suggests that the credit-to-GDP ratio is not appropriate to measure equilibrium credit. We show further that the cross-sectional variation in the income and price elasticities of credit can be related to a set of relevant economic, financial and institutional development indicators of a country. The main determinants that explain the cross-sectional variation in the income and price elasticities are financial depth, access to financial services, use of capital markets, efficiency and funding of domestic banks, central bank independence, the degree of supervisory integration, and the experience of a financial crisis. As an empirical illustration, we compute equilibrium credit and credit gaps for eleven new EU member states using our structural framework and compare it to credit gaps based on the Basel III approach.

There is an ongoing debate about the actual effects of P&R on the transport system at the subregional level. A key issue is the relative attractiveness of city centre car parks (CCCP), P&R and public transport. The paper presents the findings of a comparative empirical case-study based on a field survey of CCCP and P&R users conducted in the city of Bath, UK. Spatial and statistical analyses are applied. Radial distance to parking, availability of P&R sites in the direction of travel, gender, age, income and party-size are found to be important factors in a binary logistic regression model, explaining the revealed-preference of parking type. Stated analysis of foregone parking alternatives suggests more use of public transport and walking/cycling would likely occur without first-best parking alternatives. The policy implications and possible planning alternatives to P&R at the urban fringes for achieving greater sustainability goals are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Significantly, the explanation does not rely on changes over time or differences across races in individual fertility behavior. It is consistent with the rising nonmarital fertility measures observed in the United States since the mid-1970s, higher measured fertility for unmarried blacks than whites, and differences across races in the timing of childbearing, despite nearly constant total fertility rates and increasingly similar target family sizes for blacks and whites. The explanation relies on a selection effect associated with changes in the marriage rate and on racial differences in access to human capital investment opportunities. We find strong support for the explanation using U.S. data over the period 1957-2002. Our findings suggest caution in interpreting the results of empirical studies of childbearing that examine marital and nonmarital fertility rates separately, as these studies typically ignore the selection effect of marriage.

We evaluate the revenue and distributional effects of a one-time capital levy on personal net wealth that is currently on the political agenda in Germany. We use survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and estimate the net wealth distribution at the very top, based on publicly-available information about very rich Germans. Since net wealth is strongly concentrated, the capital levy could raise substantial revenue, even if relatively high personal allowances are granted.

Furthermore, we find no significant effects of currency rates (except Korea) or the performance of the market of origin on herding behavior among ADR issues.

The literature largely has focused on giving landowners direct incentives to store carbon. This paper explores an alternative mechanism to increase forest carbon sequestration by creating a market for wood bioenergy. By raising the value of wood, the program encourages landowners to convert vast amounts of land to forest, which incidentally increases forest carbon. By providing an indirect subsidy on woody biomass, governments can give even more incentive to reward this carbon sequestration.","[Favero, Alice] Yale Univ, Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Favero, Alice] FEEM, Milan, Italy; [Mendelsohn, Robert] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Mendelsohn, Robert] Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT USA",Yale University; Fondazione Mattei; Yale University; Yale University,"Favero, A (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",alice.favero@feem.it; robert.mendelsohn@yale.edu,"Mendelsohn, Robert/GZA-9112-2022",,,,,,37,27,32,1,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Through simulation and empirical studies, we compare six alternative proposals that are used in the literature to reduce the effects of outliers in the estimation of risk measures when using GARCH-type models. The methods are based on [1] correcting for significant outliers, [2] accommodating outliers using complex (e.g. fat-tail) distributions and [3] accounting for outlier effects by robust estimation. The main conclusions of the simulation study are that the presence of outliers bias these risk measures, being the proposal by Grane and Veiga (2010) that providing the highest bias reduction. From the out-of-sample results for four international stock market indexes we found weak evidence that more complex models (specification and error distribution) perform better in estimating the minimum capital risk requirements during the last global financial crisis.

In the canonical model, the ally principle holds - the principal picks the ideologically closest agent. However, elected politicians typically decide whether to delegate not to an individual but to an institution, which consists of many individuals with differing preferences. To improve on existing work, we model delegation with bureaucratic hierarchy. Our results show that hierarchy is sufficient to undercut the ally principle. Indeed, capturing the logic of delegation and its results requires incorporating agency structure, especially the costs of an agency head controlling her subordinates resulting in incomplete control, as different structures are associated with different policy outcomes even when the same people constitute a bureaucracy. We also demonstrate that integrating hierarchy has important implications for a wide range of considerations, such as agency structural choice and the measurement of agency ideal points.","[Jo, Jinhee] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Rothenberg, Lawrence S.] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",Kyung Hee University; University of Rochester,"Rothenberg, LS (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",lrot@mail.rochester.edu,"Jo, Jinhee/AAI-7070-2020",,,,,,27,8,10,0,18,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

While these systems share the goal of trying to improve service delivery and participant outcomes, they do not necessarily provide information on the causal (value-added) effects of a program, which requires a rigorous impact evaluation. One approach for potentially improving the association between program performance measures and impacts is to adjust performance measures for differences across performance units in participant characteristics and local economic conditions. This article develops a statistical model that describes the conditions under which regression adjustment improves the performance-impact correlation. We then use the model to examine the performance-impact association using extensive data from a large-scale random assignment evaluation of Job Corps, the nation's largest training program for disadvantaged youths. We find that while regression adjustment changes the Job Corps center performance measures, the adjusted performance measures are not correlated with the impact estimates. The main reasons are the weak associations between the unadjusted Job Corps performance measures and participants' longer-term outcomes as measured by the evaluation, as well as the likely presence of unobserved factors across centers that are correlated with outcomes.","[Schochet, Peter Z.] Math Policy Res, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; [Fortson, Jane] Math Policy Res, Human Serv Res, Oakland, CA 94612 USA",Mathematica; Mathematica,"Schochet, PZ (通讯作者)，Math Policy Res, POB 2393, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA.",pschochet@mathematica-mpr.com; jfortson@mathematica-mpr.com,,,,,,,24,3,3,1,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Central bank surveys and an index of central bank transparency reveal that central banks have adopted the necessary institutional arrangements to communicate effectively a price stability objective. However, their communications strategy is ill suited to dealing with financial stability issues. Recent events require a departure from the pre-crisis narrative that entailed a predictable relationship between inflation and output gaps, of which financial stability was considered a by-product. I argue that central banks should adopt a hybrid form of inflation and price level targeting as well as require that macroprudential regulators jointly communicate their determination to act in concert, especially when the financial system is under stress. The current practice of announcing the rationale for the setting of monetary policy instruments is no longer an effective communication strategy when central banks must also evince a concern for financial stability.","[Siklos, Pierre L.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Viessmann European Res Ctr, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University; Viessmann European Research Centre,"Siklos, PL (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, 75 Univ Ave, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",psiklos@wlu.ca,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

The services intensity of firms may affect their productivity and thereby their competitiveness abroad; services are also instrumental in connecting firms to foreign markets and can help them to differentiate their offerings from those of other firms. However, the relation between services and manufacturing exports has only been partially analysed in the previous literature. This study contributes to the field by discussing the role of services for firms and empirically testing a set of related conjectures. Export intensity is regressed on two services input parameters, applying a fractional model to a rich panel of firms in Sweden in the period 2001-2007. The microeconometric results suggest that, after controlling for covariates and heterogeneity, service inputs affect a firms' export capabilities: raising the proportion of services in in-house production yields higher export intensity on average. Furthermore, buying-in more services is associated with higher export intensity for firms in some industries. Overall, the study provides new firm-level evidence of the role of services as inputs in manufacturing.","Univ Orebro, Dept Econ, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden",Orebro University,"Lodefalk, M (通讯作者)，Univ Orebro, Dept Econ, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden.",magnus.lodefalk@oru.se,"Lodefalk, Magnus/AAI-1579-2021","Lodefalk, Magnus/0000-0003-0149-9598",,,,,53,52,56,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Local government has adopted a battery of policies to reduce these problems. In this study, we investigate the impact of increasing the fuel tax on travel mode choice based on a large sample of travel survey data. We estimate that if the price of gasoline increased to a moderate level, 11.53RMB/liter, the total car volume on the road would be reduced by 7 per cent, which corresponds to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 786,002.4 tons, or about 8 per cent of vehicular emissions from private cars and company-owned cars in Beijing.","[Qin, Ping; Zheng, Xinye] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lanlan] China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Qin, P (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pingqin2009@gmail.com; zhengxinye@ruc.edu.cn; lanlanwa@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,8,8,0,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

And is local development instrumental in the success of conservation goals? We investigated allocation of opportunities and burdens around a national park in Uganda. Our findings suggest that direct benefits from conservation and development projects may promote distributional justice by compensating for park-related damages, but are too limited in their coverage to impact development. Indirect benefits related to transportation, health, education, and security affect a far greater segment of the population. Furthermore, the benefits of conservation tend to increase local economic inequality. Contrasting tendencies in terms of distributional justice and economic equality can partly be explained by the human geography of national parks and this geography must be taken into account if broad development goals are to be achieved. Improved local attitudes towards the park seem to have resulted from a complex of effects rather than any single development initiative.","[Tumusiime, David Mwesigye; Sjaastad, Espen] Norwegian Univ Life Sci UMB, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Tumusiime, DM (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci UMB, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, POB 1432, As, Norway.",tumusid@yahoo.com,,"Tumusiime, David Mwesigye/0000-0003-0171-5027",,,,,93,15,20,1,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

According to the dual labor market theory (DLM), which considers the informal economy as a spare sector providing jobs for formally unemployed resources, unpleasant economic situations force people to act informally. Legalists, on the other hand, blame government interventions such as minimum wages or price control policies for pushing rent-seeking firms toward the shadows. This study using an Error-correction Multi-Indicators Multi-Causes (EMIMIC) model, a systematic method consisting of structural and measurement equations, shows that these two theories are complementary rather than substitutes for one another. While long-term trends are explained by legalists, DLM theory is also suitable for explaining short term changes. Iran's economy in the period 1971-2007, which was characterized by government interventions, is chosen for this purpose. These interventions are measured by Principal Component Analysis. Finally, an index of the size of Iran's informal economy is also reported.","[Khandan, Abbas] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Tuscany, Italy; [Nili, Masoud] Sharif Univ Technol, Grad Sch Management & Econ, Tehran, Iran",University of Siena; Sharif University of Technology,"Khandan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Piazza S Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Tuscany, Italy.",Abbaskhandan@gmail.com,"khandan, Abbas/HNP-8862-2023","khandan, Abbas/0000-0002-4558-6653",,,,,29,7,9,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Firms that enter a foreign market by exporting are able to capture consumer surplus by introducing a differentiated product with characteristics that the incumbent cannot match. In relatively globalized product space, in contrast, consumers perceive an entrant's difference to existing products as less pronounced so a consumer's virtual distance costs in product space are lower and a merger with an incumbent (horizontal FDI) offers pricing power that allows the entrant to extract consumer rent. Lower physical trade costs of shipping make Bertrand price competition fiercer in differentiated product space and can provide an additional incentive for a merger. A basic product space model with a linear Hotelling setup can therefore explain why FDI has become more frequent in recent periods in the presence of falling trade costs. Cross-border merger and acquisitions data support the model's prediction that horizontal FDI grows relatively faster than exports in differentiated goods industries, compared to homogeneous goods industries.","[Muendler, Marc-Andreas] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Muendler, Marc-Andreas] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Muendler, Marc-Andreas] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Ifo Institut; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Muendler, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",muendler@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,42,0,0,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Over two decades, the production of maize has seen a radical transition both in the geographical location of maize agriculture and the type of farmers growing maize. In this paper, I argue that the restructuring of the domestic maize supply is due to policy decisions to support private agents in the maize market; hence the state did not withdraw its involvement but, rather, has had a key role in the construction of the free' maize market, with the result that domestic supply for the market is concentrated in the hands of relatively few agents and in relatively few regions.

The quality of institutions is captured through the practices of public and governmental actions and mainly the legal framework quality and the fight against corruption. To achieve this objective, we use a gravity model inspired by the variant of the model proposed by Anderson and van Wincoop [2003].

The optimal capacity is dependent on various parameters such as market uncertainty, processing margin, marginal variable cost, and incremental investment cost. The major finding is that the industry-wide capacity expansions occurred in 2007 and 2008 might not have been recommended by the real options model.

Analyses of the role of incentives and their economic rationale have been usually carried out for the first two groups, and most often for the central government. Local government efforts have been rather omitted by researchers. Yet local authorities, due to their legal and political obligations to their communities, should be very interested in the positive long-term outcomes of FDI entry. The attitudes and professionalism of local authorities can be decisive in fostering a good economic/business climate, which has been identified by foreign entrepreneurs as an important factor in choosing a location for their investments. So two questions could be asked: (1) whether local governments are sufficiently aware of these opportunities and of the instruments which could help make them happen; and (2) whether foreign investors are sensitive to incentives offered by local authorities in selecting the location for an investment project in a host country. This paper aims to study the role of the local government in attracting foreign capital to the Province of Lodz as of the end of 2011. Conclusions are drawn based mainly on the results of a questionnaire study. The results confirm that investment incentives were of little importance for the inflow of FDI to the communities and counties of the Province of Lodz.","[Dorozynski, Tomasz; Swierkocki, Janusz; Urbaniak, Wojciech] Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Dorozynski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",tdorozynski@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,117,130,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500011,0

In the US the unemployment rate is approximately 9 percentage points higher for blacks than for whites. Commute time data indicates that minorities face longer commute times to work, potentially reflecting more difficult access to jobs. In this paper we investigate the impact of spatial mismatch on the unemployment rate of ethnic groups using the matching model proposed by Rupert and Wasmer (2012). We find that spatial factors explain 1-1.5 percentage points of the unemployment rate gap in both France and the US, amounting to 17-25% of the relative gap in France and about 10-17.5% in the US. Among these factors, differences in commuting distance play the most important role. In France, though, longer commuting distances may be mitigated by higher mobility in the housing market for African workers. Overall, we still conclude that labor market factors remain the main explanation for the higher unemployment rate of Africans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Romanian economy shows increased vulnerability to the global crisis because of underground economy, the low rate of collection of taxes and the lack of fiscal predictability. It is required a long-term fiscal strategy, with clear definition of the concept of fiscal policy. As opposed to Romania, where there was only a strong increase in VAT, other countries in Eastern Europe have increased VAT receipts revenues by modest increases combined with improved collection.

Our labour system based mainly on monetary incentives will default in front of financial crisis and will not be good enough in prosperous times either. This is because when they receive no money, people will stop working. And when they receive much money, they will stop working as well. Learning organisations, like the ones aimed at by the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020, need a suitable working environment, one that can make people enthusiastic about their work. Nevertheless, enthusiasm can not be forced, bought or tricked, it has to be attracted, created and cherished.

There are suggested some goals within four perspectives of BSC and measures/indicators for particular goals.","Univ W Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Jirincová, M (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic.",milenaj@kpm.zcu.cz,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,178,183,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300014,0

Thus, donors appear to have modified at least some of their aid practices in ways that build rather than undermine administrative capacity and accountability mechanisms in recipient countries.

As a result, the public investors are expected to be empowered with more quality and relevant information. This study examines a behavioral shift in investor reaction to quarterly earnings announcements after the passage of the FD due to the expected improvement in information asymmetry. The empirical findings suggest that investors show a behavioral shift after the FD in response to biased earnings forecasts. Investors become more active in that they place a discount on optimistic earnings forecasts during the earnings announcement period. It is less obvious that they place a premium on pessimistic forecasts. Another coherent finding is that investors attempt to correct for the announcement-period mis-adjustments during the post-announcement period.","[Kwag, Seung Woog] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Seoul 140742, South Korea",Sookmyung Women's University,"Kwag, SW (通讯作者)，Sookmyung Womens Univ, Coll Econ & Business Adm, Div Business Adm, Seoul 140742, South Korea.",swkwag@sookmyung.ac.kr,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Using a panel of banks over 1993-2010, the authors find that a positive shock to capital inflows and growth in gross domestic product improves banks' loan portfolio quality, and that the effect is fairly similar in magnitude using the multivariate and panel vector autoregressive frameworks. In contrast, higher lending rates may lead to adverse selection problems and hence to a drop in portfolio quality.

Traditionally there are many approaches for testing the market efficiency hypothesis. We should briefly mention the regression analysis, time series analysis, vector autoregression or linear co-integration. For recent years there are modern approaches that change the technical way of testing. Pedroni's panel co-integration method is a modern method for verification conclusions of pure economic theory. It's innovation is in analyzing short time series but on a great range of panel data. The other way is to include non-linear co-integration into non-stationary time series. The FOREX market is market with the greater trading volumes of financial traded assets. Either the rejection or the confirmation of the market efficiency hypothesis highly influence the regulation or liberalization of financial services. More we have discussed the influence of the risk premium, the influence of transaction costs and its response to equilibrium readjustment.

This method allows us to build recommender systems for use by customs officers, traders, carriers and insurers. We examine the particular use case of the recommendation to assign or not assign an armed escort to a shipping vehicle in cases of elevated risk of theft. In contrast to the usual risk based approach, this algorithm is trained solely on shipment data rather than on traditional risk indicators. This is useful as the recommendation to customs officials can be explained in terms of the make-up of a shipment and can be verified in real-time. The feasibility of the approach was tested by application to 2500 custom records collected during a continuous period of one month at eight border checkpoints between Russian Federation and two EU countries.

With the goal of protecting the people living in those slums, especially the ones living in the risky areas, the Civil Defense of Rio de Janeiro has created the Community Protection Program focusing on three subjects: (i) Training of Local Agents, (ii) Community Alarm and Alert System, and (iii) Simulation exercises at public schools. Local Agents live and work in the community and their training is of a huge importance mainly because these residents know about the vulnerabilities and they are great multipliers, advising other people about the danger. Currently there are almost 6,000 trained Local Agents acting in the community. The Alert and Alarm System for rainfall consists of sending SMS messages (Alert) and activation of sirens (Alarm). The alert is rung when the meteorologists identify the possibility of rain and the Local Agents and Community Leaders, registered to receive these messages on their cell phones, are ready to support the community. Afterwards, the Alarm (sirens) is triggered when the rain gauge indicates that rainfall has reached critical levels, what can provoke accidents - sirens were installed in 103 communities, receiving also Simulation Exercises. The Simulation Exercises at public schools consists of training for the evacuation of the community in case of heavy rains. The school represents the community, while the Civil Defense tents assembled in the courtyard represent the support points, which are safe places around the community where residents can take shelter temporarily during an emergency. The students from the 5th grade act as monitors, helping the younger students and playing the role of Public Officials and volunteers. This whole mise-en-scene has been helping a lot of communities to overcome the challenges raised by the rains in Rio de Janeiro. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The magnitude of the flood completely overwhelmed existing flood defences and made a mockery of well-known and packaged agendas meant to prevent, protect and prepare against such adverse occurrences. The European Union's (EU) Flood Directive 2007 is robust in its aim and mandate to member states, for which the UK is a member, in specifying that adequate and coordinated measures be taken to reduce flood risk. The UK Environment Agency, solely responsible for action against these natural disasters had been caught napping and widely blamed for failings in pre-empting these sad incidents. Thousands of properties were devastated and vital infrastructures, such as roads, bridges and rail tracks were damaged, as a result. Thousands of people were made homeless and some had to seek temporary shelter and refuge. The consequences on businesses were untold and large compensation were to be paid out by insurance companies. This paper is set to look into various mitigating measures meant to overcome the lapses and inadequacies of the present system and to encourage a better informed approach in dealing with future occurrences.

Over time, a growing number of road freight vehicles have delivered less freight over longer distances, while average load factors have been reduced. This development is unsatisfactory, as transport capacity that could have been used more efficiently is lost. To mitigate negative impact, it has been suggested that freight consolidation and better planned localisation of freight consolidation centres (FCCs) would improve city logistics. Based on primary data, this paper investigates the potential to establish urban FCCs intended for small road hauliers (SRHs) delivering goods to the retail sector in a wider geographical area, the Gothenburg region in Sweden. While the findings show that a large majority of SRHs could reach potential FCC locations in a short time, congestion affects deliveries and several factors, many of which were observed already in the 1970s, restrict FCC establishments. Under present conditions, there is little scope for SRHs to successfully deliver goods to retailers in the Gothenburg region from FCCs; therefore, a more efficient urban transport system from a business or societal perspective is unlikely. Policy makers need to take into consideration the different segments, requirements, and characteristics of different cities before venturing into costly FCC projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Consumer culture has become one of the most- powerful characteristics that influence both individual and groups decisions. Even though consumer behavior and purchase intention models are continuing to dominate the academic research and even/day practice of the management science, they could not imprint the whole picture of today's culture evolution. Today, consumers operate in a dynamic and constantly changing environment that dictates the constant re-evaluation of purchase intentions and decisions. In order to investigate the impact of contextual factors, brand loyalty and brand switching on consumer purchase decisions, a empirical survey was conducted with the use of a structured questionnaire on a sample of Greek consumers, aged between eighteen (18) and fifty five years (55). The size of the sample was four hundred and fifty (450) questionnaires. The findings reveal that contextual factors have the strongest influence on purchase decisions and have an impact on both brand loyalty and brand switching. Moreover, the findings provide important insights regarding the factors that practitioners should enhance in order to tailor their marketing approaches. In general, the present study offers knowledge to managers and researchers on the issues of purchase decisions, brand loyalty, brand switching, and contextual factors. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Due to the particular economic conditions in Iran, hurriedly made post-earthquake emergency shelters often fail in complying with the minimum needs of the occupants. Consequently, such shelters are often either abandoned or transformed substantially, resulting in an overwhelming waste of resources. This paper aims to investigate the transformation process of post-earthquake houses, with attention to the architectural characteristics of the transformations and people's motivational factors for these transformations. The methods used include systematic observations and map analysis of the transformations of post-earthquake houses over a 37 years period (1970-2007) and interviews with the households. Relying upon analysis of the problems of the current post-earthquake houses in Iran, the results recommended that the design for these houses should address: transformability into pre-earthquake patterns and lifestyles, adaptability to new parts/construction besides original dwelling, and capability to reflect different requirement for indoor spatial circulations. The findings therefore proposed the use of mixed 'Temporary-Permanent' housing reconstruction models which involve participation of stakeholders and end users from very early stages of design and developments in order to predict and address the latter transformations issues. This study contributes to both research and practice by proposing new design approaches and guidelines regarding post-earthquake housing reconstruction in Iran. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study is to provide a unique test of this hypothesis using the time-series properties of quarterly earnings. It is well documented that seasonally differenced quarterly earnings for adjacent quarters are positively correlated. Therefore a component of current quarter earnings when reported is news that was known or predictable at the end of the prior quarter and thus is old news. We find for those firms that receive media coverage in the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times that the price reaction at the time of the announcement of current earnings to past quarter's seasonally differenced quarterly earnings is greater than those firms that do not receive media coverage. The result is consistent with stale earnings information being given the appearance of new information resulting in a further price reaction. This suggests that the stale information hypothesis and media coverage could be a partial explanation for post-earnings announcement drift.,"[Pinnuck, Matthew] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Pinnuck, M (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Accounting & Business Informat Syst, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",mpinnuck@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,37,6,6,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The present authors propose that large and small firms treat their seasoned equity differently: small firms time the market, whereas large firms use discretionary accruals to increase their proceeds. We verify this hypothesis using a sample of 463 firms listed on the Taiwan stock exchange. Specifically, for small firms, the timing effect is positively correlated with the firm's short-term wealth and negatively correlated with its long-term wealth. For large firms, earnings management (proxied as discretionary accruals gauged by the modified Jones model) is positively correlated with short-term wealth and negatively correlated with long-term wealth. The separating equilibrium is unlikely to be conditioned by the issuing firm's flotation methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, in Europe, the European Financial Stability Fund (later the European Stability Mechanism) was created to bail troubled institutions out. The European Systemic Risk Board was created in 2010 and similar or subordinated organisms are being established at national levels in order to assure that the stability, once propped by the aforementioned organisms, is not lost again. The ESRB is geared precisely toward more centralization of policy and coordination between regulatory and supervisory agencies hitherto more specialized and limited in scope. The present paper analyses the general solution chosen by the EU and discusses the possibility and consequences of alternative financial arrangements. Starting from the essential insight that the main historical root of world financial instability is the practice of fractional reserve banking, we argue that the European chosen solution is ultimately headed to failure, and so is the Europe-wide bail-in suggested more recently, while there are alternatives, discussed herein, that are more or less suited to bring a future of financial stability.","[Smirna, Tudor Gherasim] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,tudorsmirna@gmail.com,"Smirna, Tudor/HPC-8828-2023",,,,,,20,0,0,0,4,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-021-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,281,288,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346752000039,0

The computer, the internet, Smartphone and tablet devices have a great impact on learning and teaching practices. Technology assisted learning has the power to deliver cost effective useful learning experiences to technologically deprived developing or the least developed countries. There have been several projects (OLPC, OTPC, iRead1&2-Ghana) involving technology assisted learning which have indicated brighter prospects of such deployments. However, the use of technology assisted learning to educate people (not necessarily only children) on challenging issues like livelihood, finances, healthcare and disaster preparedness is still under explored in the developing countries. This paper will explore the possibility of using tablet based e-learning in remote locations to provide disaster preparedness training to the mass and will share lessons learned from a pilot study carried out in the rural South West location in Bangladesh. Focus of the paper will be on how the training has used non-formal and informal education to make local people educated and better aware of basic disaster preparedness issues that are often overlooked, such as creating emergency plan, making emergency kit and first aid. This paper will add significant value to existing knowledge by adding field experience of using tablet device in disaster preparedness training and suggesting a place for such training within non-formal and informal educational setting.

Various probabilistic properties of (integrated) VMOU processes are presented. Further we study the effect of the SVV on the leverage effect and on the presence of long memory. One of the key results in the article is that we can quantify the impact of the SVV on the (stochastic) dynamics of the variance risk premium (VRP).

Unlike the previous literature that considers an investor's mean-spectral risk preferences for the choice of optimal portfolios only implicitly, we explicitly model these preferences in the form of a so-called spectral utility function. Within this more general framework, spectral risk measures tend towards corner solutions. If a risk free asset exists, diversification is never optimal. Similarly, without a risk free asset, only limited diversification is obtained. The reason is that spectral risk measures are based on a regulatory concept of diversification that differs fundamentally from the reward-risk tradeoff underlying the mean-variance framework.

These affected banks are no longer subject to the internal control requirements but would have been had the regulation not been changed. We hypothesize that these affected banks are likely to make riskier loans, which will increase the likelihood of failure during the crisis period. We find evidence consistent with this hypothesis. Affected banks have higher likelihood of failure during the crisis period than banks from two different control samples.

This study questions the implicit assumption that government interventions have an uniform effect on the default risk of individual banks. After testing the results for sensitivity, our main findings suggest that there exists a significant negative relationship between the announcement of the financial sector rescue packages and the daily change of the credit default premium. However, quantile regressions show that the effectiveness of these packages differs across banks: most interventions do not decrease the risk of intermediate to low-risk banks, while they do reduce the risk of high-risk banks. Besides, we find that interventions aimed at specific financial institutions are more effective in restraining banking risk than broad interventions taken to stabilize the financial market as a whole.

This paper considers two of the major types of carbon permits: European Union Allowances (EUAs, arising from the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, EU ETS) and certified emissions reductions (CERs, arising from agreements made under the Kyoto Protocol). The rules of the EU ETS allow for some use of CERs in place of EUAs by EU firms, but this substitutability is only partial. Allowing for carbon permits from different sources to substitute for one another should help achieve CO2 emissions reductions at least cost. Understanding the degree and nature of linkages (if any) between the markets for EUAs and CER is, thus, an important policy issue. In this paper, we jointly model the spot and future prices of an EUA along with the price of a CER using flexible multivariate time series methods which allow for time-variation in parameters. We find evidence of contemporaneous causality between these three variables with the EUA futures price playing the dominant role in driving this relationship. We also document time-variation in this relationship which is associated with macroeconomic events such as the financial crisis of late 2008 and early 2009. We find very little evidence of volatility spillovers or of Granger causality among any of the variables. We discuss how these empirical findings are consistent with markets which are loosely linked, but are not tightly linked as would be found for perfectly substitutable assets in efficient financial markets.

Using panel cointegration we show that intersectoral spillovers have a key impact on innovation activities and that domestic R&D has a stronger effect than international R&D. However, within technological fields, estimated international R&D spillovers are 2.4 times the national R&D effects.

We find that macroeconomic factors play important role in explaining time variations in the bond return co-movement. Specifically, domestic macroeconomic factors have higher relative importance than global factors, with domestic monetary policy and domestic inflationary environment identified as the most influential factors. The global bond market uncertainty, based on an implied volatility measure, has explanatory power in driving co-movement dynamics in emerging and frontier bond markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I find evidence that IMF lending programmes on average serve to reduce the maturity of sovereign bond issues, which is an undesirable effect. However, the impact of IMF interventions varies, importantly, across countries which differ according to measures of their fundamental macroeconomic soundness: countries with weak fundamentals tend to lengthen their debt maturities following on the heels of an IMF lending programme. This suggests that the IMF should focus particularly on ensuring that its interventions do not increase incentives for short-term debt issuance in countries not at risk of imminent crisis, but which might put themselves at risk through imprudent borrowing practices.","Cent Bank Chile, Santiago 8340454, Chile",Central Bank of Chile,"Saravia, D (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Chile, Agustinas 1180, Santiago 8340454, Chile.",dsaravia@bcentral.cl,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

These schemes allow regulators to take control over a systemically important financial institution before bankruptcy. We ask how special resolution schemes influence banks' risk taking and whether regulators should combine them with minimum capital requirements. We model a single bank which is supervised by a regulator who receives an imperfect signal about the bank's probability of success. We find that capital requirements are better than resolution from a welfare point of view if the quality of the signal is low, if it is difficult for the bank to attract deposits, or if the project return is low.

The Dutch National Travel Survey, administered in 2009, was used as a data source. First, various facets of activity-travel patterns of the elderly were compared against overall sample averages. Results indicate that the new generation of elderly people do not differ that much from other age groups in terms of their activity-travel behavior. Differences in behavior can be largely understood in terms of constraints acting on agendas. Moreover, travel patterns of elderly are affected by socio-demographic variables. Second, to further qualify the average findings, the Chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) method was applied to explore heterogeneity among the elderly in terms of travel time expenditure. It is analyzed how differences in travel time co-vary with socio-demographics, in addition to activity type, activity duration and travel aspects. The results suggest that the aging population can be systematically broken down into several homogeneous cohort segments. Travel time of elderly groups depends significantly on transport modes, travel motivation, and seven socio-demographic variables (gender, age, living environment, personal net-income, household size and season). Moreover, there is less heterogeneity in travel time of elderly who are older than 75 years old. However, for younger elderly people, especially the group aged from 65 to 74 years old, heterogeneity affects their travel. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This method is more flexible as no prior information on the changing points or size of sample window is needed. From the empirical results, we find the evidence of the existence of spillover effects among most markets, and the bilateral volatility spillover effects are more prominent over turmoil or crisis episodes, especially during Asia crisis and subprime mortgage crisis periods.

Our argument proceeds in two steps. Firstly, the basic finance problem of a centre-periphery system is captured by a threat game with complete but imperfect information. To get close to the essence of the current EZ sovereign debt crisis we analyse to what extent a 'troubled' periphery member can negotiate a bailout from the centre due to the existence of a negative externality arising from its potential default. Secondly, we analyse how establishing 'exit rules' would shift the centre-periphery relationship in a way that safeguards the stability of the EZ. We demonstrate that such rules may help limit the scope for brinkmanship whereby fiscal problems in one member state create a negative externality for the rest of the EZ. We then discuss key policy implications concerning financial aspects of the centre-periphery relationship within the EZ. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper studies how this redistribution of school days, and therefore child care days available through school, affects maternal employment. The presence of year-round calendars in a district could be correlated with other district level attributes that might affect female employment rates. I therefore use a differencing method that compares the influence of district year-round enrollment on the employment rates of women with school-aged children relative to women whose eldest child is pre-school-aged. Unobserved district factors should affect employment rates of women with school-aged and pre-school-aged children similarly, yet only women with school-aged children should be directly impacted by school calendar. I find that redistributing child care days available through school into shorter intervals over time negatively impacts maternal employment. Among those women with school-aged children, those also having pre-school-aged children have the hardest time adjusting to differences in existing availability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The effect is largely monotonic-it is small and insignificant for opaque firms and large and significant for transparent firms-and survives numerous robustness tests. We find supportive evidence for firm value and operating performance. Hence, governance and transparency are complements. This complementarity effect is consistent with the view that more transparent firms are more likely takeover targets, because acquirers can bid more effectively and identify synergies more precisely.","[Gu, Lifeng; Hackbarth, Dirk] Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Urbana, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Gu, LF (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Urbana, IL USA.",,"Hackbarth, Dirk/GNM-9256-2022; Gu, Lifeng/I-7964-2013","Hackbarth, Dirk/0000-0003-4259-5690;",,,,,54,11,12,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

The very IS based on computer data processing have its evolution, starting from partial, integrated and up to enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Most often problems in this area are: (1) the problem of getting the adequate analyses for the management and implementation of business policy because the obtained information is too old or incomplete; (2) implementation of information systems lasts inappropriately long and demands huge costs; (3) there is no significant rationalization of administrative work and papers.

More solvent banks hold fewer liquid assets against their stock of liquid liabilities, suggesting an interaction between capital and liquidity buffers.

They refer to research showing that promotion- and prevention-focused self-regulation has an important impact on judgments, choice, and behavior in economic contexts, and that such effects of regulatory focus are a consequence of behavioral strategies and differences in information processing associated with the self-regulatory orientations of a promotion or prevention focus. Furthermore, the authors emphasize that cognitive feelings are a motivational force that keeps such self-regulatory processes running. In particular, they argue that feeling right and anticipation and experience of regret increase the engagement of individuals in promotion- or prevention-focused self-regulation and direct individuals towards the relevant self-regulatory goals. Finally, the authors provide examples documenting how knowledge about self-regulatory orientations of a promotion and a prevention focus can be applied to understand individuals' behavior and to develop reasonable intervention strategies addressing relevant behavioral tendencies in the economic context.

Due to these different goal conceptualizations, prevention-focused parties are expected to set the framework for agreements in distributive business-negotiations among parties with different regulatory foci: Specifically, we predict that prevention-focused negotiators reveal a high resistance to concede until their goals are met, but are willing to concede once their goals are fulfilled. In contrast, promotion-focused parties should adjust their concession making to the best attainable outcomes, irrespective of their negotiation goals. Two studies supported these theoretical assumptions: Prevention-focused parties with goals located in the upper range (i.e., high goals) of the 'zone of possible agreements' (ZOPA; e.g., Sebenius, 1992) revealed a high resistance to concede. Hence, they outperformed promotion-focused counterparts irrespective of whether the latter held low (Study 1) or equally high (Study 2) goals. Conversely, prevention-focused parties with goals located in the lower range of the ZOPA (i.e., low goals) revealed a lower resistance to concede. Hence, they were outperformed by their promotion-focused counterparts irrespective of whether the latter held equally low (Study 1) or high (Study 2) goals.

We assume that the current government cannot commit to long-term carbon taxes, and so both it and the private sector face the possibility that the government in power in the future may give different (relative) weight to environmental damage costs. We show that this lack of commitment has a significant asymmetric effect: it increases the social benefits of the current government to have the investment undertaken, but reduces the private benefit to the private sector to invest. Consequently the current government may need to use additional policy instruments-such as R&D subsidies-to stimulate the required investment.","[Ulph, Alistair] Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Ulph, David] SIRE, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Ulph, David] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of Manchester; University of St Andrews,"Ulph, A (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",alistair.ulph@manchester.ac.uk; du1@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Ulph, David/0000-0003-3171-1270",,,,,14,24,24,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In this paper we revisit this long-standing debate and propose a new empirical approach that is concentrated on the relationship between deposit market competition and bank risk. This approach closely follows the traditional theoretical views of the competition and risk relationship and is focused on testing the classical moral hazard problem of the bank: deposit market competition raises the optimal risk choice of the bank by raising the costs of bank liabilities. Since banks can substitute between retail and wholesale funding, we relate deposit market competition to wholesale market conditions and examine their joint effect on the risk of bank assets. The analysis is based on a unique, comprehensive dataset, which combines retail deposit rate data with data on bank characteristics and data on local deposit market features for a sample of 589 US banks.

An innovation involves two stages: research results in a technology blueprint, which development transforms into a profitable activity. An innovator, who is either efficient or inefficient, must rely on outside finance for the development. Only patented technologies are developed. Strengthening the non-obviousness requirement alleviates adverse selection by discouraging inefficient innovators from doing research, but creates inefficiencies by excluding marginal innovations. We show that it is socially optimal to raise the non-obviousness requirement so as to exclude bad innovators; we also provide several robustness checks and discuss the policy implications.","[Kou, Zonglai] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Rey, Patrick] Toulouse Sch Econ, IDEI, Toulouse, France; [Rey, Patrick] Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ, Toulouse, France; [Wang, Tong] Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich, Norfolk, England",Fudan University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of East Anglia,"Kou, ZL (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zlkou@fudan.edu.cn; patrick.rey@tse-fr.eu; divinites@gmail.com,,"Wang, Tong/0000-0001-6416-6622",Chinese National Social Science Foundation; 985 project at Fudan University,Chinese National Social Science Foundation; 985 project at Fudan University,"We thank Marc Bourreau, Bruno Jullien, Carlo Cambini, Zhao Chen, Jacques Cremer, Steffen Hoernig, Sanxi Li, Matt Mitchell, Suzanne Scotchmer, Florian Schuett, Zheng Song, Tuomas Takalo, Jean Tirole, Bing Ye, the Editors, and participants at the ESWC conference (Shanghai, 2010), the EARIE conference (Istanbul, 2010), the ASSET conference (Alicante, 2010) and the Conference on Patents, Entrepreneurship and Innovation (USPTO, Washington, D.C., May, 2012), as well as seminar participants at Telecom Paristech (Paris, May, 2011) the European University Institute (Florence, March, 2012), the Renmin University of China (Beijing, April, 2012), and the Lecture Series on the Law & Economics of Innovation (ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich, Oct., 2012), for helpful comments.

In the framework of a threshold model, it is empirically shown that this relation depends on the financial risk of a country as perceived by investors. In order to proxy financial risk, a financial risk rating employed by multinational firms, banks, and equity and currency traders is used. This rating relies on debt to GDP ratios amongst other indicators. In countries with low financial risk, financial openness decreases output volatility while financial openness increases output volatility in countries with high financial risk. Extensive robustness checks confirm this result.","Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Meller, B (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Strae 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",barbara.meller@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,42,9,10,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

This paper is concerned with the numerical estimation Of the VaR for a portfolio position as a function of different dependence scenarios on the factors of the portfolio. Besides summarizing the most relevant analytical bounds, including a discussion of their sharpness, we introduce a numerical algorithm which allows for the computation of reliable (sharp) bounds for the VaR of high-dimensional portfolios with dimensions d possibly in the several hundreds. We show that additional. positive dependence information will typically not improve the upper bound substantially. In contrast higher order marginal information on the model, when available, may lead to strongly improved bounds. Several examples of practical relevance show how explicit VaR bounds can be obtained.

It introduces two new work-status groups - small-business operators and formal-casual or contract employees - in an effort to transcend the usual formal-informal distinction. We find that long-term migrants (LTMs) tend to gravitate to the small-business sector and to jobs with regular wages, whereas recent and very recent migrants are more likely to work in the informal sector. Our findings on the labour-market outcomes of successive generations of migrants are less conclusive. While a larger proportion of LTM children than that of their parents work in the formal sector, the children of migrant heads of households are less likely than those of non-migrants to find formal-sector jobs. We also find that distortionary labour-market regulations appear to diminish the overall benefits of migration.","[Manning, Chris] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Pratomo, Devanto S.] Brawijaya Univ, Malang, Indonesia",Australian National University; Brawijaya University,"Manning, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Pratomo, Devanto Shasta/JLM-6823-2023","Pratomo, Devanto Shasta/0009-0002-7820-3417; Pratomo, Devanto Shasta/0000-0002-3859-3310",,,,,45,10,12,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

But this is counter to experience, especially in the downtown areas of major cities during rush hour. This paper analyzes a bathtub model of downtown rush-hour traffic congestion that builds on ideas put forward by William Vickrey. Water flowing into the bathtub corresponds to cars entering the traffic stream, water flowing out of the bathtub to cars exiting from it, and the height of water in the bathtub to traffic density. Velocity is negatively related to density, and outflow is proportional to the product of density and velocity. Above a critical density, outflow falls as density increases (traffic jam situations). When demand is high relative to capacity, applying an optimal time-varying toll generates benefits that may be considerably larger than those obtained from standard models and that exceed the toll revenue collected.

They are linked via interbank loans and face stochastic deposit supply. Comparing different interbank network structures, it is shown that money-centre networks are more stable than random networks. Evidence is provided that the central bank stabilizes interbank markets in the short run only.

Commuters in northern Vermont face the added challenge of a northern climate that makes cycling a largely seasonal activity. Cyclists continue to face transport limitations, especially when overcoming climatic conditions. This study focused on major concerns for cyclists in Vermont with the goal of identifying and understanding specific barriers that can be overcome through policy, behavioral, and infrastructural changes. We examined issues surrounding bicycle commuting in Vermont through in-depth content analysis of transcripts from focus groups and individual interviews. Precipitation, cold temperatures, inclement road conditions, limited daylight hours, and wind were identified as uncontrollable deterrents to bicycling year-round, which have put the metaphorical brakes on many potential cycling trips. The treatment of these issues was found to be unique to individual cyclists based on their perceptions of the effects of subtle differences in climatic conditions on personal comfort and safety.

It shows that the effects on banks' incentives to engage in monitoring aimed at eliminating loan default losses in response to increased concentration of retail market shares of loans and deposits depend critically on whether the banks' asset and liability choices are interdependent. When the asset and liability decisions of both dominant and fringe banks are independent, a shift in market shares in favor of the dominant bank generates a straightforward increase in the incentives of all banks to monitor their loans. Under portfolio interdependence, the effects on monitoring outcomes at dominant banks and at banks within the competitive fringe depend on more complicated configurations of parameters. This fact helps explain mixed empirical evidence on the relationships between bank competition and measures of bank risk and soundness.","Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Baylor University,"VanHoose, D (通讯作者)，Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",,,,,,,,59,3,3,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The estimated grid search parameters, however, have been reported (1) to behave erratically over time, and (2) to have relatively large variances. On the other hand, parameter estimates based on a fixed shape parameter, while avoiding multicollinearity, turn out to be too smooth.

At the same time, it is a country where the extent of corruption in every sector is remarkably high. Stifling bureaucratic interference and corruption at every stage of economic activities is one of the main reasons behind high participation in informal and unregulated sectors. For economies characterized by high inequality and poverty, a useful tool for the government to pacify social unrest, is to choose a lower level of governance allowing substantial corruption in the system. Based on a study of states in India, we empirically show that higher corruption is associated with higher levels of employment in the informal sector. Furthermore, our analysis shows that for higher levels of lagged state domestic product, the positive association between levels of corruption and extent of employment in the informal sector is nullified.

Starting out from different theories, we investigate political explanations of government outsourcing using a Swedish data set in which outsourcing varies between municipalities and over time, as well as between services. Our identification strategy focuses on two services with similar contracting problems and local market conditions: preschools and primary schools. We study a period in which Swedish municipalities had full discretion in the provision of preschools, while their influence on the private provision of primary education was limited by a national voucher system. The comparison of preschools with primary schools in a difference-in-differences model suggests that the political color of the ruling majority influences outsourcing, which is consistent with the Citizen Candidate model of representative democracy.

These types of vessels carry by-products from the transformation of raw materials, which used to be transported by the world fleet of bulk carriers. These cargoes are handled in different ways when loaded/unloaded, depending on the logistic modes: containerised or uncontainerised. Regardless of the advantages and drawbacks inherent to both choices, it can be deduced that the signing of a charter party depends largely on the value of the cargo being shipped. It can thus be observed that there is a correlation between the transport flow dynamics and the type of cargo being shifted. This article analyses the maritime cargo routes that affect the European Continent port system. The aim of this research is to describe how connectivity evolved between the difficult period from March 2007 to March 2011. Information of relevance to the way in which the world maritime traffic of uncontainerised (general cargo hereinafter) and containerised cargo evolved will be shown for that period. It was decided to use Graph Theory techniques additionally with statistical techniques, so it would be possible to describe the relative importance of each port in the world transport context.

Sustainable transport advocates and researchers expect that reshaping built environments will increase bicycle usage because people will feel safer riding with more cycling facilities in place. These strategies identify road design as the key factor in how people use streets. From an ethnographic perspective, cycling research should also consider how road users create meanings in transit. This paper looks beyond physical changes to space and explores how human infrastructure encourages or discourages bicycling. Tacking between observation and participation, cultural anthropology can help design experimental spaces, such as Los Angeles' CicLAvia, that offer diverse city inhabitants an opportunity to reflect on their transport habits in situ. Experimental spaces for bicycling show that human infrastructure shapes transportation behavior, and has the potential to change it.

However, only a few studies have measured the strength and geographic scope of such externalities and even fewer have done so for firms in very close proximity. In this study, we examine the size and geographic scope of proximity effects among all life science firms that have received Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants in the US over a 23-year period while controlling for relevant regional and firm characteristics. From our empirical analysis, we conclude that proximity effects among nearby small life science firms are strong within one-tenth of a mile distance and are exhausted within a radius of 1.5 miles. By examining the location of all firms in the sample, we offer possible explanations for the narrow geographic scope of the measured proximity effects. We also explain the significance of such findings for academic research that seeks to understand the nature of spatial externalities and for public policy.","[Kolympiris, Christos] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Social Sci Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kalaitzandonakes, Nicholas] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",Wageningen University & Research; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Kalaitzandonakes, N (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 125 A Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",christos.kolympiris@wur.nl; kalaitzandonakesn@missouri.edu,,"Kolympiris, Christos/0000-0003-1933-6332",,,,,94,19,23,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Our results show that the majority of individuals do not make rational tax decisions based on the actual tax burden but rather use simple decision heuristics. This leads to an irrationally high impact of changes in nominal tax rates on the perceived tax burden. Taxpayers favor tax options that apply a lower tax rate on their gross income over a higher tax rate applied on their net income despite the lower actual tax burden of the latter option. This result suggests that politicians could combine increasing fiscal revenues and decreasing subjects' tax perception.

As such, an idealized version of water quality trading is envisioned, where water quality trading and nonpoint cost sharing are treated as complementary policy instruments rather than substitutes. Toward this end, the subgame-perfect equilibrium concept is used to model a multilateral contracting relationship between the regulatory authority and nonpoint sources when the regulator has incomplete information about the nonpoint sources' production costs. We characterize ex ante (or second-best) nonpoint abatement levels when the regulator chooses cost-share rates in concert with a water quality market. Numerical analysis indicates that current EQIP cost-share rates would likely be lower and more flexibly determined in the presence of water quality trading.

We provide both a theoretical model and empirical evidence of this. In particular, we show that the signing of numerous production sharing agreements (PSAs) between the government of Azerbaijan and foreign oil companies in 1994-1998 fueled expectations of higher future incomes, resulting in a considerable appreciation of the RER. Some of these PSAs subsequently failed or ran into difficulties, which led to a downward revision of expected future income and a depreciation of the RER in 1999-2003, even though the current income started to rise, due to an increase in the current oil revenue.

Our method incorporates not only direct liquidity shortages but also indirect liquidity shortages due to the knock-on effects through interbank linkages. We perform a simulation with a simple banking system model and find that a deficit bank can mitigate a liquidity shortage by holding more claims on a surplus bank. Meanwhile, a greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks tends to aggravate the liquidity shortage of a deficit bank. According to comparative analysis between different types of network structures, a core-periphery network with a deficit money center bank gives rise to the highest level of systemic liquidity shortage, and a banking system becomes more vulnerable to liquidity shocks as its interbank network becomes more ill-matched.

We find that firms with higher sensitivity of CEO compensation portfolio value to stock volatility (vega) are more likely to have large increases in R&D investments. More importantly, we find that high-vega firms experience lower abnormal stock returns and lower operating performance compared to their low-vega counterparts following the R&D increases. Our main results hold in a variety of robustness tests.

We consider alliances as a commitment technology that helps a company' Chief Executive Officer overcome agency problems that relate to the inability to ex ante motivate division managers. We show that well-governed firms are more likely to avail themselves of this technology to anticipate ex post commitment problems and resolve them. The role of governance is particularly important when the commitment problems are more acute, such as for significantly risky/long-horizon projects (Iongshots) or firms more prone to inefficient internal redistribution of resources (conglomerates), as well as in the absence of alternative disciplining devices (e.g., low product market competition). Governance also mitigates agency issues between alliance partners; dominant alliance partners agree to a more equal split of power with junior partners that are better governed. An experiment that induces cross-sectional variation in the cost of the alliance commitment technology provides evidence of a causal link between governance and alliances. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We also show that low volatility stocks have higher operating returns and this might explain why low volatility stocks earn higher stock returns. These results provide a partial explanation for the 'low volatility effect' that is independent from the existence of market anomalies or per se inefficiencies that might otherwise drive a low volatility effect.

The main interest in pricing kernels lies in validating the presence of the peaks and their variability in location among curves. Motivated by this observation we investigate the problem of estimating pricing kernels based on the shape invariant model, a semi-parametric approach used for multiple curves with shape-related nonlinear variation. This approach allows us to capture the common features contained in the shape of the functions and at the same time characterize the nonlinear variability with a few interpretable parameters. These parameters provide an informative summary of the curves and can be used to make a further analysis with macroeconomic variables.

Building on Granovetter's idea that weak ties are superior to strong ties for providing support in getting a job, we develop a model in which workers who live far away from jobs choose to have less connections to weak ties. Because of the lack of good public transportation in the US, it is costly (both in terms of time and money) to commute to business centers to meet other types of people who can provide other source of information about jobs. If distant minority workers mainly rely on their strong ties, who are more likely to be unemployed, there is then little chance for them of escaping unemployment. It is therefore the separation in both the social and physical space that prevents ethnic minorities from finding a job. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It tests an entrepreneur-worker matching model in small entrepreneurial firms. The model contemplates the existence of complementarities between workers' and entrepreneur's skills. Using a Portuguese longitudinal matched employer-employee dataset for the period 1995-2003, the empirical analysis provides descriptive results consistent with the matching model: skill stratification-entrepreneurs are more skilled than workers; scale effects-more skilled entrepreneurs run larger firms, though limited by the restriction on firm size; and positive sorting-more skilled entrepreneurs matched with more skilled workers. The estimation of wage regressions shows that the higher the level of education and experience of the entrepreneur, the higher the wage premium for workers. Results suggest that workers' wages reflect the value of the match with entrepreneur's skills. Thus, entrepreneurial skills have an impact not only on job creation, but also on the quality of jobs created.","[Baptista, Rui; Lima, Francisco; Preto, Miguel Torres] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Super Tecn, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Baptista, Rui; Lima, Francisco] CEG IST, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Preto, Miguel Torres] Ctr Innovat Technol & Policy Res, IN, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Lisboa,"Baptista, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Super Tecn, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",rui.baptista@ist.utl.pt,"Baptista, Rui/AFR-8621-2022; Baptista, Rui/B-5851-2009; Preto, Miguel/F-4388-2016; Lima, Francisco/B-7822-2009","Baptista, Rui/0000-0003-3346-4103; Baptista, Rui/0000-0003-3346-4103; Preto, Miguel/0000-0001-9174-538X; Lima, Francisco/0000-0001-6854-5910",,,,,72,15,21,0,75,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Specifically, we address the following questions: (1) Is the magnitude of abnormal returns from the announcements of S&P 500 inclusions significantly lower for stocks with options listings? and (2) Is the magnitude of abnormal returns from the announcements of S&P 500 inclusions significantly lower for stocks with a high level of options trading volume? Our findings indicate that options listings themselves are not related to the magnitude of abnormal returns from the announcements of S&P 500 inclusions. We also find that greater levels of options trading volume do not convey private information about the S&P 500 index changes.

Due to the significantly lower cost of using CIG (relative to hand-collecting data), academics have increasingly relied on this database as a source of management forecasts. However, it is important for researchers to consider the properties of this database (such as coverage, accuracy, and breadth) when evaluating whether it is an appropriate data source for their study. Overall, our results suggest systematic differences between forecasts reported on CIG and forecasts gathered from company press releases. We suggest several sample criteria that will remove or mitigate these biases. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Free riding leads to excess risk production. This problem may be solved, at least partially, either by financial regulation or by taxation. From a normative viewpoint, taxation is superior in many respects. However, reality shows that financial regulation is adopted more frequently. This paper makes a positive, politico-economic argument. If the majority chooses regulation, the level is likely to be too harsh. If it chooses taxation, then the level is likely to be too low. Due to regressive effects, a tax on financial transactions receives low support from a majority of low polluting portfolio owners. The same kind of majority may strategically choose regulation in order to burden the minority with a larger share of the cost of reducing systemic risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is no consensus concerning what constitutes an all-encompassing objective function for the supply planner, who faces what can easily constitute a problem requiring Non-deterministic Polynomial time for determining the solution even in its simplest formulations. The work presented in this article proposes a mathematically grounded approach that uses Ant Colony Optimisation to yield near optimal results across a large set of problem formulations and objective functions. The latter are designed to capture real-world goals such as cost reduction, optimal transportation management, flexibility and minimal lead-time. This study adds a new dimension to topics traditionally encountered in the literature, namely that of the cultural differences between partners engaged in international trade relations. Furthermore, the impact of the lag between determining and implementing the quasi-optimal strategy is forecast for an array of objective functions tailored to represent approaches encountered in international companies dealing with supply challenges in fields such as Information Technology. Finally, the framework thus established is employed to analyse the indirect relationship between Asian white box suppliers and a Romanian firm operating in Mobile Integrated Device space.","[Nicolescu, Luminita; Galalae, Cristina; Voicu, Alexandru] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Nicolescu, L (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",luminicolescu@yahoo.com,"Nicolescu, Luminita/G-9427-2018","Nicolescu, Luminita/0000-0001-8029-9054",,,,,51,6,6,0,16,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2013,15.0,33,,,,,8,26,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,087FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314746900002,0

The key hypothesis is that penalties at the level set for domestic violence crimes reduce recidivism (re-arrest on domestic violence charges or conviction in 2 years following an index arrest). We use state court data for all domestic violence-related arrests. Decisions to commit an act of domestic violence are based on a Bayesian process of updating subjective beliefs. Individuals have prior beliefs about penalties for domestic violence based on actual practice in their areas. An individual's experience with an index arrest leads to belief updating. To address endogeneity of case outcomes, we use an instrumental variables strategy based on decisions of prosecutors and judges assigned to each index arrest in our sample. Contrary to our hypothesis, we find that penalities, at least as set at the current levels, do not deter future arrests and convictions.","[Sloan, Frank A.; Chepke, Lindsey M.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Blevins, Claire E.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Clin Psychol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Platt, Alyssa C.] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Platt, Alyssa C.] Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Duke University; Duke University,"Sloan, FA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",fsloan@duke.edu; Claireblevins0@gmail.com,,"Platt, Alyssa/0000-0001-6396-0170; eldred, lindsey/0000-0002-5785-0423",,,,,70,14,23,0,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

On one hand these entities absorb public money, on the other hand the money should not finish there like in a black hole without any usage. There is a general consensus that culture should be supported and maintained for future generations but fulfilling aims should be valuated and controlled. According literature review there are detected approaches how to evaluate efficiency of non-profit organizations. Not all approaches are directly transferable for cultural entities in the Czech Republic and the second restriction is caused by the data availability. Selected efficiency measures will be calculated for the data sample containing the Czech cultural monuments. The Czech Statistic Office collects the data on an annual basis and therefore we are able to analyse annual data. Data samples are available for years 2009 and 2010.

According to economic theory, there are two opposing effects of unknown magnitude. The scale effect of legalized prostitution leads to an expansion of the prostitution market, increasing human trafficking, while the substitution effect reduces demand for trafficked women as legal prostitutes are favored over trafficked ones. Our empirical analysis for a cross-section of up to 150 countries shows that the scale effect dominates the substitution effect.

The stock market generally reacts favorably to the announcement of an asset revaluation. We examine the motives and characteristics of companies that revalue PP&E and their choice of assets for revaluation. First, we find that Korean companies are more likely to revalue PP&E to improve their financial position or reduce debt contracting costs rather than lessen political costs or signal better future prospects. Second, we report a pecking order in the choice of assets to revalue. Companies prefer land for revaluation to other depreciable assets. When companies select depreciable assets for revaluation, most of them revalue land at the same time suggesting that companies are likely to select depreciable assets for revaluation only after they select land. Third, we posit and find that revaluing companies are more likely to elect depreciable classes of PP&E when they are highly levered, experience equity depletion, and report losses. We also find that revaluing companies are more likely to recognize revaluation decrements in addition to increments when they are large and are revaluing depreciable classes of PP&E.","[Choi, Tae Hee] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Pae, Jinhan; Park, Sunghwa; Song, Younghyo] Korea Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea",KDI School of Public Policy & Management; Korea University,"Pae, J (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea.",jinhanpae@korea.ac.kr,,"Pae, Jinhan/0000-0002-9544-9577",,,,,15,9,11,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1608-1625,,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Product 1 as the monopoly good is produced only by firm A, while vertically differentiated products 2 as the competing goods are produced by both firms A and B. The findings of this paper are as follows: When the bundling firm produces the high-quality competing product, bundling will reduce the consumer surplus while may increase the competitor's profit and social welfare. On the contrary, when the bundling firm produces the low-quality competing good, then bundling has a foreclosure effect, making the market structure turn from a duopoly to a monopoly, hence decreasing the competitor's profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare.

After updating the projections of pension expenditure constructed in de la Fuente and Domenech (2010) for the period 2008-2060, we analyze the impact on this variable of raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 years, extending from 15 to 25 years the period over which wages are averaged to calculate the starting pension and increasing from 35 to 37 the number of contribution years required to obtain a 'full pension.' Conditional on a series of assumptions about the evolution of employment, productivity and demographics, our estimates suggest that these measures will reduce pension expenditure by up to 1.4 percentage points of GDP once the reforms have been fully implemented in 2027, thereby stabilizing pension expenditure at a bit over 9% of GDP during the transition period and preventing the emergence of a structural deficit in the system before the end of the next decade. On the other hand, the existing uncertainty about the future evolution of the relevant variables suggests that it would be desirable to bring forward in time the introduction of the periodic evaluation of the system (the so-called sustainability factor) so as to have in place a mechanism that can be used to modulate the rhythm and scope of the reform if the system's financial situation requires it before the end of the transitional period.","[De la Fuente, Angel] Inst Anal Econ CSIC, Madrid, Spain; [De la Fuente, Angel] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Domenech, Rafael] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Barcelona School of Economics; University of Valencia,"De la Fuente, A (通讯作者)，Inst Anal Econ CSIC, Madrid, Spain.",,"Domenech, Rafael/L-8616-2014","Domenech, Rafael/0000-0001-9902-1060",,,,,41,16,21,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

A key finding of the paper is that the procompetitive and distributional impacts of cooperatives depend critically on the sensitivity of price in the downstream retail market, the nature of the cooperative's governance structure, and the open or closed nature of cooperative membership. The article also provides a discussion of new areas in which an understanding of cooperatives and collective action would be valuable, as well as a discussion of the applicability of the proposed framework to these areas.","[Fulton, Murray] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada; [Giannakas, Konstantinos] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",University of Saskatchewan; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Fulton, M (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada.",Murrray.Fulton@usask.ca; kgiannakas@unl.edu,,"Giannakas, Konstantinos/0000-0002-3628-2869; Fulton, Murray/0000-0002-0351-5531",,,,,93,26,28,4,54,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

In addition, they can help address accountability problems in the implementation of social policies and provide information to policy makers regarding policy design. To function effectively, a system of redress requires a well-designed and inter-linked supply of redress procedures as well as, especially if rights consciousness is not well-developed in a society, a set of organizations that stimulate and aggregate demand for redress. On the supply side, this paper identifies three kinds of redress procedures: administrative venues within government agencies, independent institutions outside government departments, and courts. On the demand side, the key institutions are non-governmental organizations/civil society organizations and the news media, both of which require a receptive political and economic climate to function effectively. Overall, procedures for redressing grievances and complaints regarding basic service delivery are under-developed in many countries, and deserve further analysis, piloting, and support.

We compare the standard mean-variance optimization model with models based on CVaR, CDaR and Omega, for both conservative and aggressive hedge fund investment strategies. In order to implement the CVaR, CDaR and Omega optimization models, we propose a semi-parametric methodology, which is based on extreme value theory, copula and Monte Carlo simulation. We compare the semi-parametric approach with the standard, non-parametric approach, used to compute CVaR, CDaR and Omega, and the benchmark parametric approach, based on both static and dynamic mean-variance optimization. We report two main findings. The first is that the CVaR, CDaR and Omega models offer a significant improvement in terms of risk-adjusted portfolio performance over the parametric mean-variance model. The second is that semi-parametric estimation of the CVaR, CDaR and Omega models offers a very substantial improvement over non-parametric estimation.

Thus, small and medium-sized companies may expand their capital structure with a relatively modern financing instrument which deserves consideration. The high level of professionalization of football clubs raises the question of adequate financing. Due to the credit crises it became more difficult for football clubs to conclude loan agreements. Therefore, professional football clubs were looking for alternative financing instruments, of which one is the so-called fan bond. The aim of the research project is to examine if professional football clubs may learn from the small and medium-sized companies in the field of debt financing, especially debt financing with bonds. The question may also be posed vice versa. May small and medium-sized companies learn from the professional football clubs? Furthermore, what kind of experiences did the small and medium-sized company make with this relatively modern financing instrument?

Under policy coordination, domestic optimal monetary policy rules depend on domestic endogenous variables, foreign inflation, and domestic and foreign policy rates when the zero lower bound is never binding.

Based on the existing literature, there are several possibilities how to render the current set-up of the pension system sustainable. This sustainability is conventionally regarded from the perspective of provision of satisfactory level of retirement pensions as well as from the perspective of general budgetary impact. In this respect, demographic change is accounted for owing to the common perception that it has a lot to do with how the future pension system should and will look like. It has been found out that if appropriate economic policy measures targeting mainly labour market participation rate and long-term unemployment - are adopted, no need for abrupt changes in the existing social security system framework is actually necessary. Also, the linkages between the participation rate and potential output seem to be relatively strong, so that the economy could be easily considered as significantly influenced by its labour market. The functioning of the latter thus seems to be pivotal for the resolution of some long-term economic capacity concerns, including its dynamics.","[Janicko, Martin; Tsharakyan, Ashot] Coll Banking, Banking Inst, CZ-15800 Prague 5, Czech Republic",AMBIS University,"Janicko, M (通讯作者)，Coll Banking, Banking Inst, Narozni 2600-9, CZ-15800 Prague 5, Czech Republic.",martin.janicko@email.cz; ashot_d@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,12,12,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The main goal is the critical reflection of the concept. We consider the Paul Krugman's and Richard Baldwin's remarks regarding the problems associated with using competitiveness as an analytical concept still valid when restrained to the domain of neoclassical economics. Moreover even though the competitiveness is widely accepted as an analytical concept - we believe a number of problems associated with its current use exist (both in theory and in process of policy formations). Mainly, there is confusion between the micro and macro-economic understanding of concept which stems from confusion between individual and national/territorial level of analysis. We also believe that even if new trade theory (increasing returns and strategic trade) is taken into account, it is quite problematic to formulate policy recommendation for structural and industrial policy on its grounds. When the assumptions of neoclassical economics are loosened, the concept of competitiveness might prove valid. Finally we stress than even if this is the case the sensitiveness of the most of recommendations for competitiveness promotion to retaliation and potential damage resulting to international economic regime from its enforcement is rather high.","[Krpec, Oldrich; Hodulak, Vladan] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Krpec, O (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Jostova 10, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic.",okrpec@gmail.com; hodulakv@mail.com,"Krpec, Oldrich/C-6670-2013; Hodulak, Vladan/W-5422-2019","Krpec, Oldrich/0000-0003-4892-7086; Hodulak, Vladan/0000-0002-6988-0048",,,,,44,5,5,2,18,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We develop a theory where firms adopt a net debt target that acts as a balancing variable between equityholders and managers. Negative (positive) net debt occurs in human (physical) capital intensive industries. Negative net debt arises because tradeable claims cannot be issued against transferable human capital. Heterogeneity in capital structure occurs when firms have debt that is not fully collateralized. Physical capital intensive firms take on high leverage but may underlever to avoid bankruptcy costs. This creates excess rents for managers (even if the supply of human capital is competitive) because wealth constraints prevent managers from coinvesting.,"[Lambrecht, Bart M.; Pawlina, Grzegorz] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",Lancaster University,"Lambrecht, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",,,"Pawlina, Grzegorz/0000-0002-6664-5616",,,,,51,11,13,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

In general, for the normal period (pre and post-crisis), symmetric GARCH model perform better than the asymmetric GARCH but for fluctuation period (crisis period), asymmetric GARCH model is preferred.

This paper develops a variant of Hotelling's model involving an intermediate goods market in order to explore the location choices of firms. We consider interactions among three firms: a wholesale supplier of an essential input and two retail producers. One of these retailers is a vertically integrated firm. The other is an independent downstream firm. Within this framework, this paper will discuss the role of strategic vertical outsourcing in determining optimal locations for firms, and it will also explore the input pricing of wholesale suppliers. In general, the two firms were located more closely when the vertically integrated firm had a cost advantage without taking strategic outsourcing into consideration. However, the price of the input may increase when we take strategic vertical outsourcing into account in the model, and this may cause the two firms to move farther away, giving rise to the Principle of Minimum Differentiation.

Downgrades are more likely to occur if the analyst's investment bank has no underwriting relationship with the seasoned firm. From 1997 to 2001, I find some evidence supporting the hypothesis of strength of analyst coverage: downgrades by analysts affiliated with the IPO lead manager were negatively associated with the IPO's price performance after the offering day. Analysts were likely to downgrade a seasoned stock prior to promoting a cold IPO, underwritten by their investment bank. Since 2002, when new rules on analyst independence were adopted, downgrades of seasoned stocks have become unrelated to the price performance of IPOs.","[Mola, Simona] US Secur & Exchange Commiss, Washington, DC USA",U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC),"Mola, S (通讯作者)，US Secur & Exchange Commiss, Div Risk Strategy & Financial Innovat, Washington, DC USA.",molayosts@sec.gov,,,,,,,29,0,0,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

New business model establishment is always risky procedure with quite uncertain consequences. In managerial practice there exist critical situations where pushing through new business may become a superior tool for competitive advantage generation. No doubt that telecommunication services are believed to contain hidden business potential which can be unleashed as soon as legislation barriers are lifted. Such a situation is expected to come into effect in a moment when the government resumes a tender for additional telecommunication operator. It is mandatory for the winner of the tender to enable so called virtual telecommunication operators to enter the telecommunication market and reinforce competitiveness of this market. Many a newcomer considers entering this market but it is far from easy to develop functioning business model which would assure sustainable competitive advantage and continuous growth. This paper made a point to propose normative model of virtual operator foundation which would be almost generally applicable by any potential newcomer to budding virtual telecommunication market.,"[Spacek, Miroslav] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Stepan, Marek] Generalni Financni Feditelstvi, Prague 11000, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spacek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",miroslav.spacek@vse.cz; mar.stepan@gmail.com,"yongquan, hu/G-7450-2011; Špaček, Miroslav/K-6516-2015","Špaček, Miroslav/0000-0001-6042-3249",IGA 2 subsidy at University of Economics in Prague,IGA 2 subsidy at University of Economics in Prague,This paper was elaborated with the support of IGA 2 subsidy at University of Economics in Prague.,,12,3,3,1,8,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1400,1410,,,,,,11,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100141,0

The density of these activities in a limited and geographically defined spatial coastal zone, poses significant challenges and pressures on the marine environment, as most of the activities and services are closely interrelated to marine ecosystems. The international community is developing and implementing important measures for the sustainable development of coastal communities, including the creation of marine protected area (MPA) networks. This approach is an ecosystem-based approach targeted at the management of human activities in order to sustain biodiversity and at the same time support viable economic activities essential for the sustainable development of these areas. This paper contributes to the knowledge and best practice examples pertinent to the creation and development of marine protected areas (MPAs) in Europe and the Mediterranean, analyzing ways in which this important and successful tool can be introduced and applied further in the Black Sea. The creation of MPAs is closely associated to studies mainly focusing on scientific observations of the marine environment, participation and direct involvement of stakeholders, as well as evaluating the socioeconomic impacts on coastal communities. Economic benefits of MPAs include job creation in novel areas such as environmental services and products, including non-consumptive activities such as tourism and recreation. The economic value of biological resources is difficult to express in monetary terms, whereas others such as the direct financial benefit to local economies from recreational and other activities centered on MPAs, are easier to calculate. The paper utilizes the basic methods for valuation of environmental goods and services, based on direct costs, capital costs and operating costs, such as labour costs for monitoring and protecting the area. Also indirect costs, mainly through the assessment of potential damages to fishermen who may be harmed by fishing bans, are addressed. The paper finally discusses the interactions between the complex biological, social, economic and institutional factors and proposes a generic model for attaining significant socioeconomic benefits associated with sustainable development of coastal zone areas in the Black Sea.","[Todorut, Amalia Venera] Constantin Brancusi Univ Targu Jiu, Targu Jiu, Romania; [Tselentis, Vassilis] Univ Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece",Constantin Brancusi University; University of Piraeus,,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,24,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-05-6,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2013,,,,,,,193,199,,,,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC0BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348880400026,0

In particular, the extent of portfolio rebalancing and consumption smoothing are influenced by the presence of non-convex portfolio adjustment costs. Suppose bonds can be adjusted costlessly while adjustments to stock accounts entail adjustment costs. Due to these portfolio adjustment costs, the household demands both stocks and bonds. A household can buffer some income fluctuations without incurring adjustment costs and engage in costly portfolio rebalancing less frequently. Using the estimated preference parameters and portfolio adjustment costs, the response to income and return shocks is nonlinear and reflects the interaction of portfolio rebalancing and consumption smoothing.

It employs (individual) voting records of the Monetary Council of the Hungarian National Bank and of the Monetary Policy Council of the National Bank of Poland. Preference heterogeneity in committees is not directly observable. Therefore, we pursue an indirect measurement and conduct an econometric analysis based on (pooled) Taylor-type reaction functions estimated using real-time information on economic and financial indicators and voting records. Recent evidence for the monetary policy committees of advanced economies (see Besley et al., 2008 and Jung, 2011) suggests preference heterogeneity among its members is systematic. Unlike for monetary policy committees of advanced countries, the present paper finds preference heterogeneity to be random for both the members of the Monetary Policy Council of the National Bank of Poland (NBP), and the members of the Monetary Council of the Hungarian central bank (MNB). But, similar to the committees of advanced economies, the diversity of views on the inflation forecast is measurable in both committees. A separate cluster analysis shows that different preferences of MPC members may be attributable to their status (chairman, internal member, external member) and that members may also differ in their desired response to changes in the economic outlook.

In 2008, the EU established the 20/20/20 vision, demanding that carbon emissions and energy consumption both be reduced by 20%, and that the production of Green Energy be further increased in order to account for 20 percent of total energy production by 2020. Regarding the reduction of emissions, a cap-and-trade system (Brown Certificates) was implemented. for the fostering of so called renewable, i.e. Green, energy different nations chose different measures, such as direct subsidies, feed-in-tariffs (e.g. Germany), or Green Certificate markets based on a quota system (e.g. Denmark). Recently, a market-based instrument (White Certificates) intended to improve efficiency of non-commercial energy consumption is also on the agenda of several European nations (demand side management). All of these instruments are directed towards the energy market. Therefore, this paper deals with identifying interdependencies and trade-offs that might occur, if both, supply and demand side, of a single market are regulated by different policy measures. Our results show that, in fact, significant interdependencies and trade-offs exist. In our model, a feed-in tariff in combination with an emission cap or tax renders the most favorable results-in the absence of demand side management.","[Meran, Georg; Wittmann, Nadine] Berlin Univ Technol, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Wittmann, N (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol, Str 17 Juni 135,H50, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",gmeran@mailbox.tu-berlin.de; nadine.wittmann@tu-berlin.de,,,,,,,25,13,15,2,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find that in the immediate aftermath of a disinflation policy, the economy enters in a persistent recession. The inflation rate increases above its long-run level and exhibits a positive hump-shaped response. A similar pattern is found for the nominal interest rate, which responds even more strongly in the short-run.

The equations are estimated using data for 52 countries, from 2003 to 2009. Results suggest ODA for FIIV/AIDS is not fungible across the 52 countries.

Sovereign ratings and outlooks tend to be positively related to regional stock market co-movements suggesting that there are positive rating spillover effects whereby upgrades provide common benefits for neighboring countries in the region, however downgrades would lead to investors shifting funds from the downgraded market into the surrounding region. In contrast, sovereign rating and outlooks tend to be negatively related to regional bond market co-movements suggesting the existence of contagion during periods of ratings and outlook downgrades (negative rating spillover effects).

Decomposing BEIME into risks of operating leverage and financial leverage according to Penman et al.

In this paper, we study whether, and to what extent, the miscalibration (largely, overconfidence) of the unskilled can be reduced by feedback. We report the results of two studies, one in a natural setting and one in a more controlled setting, where participants make incentivized judgments of their absolute and relative performance in various tasks and feedback conditions. In the first study, participants improve their calibration after being exposed to naturally available information in the form of environmental feedback (i.e., feedback about the nature of the task) and calibration feedback (i.e., feedback about one's absolute and relative performance), but it is impossible to separate the effects of the two types of feedback. In the more controlled setting of the second study, we identified a positive effect of calibration feedback alone. In both studies, it is the unskilled who improve their calibration most. Our results suggest that the unskilled may not be doomed to be especially unaware. We also identify an important difference between the effects of feedback on the calibration of absolute and relative performance judgments. While the calibration of absolute performance judgments is more uniformly amenable to feedback, there appears to be a residual miscalibration of relative performance judgments by the unskilled that we attribute to differences in information acquisition and self-image.

Consistent with findings from prior research on developed countries, size and age have a negative impact on firm growth in the majority of specifications. Enterprises managed by women have lower expected growth rates. Proprietary firms face lower growth on the whole, especially if they are young firms. Exporting has a positive effect on firm growth, especially for young firms and for female-owned firms.

Making use of data on the evolution of central bank independence over time and controlling for possible nonlinearities, we employ interaction models to identify the conditions under which more central bank independence will enhance a country's inflation performance. Examining a cross-section of up to 69 countries, we are able to show that granting a central bank more autonomy does not necessarily lead to better inflation performance. To lower inflation by increasing independence, two conditions must be fulfilled: (1) The change in independence must be sufficiently large, and (2) the quality of the political institutions must be sufficiently high.

Specifically, we explicitly incorporate arbitrary trade costs in both differentiated-good and homogeneous-good sectors into a two-country model, and clarify the effects of trade-barrier reduction in each sector. We show that their impacts on welfare levels in the two countries are different, and, if an industry is liberalized while the other is protected, a conflict between the countries might occur.

The context for the analysis is Spain's Primera Liga and the Union of European Football Association (UEFA) Champions League. We find that the award of sanctions by Spanish referees in the Champions League are not significantly different to those of the referees from other countries and as such are subject to the same sources of bias. In Primera Liga matches where the crowd is separated from the pitch by running tracks, we find that the probability of the award of a yellow card to the home team is higher and that of the away team is lower compared to matches played at stadia without running tracks. Similar results are found in the Champions League, where efforts are made to hire neutral referees. Referee behavior is also influenced by the size of the crowd in attendance.

We explore the long-run implications of public financing policies aimed at short-run stabilization when: (i) agents are sensitive to model uncertainty, as in Hansen and Sargent (2007), and (ii) growth is endogenous, as in Romer (1990). We find that countercyclical deficit policies promoting short-run stabilization reduce the price of model uncertainty at the cost of significantly increasing the amount of long-run risk.

Our evidence suggests that the noise in the data is not an issue. We also show that parameter differences for mixed samples, which contain information on different seasons, are too small to distort statistical analysis. This is so because parameter estimates converge to some values (but not necessarily to the true values) for high frequencies or as the sample size becomes large. Our evidence suggests a possibility that the CAPM may hold empirically if seasonality in the parameters of the population model are taken into consideration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In order to avoid regulatory penalties due to an excessive number of Value-at-Risk (VaR) violations, capital requirements are minimized subject to a given number of violations over the previous trading year. Capital requirements are based on the recent Basel II amendments to account for the 'stressed' VaR, that is, the downside risk of the portfolio under extreme adverse market conditions. An empirical application for two portfolios involving different types of assets and alternative stress scenarios demonstrates that the proposed approach delivers an improved balance between capital requirement levels and the number of VaR exceedances. Furthermore, the risk-adjusted performance of the proposed approach is superior to that of minimum-VaR and minimum-stressed VaR portfolios. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The Canadian Temporary Foreign Worker Program was thus expanded and conditions to access it made easier. During the same period, the pattern of regional disparities in unemployment rates became more persistent. This paper shows that some of the persistence is due to the increased availability of temporary foreign workers.

In deciding whether to roll over his debt, each maturing creditor is concerned about the rollover decisions of other creditors whose debt matures during his next contract period. We derive a unique threshold equilibrium and characterize the roles of fundamental volatility, credit lines, and debt maturity in driving runs. In particular, we show that when fundamental volatility is sufficiently high, commonly used measures such as temporarily keeping the firm alive under runs and increasing debt maturity can exacerbate rather than mitigate runs.","[Xiong, Wei] Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [He, Zhiguo] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Xiong, Wei] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Princeton University; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Xiong, W (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, 26 Prospect Ave, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",wxiong@princeton.edu,"Xiong, Wei/AAD-9426-2022",,,,,,46,135,158,1,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Rather less attention has been paid, however, to England's comparative position at different points of the achievement distribution. Is the test score gap particularly big between the most able children from advantaged and disadvantaged homes, or are differences particularly pronounced between low achievers? This issue is investigated using the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 data set. The association between family background and high achievement is found to be stronger in England than in most other developed countries, and there is little evidence that this has changed over time.

This paper offers an explanation by using a simple two-sector AK growth model with intersectoral linkages and high relative prices of intermediate goods. Intersectoral linkages lead to two balanced growth paths (BGPs). The high-growth BGP is a source. The low-growth BGP is a sink because it has a small final goods sector, small intersectoral spillovers from the final goods sector to the intermediate goods sector, and small marginal products in the intermediate goods sector, yielding high relative prices of intermediate goods. The low-growth BGP is an attractor and thus development trap. To produce a big push effect, this paper analyzes the first-best policy and finds that a subsidy to own consumption and a provision of public goods to the final goods sector can internalize the external effect and render the low-growth BGP infeasible. As a result, there is only the high-growth BGP.","[Chen, Been-Lon] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Lee, Shun-Fa] Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Tamkang University,"Chen, BL (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, 128 Acad Rd,Sect 2, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",bchen@econ.sinica.edu.tw; alphalee@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We document substantial return predictability from the set of easy-to-analyze firms to their more complicated peers. Specifically, a simple portfolio strategy that takes advantage of this straightforward vs. complicated information processing classification yields returns of 118 basis points per month before transaction costs. Consistent with processing complexity driving the return relation, we further show that the more complicated the firm, the more pronounced the return predictability. In addition, we find that sell-side analysts are subject to these same information processing constraints, as their forecast revisions of easy-to-analyze firms predict their future revisions of more complicated firms.

Using formal cojumping tests this paper considers the cojumping behavior of spot and futures prices in high frequency US Treasury data. Cojumping occurs most frequently at shorter maturities and higher sampling frequencies. We find that the probability of cojumping is altered by the presence of an anticipated macroeconomic news announcement. The probability of cojumping is particularly affected by news surprises in non-farm payrolls, CPI, GDP and retail sales. However, the two cojumping tests are also more likely to provide contradictory results in the presence of surprises in non-farm payrolls. On these occasions the market does not clearly signal its short term pricing behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, however, this theory has lost its importance in development literature. Based on a household-level survey from rural Pakistan, this paper seeks to re-introduce the importance of interlinkages by illustrating their exploitative potential, particularly in unequal isolated villages where landlords are essentially monopolist/monopsonist. The solution proposed is to break isolation. Making use of an exogenous shock found in the construction of a motorway, the study finds that while connectivity does not break interlinkages completely, it does significantly reduce their exploitative nature.

Instead of an unproblematic inclusion of fishers' movements into the general rubric of transnational agrarian movements, I argue that considering differences between agriculture and fishing, and within fishing, allows a better explanation of the potential and limits of solidarity within the transnational network of fishers movements.

I also estimate the out-of-pocket educational expenses and foregone earnings of for-profit students. I find that for-profit, two-year colleges cost taxpayers roughly $7,600 per year for a full-time equivalent student. Students bear most of the cost of their education, in the form of foregone earnings, tuition, and loan interest amounting to $51,600 per year 1 contrast these costs with similar estimates for public community colleges, including the direct subsidization of the sector by state and local taxpayers. I find that community colleges cost taxpayers more than for-profits - about $11,400 per year - but students incur costs of only about $32,200 per year of attendance.

The approach relies on an optimization argument, requiring that the weighted sum of measures for the deviations of the business unit's losses from their respective allocated capitals be minimized. The approach is fair insofar as it requires capital to be close to the risk that necessitates holding it. The approach is additionally very flexible in the sense that different forms of the objective function can reflect alternative definitions of corporate risk tolerance. Owing to this flexibility, the general framework reproduces several capital allocation methods that appear in the literature and allows for alternative interpretations and possible extensions.","[Dhaene, Jan] Katholieke Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Louvain, Belgium; [Tsanakas, Andreas] City Univ, Cass Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Valdez, Emiliano A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Math, Storrs, CT USA; [Vanduffel, Steven] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Econ & Polit Sci, Brussels, Belgium",KU Leuven; Bangor University; City University London; University of Connecticut; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Dhaene, J (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Louvain, Belgium.",jan.dhaene@econ.kuleuven.be,"Dhaene, Jan/I-9656-2019; Vanduffel, Steven/K-6709-2012; Dhaene, Jan/K-6178-2012","Vanduffel, Steven/0000-0003-0511-1044; Dhaene, Jan/0000-0003-4314-8809",,,,,39,115,123,3,36,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We apply a simple and easy-to-use analytical bias formula instead of bootstrap or Monte Carlo bias-adjustment. Regarding return predictability we show that bias-adjustment in the multivariate setup can yield very different results than in the univariate case. Furthermore, bias-correcting the VAR parameters has both quantitatively and qualitatively important effects on the optimal portfolio choice. For intermediate values of risk-aversion, the intertemporal hedging demand for bonds and stocks is heavily affected by the bias-correction. Utility calculations also show large effects of bias-adjustment, both in-sample and out-of-sample. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper compares three survey-based methods for measuring organizational networks: the roster, the free-recall name generator, and a hybrid name generator that combines these two classic approaches. Results indicate that the roster and free-recall name generator methods both suffer from important limitations. The roster method tends to measure many linkages among a limited set of network actors, whereas the name generator tends to measure fewer linkages among a larger set of network actors. Using survey data on policy networks within California regional planning processes (N = 752), we find that the hybrid method strikes an effective balance between these techniques. The hybrid approach performs well in terms of identifying a large number of network actors and interconnections between them. Although no survey-based measurement technique is perfect, this study suggests that the hybrid name generator is an excellent alternative for the measurement of complex networks with large or shifting boundaries that encompass a diverse set of actors.","[Henry, Adam Douglas] Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [McCoy, Michael] Univ Calif Davis, Urban Land Use & Transportat Planning Ctr, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Arizona; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Henry, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, 315 Social Sci Bldg, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,"Lubell, Mark/H-5018-2012","Lubell, Mark/0000-0001-5757-7116",,,,,42,34,43,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

This paper conceptualizes devolution as a three-stage process and uses a simulation model calibrated to real-world conditions to analyze devolution in Spain's Upper Guadiana Basin. The Spanish national government has proposed spending over a billion euros to reverse a 30 year decline in groundwater levels. We investigate how the government can most effectively allocate this money to improve water levels by utilizing its power to set the structure of a local negotiation process. Using a numerical Nash model of local bargaining, we find that if the national government creates appropriate incentives, local bargaining can produce water stabilization. The actual water levels that will emerge are highly dependent on the central government's decisions about the budget available to local stakeholders and the default policy, which will be influenced by the relative value the government places on various financial and environmental outcomes. Our paper concludes by determining the relationship between these relative valuations and the government's preferences over water levels.","[Sayre, Susan Stratton] Smith Coll, Dept Econ, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Marchiori, Carmen] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Environm Econ & Policy, London, England; [Simon, Leo K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Smith College; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Sayre, SS (通讯作者)，Smith Coll, Dept Econ, Seelye 305, Northampton, MA 01063 USA.",ssayre@smith.edu,,"Sayre, Susan/0000-0003-4755-8362; MARCHIORI, Carmen/0000-0001-6793-0278",ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,24,5,5,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In this paper, differences in spending on education are examined empirically, both at the household and individual levels. Results are mixed, though the balance of evidence weighs toward pro-male bias in spending on education at the household level.

Evidence from American Time Use Data,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY; UNITED-STATES; OBESITY; ADULTS; OVERWEIGHT; ADOLESCENTS; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN,"Obesity is epidemic in the United States, and there is an imperative need to identify policy tools that may help fight this epidemic. A recent paper in the economics literature finds an inverse relationship between gasoline prices and obesity risksuggesting that increased gasoline prices via higher gasoline taxes may have the effect of reducing obesity prevalence. This study builds upon that paper. It utilizes cross-sectional time series data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) over 20032008, utilizes the increases that occurred in gasoline prices in this period due to Hurricane Katrina and to the global spike in gasoline prices as a natural experiment, and explores how time spent by Americans on different forms of physical activity is associated with gasoline price levels. Economic theory suggests that higher gasoline prices may alter individual behavior both via a substitution effect whereby people seek alternatives to motorized transportation, and an income effect whereby the effect of higher gasoline prices on the disposable family budget leads people to make various adjustments to what they spend money on. The latter may lead to some increase in physical activity (for example, doing one's own yard work instead of hiring help), but may also lead to decreases in other physical activities that involve expenses, such as team sports or workouts at the gym. Thus, ultimately, the relationship between gasoline prices and physical activity must be empirically determined. Results from multivariate regression models with state and time fixed effects indicate that higher gasoline prices are associated with an overall increase of physical activity that is at least moderately energy intensive. The increases are most pronounced in periods where gasoline prices fluctuate more sharply and unexpectedly. These results appear robust to a number of model specifications. One of the major components of this increase appears to be an increase in housework that is at least moderately energy intensivesuch as interior and exterior cleaning, garden, and yard work. This tentatively suggests that there is an income effect of higher gasoline prices, or a possible increase in prices of such services when gasoline prices increase. However, the increases in physical activity associated with increased gasoline prices are weaker among minorities and low socioeconomic status (SES) individuals. Hence, while a policy that increases gasoline prices via raised gasoline taxes may have benefits in terms of increasing overall physical activity levels in the United States, these benefits may not accrue to low SES individuals to the same extent as to their higher SES counterparts. This suggests that if increasing physical activity is the primary goal, then it may be more efficient to use a tax that can exert an income effect on mid-to-high SES households, such as a targeted income tax. On the other hand, if gasoline taxes are imposed to address other negative externalities of gasoline use, then these taxes may have the added benefit of increasing physical activity at least among some segments of U.S. society.","Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Healthcare Org & Policy, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Sen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Healthcare Org & Policy, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",,,,,,,,44,15,15,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

It is shown that there may arise cases where naives needlessly put effort on projects they never complete. Moreover, in endogenous total cost projects, the naive types always end up completing projects of lesser quality than originally intended. By introducing a bonus motive, it is shown that agents with higher self-control problems should be given a higher bonus to prevent inefficient procrastination. I, then, characterize the behavior of partially naives who potentially learn self-preferences. It is found that without learning self-preferences, partial naives behave either like sophisticates or naives depending on the level of naivete; with learning, if the learning pace is fast enough, procrastination until the deadline does not occur.

J,"Phan, D",,,,Diep Phan,,,Migration and Credit Constraints: Theory and Evidence from Vietnam,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SEASONAL MIGRATION; REMITTANCES; INVESTMENT; INEQUALITY,"The new economics of labor migration (NELM) frequently emphasizes the importance of migration as a way for rural households to overcome credit constraints. If this hypothesis is correct, then the credit constraint is a motivation for migration (a relaxation of this constraint would encourage less migration). Conventionally, it is believed that migration is costly and has to be financed with borrowed capital, so the credit constraint is a deterrent of migration (a relaxation of this constraint would encourage more migration). In this paper, an agricultural household model is developed to study whether the credit constraint is a motivation for or a deterrent to migration. The model's result confirms the NELM's hypothesis: for households with high demand for agricultural investments and high net migration return, migration is used as a way to finance capital investments. Using data from four provinces in Vietnam, preliminary evidence is found supporting this hypothesis.","Beloit Coll, Beloit, WI 53511 USA",Beloit College,"Phan, D (通讯作者)，Beloit Coll, 700 Coll St, Beloit, WI 53511 USA.",phand@beloit.edu,,,,,,,26,8,10,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The usual route to behaviour change in economics and psychology has been to attempt to 'change minds' by influencing the way people think through information and incentives. There is, however, increasing evidence to suggest that 'changing contexts' by influencing the environments within which people act (in largely automatic ways) can have important effects on behaviour. We present a mnemonic, MINDSPACE, which gathers up the nine most robust effects that influence our behaviour in mostly automatic (rather than deliberate) ways. This framework is being used by policymakers as an accessible summary of the academic literature. To motivate further research and academic scrutiny, we provide some evidence of the effects in action and highlight some of the significant gaps in our knowledge. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, my econometric analysis shows that a subjective debt burden is not only influenced by the current constellation of income, debt service and, possibly, the potential subsistence level. Expectations of the personal economic situation and several non-financial factors affect debt perception as well. Women report significantly higher subjective debt burdens. Unemployment is also associated with drastically higher self-assessed debt burdens even when controlling for the current financial situation and for expectations. Some differences in the subjective perception of objective debt burdens can be attributed to personality traits (such as locus of control) and life satisfaction. I draw the following conclusions: First, self-assessed debt burdens contain information beyond the current economic situation, e.g., expectations of future incomes. Second, relying on subjective debt statements can lead to biased results for policy analysis if the researcher does not account for non-financial factors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Most yield functions used in economics and ecology rely on convexity properties of species growth functions, but convexity is shown here to depend on whether realistic biology is incorporated. Optimizing behavior by individual organisms is connected with species population dynamics in order to derive growth functions in a general equilibrium ecosystem model. Non convexities are shown to be an inherent property of the growth functions owing to familiar biological processes including predator-prey and competitive relations, predator satiation and prey substitution. The growth functions generate yield functions that are problematic for management, because they exhibit kinked average revenue curves, discontinuous marginal revenue curves, and knife edge optimum effort levels where a small increase above the optimum effort can rapidly deplete the stock. These phenomena can be explained entirely by the underlying biological processes.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Tschirhart, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave,3985, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",jtsch@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,64,14,17,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This article, however, refutes the claim. In today's competitive world, having expertise, knowledge and marketing experience for financial market activities, especially brokerage firms has proven inevitable. This should be accompanied by performing marketing operations along with intermediary roles and carrying on the daily transactions of shares in the Tehran stock exchange market. The current study attempts to investigate the level of marketing knowledge used in the stock exchange market, to identify the reasons behind deficient use of the marketing knowledge by the financial institutions (financial intermediaries, brokerage firms and etc) and finally to improve the investment in Tehran stock exchange market. The method used is survey-based and the statistical population has been drawn from among the financial institutions active in Tehran stock exchange and the regional branches of the country. The results obtained from the research display that, during the period reviewed, the active marketing system in the brokerage firms was the traditional system without attending to the modern criteria of financial service marketing in the areas relating to communication and determination of the shares prices, services of conduct transactions of the financial analyses and encouraging the big companies to enter the Tehran Stock Exchange., (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The economy of the Slovak Republic is based on small and medium-sized enterprises SME. The role played by SME is irreplaceable, especially in the areas of job creation, balancing regional development and the introduction of innovations into standard business practice. However, long-term problems of small and medium enterprises are not addressed (corruption, lack of law enforcement, bureaucracy, large regional disparities, lack of support for emerging businesses.

The small companies cannot compare themselves with the big companies, as the big ones can upgrade their technologies and processes at lower prices, without time consuming and with available financials to change the direction when the actions taken deviate from what was planned. That is why small companies suffer from disadvantages on the market. To overcome these situations and start competing, especially these days, small companies must incorporate creativeness in their way of thinking and acting. It is mandatory for small companies to design the daily activities performed based on new technology, historical data, updated know-how etc., mostly because technology is more and more present, products have less life days, or the global trend is heading to globalization and integration. In this paper a small ice cream store will be analyzed.

The model enables us to distinguish between regimes without extreme dependence, and ones with tail dependence which can be of asymmetric type.

The empirical results confirm that SMEs represent a source of employment and income, but their labour productivity is more reduced compared to large enterprises.

The problems with the banks stem from the irresponsible, reckless and possible illegal behaviour of some financial institutions in some countries, rather than all financial institutions in all countries. These banks need to focus more on their core activity of channelling funds to sound business opportunities. But there has been a failure of regulation too. In several countries the financial systems were deregulated in the 1990s and both the EU and particular governments were unwilling to return to regulation once the system got out of control. There has also been a readiness to financially reward under-achievement by senior management in both the public and private spheres. To succeed the capitalist system depends upon rewarding success and only success. That has not been happening. The result is crisis and perhaps the only reason Europe has not collapsed to a situation comparable with the 1930s is the use of quantitative easing. But that is not a cure and may well simply be building up still bigger problems for tomorrow. These then are the symptoms, albeit deeply serious symptoms, of a continent in crisis. But underlying these symptoms are still more fundamental problems. Christine Lagarde recently implied that its 'payback time for the Greeks, who had to start paying their taxes. She could equally have applied this to Europe as a whole. The failure to pay taxes, and associated corruption, are two of the underlying problems. The failure to produce products the world wants to buy is another one. The Scandinavian countries stand out as having emphasised innovation as central to the economy and having relatively low public sector deficits. But in general the EU, and its member countries, have, despite the rhetoric, not prioritised innovation, have tolerated high levels of tax evasion and avoidance and turned a blind eye to incompetence and corruption. In this paper we look at all of these issues and how they have contributed to the crisis and what must be done if we are to emerge successfully out of that crisis into a new era of prosperity. We also examine current and likely trends towards greater fiscal and monetary union and regulation, particularly financial regulation, within the Eurozone and the EU, and the reality of a twin speed (or rather multi-speed) Europe emerging.","[Hudson, John] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Orviska, Marta] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Slovak 97590, Czech Republic",University of Bath,,j.r.hudson@bath.ac.uk; marta.orviska@umb.sk,"Orviska, Marta/U-5000-2019",,,,,,8,0,0,1,10,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3527-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,53,+,,,,,,2,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEZ44,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318886500005,0

The estimated differentials attributed to the boom-induced labor demand shocks show significant direct and indirect impacts on the earnings and employment within the energy extraction and other non-energy local sectors respectively. The local job multipliers indicate that job creation within the energy extraction sector leads to modest job creation within the non-energy local sectors during boom periods. For every ten energy extraction jobs created during a boom period, approximately three construction jobs, two retail jobs, and four and a half service jobs are created. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

(Elbers, C., Lanjouw, J. and Lanjouw, P. (2003) Micro-level estimation of poverty and inequality. Econometrica, 71(1), pp. 355364) combines a household survey and a census to generate a disaggregated map of poverty measures. Since censuses are often conducted every 10 years, construction of poverty maps on a regular basis is not straightforward. This article discusses methods to update poverty maps for years between censuses by combining an old census and new household surveys. These discussed methods are illustrated by producing a poverty map in Vietnam for the years 2004 and 2006 using the 1999 Population and Housing Census and Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys in 2002, 2004 and 2006. The validation of the updating methods is examined by comparing poverty estimates in 2006 obtained from the updating methods with benchmark poverty estimates obtained from the standard small area estimation method using data from the 2006 Vietnam Household Living and the 2006 Rural Agriculture and Fishery Census.","[Nguyen Viet Cuong] Wageningen Univ, Mansholt Grad Sch, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Nguyen Viet Cuong] Natl Econ Univ, Fac Trade & Int Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam",Wageningen University & Research; National Economics University - Vietnam,"Cuong, NV (通讯作者)，Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",cnguyenviet@yahoo.com,,,,,,,13,7,7,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

One is the focus on village studies at the expense of nationally representative surveys. Another is insufficient appreciation of the technical limits of the new rice technology. The third is a misleading model of agrarian change. The inability of village studies to validate generalisations, the reluctance to abandon the historical model of de-peasantisation, and opposing beliefs about how to evaluate socio-economic consequences created a Rashomon Effect that made the controversy hard to resolve.","Int Crops Res Ctr Semiarid Trop ICRISAT, Nairobi, Kenya",CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Orr, A (通讯作者)，Int Crops Res Ctr Semiarid Trop ICRISAT, POB 39063, Nairobi, Kenya.",a.orr@cgiar.org,,,,,,,134,14,17,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

Along with a self-reported financial anxiety questionnaire, a modified Emotional Stroop Test (EST) and Dot-Probe Paradigm (DPP) were separately utilized to evaluate financial anxiety. In both studies, the self-reported financial anxiety questionnaire correlated significantly with the implicit measures. Furthermore, the DPP was predominantly characterized by avoidance of financial information. Financial anxiety was shown to be a separate construct from depression and general anxiety. These findings indicate that those who report having financial anxiety also display reaction latencies in the processing of financial information.

First, VC syndication creates product market value for their portfolio firms. Specifically, VC syndicates invest significant amounts in younger firms, in earlier financing rounds, and in early stage firms. Further, VC syndicates nurture innovation of their portfolio firms and help them achieve better post-initial public offering operating performance.

Specifically, VC syndicate-backed firms are more likely to have a successful exit, enjoy a lower initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, and receive a higher IPO market valuation.

Data from 244 questionnaires from 36 family farms were collected and analysed. Three factors with eigen-values greater than one were extracted, explaining 63.56% of the variance, describing the theoretical dimensions of the dependent variable family harmony and the independent variables existence of family forums and conflict management. The impact of the existence of family forums and conflict management on family harmony was examined by means of multiple linear regression analysis. The results indicate that a significant proportion of the variation in family harmony among family members in family farms is explained by the existence of family forums and the management of conflict among family members. The findings thus indicate that family harmony among family members in the participating family farms is related to the existence of family forums and conflict management. Practical recommendations are made to improve family relationships in family farming businesses.","North West Univ, Potchefstroom Business Sch, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"van der Merwe, SP (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Potchefstroom Business Sch, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",stephan.vandermerwe@nwu.ac.za,,"Van der Merwe, Stephan/0000-0001-8361-5139",,,,,55,0,0,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2012,51.0,3,,,,,78,96,,10.1080/03031853.2012.749569,0.0,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,081XC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314354700004,0

Executive pay restrictions were often a rationale cited for early TARP exit, and high levels of CEO pay in 2008 were associated with banks being significantly more likely to escape TARP. In addition, we find that larger publicly traded banks with better accounting performance, the stronger capital ratios, and fewer troubled loans and other assets exited early. Banks that raised private capital in 2009 were significantly more likely to return the taxpayers' money early. The original eight TARP recipients, which received $165 billion of the $245 billion passed out, had weak tangible common equity ratios at the end of 2008, relative to other TARP recipients. Those eight banks raised common equity capital in 2009, and all at least partially exited the government's embrace. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An adoption model with profitability and risk considerations distinguishes between the two margins, where the intensive margin results from direct 'gene' impacts and higher complimentary input use, and the extensive margin reflects the growing range of lands that become profitable with the GE technology. We identify yield increases from cross-country time series variation in GE adoption share within the main GE crops - cotton, corn and soybeans. We find that GE increased yields 34 per cent for cotton, 12 per cent for corn and 3 per cent for soybeans. We then estimate the quantity of extensive margin lands from year-to-year changes in traditional and GE planted area. If all production on the extensive margin is attributed to GE technology, the supply effect of GE increases from 5 per cent to 12 per cent for corn, 15 per cent to 20 per cent for cotton, and 2 per cent to 40 per cent for soybeans, generating significant downward pressure on prices. Finally, we compute 'saved' lands and greenhouse gases as the difference between observed hectarage per crop and counterfactual hectarage needed to generate the same output without the yield boost from GE. We find that altogether, GE saved 13 million hectares of land from conversion to agriculture in 2010, and averted emissions are equivalent to roughly one-eighth of the annual emissions from automobiles in the US.","[Barrows, Geoffrey] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sexton, Steven] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Zilberman, David] Univ Calif, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; North Carolina State University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Barrows, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",geoffrey.barrows@gmail.com; steven.sexton@ncsu.edu; zilber11@berkeley.edu,,"Barrows, geoffrey/0000-0001-5415-1910",,,,,37,30,34,1,64,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

If interest-rate derivatives usage allows a BHC to substitute more freely among sources of funds, then its reliance on less interest-rate-sensitive sources such as core deposits should be lower. We test the hypothesis that if BHCs use interest-rate derivatives to reduce the adverse effects of interest-rate uncertainty on lending, then their loan growth should be less sensitive to core deposit growth. We find that loan growth is less sensitive to core deposit growth for interest-rate derivatives users than for non-users and that this sensitivity is lower when the extent of derivatives usage is higher. One important implication is that the funding flexibility enjoyed by BHCs using interest-rate derivatives should allow these BHCs to provide a smoother and higher level of intermediation, leading to more stable loan growth and greater economic stability.

Binary dictator games and real effort tasks are used to examine whether individuals exert effort in a manner that is consistent with their revealed preferences. The analysis of controlled laboratory experiments suggest that while individuals' effort provisions are generally consistent with the theory, those who reveal relatively pro-social preferences fail to procure their preferred outcomes too frequently when the state of the world is highly inequitable in their favor. Consideration is given to alternative theories, namely ego depletion and cognitive dissonance, as potential explanations of social outcomes. There is evidence to suggest that dictators, on average, experience ego depletion which leads to a reduction in pro-social behavior through time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a large panel of banks from 12 euro area countries for the period 2002-2010 we analyze the reaction of loan supply to monetary policy actions depending on the degree of bank competition. We find that the effect of monetary policy on bank lending is dependent on bank competition: the transmission of monetary policy via the bank lending channel is less pronounced for banks with extensive market power. Further investigation shows that banks with less market power were more sensitive to monetary policy only before the financial crisis. These results suggest that bank market power has a significant impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy. Therefore,wide variations in the level of bank market power may lead to asymmetric effects of the single monetary policy. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The quest is often impossible because of the interconnectedness between labor supply, consumption decisions and the environmental quality. The paper differentiates between two conceptualization for the Pigouvian tax that have been employed in the literature and argues that each has tried to isolate the environmental component in its own way. One conceptualization, due to Cremer et al. (J Public Econ 70:343-364, 1998) does so by ruling out direct feedback from changes in environmental quality on the incentive effect of the tax. In the second conceptualization, due to Bovenberg and Ploeg's (J Public Econ 55:349-390, 1994), incentive effects are ruled out by making consumers' valuation of environmental quality independent of the labor supply. This is achieved by assuming separability between labor supply and other goods (including environmental equality). To convey its message, the paper studies the properties of optimal polluting and non-polluting non-labor input taxes in a Mirrleesian model with endogenously determined wages.","Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Gahvari, F (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",fgahvari@illinois.edu,,,,,,,24,13,13,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This is largely explained by an increase in the share of corporate profits in national income. In this paper, we discuss the sources of corporate profits, and specifically corporate taxable profits; these include a normal return to capital investment, returns to labour or entrepreneurial effort that are realised as dividends or capital gains, and returns to market power. We relate these components of profits to the ways that corporate taxes can change incentives to invest or exert effort, and we discuss some implications for policy.","[Griffith, Rachel; Miller, Helen] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Miller, Helen] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Manchester,"Griffith, R (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",rgriffith@ifs.org.uk; helen_m@ifs.org.uk,"Griffith, Rachel S/A-2583-2009","Griffith, Rachel S/0000-0002-8616-5820",ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,96,9,9,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We show, however, experimentally that a fractional integration test may discriminate between spurious long memory of order D and integration of order D. Further, we suggest a test for the null hypothesis that the order of integration does not change from one subperiod to another. It simply builds on the difference of the estimates from the respective subsamples that are split exogenously. Upon appropriate normalization a limiting standard normal distribution arises. With these methods we tackle the question whether international and sectoral bank equity index returns are fractionally integrated and whether the memory parameters have changed. The daily data are split into three regimes: one pre-crises subsample, a second including the collapse of the Lehman Brothers bank, and a third covering the Euro area sovereign debt crisis. In particular, we provide evidence that both turmoils had differing international effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Conflict-affected environments are presumed to be settings that combine extraordinary need and opportunity for building institutions. The substantive and methodological consistency of the field experiments (Afghanistan, DRC, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) allows us to derive general conclusions about attempts at local institution building in conflict-affected contexts.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine bank market power and SME credit constraints in an international, developed economy setting. Moreover, our study is the first to address a number of econometric considerations simultaneously, in particular by controlling for the availability of profitable investment opportunities using a structural Q model of investment. Our results strongly support the market power hypothesis, namely, that increased market power results in increased financing constraints for SMEs. Additionally, we find that the relationship exhibits heterogeneity across firm size and opacity in a manner that suggests that the true relationship between bank market power and financing constraints might not be fully explained by the existing theory. Finally, we find that the effect of bank market power on financing constraints increases in financial systems that are more bank dependent. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using data between 1990 and 2006, impacts of the Spanish HSR on Madrid's Atocha railway station influence area - a 20 km radius buffer centred on the station - were investigated. To model the HSR impacts, besides socioeconomic variables, the development of both local and regional transportation networks with corresponding accessibility improvement is also taken into account to segregate the impacts of land-cover change brought by different sources of accessibility measures. In this study, two SML models are used: one incorporates regional accessibility indicators as a base model, and the other does not, acting as a control model. The model estimation results reveal that the reduction of the local and regional weighted travel average time has positive impacts on the Atocha station catchment area's urbanised land-cover rates. Although the base and control models both achieve high goodness-of-fit values, the base model that considers regional accessibility reveals a better goodness-of-fit statistic and is more robust than the control model. It is concluded that the improvement of regional accessibility due to the arrival of HSR at Atocha station plays an essential role in the urbanisation of land cover changes in the study area.

The radical program has caused the emergence of markets for various care services apart from permanent institutional care, which is only a major formal care sector in many developed countries. The availability of various formal care services can stimulate female labor supply through a reduction of the burden of informal caregiving. To investigate the impacts of the LTCI, we compare the labor market behavior of females who face requirements for elderly care in their household for three periods-before the launch of the LTCI, four years after the launch, and ten years after the launch. Our empirical analysis indicates positive effects of the launch and diffusion of the LTCI on female labor supply. As a result of the LTCI, care for male elders is no longer an obstacle for female labor supply, but care for female elders is still burdensome. We also find that the care requirement reduces the probability of being a regular worker; however, regular workers are more likely to utilize formal care, whereas many nonregular workers provide informal care by themselves.

The banking sector in Canada provides a unique setting in which to examine market discipline along with the prospects of proposed reforms because Canada has no history of government bailouts, and an implicit government guarantee has been in effect consistently since the 1920s. We find that large banks have a funding advantage over small banks after controlling for bank-specific and market risk factors. Large banks on average pay 80 basis points and 70 basis points less, respectively, on their deposits and subordinated debt.

We find that the interest rate pass-through was generally complete on impact before the outbreak of the financial crisis, but became significantly distorted in the period thereafter, which hampered the effectiveness of monetary policy. Empirical evidence suggests that the decrease in the interest rate pass-through can be related to a change in the structural parameters characterizing the economies and a substantial increase in the average size of structural shocks. DSGE model simulations show that an increase in the frictions that banks are subject to can explain the decrease in the retail bank interest rate pass-through. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A number of different copula specifications with different conditional dependence structures and time-varying dependence parameters were employed in the research. Empirical results for weekly data for the period January 1998-October 2012 provided evidence of positive and weak food-USD dependence and no extreme market dependence for corn, wheat and rice, thus confirming that price spikes for these foods were not caused by extreme USD depreciation. For soybeans, however, we found evidence of positive average dependence and asymmetric tail dependence, with positive upper tail dependence confirming the contribution of USD depreciation to soybean price spikes. Given that food commodities are undergoing a financialization process, we also examined the implications of USD links with food prices for food risk policy management. We provide evidence of USD hedging effectiveness in reducing food portfolio risk and downside food risk and also of better overall performance in terms of the investor's loss function than a food-only portfolio.

Moreover, the in-sample VaR is estimated for both the global financial crisis (GFC) period and the non-GFC period. Subsequently, through several accuracy measures, nine models are evaluated in order to explore the influence of long memory, leverage, and distribution effects on the performance of VaR and ES forecasts. As shown by the empirical results of the nine models, the long memory, leverage, and distribution effects subsist in the stock markets. Moreover, regarding the out-of-sample VaR forecasts, long memory is the most important effect, followed by the leverage effect for the low level, whereas the distribution effect is crucial for the high level. As for the three VaR approaches, weighted historical simulation achieves the best VaR forecasting performance, followed by filtered historical simulation, whereas the parametric approach has the worst VaR forecasting performance for all the levels. Furthermore, VaR models underestimate the true risk, whereas ES models overestimate the true risk, indicating that the ES risk measure is more conservative than the VaR risk measure. Additionally, based on back-testing, the VaR provides a better risk forecast than the ES since the ES highly overestimates the true risk. Notably, long memory is important for the ES estimate, whereas both the long memory and the leverage effect are crucial for the VaR estimate. Finally, via in-sample VaR forecasts in regard to the low level, it is found that long memory is important for the non-GFC period, whereas the distribution effect is crucial for the GFC period. On the other hand, with regard to the high level, the distribution effect is crucial for both the non-GFC and the GFC period. These results seem to be consistent with those found in the out-of-sample VaR forecasts. In accordance with these results, several important policy implications are proposed in this study.

The compensating differentials literature, by contrast, suggests that neither skill specificity, nor labor market protections affect preferences when wages adjust for differences in risks and investment costs. We examine these competing predictions using U.S. data on general and specific skills. Absolute and relative skill specificity have a robust positive correlation with income, but are negatively correlated with preferences for social protection. Our results strongly support the compensating differentials approach.","[Timmons, Jeffrey F.] IE Univ, Madrid 28006, Spain",IE University,"Timmons, JF (通讯作者)，IE Univ, IE Business Sch, Calle Alvarez de Baena 4,1, Madrid 28006, Spain.",jeffrey.timmons@ie.edu,,,,,,,41,0,0,1,17,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

While this view is supported to a large extent by experimental findings, there remains several hurdles that hinder the implementation of the ambient tax in the field. One of these hurdles is the nature of the damage. Experimental findings suggest that the efficiency of the ambient tax is higher under external damage, i.e. if ambient pollution affects non-polluters (Spraggon in J Public Econ 84:427-456, 2002) than under internal damage, i.e. if ambient pollution affects polluters themselves (Cochard et al. in Environ Resour Econ 30:393-422, 2005). But this result rests on very different experimental settings. Therefore, we designed a new experiment that allows to compare external and internal damage within a common setting. Our main finding is that the ambient tax is equally efficient under internal and external damage.","[Willinger, Marc] Univ Montpellier I, Inst Univ France, LAMETA, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Ammar, Nasreddine] Univ Laval, Fac Sci Agr & Alimentat, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Ennasri, Ahmed] Univ Int Rabat, UIR Business Sch, Pole Business Management Finance & Actuariat, Rabat, Morocco",Institut Universitaire de France; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Laval University; Universite Internationale de Rabat,"Willinger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier I, Inst Univ France, LAMETA, Ave Raymond Dugrand,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France.",willinger@lameta.univ-montp1.fr; nasreddine.ammar.1@ulaval.ca; ennasri@lameta.univ-montp1.fr,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In this paper, we show that industrial clusters, through specialization and division of labor, can ease the financial constraints of microenterprises even in the absence of a well-functioning capital market. By using data from more than 17,000 microenterprises in four sectors and four regions of Ethiopia, we find that clustering lowers capital entry barrier by reducing the initial investment required to start a business. This effect is found to be significantly larger for microenterprises investing in districts with high capital market inefficiency, indicating the importance of clustering as an organizational response to a credit constrained environment. The findings highlight the importance of cluster-based industrial activities as an alternative method of propagating industrialization when local conditions do not allow easy access to credit.","[Ali, Merima] Chr Michelsen Inst, N-5892 Bergen, Norway; [Peerlings, Jack] Wageningen Univ, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Zhang, Xiaobo] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Zhang, Xiaobo] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Peking University,"Ali, M (通讯作者)，Chr Michelsen Inst, Jekteviksbakken 31, N-5892 Bergen, Norway.",merima.ali@cmi.no; jack.peerlings@wur.nl; x.zhang@cgiar.org,"zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023; Peerlings, Jack/C-8473-2015","zhang, xiaobo/0000-0002-4981-9565",,,,,59,5,8,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

First, I argue that the region's history of settlement, production and political struggle helped to entrench certain normative beliefs around landownership, most notably in its population of semi-commercial upper peasants. I then detail the ways in which these upper peasants mobilized around notions of distributive justice to successfully press demands for land restitution in the late 1980s, drawing on Vietnamese newspapers and other sources to construct case studies of local land conflicts.

In this paper, I develop a tractable model that incorporates variable mark-ups to study how a competitive environment is affected by environmental policies in a market with firm heterogeneity and endogenous abatement technology choice. The findings of this study are consistent with the Porter Hypothesis in the sense that environmental regulations motivate abatement technology adoption and enhance productivity and environmental quality. However, the productivity gain is mainly driven by reallocation of resources across firms rather than the induced abatement technological change. Tougher regulations harm the competitive environment by increasing average prices and market concentration. Social welfare also drops because in the absence of strong competition fewer variates are produced in equilibrium.","York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Sadeghzadeh, J (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, Room 1144,Vari Hall,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",jay373@econ.yorku.ca,,,,,,,23,8,9,2,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

City governments rely on the minimum parking requirement, the conventional approach, to manage parking quantity, which shapes a unique phenomenon called the developer-led supply pattern. In this paper, we establish ordinary least squares models to explore spatial-mismatch characteristics that result from the current parking policy and infer the latent mechanism of parking supply using geographical correlation analysis. In the case of Shenzhen, we found that few urban factors at the district level are involved in the decision making of developers regarding parking provision, which compromises the endeavor of creating sustainable transport and thus requires further policy intervention. Market force serves its role in strict planning regulations at the neighborhood level because of the dominant role of property developers. These models not only confirm the mismatch of parking supply with the objectives of sustainable urban transport but also reveal the willingness of developers as a driving force that interacts with the regulatory environment. Such willingness leads to a spatially inconsistent, inefficient parking supply pattern over the entire Shenzhen metropolis. Based on these findings, two suggestions are made for parking policy on district and neighborhood bases that address the situation of high-density urbanization in Chinese cities and similar circumstances.

This is done across the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Further, housing price data is added for both countries. For the US, data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and Census data were used construct measures of house price appreciation and the relative cost of owning to renting. For Germany, proprietary data from BulwienGesa AG was used to construct comparable indices. Observed differentials in tenure transitions appear to be consistent with the differences in housing and mortgage market conditions, as well as the tax treatment of owned homes across the two nations. In particular, while there is substantial house price appreciation in the US, on average house prices fall over the same period in Germany. In addition, mortgage interest is not tax deductible in Germany, alternative mortgage options available in the US are not prevalent there, and down payment requirements are much greater. Consequently, German households have a much lower probability of homeownership and there is only a small likelihood of those who initially achieve homeownership returning to rental tenure or moving to another owned home. In contrast, households in the United States have a very high likelihood of homeownership, but the housing market appears much more volatile with a high likelihood that households will return to rental tenure, and subsequently achieve homeownership for a second time during the period of observation.

According to our results, real long-term interest rates and real stock prices tend to increase the probability of a costly housing-price boom, whereas real GDP tends to increase the probability of a costly stock-price boom. Interestingly, the credit-to-GDP gap indicator, sometimes put forward in the literature as a key reference for setting countercyclical capital buffers, does not seem to be a robust leading indicator of costly booms or banking crises.

Among other changes, the Act restricted issuers' account closure policies, eliminated certain fees, and made it more difficult for issuers to change terms on credit card plans. Critics of the Act argued that because of the long lag between approval and implementation of the law, issuing banks would be able to take preemptive actions that might disadvantage cardholders before the law could take effect. Using credit bureau data as well as individual data from a survey of U.S. consumers, we test whether banks closed consumers' credit card accounts or otherwise restricted access to credit just before the enactment of the CARD Act. Because the period prior to the enactment of the CARD Act coincided with the financial crisis and recession, causality in this case is particularly difficult to establish. We find evidence that a higher fraction of credit card accounts were closed following the Federal Reserve Board's adoption of its credit card rules, but not between May 2009, when the CARD Act was signed, and when most of its provisions became law in February 2010. However, we do find evidence that banks deteriorated terms of credit card plans at a higher rate during this period, especially lowered the credit limits. Among the survey respondents whose bank accounts were closed during that period, account holders were much more likely to close their own credit card accounts than to have them closed by their card issuers.

While penalties did not reduce prices or profits, making collusion legal raised profits by at least 16% each year, compared with the time when the illegal cartel was not prosecuted. The threat of penalties was sufficient to reduce profit from collusion.

The analysis considers both country and industry effects. While traditional portfolio management strategies usually follow a top-down procedure, assuming that country-level effects drive financial aggregates (e.g., stock returns) our empirical results suggest that the equity markets of 37 of the 42 counties in our sample do form a unified convergence club. The empirical findings, however, also show more numerous stock-price convergence clubs in certain industries. That is, country factors play a more important role in explaining the actual convergence in real stock prices than industry factors. Conversely, the volatility of stock prices exhibits much more evidence of convergence than stock prices. These findings should assist portfolio managers in the design and implementation of appropriate portfolio management strategies. Regulatory authorities also can benefit in the design of financial regulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Linear and non-linear dependencies are detected after pairwise and system-wise causality analysis. A new stepwise multivariate filtering approach is implemented after controlling for conditional heteroskedasticity in the raw data and in VAR/VECM residuals using multivariate GARCH models. Significant nonlinear causal linkages persisted even after the application of GARCH-BEKK, CCC-GARCH and DCC-GARCH modelling. This indicates that volatility effects might partly induce nonlinear causality. Perhaps new short-term asset-pricing models could be developed to explain this stylized fact.

Total network length has decreased fundamentally while high-speed rail (HSR) line construction has soared since then. Accordingly HSR has stipulated a lot of research, but only recently HSR's impacts on settlement structure and transport regimes have been studied in depth. We embrace a passenger's point of view and utilize a generalized overview model for illustrating the trade-offs between trip speeds of complete trip chains, access/egress legs and mainline trip lengths. In order to estimate input parameters, an overview of railway network and settlement structure of Austria is empirically derived. In four scenarios, we vary these input parameters to study the impact of timetable integration, speed upgrades on mainlines and access/egress modes on trip speed in the Austrian case. Our results show that travel speed advantages of mainline speed increases are quickly countervailed by access/egress improvements or timetable integration improvements. We conclude that finding harmonized optimum speeds, introducing clock-face timetable design and improving access/egress modes are promising strategies in comparison to unscrutinized further maximization of mainline travel speed levels at the expense of feeder/distributor lines quality.

The paper emphasizes three factors: the distinction between insider-affiliated and non-insider-affiliated outside directors based on family relationships, governmental agency theory-based regulations, and the firm's choice between agency and stewardship governance philosophy. Evidence has shown that the proportion of non-insider-affiliated outsiders on the board is sensitive to changes in firm and CEO characteristics, and to changes in government regulations. Government regulations significantly shape corporate boards, encouraging a smaller size, more outside directors, and fewer insider-affiliated outside directors. For firms adopting agency and stewardship theories as governance arrangement, the determinants of board structure are diverse. The board structure of principal-steward firms is less susceptible to changes in firm characteristics but more susceptible to CEO influence, and more responsive to government regulations.

The paper focuses on the reform, explaining its aims, breaking down the main contents, critically examining the official view and describing the expected ageing of the Spanish population. This approach complements the quantitative analyses performed by other researchers and will enable us to assess the reformed system with the focus on four main areas: actuarial fairness, actuarial transparency, solvency and communication with the public. The main conclusion is that the reform was a wasted opportunity given that Spain did not take advantage of the lessons learned in Sweden, it did not include any elements for improving the management of pay-as-you-go systems, and there is no sound basis for claiming that the system's sustainability is assured in the medium term, the long term or even the short term. The new parametric reforms currently under consideration in Spain are targeted to correct some of the pension system's design faults that have been highlighted in this paper.","Univ Valencia, Dept Financial Econ & Actuarial Sci, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Vidal-Meliá, C (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Financial Econ & Actuarial Sci, Ave Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",carlos.vidal@uv.es,"VIDAL-MELIA, CARLOS/AAH-9010-2020","VIDAL-MELIA, CARLOS/0000-0002-7227-5076",,,,,62,13,16,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

We also investigate the role of institutional quality in altering MFIs' incentives and behavior in determining outreach. Our results indicate that NGOs are more profitable and have better outreach than banks and cooperatives. While a weak rule of law favors relationship-based exchanges and thus, results in NGO superiority, stronger institutional quality may encourage banks to cater to more borrowers, hence, shareholder-owned MFIs do not socially perform differently from NGOs.

This paper examines the relationship between legal access to the birth control pill and female poverty. We rely on exogenous cross-state variation in the year in which oral contraception became legally available to young, single women. Using census data from 1960 to 1990, we find that having legal access to the birth control pill by age 20 significantly reduces the probability that a woman is subsequently in poverty. We estimate that early legal access to oral contraception reduces female poverty by 0.5 percentage points, even when controlling for completed education, employment status, and household composition.","[Browne, Stephanie P.] JP Morgan, New York, NY 10179 USA",JP Morgan Chase & Company,"Browne, SP (通讯作者)，JP Morgan, 383 Madison Ave,3rd Floor, New York, NY 10179 USA.",spbrowne21@gmail.com; Sara.LaLumia@williams.edu,,,,,,,35,13,19,3,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

The analyses indicate that veto players and especially government fractionalization exert a constraining effect on changes in the size of government, but also that the effect is not consistent over time: neither veto players in general nor fractionalization of government in particular exerted any constraining effect during the decades of rapid government growth due to welfare state creation and expansion in the 1960s and 1970s.

More specifically, we investigate to what extent choices for leisure activities and related travels are driven by the satisfaction of needs. In addition to conventional attributes (such as activity costs), our regret based discrete choice model incorporates latent variables representing the anticipated level of individual needs-satisfaction by a particular leisure activity. The latent variables are calibrated with the help of subjective indicators of needs-satisfaction associated with the leisure activities. Results show that needs-satisfaction allows us to decompose a substantial share of the unobserved heterogeneity in leisure activity-travel decisions across respondents. Identifying the structural drivers of anticipated needs-satisfaction also enables a better prediction of leisure activity choice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Even though the framework of the Zodrow-Mieszkowski model is extended into two dimensions, we are able to characterize the signs of both tax rates and the provision level of the public good: for a large class of production functions (including CES), tax competition is characterized by underprovision of public goods, and by positive taxes on both labor and capital. Since this holds true (with some qualifications) for various labor market models (including efficient bargains, the monopolistic union, and competitive labor markets), we can safely conclude that the results of Zodrow and Mieszkowski survive some important and substantial modifications of the framework, and are thus more general than recently suggested elsewhere.","[Eichner, Thomas] Univ Hagen, D-58097 Hagen, Germany; [Upmann, Thorsten] Univ Duisburg Essen, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany",Fern University Hagen; University of Duisburg Essen,"Eichner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany.",thomas.eichner@fernuni-hagen.de; thorsten.upmann@uni-duisburg-essen.de,"Upmann, Thorsten/AAA-9925-2019","Upmann, Thorsten/0000-0001-7804-7982",,,,,42,3,3,0,8,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2014,70.0,2,,,,,218,248,,10.1628/001522114X681360,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AK0GU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338091700003,0

We find that investors demand statistically and economically significant risk premiums to hold financial assets performing poorly during market dislocations, that is, when both frictions to the trading activity of speculators and arbitrageurs and their marginal utility of wealth are likely to be high.","[Pasquariello, Paolo] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Pasquariello, P (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Finance, Ross Sch Business, Suite R4434, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ppasquar@umich.edu,"Pasquariello, Paolo/A-1143-2007",,,,,,106,37,42,2,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Low rates of take-up of available assistance among eligible homeowners have hampered the potential success of programs such as the U.S. Treasury's Hardest Hit Fund initiative. This paper investigates the effect of accessibility and related transaction costs, measured in terms of geographic access to application intake agencies, on the likelihood of application completion for homeowners who begin the assistance application process. Using data from a large-scale mortgage assistance program in Ohio, the work is motivated by the observation that a surprisingly small percentage of eligible homeowners who register for assistance submit a completed application. Consistent with the literature on access and transaction costs, we find that proximity to intake agencies increases the probability of application submission in a small, but significant, way. The results suggest that further emphasis should be given to the interactions at the front lines of mortgage assistance programs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using a southern African conservation and development intervention, the paper compares positive translation along the project's accountability chain with the broader circulation of positive references to the project's payments for ecosystem services initiative. While both illuminate the construction of value in conservation and development, the paper concludes that a neoliberal context increasingly emphasizes the latter tactic of epistemic circulation.

The analysis is conducted at municipal level, based on data on land use and mobility characteristics of the de-urbanisation process in Biscay, a small European province, from 1991 to 2001. The links are assessed by means of multiple regression analysis, in which specific techniques of spatial econometrics are applied in order to avoid biased results and unreliable inferences due to spatial dependence. The findings reveal, at municipal level, the importance of gross population density, geographic concentration of the population and, to a lesser extent, the ratio of jobs to residents in explaining the modal split in commuting, and the influence of access to public transport. It is also shown that public transport services have spillover effects that extend beyond the limits of the municipality and encourage use in adjacent areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The first is the unregulated case, which only imposes limits on maximum leverage. The second is Basle II and the third is a hypothetical alternative in which banks perfectly hedge all of their leverage-induced risk with options. When compared to the unregulated case both Basle II and the perfect hedge policy reduce the risk of default when leverage is low but increase it when leverage is high. This is because both regulation policies increase the amount of synchronized buying and selling needed to achieve deleveraging, which can destabilize the market. None of these policies are optimal for everyone: risk neutral investors prefer the unregulated case with low maximum leverage, banks prefer the perfect hedge policy, and fund managers prefer the unregulated case with high maximum leverage. No one prefers Basle II. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis shows that variations in patent applications reflect not only variations in research productivity but also variations in the appropriability and filing strategies adopted by firms.

Our results may explain why aid to Iraq and Afghanistan has had little development impact and serves as warning for Burma and Arab Spring regimes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using this methodology, which exploits time-variation in the cross-section of short interest, we document that the amount of capital devoted to value and momentum strategies has grown significantly since the late 1980s. We provide evidence that this increase in capital has resulted in lower strategy returns. However, consistent with theories of limited arbitrage, we show that strategy-level capital flows are influenced by past strategy returns and strategy return volatility and that arbitrage capital is most limited during times when strategies perform best. This suggests that the growth of arbitrage capital may not completely eliminate returns to these strategies.","[Hanson, Samuel G.; Sunderam, Adi] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02467 USA",Harvard University,"Hanson, SG (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Soldiers Field, Boston, MA 02467 USA.",shanson@hbs.edu,,,,,,,84,60,68,2,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

By constructing a general equilibrium model of international trade, which is extended to allow production-generated pollution, we characterize conditions under which a tariff reform and a pollution tax reform increase the value of the small country's imports. It is shown that uniform proportional cuts in tariffs that increase welfare do not necessarily improve market access, and the Ju-Krishna rule of tariff reforms that improves market access does not necessarily increase welfare. A reduction in all pollution distortions proportional to their degree of distortion can be shown to improve both welfare and market access.","Rissho Univ, Fac Econ, Shinagawa Ku, Tokyo 1418602, Japan",,"Kawahara, S (通讯作者)，Rissho Univ, Fac Econ, Shinagawa Ku, 4-2-16 Osaki, Tokyo 1418602, Japan.",kawahara@ris.ac.jp,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The robustness of this commitment is a major feature of the intellectual landscape surveyed by Mazzoleni and Nelson (2013, Industrial and Corporate Change, 22, 6), and the challengers' inability to overthrow it is clearly a key rubric for an answer to the basic Mazzoleni and Nelson question about explanations for the failures of the successive challenges to neoclassicism. The principal thesis here is that the neoclassical commitment to optimizing actors has exacted a high opportunity cost because of its distorting effect on the discipline's priorities. The commitment encourages theorists to engage primarily in the construction and analysis of models that are viewed as parables and valued primarily on esthetic grounds, and not for the insight into reality that they provide. Thus, the contemporary esthetics of neoclassical theorizing push the economics discipline away from serious engagement with the complexity of economic reality.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, SH DH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Winter, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, SH DH, Suite 2000,3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",winter@wharton.upenn.edu,"Winter, Sidney/GXG-2470-2022",,,,,,25,2,2,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In general, mortality risk can be divided into different subcategories, among them unsystematic risk, adverse selection, and systematic risk. In addition, basis risk may arise in case of hedging, for example, longevity risk. The aim of this article is to holistically analyze the impact of these different types of mortality risk on the risk situation and the risk management of a life insurer. Toward this end, we extend previous models of adverse selection, empirically calibrate mortality rates, and study the interaction among the mortality risk components in the case of an insurer holding a portfolio of annuities and term life insurance contracts. For risk management, we examine natural hedging and mortality contingent bonds. Our results show that particularly adverse selection and basis risk can have crucial impact not only on the effectiveness of mortality contingent bonds, but also on the insurer's risk level, especially when a portfolio consists of several types of products.","[Gatzert, Nadine; Wesker, Hannah] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Gatzert, N (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.",nadine.gatzert@wiso.uni-erlangen.de; hannah.wesker@wiso.uni-erlangen.de,,,,,,,35,12,16,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Findings reveal considerable struggle among our subjects to meet even minimal needs for shelter and food, although economic security and stability could be attained when employment or public benefits were coupled with familial social support.

We use a sample of virtually all US commercial banks during the period 1998-2010 to analyze the relationship between these two risk sources on the bank institutional-level and how this relationship influences banks' probabilities of default (PD). Our results show that both risk categories do not have an economically meaningful reciprocal contemporaneous or time-lagged relationship. However, they do influence banks' probability of default. This effect is twofold: whereas both risks separately increase the PD, the influence of their interaction depends on the overall level of bank risk and can either aggravate or mitigate default risk. These results provide new insights into the understanding of bank risk and serve as an underpinning for recent regulatory efforts aimed at strengthening banks (joint) risk management of liquidity and credit risks.

Time-varying betas are estimated from time-varying conditional variances and covariances, where conditional information is incorporated by modelling variances and covariances using ARCH, GARCH and GARCH-M models. For the majority of momentum trading strategies winner portfolios show higher systematic risk than loser portfolios, and in some cases this difference is found to be statistically significant.

The paper finds that sovereign defaults can indeed generate a decline in foreign and domestic credit even if domestic agents do not hold sovereign debt, and that stronger domestic financial institutions can amplify this effect.

Exports, industrial production, and stock prices crashed after 2007 and had yet to regain their pre-crash values five years later. This paper investigates the contribution of the yen appreciation to this economic disaster. Evidence from Johansen maximum likelihood and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) estimation indicates that a 25% appreciation reduces long run exports by 8-18%. Panel DOLS evidence reveals that the appreciation especially depressed exports in the automobile sector. Regression evidence implies that the yen appreciation caused yen export prices to fall 29% in the automobile sector and 22% in the electrical and electronics sector. Finally, evidence from estimating exchange rate exposures indicates that the yen appreciation reduced stock prices significantly in the automobile and electronics sectors. J. Japanese Int.

We develop a new way to examine tax evasion that focuses on corporate transactions, rather than corporate profits. Specifically, we examine how commodity flows respond to destination sales taxes, allowing for tax evasion as a function of distance between trade partners. After accounting for transportation costs, we find that the effect of taxes decreases as distance increases. This is consistent with the notion that longer distances between trade partners hinder government oversight and increase the likelihood of successful tax evasion. Our results are robust with respect to outliers, strategic neighbor effects, information sharing agreements and other re-specifications. These results are important to policymakers because they evidence the difficulty of enforcing destination taxation in open economies such as U.S. states and the European Union. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study uses case study methodology involving an agro-based government research institution and six private firms in Malaysia. This research reveals that the development of new technology did not lead to technology transfer until business opportunity is properly recognised. The business opportunity must be recognised first; then, the process of technology transfer will follow. The accomplishment of technology transfer from government research institution to private firms requires a well planned and comprehensive, structured process, and the support of the following factors: (a) business opportunity is recognised; (b) the technology generator shared his/her knowledge and know-how fully; (c) both the technology generator and technology recipient are passionate about technology transfer; and (d) both of them are totally involved and committed throughout the technology transfer process. As a conclusion, the accomplishment of technology transfer is explained by cognitive and affective theories in that, the entrepreneur's mental judgment links the process of technology transfer through the recognition of opportunity, while emotions and feeling complement this process.

This has impacted on the further distribution of salinity and flooding of low laying areas even in further inland areas. As the consequence, buildings in the proximity of riverbanks are left susceptible to potential damages and shortened life cycles. Thus, there is a real need to change the way buildings in these areas to be designed and how risk of damages can be mitigated and managed. The city of Perth in Western Australia, like many other cities around the world, is laying on the riverbank of a large river, the Swan River. As the population of Perth increases dramatically, it will become important to ensure sustainability of its buildings to support the ever growing populations and hence its needs. There are myriads of approaches in mitigating and managing these risks. This research project aims to investigate the contemporary risk management practices in mitigating flooding risk in buildings adjacent to the Swan River and bring them together as a holistic risk management approach. The findings of this research can be proposed to the Western Australian government to assist them in developing further policies in ensuring sustainable buildings fit for the future. At this point of writing, the research project is on its early stage of conducting literature review and designing the research methodology. It is intended to conduct a pilot survey, followed by case study approach of contemporary buildings adjacent to the Swan River to contextualize the research. This paper presents the current progress of this research. (C) 2014 The Authors.

This qualitative study interviewed 15 focus groups with 148 university students to understand the challenges of mobile learning. The study of local culture is the main focus of this research in the context of Malaysian universities. The study resulted in the following themes; lack of local cultural content; the high cost of smart phones and services; lack of awareness of ethics for mLearning; unawareness of learning potential; hardware problems; and wireless problems.

On the other hand, the relative unimportance of the corporate bond market in Europe was mirrored by the corresponding dominance of the banking sector. Although there is no definitive evidence that either a market-based or bank-dominated financial system is better, arguments, that a more diversified financial system would mitigate its vulnerability to systemic risk, are made. With the instruments of comparative analysis, underdeveloped bond markets and dependence on bank finance are topics of concern of this paper as well as an aim to examine other competing factors on impacts of banking on bond markets, banking substitution and mixed market models are argued.

It would be logical to expect that crude oil as an important production factor will have a significant impact on the economy and figuratively on the capital markets. Intuitively, it might be assumed that if the production costs rise, there will be an overall deterioration of the financial situation of a particular company with a subsequent drop in its share price and vice versa. This fact, in our research is not clearly given. It is evident the need to differentiate in which sector the company is operating. The results of our research have been certainly influenced by the nature of the Prague Stock Exchange. Although the Czech Republic is one of the EU-members, the different institutional environment of the country should be taken into account, because in the nineties the Czech Republic was one of the transition economies.

Procyclicality, cross-sectional systemic risk analysis, and financial soundness indicators proposed that Mongolian financial system is at credit risk because of large banking sector.

Listed firms in the Netherlands have a long tradition of limiting shareholders' rights. Using a change in corporate governance regulations as a natural experiment, we show that governance rules have a causal effect on insider trading profits. Our results imply that insider transactions are more profitable at firms where shareholder rights are not restricted by antishareholder mechanisms. These findings are inconsistent with internal monitoring of insider trading. Rather, we explain this empirical pattern by imperfect substitution between insider trading profits and other private benefits of control.","[Cziraki, Peter] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [De Goeij, Peter; Renneboog, Luc] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Toronto; Tilburg University,"Cziraki, P (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,"Cziraki, Peter/P-6399-2019; Cziraki, Peter/C-1748-2015","Cziraki, Peter/0000-0002-9360-2320;",,,,,43,29,30,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

The methodology used is based on the model of Working with People (WWP), which integrates elements of social learning and planningand Project management international models, which integrate competences that have an influence on regional development. WWP model is the result of experience in rural development planning from the research group GESPLAN at the Technical University of Madrid in several European contexts and emerging countries. The results show that the main skills and competences for regional development in Rumania are focused on three components: technical-entrepreneurial, social-ethical and political-contextual. Experience lessons in the first years of the Romanian National Rural Development Network (NRDN) demonstrate the right project management approach for Regional Development, exceeding the technical approach of the management and emphasizing the behaviour of individuals and the contexts where they work. This new way of thinking opens up new fields of research in regional development projects planning, evaluation and management.

The main characteristic of anxious periods is that the perceptions and expectations about economic conditions worsen for economic agents even though the economy is not in a recession. We identify distinct periods of anxiety for consumers, CEOs (firms) and analysts. Subsequently, we study the lending behavior of US banks during the anxious quarters from 1985 to 2010, using bank-level data. The results show that banks' lending falls when consumers and analysts are anxious, and this effect is more pronounced when banks hold a higher level of credit risk. These effects are more pronounced in anxious periods that were followed by recessions, and in these periods loan growth also responds negatively to the anxiety of CEOs. Yet, these effects are quite less prevalent in the period after 2001. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical analysis was based on the multivariate GARCH - BEKK models. The results showed that the structure of the estimated correlations between the years 2007 and 2010, showed clear evidence of contagion in the indices at issue. In the period of the international financial crisis, there was an increase of the correlation between the indices of the U.

Expansions of access, however, have changed the venue in which the drug is obtained, shifting its provision from hospital emergency departments to pharmacies. We find evidence that this shift may have led to a decrease in reports of sexual assault.

Geographical occurrence of floods has become less predictable recently, since flash floods have the main role at the beginning of flood events. Flash flood has a bigger impact to our environment than ordinary floods, as municipalities are prepared in most cases for the ordinary ones. Land cover type is an important factor due to its influence on the precipitation water runoff for a decision what kind of crop is suitable for a given region. This choice can substantially affect the future impact of floods (e.g. corn is a crop which can negatively influence the area during the flash floods). The second problem is an expansion of crop to forest areas ( deforestation). This process has also a negative impact on influence of upcoming flash flood. The paper deals with assessment of land cover type with regard to its possible impacts on flash flood impacts when the main danger does not come from the river but from hillsides around urban areas and assessment of flood with regards to land cover changes. In this paper, the available remote sensing data will be analyzed for this task as well as the analysis of available technology which can be used in areas where the data from remote sensing cannot be used in the required time frame or quality - for example which kind of data from field surveying will be needed or if there is an opportunity for using UAV.

Two principles stand out: First, the economy is regularly hit by unexpected economic disturbances (shocks) that policymakers and forecasting models cannot predict.

It reflects on cash grants as the key instrument adopted by government to effect land redistribution and restitution, and links this instrument and the way it was applied to the poor outcomes achieved for both agriculture and people. Attention then turns to more recent policies aimed at rescuing failed land reform projects and avoiding future failures by assigning a more central and prescriptive role to government agencies. The message to agricultural economists is to discern between rhetoric and policy, and to focus on getting institutions right' at both a policy and practical level.

Traditional course objectives and assessment methods are inconsistent and Arabic course instructors lack the skills required to meet performance expectations. To address these challenges this research-in-progress examines the extent to which a learning culture and use of technology impact knowledge sharing and teacher performance. The specific education context is language (Arabic) teaching in a Saudi tertiary institution. Particular focus is given to the application of two technological platforms to support knowledge sharing: Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and Learning Management Systems (LMS). The development of a learning culture and the use of technology form the two core elements of the conceptual model applied in this research, which aims to further our understanding of how to improve teacher performance.","[Matrafi, Sattam Al.; Othman, Fahad Al.] Minist Higher Educ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",,"Matrafi, SA (通讯作者)，Minist Higher Educ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Sattam.m@hotmail.com; fd.othman@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,1085,1089,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300112,0

Bangladesh is a multi-hazard prone country. Based on lessons learnt from shelter response after 2007 and 2009 cyclones, a major Bangladeshi implementing agency jointly with a Bangladesh University and with the support of a foreign international agency, took the challenge to associate local communities, operational and academic stakeholders as well as linking emergency, rehabilitation and development. After a pilot phase, a 3-years programme has been undertaken at national level to develop strategies for habitat, risk reduction and disaster preparedness, on the basis of a strong participatory and interdisciplinary approach. This process started with the analysis of local houses, resources and coping practices in different regions of the country. From the findings, technical solutions have been elaborated, for each area, to improve existing buildings as well as to respond to future crisis, according to cultural, social, environmental and economical specificities of each site. Past experiences on post-disaster response have highlighted the need for more context specific approaches, that do not focus only on effective and efficient built products but that directly contribute to a sustainable and long term vulnerability reduction and poverty reduction. In areas prone to recurrent natural hazards, local population and builders have often integrated these risks into their daily practices, developing in many cases particular behaviour, to reduce the vulnerability of the built environment. These coping strategies are usually a balance between existing skills, resources and risks and can be extremely valuable for the enhancement of local resilience. Assessment alone is not enough to foster the development of affordable and sustainable solutions; awareness also needs to be developed. Starting from how we apply learning's to other projects at regional and national level, this paper will explore the contribution of the analysis of local building culture into vulnerability reduction strategies, linking past present and future of a community.

In any case this current approach is more suitable for a service-based sustainable society. The creative and cultural economy in the digital environment is a growing part of the global economy. Trade based on creativity, knowledge and information generates jobs, wealth and cultural engagement. According to a UNDP report Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI) contribute up to 7% of GDP and is the fastest growing sector of many economies. In Latvia the term Creative Industries (CI) has been used since 2005 and similarly to other Baltic States Latvia has accepted the CI definition provided by the British Department of Culture, Media and Sports (DCMS). Despite that, broader entrepreneurship policy support for CCI is used very little. In spite of the lack of attention by economic policy makers, creative industries in Latvia exist, therefore it makes sense to talk about them and analyze their economic condition as a means of understanding more deliberately their economic potential. The aim of this paper is to explore the concept of CCI with the method of literature review and to establish an understanding of the describing terms and theories. This is crucial because the amount of literature is large and many sources express policy formulations which could be questioned with respect to their academic strength. This research paper has three main themes - (a) key descriptions of CCI and related concepts; (b) statistical perceptions and the limitations of existing statistical frameworks; and (c) some interesting theories of how to perceive CCI.","Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Moore, I (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",moore@latnet.lv,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,11,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,262,275,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500025,0

Thus, this study seeks to (i) examine the issues influencing the decisions of agro-dealers to participate in the loan market, (ii) analyze the demand for business loan by the agro-dealers and (iii) articulate policy measures for sustainable financing of agro-input business enterprises in Nigeria. The study employed primary data collected through structured questionnaires from 300 agro-dealers and used a Tobit type-II model for the analysis. The results show that interest rate, debt, value of asset, membership of trading association and source of credit are major determinants of loan demand. Agro-dealers need to organize themselves into input trading associations to enhance their creditworthiness and unleash the inherent social capital and information advantages for improved agro-dealership financing. Moreover, diversification of product coverage by agro-dealers and a value-chain approach that links internal financing in the form of trade credit within the agro-input sector with external financing from the commercial banks are strongly recommended.","IFPRI, Nigeria Strategy Support Programme, Abuja, Nigeria",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Olomola, AS (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Nigeria Strategy Support Programme, Abuja, Nigeria.",as_olomola@yahoo.com,,,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)(CGIAR),This paper emanates from a research project on agricultural financing in Nigeria funded by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).

The quarterly data from Eurostat database are used as a data source. Central Europe countries were chosen as a sample of countries in the period of time from 1995 to 2013. The model predicts negative impact of country productivity shock on current account if the shock is permanent. The reason of this conclusion is consumption smoothing of agents in the economy. The regression presented in this paper does not give clear results about country specific productivity shock as the expected sigh was detected only in the case of Poland and Austria. Global productivity has insignificant impact on current account as the model predicts. The model also predicts lower effect of country specific productivity shock on investments in comparison with current account.

In the current challenging business environment, acquisitions face higher degree of risk profiles, especially cross-border acquisitions in the emerging markets. Conducting a thorough due diligence investigation in the context of an acquisition is more important now than ever. In a meta-analysis this paper researches the key risk factors in the acquisition process and their assessment within a due diligence audit. The starting point is the research of academic findings which basically concentrate on common approaches considering financial, legal, commercial, and some other issues in domestic acquisitions and in developed countries. In contrast, this paper considers risk factors in cross-border and emerging markets transactions. Secondly, a number of consultancies publish studies based on surveys on this topic which reflect typical risk factors consisting of i.e. regulatory issues, political factors, and litigation history etc. which may lead to commercial and reputational impediments in cross-border acquisitions. The task of the paper is to match the academic and practical view in order to give a more complete understanding of risk factors to be covered in due diligence audit. The outcome statement is that compared to the academic view of conducting due diligence, the practitioner's experience point to the fact that due diligence scope needs to be suited to the dynamics of the markets. The comparison calls for a different, a more integrated system of due diligence and shows herein the research deficit. The originality of the paper is given by unique meta analysis of the acquisition due diligence literature and the selected consultant studies from anonymized practical experience based on insider information. The outcome is a compendium of evaluated risk factors which need to be included in each due diligence audit in the pre-acquisition phase.","Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Sacek, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",alen.sacek@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,0,0,1,12,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,325,336,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500031,0

Two actors support the game, namely local government with a high level of competences, and a local firm. Local government has significant power in the field of local entrepreneurship while local firm is interested in running a new investment in the region. The game is constructed using signals that either guarantee payoffs or produce losses for both actors. Local firm confronts two options: to nu) the investment project in the local jurisdiction or to defect. Intraregional cooperation among local actors detennines the options of equilibrium in the game generating conditions for local development. Sufficient condition for attracting investment prerequisites high levels of cooperation between local government and firm. The capacity of local government to implement effectively the reform is the key variable of the game. As a sequence: (a) Local actors should adopt strategies that relate their profits with the prosperity of the region, (b) Policy implications of local government should focus on the transformation of its function, in order to attract investments and successively to improve local welfare.

Through its export activities, the red meat industry is also an important generator of foreign exchange. However, Namibia exports its red meat to only a few trading partners, including South Africa (46%) and the European Union (EU) (29%). This is raising concerns because Namibia could lose its preferential (i.e. duty-and quota-free) market access into the EU with the expiry of the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA) in 2014, while over-reliance on only a few markets increases the export sector's vulnerability to external shocks. Namibia therefore needs to diversify its markets for red meat. The purpose of this paper is to identify new export markets as realistic alternatives to the traditional main markets of South Africa, the EU and Norway. A Decision Support Model (DSM) was applied as the market selection tool in this study. The DSM consists of four filters that systematically analyse export opportunities against factors such as macroeconomic risk, market size, market concentration, shipping costs and tariff barriers. Two hundred and thirty-one countries and 28 red meat products were put through this filtering process. The analysis revealed that the most promising alternative export markets for Namibian red meat include Hong Kong, Switzerland, Qatar, Bahrain, Singapore, Malaysia and China. The DSM results constitute an important foundation for more in-depth research into demand patterns, as well as other possible deterrents, in the identified markets.","[Spies, D. C.; Idsardi, E.

For this purpose, in the present work a model for the seismic vulnerability evaluation at territorial scale was developed in order to analyze the buildings built in Italy between 1930 and 1940, belonging to the architectural movement of Italian Rationalism. Starting from the vulnerability model, based on the European Macroseismic Scale (Grunthal, 1998; Giovinazzi and Lagomarsino, 2004), the proposed methodology provides new parameters related to specific vulnerabilities of the Rationalist architectural heritage. The analysis of these buildings, represented by a sample geographically contextualized to Ligurian region (Italy), pointed out that the vulnerability is related to two main issues. The first is the formal characteristics, related to the research of lightness, transparency and boldness that characterized the new architectural language which, in those years, was developing in Italy, as in the rest of Europe. At the base of the formal choices is the use of reinforced concrete, a new construction technology: if the use of this material was a valuable tool for the formal renovation in architecture, it is true that it is, at the same time, the second cause of the vulnerability that characterizes the buildings belonging to the Italian Rationalism. In fact, it is necessary to take into account that the construction technique was in its first step at the beginning of the last century, and that, therefore, had not yet fully mastered, causing structural problems, in some cases, already from a static point of view. The scores of vulnerability, assigned to the parameters identified, have been calibrated through parametrical analysis on a building prototype, from a real case study, selected as representative of certain recurring characteristics in the sample.

For this purpose, results of empirical research, which measures national intellectual capital of European countries from 2007 to 2011, are discussed. The methodology of the empirical research is mostly based on the National Intellectual Capital Index (Bontis, 2004). 25 indicators covering human capital, market capital, process capital and renewal capital of European countries are investigated. A simple additive weighting method is used to aggregate indicators. The weights of indicators are selected based on expert survey. Some of the conclusions are based on correlations between the overall national intellectual capital index and GDP per capita. The study sample includes 28 European countries: 27 members of the European Union plus Norway. The overall national intellectual capital index of the three Baltic States is relatively different: Estonia ranks 9th, Lithuania -21st, and Latvia -24th. Estonia is a clear leader among the Baltic States according to the NICI and different types of IC. It even exceeds the European average. According to process capital, Estonia is particularly sound and falls into the top five European countries, while Lithuania and Latvia, according to the most types of IC, stand below the European average. In comparison, the financial capital of the Baltic States in the period 2007-2011 looks fairly similar. However, based on the recent data this is tending to change. The results of this study contribute to the debate on the IC drivers explaining the potential of national wealth creation. However, the main contribution of the paper lies in the clarification of the condition of national intellectual capital of the Baltic States, comparison of these countries according to the different types of IC, and suggestions of some guidelines related to the future development of their economies, that can be useful for national policy makers responsible for the development of national strategies.","Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Uziene, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania.",lina.uziene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,12,7,8,2,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,283,292,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000035,0

This success is traditionally measured by financial indicators, which are relatively easy to interpret, and as they are used for a long time period, they are also well elaborated. Using these indicators, it is necessary for any enterprise to identify and found those factors that contribute to its success and also those that inhibit this success. The success of the enterprise cannot be evaluated only by a one variable but by a set of them. Many of published studies point to the significant differences between the economically successful and less successful enterprises in connection with characteristics or orientation of their corporate culture. Published studies indicated differences in selected factors contributing to the success of the enterprise, which showed the interdependence with the various characteristics of the corporate culture. Described differences, were identified mainly in the area of management. The ability of management of enterprise to make right decisions is an important factor for ensuring the enterprise success. Available information about the decision-making object, which can be obtained by monitoring all relevant, not just financial, performance indicators are a precondition for correct decisions. Demonstration of the strengths and weaknesses of the enterprise predominates when reporting the enterprise performance. Performance data should document the important aspects of corporate activities. It is essential for these data to be understandable. The surveys, which we carried out in industrial enterprises in Slovakia in the framework of projects solutions confirmed that among more successful enterprises are mainly enterprises with a formulated corporate philosophy of management and strategy, behavior feedback (a regular staff assessment), cooperative, trust-full and highly goal-oriented management style. Other differences were shown in the employee's awareness and communication. It is explicit, that the enterprise success and its social responsibility for the enterprise employees and for its social surroundings are in close interaction. Actually, there are not elaborated and adapted criteria for assessing the achieved success particularly in linking economic criteria with soft factors, e.g. satisfaction of employees, training and innovation in the enterprise, which contribute to the enterprise competitiveness, in many enterprises. In general, there is an absence of specific and proven management methods, which would take into account the corporate culture. Creation of such methods, based on the values of corporate culture, which supports performance of individuals and the overall performance of the enterprise at the same time is a challenge for management. We propose and describe a model and set of indicators to monitor this area in the framework of carried out projects, in this article.

Its value is constantly rising and is beginning to drive the competitiveness of enterprises, industries and entire economies. This paper is aimed at investigating the theory of social capital, representing the key element of intellectual capital at the firm level, and examining its importance for the corporate value chain. The growing significance of social networking in the business world of today leads us to believe that without social capital (identified as the inter-and intra-organizational trust on which the system of relations with the environment is based), enhancing corporate competitiveness is practically implausible. The primary objective of the paper is to present the concept of social capital in Polish enterprises against the background of the EU-27 country group. It is commonly assumed that (in order to develop more dynamically) Polish enterprises need to focus increasingly on the growth of their intangible assets. Given the continued rise of knowledge and innovation as the key drivers of economic expansion, special emphasis must be laid on promoting social value creation. That is why investing in external and internal relation building among corporate stakeholders is particularly desirable. Unfortunately, the quality of social capital in Poland seems to be relatively inferior in essence not due to insufficient investment but rather due to the lingering legacy of the ancient regime (the old communist system). A study of social capital in Poland demonstrates relative underdevelopment of social capital in Polish enterprises and denudes critical factors which can impede the social value accumulation process. The research is based not only on selected prior literature focused on social capital (in particular previous works on this particular concept) but also backed by broad empirical findings and statistical data derived from Polish and international think tanks. Additionally, the paper aims to attract the attention of scientists and practitioners focused on the significance of intellectual capital to social capital in the process of knowledge creation and achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. The author believes that it is a relatively unexplored area of research worth pursuing within the so called third stage of intellectual capital research.","Univ Bialystok, Fac Econ & Management, Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok,"Wildowicz-Giegiel, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bialystok, Fac Econ & Management, Bialystok, Poland.",awildowicz@interia.pl,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,307,315,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000038,0

First, special measures were taken to prevent collapse of financial intermediation. At the same time main policy rates were cut down to historical lows hitting the zero lower bound quite soon after the onset of the financial crisis. After that central banks realised various unconventional measures in order to support their weak economies. While exceptional instruments aimed at restoring financial markets seem to have been inevitable to avert a collapse of a much greater magnitude in the short run, some other measures have remained disputable. Not only had these measures limited effectiveness in restoring stronger and sustainable economic growth, but concerns have also been raised recently about their unintended consequences. These side-effects concern not only domestic economies but international spillovers on many vulnerable less advanced and/or developing economies have been evident. Moreover, potential risks of the unprecedented measures may start to act fully in a longer horizon. Quantitative easing has led to enormous increases in balance sheets of the Fed, the BoE and ECB; however structural differences on the asset side have been evident. Main challenge for major central banks thus seems to be the right timing and structure of inevitable exit strategies in the near future so that a smooth exit with minimal side effects could be guaranteed.","Czech Natl Bank, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank,"Zamrazilová, E (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Na Prikope 28, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",eva.zamrazilova@cnb.cz,,,,,,,56,3,3,0,29,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Inflation uncertainty is obtained from a GARCH model, while checking for any structural break in the series we find that there are possible structural breaks. The structural breaks in mean are captured using dummy variables in the AR-GARCH models and the best models are identified using the informational criterion [Akaike, Schwarz, Log-likelihood].

Compared to East European countries, satisfaction levels were considerably higher in Western countries (West Europe, North America, and Oceania). Moreover, there was considerably greater inequality in the distribution of satisfaction in East European, compared to Western, countries. When these facts were combined to construct equity-sensitive satisfaction averages, the gap between Western countries and East European countries was even greater than suggested by a comparison of average satisfaction levels. This raised the question of why satisfaction levels varied so markedly between these two sets of countries. A logit model suggested that a number of factors were important for determining whether people were satisfied with the way democracy worked in their countries. While there was a difference between Western countries and East European countries in their endowments of these satisfaction-inducing factors (income, gender, participation, education, among others), when the equations were estimated separately for the Western countries and East European countries, the coefficient responses associated with several of these factors also differed markedly between the two groups.","[Borooah, Vani K.] Univ Ulster, Sch Econ, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, Antrim, North Ireland; [Katos, Anastasios B.; Katsouli, Eleni] Univ Macedonia, Dept Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece",Ulster University; University of Macedonia,"Borooah, VK (通讯作者)，Univ Ulster, Sch Econ, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, Antrim, North Ireland.",VK.Borooah@ulster.ac.uk; katos@uom.gr; katsouli@uom.gr,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2013,157.0,3-4,,,SI,,569,584,,10.1007/s11127-013-0134-2,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,269AT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328213100010,0

We solve the game in mixed strategies and find equilibrium conditions remarkably descriptive of government responses to actual and potential large bank insolvencies during the recent financial crisis. The central role of the technology constraint in this model highlights a crucial determinant of failed bank resolution policy that has been overlooked in the theory literature to date; without improved resolution technologies, future bank bailouts are inevitable.

The results show that there is a positive and statistically significant association between economic globalization and the magnitude of regional disparities. Countries with a greater degree of economic integration with the rest of the world tend to register higher levels of regional inequality. This finding is robust to the inclusion of additional explanatory variables and to the choice of the specific measure used to quantify the relevance of spatial inequality within the sample countries. Our analysis also reveals that the spatial impact of economic globalization is greater in low- and middle-income countries, whose levels of regional disparities are on average significantly higher than in high-income countries.

This paper employs a heteroskedasticity-based approach to estimate the structural coefficient measuring the sensitivity of market-based indicators of corporate credit risk to declines in the benchmark market interest rates prompted by the LSAP announcements. The results indicate that the LSAP announcements led to a significant reduction in the cost of insuring against default riskas measured by the CDX indexesfor both investment- and speculative-grade corporate credits. While the unconventional policy measures employed by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy have substantially lowered the overall level of credit risk in the economy, the LSAP announcements appear to have had no measurable effect on credit risk in the financial intermediary sector.","[Gilchrist, Simon] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Gilchrist, Simon] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gilchrist, S (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",sgilchri@bu.edu; egon.zakrajsek@frb.gov,"Zakrajsek, Egon/R-7053-2019",,,,,,43,49,54,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We think that the practical solution is to be able to price these instruments seamlessly and consistently with other existing derivatives. We propose a novel and practical convertible bond approach which is theoretically consistent with existing frameworks such as Black-Scholes and is conceptually and technically similar to the pricing models already being used in practice for convertible bonds and hybrid securities. Such a model is reasonable as all of these asset classes are hybrid equity-credit instruments and share many characteristics. Also, contingent capital through its unique mechanisms such as principal loss absorption, presents interesting risk scenarios which may not be readily apparent or may appear counterintuitive. Contingent capital may thus, at first sight, appear to carry obscure risks but, we show that by taking a careful quantitative approach, we can understand the characteristics of such instruments in a concise manner. Further, for discussing the pricing in terms of characteristics of the issuer, one in turn, needs a concise framework to describe those characteristics in terms of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio risk. Our framework describes CET1 ratio risk via three intuitive issuer parameters: target, volatility, and resilience. In spite of the exotic risks, an investment decision in contingent capital can be justified if a sufficient return is expected in compensation. In this paper, we present a valuation method based on hurdle Sharpe ratios that has direct implications for investment decision making in the context of expansion of investor's efficient frontier. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our framework as a daily pricing tool for market participants using empirical market data.

Current knowledge regarding the impact of residential dissonance is limited to short-term travel behaviours in urban vs. suburban, and rural vs. urban areas. Although the prevailing view is that dissonants adjust their orientation and lifestyle around their surrounding land use over time, empirical evidence is lacking to support this proposition. This research identifies both short-term mode choice behaviour and medium-term mode shift behaviour of dissonants in transit oriented development (TODs) vs. non-TOD areas in Brisbane, Australia. Natural groupings of neighbourhood profiles (e.g. residential density, land use diversity, intersection density, cul-de-sac density, and public transport accessibility levels) of 3957 individuals were identified as living either in a TOD (510 individuals) or non-TOD (3447 individuals) areas in Brisbane using the TwoStep cluster analysis technique. Levels of dissonance were measured based on a factor analysis of 16 items representing the travel attitudes/preferences of individuals. Two multinomial logistic (MNL) regression models were estimated to understand mode choice behaviour of (1) TOD dissonants, and (2) non-TOD dissonants in 2009, controlling for socio-demographics and environmental characteristics. Two additional MNL regression models were estimated to investigate mode shift behaviour of (3) TOD dissonants, and (4) non-TOD dissonants between 2009 and 2011, also controlling for socio-demographic, changes in socio-demographic, and built environmental factors. The findings suggest that travel preference is relatively more influential in transport mode choice decisions compared with built environment features. Little behavioural evidence was found to support the adjustment of a dissonant orientation toward a particular land use feature and mode accessibility they represent (e.g. a modal shift to greater use of the car for non-TOD dissonants). TOD policies should focus on reducing the level of dissonance in TODs in order to enhance transit ridership. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We address these questions using data collected from employee surveys conducted in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Serbia. Employing a composite measure, we find that younger workers tend to adhere more strongly, and older workers less strongly. This result is obtained in the majority of cases for the individual work ethic components, as well. We also find work ethic adherence is stronger among men than women, among supervisors, and among participants who exhibit an internal locus of control.

The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) are shadowed by professional and academic economists who provide a separate policy rate recommendation in advance of the central bank announcement. In this paper, we systematically evaluate this second opinion and find that, first, the shadow committee of the ECB tends to be relatively less inflation averse than the ECB. In contrast, the shadow committee of the BoE proposes a more hawkish monetary policy stance than the BoE. Second, consensus within a shadow committee is far easier to reach when there is no pressure to change the policy rate. Third, the ECB's shadow committee is more activist than the ECB's Governing Council and a larger degree of consensus within the former brings about a greater likelihood that the two committees will agree.

The current study provides an overview of the literature that refers to anticipated pride and guilt within the NAM. Moreover, we aim to increase our understanding of these associations through theoretical arguments and a study conducted in the Netherlands. We hypothesised that anticipated pride and guilt cause individuals to behave themselves in a manner that is in line with personal norms. This proposition regarding the self-regulatory function of anticipated pride and guilt was confirmed by our study; anticipated emotions mediate the effects of personal norms on behaviour. These associations remained after including the Theory of Planned Behaviour in the NAM, although in the integrated NAMTPB model, anticipated emotions affected behaviour via behavioural intentions.

In particular, we focus on the increased role of pass-through entities and the declining significance of the taxable corporate form. Our analysis suggests that significant reductions in the corporate tax rate, absent changes in the personal tax rate, will likely reverse the organizational form incentives that have existed since TRA86. Further, if the loss in revenue from a rate reduction is offset by a broadening of the tax base, most business entities, comprising most business income, are likely to face an overall increase in their tax burden.","[Plesko, George A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Accounting, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Toder, Eric J.] Urban Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Toder, Eric J.] Tax Policy Ctr, Washington, DC USA",University of Connecticut; Urban Institute,"Plesko, GA (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Accounting, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",gplesko@uconn.edu; etoder@urban.org,"Plesko, George A/B-5113-2013",,,,,,12,6,7,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Three hypotheses and their verification give the answer to this question. The hipotheses are as follow: the Poczta Polska SA is operator which ratify the Universal Postal Convention, therefore, pro-environmental and pro-social goals should be part of their actions; Operators involved in environmental and social activities take official strategy CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) and officially announce it publicly, for instance, on their own websites; actions speak for themselves - the entity involved in the particular area will be actively participate in it, so that its operation will be known to the public.

As of late 2012, thirty-two U.S. states and Puerto Rico had enacted legislation enabling the use of PPPs. PPP enabling laws address such issues as the treatment of unsolicited PPP proposals, prior legislative approval of PPP contracts, and the mixing of public and private funds. We utilize 13 key elements of PPP enabling laws to develop an index reflecting the degree to which a state's-law is encouraging or discouraging of private infrastructure investment. We examine why states pass such laws, and why some states pass legislation that is relatively more favorable to private investment. We consider demand side, supply side, and political/institutional drivers of passage. Vehicle registration growth and greater traffic congestion both increase the likelihood of passage, as does political agreement between a state's executive and legislative branches. Traffic congestion, growth in per-capita income, and the percent of Republicans in the state's House of Representatives all increase a law's favorability to private investment. There is little indication that traditional public finance variables, such as federal highway aid, affect the likelihood of passage or the favorability of a state's PPP enabling law.

Using a comprehensive sample of stock option repricings announced between 2004 and 2009, we find that repricing firms following the restrictive policies of proxy advisors exhibit statistically lower market reactions to the repricing, lower operating performance, and higher employee turnover. These results are consistent with the conclusion that proxy advisory firm recommendations regarding stock option repricings are not value increasing for shareholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I use data from the 1993, 1998 and 2003 National Survey of Small Business Finances to explore how firms fare after a bankruptcy filing. On the positive side, previously bankrupt firms are not any more burdened than the average small firm by problems relating to profitability, cash flow, health insurance costs, or taxes. Further, the fact that these firms are surviving several years after the filing is itself a testament to the efficient functioning of the US bankruptcy system. It suggests that the bankruptcy system goes a long way toward helping businesses recover after a bankruptcy filing. However, the one area of concern that persists after a filing is financing or credit access. In general, these firms have a nearly 24 percentage point higher likelihood of being denied a loan and are charged interest rates that are more than 1 percentage point higher than those charged to other businesses. A bankruptcy affects all types of financing, even trade credit, which is a significant form of lending between businesses. In fact, it appears that firms with a bankruptcy record are rationed out of the market, with all types of loans being denied at significantly higher rates than other firms. Further, my results show that bankruptcy leads to a class of discouraged borrowers who are significantly less likely to even apply for a loan. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our model permits us to analyze the response of regulatory policy to political factors, such as the size of a group of informed voters and the accuracy of their information about the incumbent. We also show that the extent of voter influence on policy outcomes is shaped by the state of market demand.

VaR is the basis of Basel II, and all three approaches are proposed in Basel III. This paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, we prove that these three rules provide an incentive to increase the probability of catastrophic financial institution failure. Collectively, these rules provide an incentive to increase (not decrease) systemic risk. Second, we argue that an unintended consequence of the Basel II VaR capital adequacy rules was the 2007 credit crisis. Third, we argue that to reduce systemic risk, a new capital adequacy rule is needed.

Brand perception affects financial policy through reducing overall firm riskiness, as strong consumer evaluations translate into lower future cash flow volatility as well as higher credit ratings for potentially volatile firms.

There is evidence of contrarian investor behaviour following an increase in yields, but continuation of order imbalances when yields are falling (the prices of bond futures are rising). International bond futures markets are strongly intertwined with the US market having a strong influence on the returns and order-flow across all countries; this is likely an indication of the spill-over effect of US macroeconomic data.

Therefore, using an infinite-horizon representative agent model calibrated with data for the Brazilian Amazon, this paper analyzes how improved property rights influence the frontier farmer's investment in the land, as well as the farmer's consumption and debt. Three channels through which property rights affect these variables are identified in the analysis. Two involve the expenditure the farmer incurs to defend the land claim, and the third involves the interest rate premium the farmer faces when borrowing without a clear title to the land. Variants of the model allow for labor to defend the land claim and for endogenous property rights. The findings suggest a need and direction for further, empirical research, particularly with regard to informal institutional arrangements, measures of property rights and the means by which they are defended.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Asheville, NC 28804 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina - Asheville,"Tatum, RC (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, CPO 2110,1 Univ Hts, Asheville, NC 28804 USA.",rtatum@unca.edu,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

A financially-constrained inventor invests in an idea which she then sells to a buyer. The buyer in turn invests in developing this idea into a marketable product. We propose a novel formulation of ex ante control rights of an IP buyer, over the financially-constrained IP seller. We do not assume alienability of the inventor's ideas; the control right is defined as ex ante prescribed prohibition of ex interim financial contracting with third parties. We show that such an agreement strengthens the seller's ex ante incentives to invest in the quality of her product which is to be traded at the interim stage. The enforcement of this control right is credible, or renegotiation-proof, only for the controlling buyer (a downstream user of the IP), and not for other potential partners of the seller, such as independent venture capitalists.

Our results show that the more time a party remains in office, the higher is the likelihood of leaving it. However, more flexible polynomial-in-time, cubic splines and time-dummies specifications show that the behaviour of that likelihood is not monotonic: it increases but only until the third term, then it decreases until the sixth term before starting to increase again. This study also shows that the likelihood of an incumbent party leaving office, given his tenure, is affected by the local economic environment, political support, the effective number of parties, the dimension of the municipality and the age of its leader. Additionally, it shows that that likelihood is consistently lower when the party leader/mayor decides to run for another term. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The results also confirm that political variables are important and that they influence the likelihood of seeking reelection in much the same way as they affect vote and popularity functions.","[Castro, Vitor; Martins, Rodrigo] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Castro, Vitor] NIPE, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Martins, Rodrigo] GEMF, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Castro, V (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Ave Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal.",vcastro@fe.uc.pt; rodrigom@fe.uc.pt,"Martins, Rodrigo/AIC-5971-2022; Castro, Vítor/P-4837-2019","Martins, Rodrigo/0000-0003-0340-5495; Castro, Vítor/0000-0002-6426-6663",,,,,54,7,11,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2013,156.0,3-4,,,,,677,702,,10.1007/s11127-012-9922-3,0.0,,,26,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,184NK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321897600014,0

We show that in an economy calibrated to U.S. data, variations in financial frictions on capital allocation in response to news about future technology can generate aggregate TFP fluctuations and, thus, trigger business cycles before the actual technological change is realized. Using the COMPUSTAT dataset, we find that the relative capital productivity of financially constrained to unconstrained firms is highly countercyclical. Moreover, our VAR analysis shows that news shocks can account for a substantial fraction of the relative capital productivity fluctuations over business cycle frequencies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The growth of Chinese exports in world trade,REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Chinese exports; Constant market share analysis; Export shares,,"The growth of Chinese exports in market share over the past two decades is a singular event in the history of world trade. Using data from 1995-2010, we document this growth in a variety of ways. We show that the expanded trade is pervasive. Virtually every country in the world has seen China claim a larger share of its import market. Then, we use Constant Market Share analysis to determine which country or countries have lost market share as China's trade has grown. Contrary to much discussion in the popular press, we find strong evidence that other developing countries have not seen export shares fall as a result of China's gains. Rather, our results suggest that China's share growth has come largely at the expense of exporters based in developed countries, especially Japan and the United States.","[Husted, Steven] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15216 USA; [Nishioka, Shuichiro] W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; West Virginia University,"Husted, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, 4508 WW Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15216 USA.",husted1@pitt.edu; Shuichiro.Nishioka@mail.wvu.edu,,"Nishioka, Shuichiro/0000-0001-7808-7159",,,,,20,17,20,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We advance understanding of the effects of diverse beliefs and overconfidence among investors in their ability to assess the sovereign's creditworthiness. Theoretically, we find that demand for insurance against default is positively related to the absolute difference between the market price of sovereign risk and the risk forecasted by the economy's fundamentals. We find preliminary support for this prediction in a newly available dataset on sovereign credit default swaps (CDSs): after controlling for the size of the public debt, the absolute size of the gap between the actual and forecasted spreads is positively related to the value of outstanding CDSs.
