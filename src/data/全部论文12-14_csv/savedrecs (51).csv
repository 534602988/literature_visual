We analyze plot level adoption decisions of SIPs by male, female or joint plot managers within the household, controlling for household characteristics, asset wealth and land quality factors that condition investments in intensification options. Using a multivariate probit model, we find gender differences in the adoption pattern for some SIPs. Compared to male plot mangers, female managers are less likely to adopt minimum tillage and animal manure in crop production, indicating the existence of certain socioeconomic inequalities and barriers for female farmers. However, we find no gender differences in the adoption of soil and water conservation measures, improved seed varieties, chemical fertilizers, maize-legume intercropping, and maize-legume rotations.

The farm size distribution and the existence of an inverse relationship (IR) between farm size and land productivity in SSA and the implications of this relationship for efficiency and equity are investigated. More secure property rights and removal of restrictions on land markets have the potential to create both efficiency and equity benefits, but there are high risks of elite capture of large land areas with inefficient and inequitable outcomes. This situation is the case not only in land-abundant areas but also in urban and pen-urban areas where increasingly larger proportions of people will make their living. Increasing population pressure in densely populated rural areas contributes to more rapid rural-urban migration, and creating alternative livelihood opportunities for the migrating youth population is essential to achieving economic development with social stability.

To this end, it distinguishes between root, conditional, and internal drivers of price changes using three empirical models: (1) a price spike model where monthly food price returns (spikes) are estimated against oil prices, supply and demand shocks, and excessive speculative activity; (2) a volatility model where annualized monthly variability of food prices is estimated against the same set of variables plus a financial crises index; and (3) a trigger model that estimates extreme values of price spikes and volatility using quantile regressions. The results point to the increasing linkages among food, energy, and financial markets, which explain much of the observed food price spikes and volatility. While financial speculation amplifies short-term price spikes, oil price volatility intensifies medium-term price volatility. (C) 2013 The authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Serrano Cheese case, Campos de Cima da Serra region, Brazil",FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food safety regulations; Zero microbiological contamination; Traditional food; Raw milk cheese; Food risk perceptions,KNOWLEDGE DYNAMICS; QUALITY; MILK,"Although some authors and policymakers have been considering the valorisation of traditional food as a strategy to revitalise rural areas, the commercialisation of such foods in formal markets demands strict compliance with food safety regulations. This is particularly so in relation to building structures and equipment. However, many of these requirements, based on an expectation of zero microbiological contamination, represent a big challenge to traditional food production and commercialisation; they often put in jeopardy the very characteristics that make these foods unique, diverse and desirable. Taking this context into account, how would it be possible to overcome the challenges that food safety regulations represent to the valorisation and maintenance of the individuality and diversity of traditional and artisanal food? This paper, inspired by the Cultural Theory of risk, considers the case of traditional cheeses, particularly those made from raw milk and using wooden surfaces, moulds and utensils, which are commonly used in many Latin American countries. The aim is to amplify the debate related to traditional food valorisation, particularly regarding artisanal cheeses. To do this, we consider the case of Serrano Cheese, an artisanal cheese made from unpasteurised milk in Campos de Cima da Serra, a region located in the southernmost state of Brazil. A field study inspired by the ethnographic method was carried out in this region. The data collected indicate that besides adapting production and expertise to food safety regulations, the valorisation of traditional food depends firstly on understanding the risk perceptions related to these products and secondly on recognising and legitimating traditional forms of knowledge.

We use a four-year panel dataset to estimate the effects of hybrid seed use on four indicators of household welfare, namely, income, assets, inequality and poverty. Results show that use of hybrid seed not only contributes to higher annual income, but also to raising the value of assets, possibly reflecting longer-term welfare effects. Further, we find that use of hybrid seed reduces the depth of poverty, and that the amount planted reduces inequality. As expected, impacts differ between major and minor maize-growing areas of the country. Maize farmers who do not use hybrid seed are clearly disadvantaged. This calls for continued public and private investments in the infrastructure and policy process that supports a competitive, liberalized seed industry and improved access of smallholder farmers to well-adapted, affordable hybrids.

We adopted endogenous switching regression treatment effects complemented with a binary propensity score matching methodology to test robustness and reduced selection bias stemming from both observed and unobserved characteristics. We expand this further with the generalized propensity score (GPS) approach to evaluate the effects of continuous treatment on the response of the outcome variables. We find a consistent result across models indicating that adoption increases food security and farm households that did adopt would also have benefited significantly had they adopted new varieties. This study supports the need for vital investments in agricultural research for major food staples widely consumed by the poor, and efforts to improve access to modern varieties and services. Policies that enhance diffusion and adoption of modern wheat varieties should be central to food security strategies in Ethiopia.

Diet-related health problems are, however, more likely among households with high intakes of unhealthy foods or low intakes of healthy foods than in households with average intakes. In this article, we focus on purchases of healthy and unhealthy foods among low-, median-, and high-purchasing households. The effects of an increase in the Norwegian value-added tax (VAT) on some unhealthy foods and a removal of the VAT on some healthy foods are investigated. Using censored quantile regressions, we reject equality of the own-price elasticities for eight of nine food and beverage groups. We find that a VAT increase is more effective in reducing purchases of unhealthy foods among high-purchasing households than a VAT removal is in increasing the purchases of healthy foods among low-purchasing households.

Despite belonging to the same sub-regional organization, the formal trade ties between Cameroon and its neighbours have been hampered by a combination of factors that have spurred the growth of informal (unrecorded) trade. Interest in cross-border trade of agricultural and horticultural commodities between Cameroon and its neighbours has been overwhelming, but knowledge of its magnitude, determinants, and consequences remains inadequate, leading not only to undervaluation of figures in the national accounts, but also inhibiting formulation of appropriate policies and strategies to exploit its potential impact, particularly on food security. Using a monitoring method of cross-border flows of informal trade, the study aims to estimate the volume/value of unrecorded cross-border trade between Cameroon and its CEMAC's neighbours and compare it with the recorded (official figures) trade. The results indicate that in 2008 a volume of just over 155000 tons of agricultural and horticultural commodities has been shipped from Cameroon to its neighbours in the CEMAC for an estimated value of almost 38 billion CFA francs and representing 0.4% of GDP in Cameroon. The comparison in relative terms shows that informal or unrecorded trade represents 96% of the official and mainly includes agricultural and horticultural commodities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to high monitoring costs and low technical potential for emission reductions, a tax on consumption may be a more efficient policy instrument to decrease emissions from agriculture than a tax based directly on emissions from production. In this study, we look at the effect of internalising the social costs of greenhouse gas emissions through a tax based on CO2 equivalents for 23 different foods. Furthermore, we compare the loss in consumer surplus and the changed dietary composition for different taxation scenarios. In the most efficient scenario, we find a decrease in the carbon footprint from foods for an average household of 2.3-8.8% at a cost of 0.15-1.73 DKK per kg CO2 equivalent whereas the most effective scenario led to a decrease in the carbon footprint of 10.4-19.4%, but at a cost of 3.53-6.90 DKK per kg CO2 equivalent. The derived consequences for health show that scenarios where consumers are not compensated for the increase in taxation level lead to a decrease in the total daily amount of kJ consumed, whereas scenarios where the consumers are compensated lead to an increase. Most scenarios lead to a decrease in the consumption of saturated fat.

The present study makes a systematic attempt to assess the extent and degree of integration among select agricultural markets in India. We have used the common factor representation of the cointegrated series, called Gonzalo-Granger (G-C) model, to assess the extent of market integration. Degree of market integration has been assessed using the persistence profile approach. Our results indicate that the commodity markets that do not face inter-state or inter-regional movement restrictions, like gram and edible oils, appear well-integrated. On the contrary, rice market, subject to the maximum inter-state movement restrictions, does not show integration at the national level. The broad implication of the study is that the markets can play a more effective role if supplemented with more open policy initiatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a static positive programming model which simultaneously solves a set of microeconomic farm models reproducing the behaviour of representative individual farm households. This model is designed to capture key features of developing countries' agriculture such as the non-separability of production and consumption decisions due to market imperfections, the inter-linkage between transaction costs and market participation decisions, the interaction among farm households for factor markets and the seasonality of resource use. Model use is illustrated in this paper by simulating the impact of rice seed policy on the livelihood of representative smallholder farmers in Sierra Leone. Results show that the seed policy would improve farm productivity and boost household income but that it is not sufficient to fight poverty since 90% of the surveyed farm households would continue to live below the extreme poverty line of 1 USD-equivalent per person per day.

Drawing on both theory and empirical evidence, this paper argues that fundamental impacts of links between agricultural productivity sustainability and real food price changes are often overlooked in current policy analysis. This is exacerbated by a lack of relevant and accessible indicators for monitoring agricultural productivity sustainability and real food prices. Two relatively simple and widely applicable sets of indicators are proposed for use in policy development and monitoring. Historical series of these indices are estimated for selected countries, regions and the world. Their strengths, weaknesses and potential value are then discussed in the context of the need for better sustainable agricultural development and food security indicators in any post 2015 successors to the current MDGs.

Following the use of front-of-pack nutrition labels on pre-packed foods, the provision of easily accessible nutrition information on foods prepared and consumed out of home is a highly topical policy issue with the potential to help consumers making better informed and more healthy food choices when eating out. Information that is presented in a format preferred by the target group is more likely to be used. A sample of 1725 university canteen users participated in a web-based choice experiment designed to identify and understand individual preferences for alternative nutrition labels on canteen meals. Participants valued the presence of nutrition labels on canteen meals and showed a preference for more detailed formats. Ability and motivation to process information as well as socio-demographics explained differences in label preferences. Observed decreasing marginal utility from combinations of two simple label formats as well as from combinations of two detailed formats, signalled information insufficiency versus information overload, respectively. In order to satisfy most canteen users' information needs, a nutrition label that contains basic Guideline Daily Amount (GDA)-type of numerical information in combination with familiar visual aids like stars and colour codes is proposed to be used in university canteens.

To help identify specific areas where additional investment is most needed, this study compares the impact potential for the poor of alternative agricultural research foci, taking changes in production patterns, consumption patterns and environmental sustainability into account. New spatial data on the distribution of poverty and the expenditure patterns of households below international poverty lines are used to offer more detailed assessment of the poverty relevance of alternative foci than possible previously. Patterns of impact potential are evaluated against evidence of impact to date to discern probabilities of success in achieving potential impacts. Impact patterns discerned are contrasted with current relative funding allocations across research areas in the subregion by National Agricultural Research Systems (NARSs) and International Agricultural Research Centers (IARCs) to identify key funding gaps. Research on rice, vegetables, fruit and aquaculture is identified as having the largest gap between current investments and expected impacts. The rice research gap is the most pronounced, as it is the single source of a substantial share of quantified potential future benefits for the poor, has positive expected environmental benefits, and has a strong record of documented impact to date in the subregion. Vegetables, fruit and aquaculture appear to have greater relative impact potential for the poor and nutritional benefits than their funding shares, but the track record of impact to date is more limited and the likelihood of success for such investments is more uncertain.

An important dimension along which the otherwise similar programs differed was the fertilizer distribution strategy. Fertilizer distribution among program participants was done at the individual level for one set of farmers, while the fertilizer was given indirectly through a group representative for the other set. Where fertilizer was given to a group representative for further distribution to members, relatives of the farm group's president received more bags of fertilizer than others. Where fertilizer was given directly to farmers such results did not obtain. This differential outcome suggests that while groups may facilitate the process of farmer identification and coordination, elite capture and intra group dynamics may affect their efficacy for providing equal access to inputs for members. Two-tier models enable us to model the potentially separate processes that determine participation in the voucher program and the amount of fertilizer received, upon deciding to participate. With intentions to adopt and scale up voucher programs in various food security and poverty alleviation programs across developing countries, it is important to understand when and how farmer groups can affect the successful implementation of such programs.

One way of mitigating these adverse effects is to provide food aid. In this study we evaluate the impact of a World Food Programme intervention on household food security and asset protection among conflict-affected households in Northern Uganda. We employ propensity score matching to estimate the average treatment effect on food expenditure, food consumption and preservation of assets using a sample of 1265 observations from a 2008 survey. Our results reveal that the operation's system of targeting beneficiaries was effective and in accordance with programme objectives. Food aid considerably reduced food expenditure of households, suggesting that recipients were net buyers of food, and that the food aid received was effectively consumed within the household. A corresponding positive effect on non-food expenditure was not found. Our results also indicate that food aid was effective in increasing meals consumed and in avoiding distress destocking of low value assets, but, surprisingly, only for male headed households.

Using a stated choice experiment, we initially find that Flemish consumers are willing to pay a positive price premium of some 33 eurocent per kilogram for labeled organic apples. After the provision of information on the actual environmental and health effects of organic apple production, this price premium becomes even more pronounced and increases to 57 eurocent per kilogram. Using a conditional logit model with covariates and a mixed logit model, we find evidence of preference heterogeneity. Also, the effect of information provision is more pronounced for certain groups of consumers such as non-vegetarians, infrequent buyers of organic products and members of a nature protection organization. As such, this paper illustrates that there is a role for policy makers and CSR producers in providing more accurate and reliable information about socially responsible production processes. Moreover, it is important to take the observed preference heterogeneity into account and tailor policies to specific consumer groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates how time delays affect product quality, product price, trade flow, and social welfare, using data on the days it takes to clear customs in 96 countries. We explore the impacts of time delays on product quality and price with different levels of perishability. We find that longer time delays at the border would significantly decrease highly perishable agricultural products' quality and price. We also find that for highly perishable agricultural products, improved and simplified customs delays would increase trade flows and social welfare of importing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For welfare labelling to be viable the market for livestock products produced to higher welfare standards has to be sufficiently segmented with consumers having sufficiently distinct and behaviourally consistent preferences. The present study investigates consumers' preferences for meat produced to different welfare standards using a hypothetical welfare score. Data is obtained from a contingent valuation study carried out in Britain. The ordered probit model was estimated using Bayesian inference to obtain mean willingness to pay. We find decreasing marginal WTP as animal welfare levels increase and that people's preferences for different levels of farm animal welfare are sufficiently differentiated making the introduction of a labelling scheme in the form of a certified rating system appear feasible.

In order to achieve this aim, a mixed rank-ordered logit which allows for the investigation of heterogeneous preferences and their sources has been estimated. In particular, we have analysed to what extent consumers' socio-demographic traits affect their price-sensitiveness and whether consumers' sensory (hedonic) valuations and attitudes towards ham with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) affect the preferences for specific attributes. Results show that consumers with a low-medium age and income are more price sensitive. Consumers more inclined sensorially towards the regional specialty (with or without PDO) are more likely to purchase this product, and consumers with a more favourable attitude towards PDO ham are also more prone to purchase cured ham with quality certification. Findings also suggest that although the PDO scheme attracts a segment of consumers, the origin by itself is still a more powerful signal of quality, and more specifically the region of origin.

For a number of reasons, including lack of data in some instances, the short-run analytical approach has embedded an assumption of equal percentage price changes for consumers and producers. This assumption implies that food marketing costs change by the same percentage, because an x percent change in both farm prices and consumer prices implies that there must also be an x percent change in their difference. But this paper shows that most marketing costs are fixed, not proportional, and further that assuming proportional marketing costs leads to a bias towards finding negative impacts of higher food prices. The magnitude of the bias is shown to be greater than that from failing to incorporate supply and demand responses to price changes, and can be substantial relative to the effect estimated without incorporating the bias. In addition, the bias is not necessarily uniform across income classes; thus, failure to explicitly consider marketing margins has the potential to reverse the relative magnitudes of the impact on rich and poor.

We describe the structures and institutions that perform these standards and their inclusion in, and impacts on, China's agricultural sector, which is characterized by a polarization between widespread smallholder production and emerging consolidated entrepreneurial farm enterprises branded as ecological. Based on 95 key informant interviews conducted between 2010 and 2012, we discuss the contradictions within state- and civil society-led paths to zero. We argue that the government's commitment to ecological agriculture is superficial. Due in part to the context of a state-driven yet market-oriented economy with limited civil society involvement, the system of extensive standards has not been clearly communicated to Chinese consumers. Nor has it garnered public trust in the food system, as evidenced by a rapidly expanding 'alternative' food sector, including community supported agriculture (CSA) ventures and home delivery schemes, many of which are based on producers and consumers negotiating trust rather than relying on the quality assurance of certification. But consumers are motivated by seeking zero food safety risk, and show limited concern about environmental protection or farmer livelihoods. Some exceptions are patrons of values-oriented CSAs, farmers' markets, and buying clubs, which point to interesting trajectories for the future of China's food system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This requires assessments of project performance at all stages of implementation, comprising ex-ante impact assessment, monitoring and evaluation, and ex-post attribution of outcomes. Ex-ante impact assessment, in particular, involves performing Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to determine the Expected Net Present Value (ENPV) of the project in question. Unfortunately, the traditional ENPV approach has proven inadequate for dealing with uncertainty in the timing of investments and flexibility in future decision making. This is especially relevant for Research and Development (R&D) projects which require several stages of product development and multiple rounds of testing prior to releasing final products. As a consequence, the real-options approach to CBA has increasingly been used to evaluate private sector R&D projects. This paper advocates for the adoption of the real options approach in the evaluation of public investments in agricultural research, and illustrates its practical utility with an assessment conducted by USAID to determine the economic viability of a proposed project to develop improved varieties of critical food security crops in Uganda.

In Bangladesh, estimates suggest that the country's potential rice-fish production system encompasses 2-3 million hectares of land. But despite three decades of research on biophysical and technical aspects of rice-fish systems, this potential has not been fully realized due to insufficient attention given to the social, economic, and policy dimensions of rice-fish system improvement. This paper provides a characterization of the diverse and changing nature of rice-fish systems in Bangladesh to shed new light on the economic viability of different rice-fish systems and recommend policy and investment options to accelerate the development of appropriate rice-fish technologies. Data are drawn from a novel subdistrict-level survey of fishery officers, a household/enterprise survey, focus group discussions, and a meta-review of the literature on aquaculture in the country, all of which were conducted in 2010-2011. Findings indicate that concurrent rice-fish systems, alternating rice-fish systems, and collectively managed systems offer considerable potential for increasing productivity and farm incomes in Bangladesh. Findings also suggest that while innovation in these rice-fish systems is being driven by households and communities, there is need for more supportive government policies and investments to enable further innovation. Policymakers need to develop effective regulations to promote feed and fish quality and quantity, for example. More rigorous analysis of the intended and unintended impacts of these policies and investments is also necessary. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We explore the impact of different labeling regimes on consumer attitudes towards GM products and consumer welfare. Our experimental results illustrate that these consumer attitudes do not follow the Uniform distribution as has often been assumed in the literature but instead fit an adjusted Kumaraswamy distribution. If a Uniform distribution is assumed, the advantage of mandatory labeling would be exaggerated. Using an adjusted Kumaraswamy distribution our simulation results demonstrate that voluntary labeling is superior to mandatory labeling with the higher separation cost, while mandatory labeling is not necessarily better with lower separation cost. Therefore, the governments of China and other countries with similar consumer characteristics should consider voluntary labeling for GM food while encouraging innovations that reduce the price of GM food as well as controlling the opportunistic behavior of its producers so as to enhance the advantage of voluntary labeling.

For food safety training to be effective, employee behavior must be assessed following training in order to reduce the risks of foodborne illness. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of manager training and how this training impacted the grocery stores' performance related to hot/cold self-serve bars. Three grocery store chains were recruited and each chain selected 15 stores to be observed pre- and post-training during set-up, lunch, and tear-down of the bars. After the pre-training observation, managers from eight stores per chain attended a food safety training course (training group), while managers from the remaining seven stores received no additional training (control group). Following the training, all stores were observed to collect post-training data. The information from the observations indicated that the training did not cause a significant change in store performance for a majority of the observed categories. Many state policies only call for training and certification of managers in retail food service establishments. This study showed that it may be time for these policies to be changed to include employee training and certification as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Rowell, A.

Using a modification of the GTAP modeling platform to account for the global interactions of regional biofuel and food markets, the analysis shows that biofuel production levels depend on the assumption about the future price of energy and the nature of the substitutability between biofuels and petroleum-based transport fuels. Low energy prices reduce the demand for biofuels and thus require greater government support to meet the desired production targets. At the other extreme, when prices are high and there is scope for substituting biofuels for petroleum-based fuels, the volume of biofuels produced will exceed the mandates. Even when biofuels are being mainly produced in developed countries, our results indicate that there are impact pathways that extend far beyond the borders of the US, Brazil and the EU. Prices of feedstock and non-feedstock commodities rise in developing countries. There is also a rise in value added from the agricultural sector a gain that is enjoyed by the owners of land and labor, including unskilled. Hence, to the extent that agriculture is a key sector in getting growth started and addressing poverty needs, the emergence of biofuels can (in this way at least) be a positive force.

Some US states, however, have proactively adopted their own SCC limit to mirror the EU limit. The purpose of this study was to analyze the impacts on Wisconsin dairy producers if Wisconsin should adopt the current EU limit and compliance criterion. Analyses were done on SCC results for Wisconsin Grade A and Grade B dairy producers reported each month to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (WDATCP) during January 1, 2009-December 31, 2012. Results were evaluated against the current US Grade A and EU compliance criteria for SCC and the percentage of (producer x month) combinations in compliance was determined. If the current EU SCC compliance criterion was in place, 86.7-94.3 and 64.3-77.3% of Wisconsin Grade A and Grade B (producer x month) combinations, respectively, would have been in compliance for the years 2009-2012. Compliance of Wisconsin Grade A and Grade B producers with the existing US SCC compliance criterion during the same period was 99.3-99.7% and 87.9-93.9% (producer x month combinations) respectively.

Yet, little empirical research has assessed the relationship between farm diversity and diet diversity or the plausible causal mechanisms that may operate between these two constructs. This research examines cross-sectional data from the Malawi Third Integrated Household Survey (IHS3), a nationally representative sample of farming households in Malawi, implemented from March 2010 March 2011 as part of the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA). These data were used to determine the relationship between farm production diversity and household dietary diversity, and to identify determinants of this relationship. Two indicators of dietary diversity, a modified Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS), and the Food Consumption Score (FCS), were calculated along with three indicators of farm production diversity including the Simpson's Index, a metric accounting for both species richness and evenness. In multiple regression analyses, adjusting standard errors for the complex survey design of the IHS3 and controlling for the effects of several covariates on household dietary diversity, farm production diversity was consistently positively associated with dietary diversity (P < 0.0001). The association of increased farm diversity as measured by a combined crop and livestock measure on dietary diversity was significantly greater in woman-headed households compared to those headed by men (HDDS: P = 0.008; FCS: P = 0.076). The positive association of farm diversity with dietary diversity was also greater in wealthier households (P < 0.05). Consumption of legumes, vegetables and fruits was especially strongly associated with greater farm diversity. More diverse production systems may contribute to more diverse household diets. However, this relationship is complex; it may be influenced by gender, wealth, control of household decisions, the relative market-orientation of a household's agricultural production, and the specific nature of farm diversity.

While there is a growing literature on the food practices of 'alternative' consumers, 'mainstream' consumers are less well understood. This paper describes qualitative research undertaken in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area of Sydney, Australia, which aimed to uncover consumer views towards sustainable and healthy diets. Most participants indicated a discrepancy between their desired and actual behaviours: while they want to support Australian, or local, food producers they gravitate towards cheap and tasty food from 'anywhere'; and while they associate nutritious food with fresh food, they will buy processed foods which can be less expensive, appeal to children and are prone to less waste. Reflecting mainstream Australian political culture, participants were compromising household food budgets in order to pursue a socially acceptable standard of living (including decent housing, car-reliance). They were also incorporating the pleasure and desires of family members as part of 'the moral arts of everyday life'. Using social theories of consumption and practice sociology we argue that food choices and practices - easy or not - need to be interpreted as part of the role that consumption plays in political citizenship and moral subjectivity. In the Western Sydney context, food practices are essentially household budget and family nourishment practices rather than nutrition and sustainability practices; a position which is not addressed in the government's new food policies or wage determination processes.

This paper questions whether these SSFC contribute or not to the preservation and/or development of urban agriculture in the Ile-de-France Region (Paris and surrounding areas), where agriculture still represents a major land use activity (more than 50%). Based on documentary and empirical research the analysis shows that a quarter of farms are involved in SSFC in this region. Taking different forms, these SSFC initiatives are for the majority very recent, they often develop in the frame of hybrid forms of farming. Even though the contribution of SSFC in the total food supply of the Parisian region is poorly informed, and probably very small, the recent interest of consumers, inhabitants, and territorial stakeholders in organic and/or local food is real and has encouraged various types of incentives and commitments. The development of SSFC in the Paris region nevertheless faces numerous obstacles such as the scarcity of land and labour and the environmental impacts that still remain controversial. Promoting the role of SSFCs in the preservation of a sustainable urban agriculture requires access to more statistical and comparative data, which are currently unavailable. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper studies the underlying factors involved in determining consumers' choice behaviour towards GM foods in order to develop an integrated analytical framework. Reliable information about consumers' behaviour towards GM foods should lead to the design of political strategies intended to make citizens feel safe in their purchasing choices. In addition, there is an analysis of behavioural differences due to consumers' objective knowledge levels. The research was performed in southern Spain using variance-based structural equation modelling, namely the Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression technique. The results support those arguments that connect consumers' behavioural intentions, attitudes and different factors involved in determining consumer choice, because attitudes towards GM foods link consumer purchasing intentions to the perceived benefits and risks posed by GM foods. Furthermore, there are some insights into the moderating role played by the consumers' level of knowledge in their purchase intentions to GM food. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a new framework to examine the effects of dietary knowledge on nutrient intake and diet quality. The framework allows the effects to differ by one's expectation about food availability (EFA). Using data from China, we find that dietary knowledge affects mainly the quantity of diet (e.g., lowering total calorie intake) when EFA is increasing, while it affects mainly the quality of diet (e.g., lowering the share of calories from oils) when EFA is decreasing. The effect on the quantity is larger among overweight adults, while the effect on the quality is more significant among non-overweight adults. Without distinguishing the direction of changes in EFA as in previous studies, the estimated effects of dietary knowledge tend to be smaller. Thus, as an anti-obesity measure, dietary education may be more effective than indicated by previous studies under the situations where EFA increases (e.g., introducing food coupons), while only marginally effective under the situations where EFA decreases (e.g., increasing real food prices).

We test the main predictions of an international trade model based on firm heterogeneity in product quality and non-homothetic preferences in consumption. In this setting, the firm's export intensity should be increasing in the per-capita income of foreign destinations, and the effect should be largely driven by firms' heterogeneity in product quality. Using different measures of revenue-TFP, and different proxies for product quality, we find strong support for the main model predictions. Moreover, consistent with the Alchian-Allen effect, we find a positive relationship between the quality of exported products and the distance of destination countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This review provides an overview of the current legislative framework, discusses the concept of the 'average consumer' and brings together findings on consumer understanding from an international perspective. It examines factors related to the personal characteristics of individuals such as socio-demographic status, knowledge, and attitudes, and factors pertaining to food and food supplement products such as the wording of claims and the communication of the strength and consistency of the scientific evidence. As well as providing insights for future research, the conclusions highlight the importance of enhancing the communication of scientific evidence to improve consumer understanding of food health claims.

To date, however, there is little empirical evidence to substantiate this claim. This paper utilized data from two studies to explore whether consumers exposed to labels on genetically engineered foods expressed greater aversion to genetic engineering than consumers in control groups, who were exposed to decoy labels unrelated to the technology. We find little evidence of a signaling effect resulting from the mere exposure to labels. However, in Study 1, we find signaling operating in another fashion: there were stark differences in the implied willingness-to-pay to avoid genetically engineered foods when consumers were exposed to mandatory contains labels vs. voluntary does not contain labels. In study 1, we also find aversion to a non-GE technology - ethylene ripening - that is comparable to aversion to biotechnology. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The Networks used voluntary partnerships to influence peoples' choice architecture to move them toward healthier behaviors. The purpose of this research was to conduct an exploratory study of diverse stakeholders' perspectives about perceived responsibility and accountability expectations to improve food environments in England through the Food Network partnerships. A purposive sample of policy elites (n = 31) from government, academia, food industry and non-government organizations sorted 48 statements related to improving food environments in England. Statements were grounded in three theoretical perspectives (i.e., legitimacy, nudge and public health law). PQMethod 2.33 statistical software program used factor analysis to identify viewpoints based on intra-individual differences for how participants sorted statements. The results revealed three distinct viewpoints, which explained 64% of the variance for 31 participants, and emphasized different expectations about responsibility. The food environment protectors (n = 17) underscored government responsibility to address unhealthy food environments if voluntary partnerships are ineffective; the partnership pioneers (n = 12) recognized government-industry partnerships as legitimate and necessary to address unhealthy food environments; and the commercial market defenders (n = 1) emphasized individual responsibility for food choices and rejected government intervention to improve food environments. Consensus issues included: protecting children's right to health; food industry practices that can and should be changed; government working with industry on product reformulation; and building consumer support for economically viable healthy products. Contentious issues were: inadequacy of accountability structures and government inaction to regulate food marketing practices targeting children. We conclude that understanding different viewpoints is a step toward building mutual trust to strengthen accountability structures that may help stakeholders navigate ideologically contentious issues to promote healthy food environments in England.

Today these concerns are particularly relevant to Africa, with its rapid population growth, very small farms, and chronic food insecurity. In this paper we examine adaptation to falling land-labor ratios using a comprehensive theoretical framework in which households faced with binding land constraints can respond in three ways: intensifying agricultural production, diversifying out of agriculture, and reducing fertility rates. Using cross-country data and drawing upon the existing literature, we reach three conclusions. First, population density is associated with reduced fallows and more intensive use of land but not fertilizer use or irrigation, indicating major challenges in achieving sustainable intensification or agricultural productivity growth. Second, there is little evidence of successful non-farm diversification in response to land pressures in Africa from domestic or international income sources. Third, rural Africans in land constrained countries desire smaller families, but have thus far benefited little from family planning policies. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated multi-sectoral approach to sustainably reduce poverty in the region.

We utilize the most recent version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database, its global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, and the gravity border effect approach to estimate the ad-valorem tariff equivalents (AVEs) of non-tariff barriers (NTBs). In our overall analysis, we account for 24 various sectors. However, in our evaluation, we focus primarily on the food and agricultural sectors because this sector is characterized by high tariff and non-tariff protection. In the CGE simulation analysis, we consider the removal of tariffs and NTBs simultaneously. After projecting the GTAP framework to 2020, we conclude that Turkey would gain unambiguously from EU membership, whereas Turkey's gains from GAFTA membership would be more limited. The paper also presents that the welfare gains from the removal of NTBs are of considerable importance and would generally be greater than the gains stemming from the elimination of import tariffs.

However, key definitions of SI support quite different approaches; a report published by the Royal Society (Baulcombe et al., 2009) favours the land sparing model whilst a Foresight report (2011) favours land sharing. SI will require pragmatic and innovative policies, including further revision of the Environmental Stewardship Scheme and the development of landscape-scale governance within an over-arching strategic approach to planning. However, its innovation is its focus on unlocking the social at the expense of the private value of land (at those locations where non-market ecosystem services have a higher value than marketable agricultural products). Though scientific advances may help raise production efficiency through a better understanding of the trade-offs between agricultural production and ecosystem service provision, issues related to who controls the use of land will be the most difficult to resolve, which suggests a role for Boundary Organisational Theory (BOT) because of the insights this theory lends to negotiating complex problems. Within BOT terminology SI can be considered a boundary object about which stakeholders are able to negotiate site-specific issues to incrementally arrive at solutions which draw on the full range of land sharing and land sparing options and so avoid prescriptive approaches and technologies.

However, experiences from other world regions show that countries in transition are at high risk of entering conflicts, which often come at large economic, social and political costs. In order to identity options on how conflict may be prevented in Arab transition countries, this paper assesses the key global drivers of conflicts based on a dataset from 1960 to 2010 and improved cross-country regression techniques. Results show that unlike in other studies where per capita incomes, inequality, and poor governance, among other factors, emerge as the major determinants of conflict, food security at macro and household-levels emerges as the main cause of conflicts in the Arab World. The high exposure of Arab countries to global food price variations proves to be an important source of vulnerability for a peaceful Arab transition. If history is also a guide to the future, improving food security is not only important for improving the lives of rural and urban people; it is also likely to be the key for a peaceful transition. The paper concludes with a set of policy options on how to improve food security at macro and household-levels, including safeguard mechanisms against excessive price volatility, exportled and pro-poor growth, the creation/expansion of social safety nets and targeted nutrition programs.

Evidence from Malawi,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Africa; Agricultural input subsidies; Gender; Maize; Malawi; Technology adoption,TECHNOLOGY; PRODUCTIVITY; INNOVATIONS; FARMERS; WOMEN,"Nationally representative data for Malawi were used to measure the gender gap in adoption of modern maize and to investigate how, if at all, Malawi's Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) has impacted the gap. Regression results show the probability of adopting modern maize was 12% lower for wives in male-headed households, and 11% lower for female household heads, than for male farmers. Receipt of subsidized input coupons had no discernible effect on modern maize adoption for male farmers. Receiving a subsidy for both seed and fertilizer increased the probability of modern maize cultivation by 222% for female household heads, suggesting the FISP has likely reduced the gender gap in adoption of modern maize in Malawi.

In this paper, we examine the patterns and trends in food price volatility using an unusually rich database of African staple food prices. We find that international grain prices have become more volatile in recent years (2007-2010) but no evidence that food price volatility has increased in the region. This contrasts with the widespread view that food prices have become more volatile in the region since the global food crisis of 2007-2008. In addition, the results suggest that price volatility is lower for processed and tradable food than for nontradable food, that volatility is lower in the major cities than in secondary cities, and that maize price volatility is actually higher in countries with the most active intervention to stabilize maize prices. These findings suggest that greater attention should be given to the (high) level of food prices in the region rather than volatility per se, that regional and international trade can play a useful role in reducing food price volatility, and that traditional food price stabilization efforts may be counterproductive.

However, rinderpest is just one of two diseases that has been successfully eradicated globally. A major gap in the history of rinderpest concerns the socio-economic impacts of its control and eradication. While much has been documented on the epidemiological, technical, and institutional lessons resulting from rinderpest control and prevention, very little has been written on the implications for society at local, national, regional and global levels. In this paper, we provide a more rigorous methodological approach to the estimation of the global impact of rinderpest eradication that highlights the different levels of impacts and benefits associated with different groups of stakeholders.

Due to markets incompleteness, not all risks are insurable. We empirically test the theory (and the intuition) suggesting that people bearing an uninsurable background risk are less willing to bear other insurable risks and therefore increase their demand for insurance against insurable risks. We present a case study on the Palestinian Territories. We consider the implications of a background risk of food insecurity, a major formally uninsurable risk, using nationally representative household data. Using a bivariate probit model, we find that exposure to severe food insecurity risk increases the propensity to insure against health risks, and this propensity is increasing in background risk intensity. Our findings point to possible incentive changes towards the desirability of insurance that have implications for policy design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data on true sales in Italian supermarkets in the 2002-2004 period we estimate the structural demand model developed by Berry (1994). This approach allows us to solve potential endogeneity problem in the estimation of the price coefficient in the demand equation, as well as other aspects related to multiple sources of differentiation. In a market where 62 percent of organic jams are diet this approach allows us to identify separately the market power induced by the organic logo and by the low content of sugar. The estimation results from various specifications of GEV class of models show that the organic attribute guarantees a degree of market power greater than the diet attribute. However, the protection from competition entailed by the organic logo is not particularly strong, and the diet attribute does not guarantees additional protection to organic jams. Most importantly, our findings show that consumers trust more big organic producers thus suggesting important policy implications on the supply and marketing side of the jam market.

However, internationally harmonized EU standards-those that are equivalent to ISO norms-have much weaker trade effects, and in some cases are even trade-promoting. EU standards may have hurt developed countries more than developing countries, but this result is dependent on the sector.

However, very little long-term evidence from farmers' fields, accounting for variations in agro-ecological conditions, has been assembled to back this claim or determine the conditions under which it is true. Using five waves of nationwide household survey data from Kenya covering 13 years, we estimate the relative and absolute profitability of nitrogen application rates on maize fields and compare these profitability conditions to observed nitrogen use patterns over time. In general, we find that farmers are consistently and steadily increasing towards risk-adjusted economically optimal rates of fertilizer application over time and that, in the most agriculturally productive areas, farmers' application rates on maize sometimes exceed rates that maximize profitability. Fertilizer use rates may nevertheless be profitably raised in these areas, but doing so will require the adoption of complementary inputs and management practices that raise maize response rates to fertilizer application. This motivates a more holistic approach to input intensification strategies in the region. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Sheahan, Megan; Black, Roy; Jayne, T.

The goal of this study was to investigate the interaction between organic and local/traditional food in Lebanon from the perspective of an organic consumer. The attitude toward both their present interaction and possible developments were investigated. Interviews with 146 consumers were conducted at the farmers market and specialised shops in Beirut, where organic and local/traditional foods (baladi) are sold. The data collected from the questionnaires were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical analysis (structural equation model, t-test and ANOVA). The results show that the integration of organic and baladi foods seemed to be accepted largely as a future perspective; recent food scandals made baladi foods less reliable, which has negatively affected the contemporary organic consumer's attitude toward the relationship between baladi and organic products. The only statistically significant results emerged when this facet of consumer responses was analysed. Younger and wealthier organic food consumers, prone to integrate the more appealing gastronomic characteristics of local/traditional foods in their diet (foodies), seemed relatively more accepting of a joint marketing of organic and baladi foods. The farmers market seemed to play a central role in supporting a positive interaction between organic and baladi foods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

While there was a lot of attention on the criminal investigations and post scandal industrial shake up, less is known about the impact of the Milk Scandal and policy response on the dairy farmer. The main objectives of this study are to describe the policies that were implemented by the government in response to the Milk Scandal and analyze the effect of the policies on dairy producers. To meet the objectives of the study, the paper uses a primary data set collected by the authors in 25 dairy producing villages, including 231 households, in the Greater Beijing area. The data set documents the policies that were implemented by the government as well as the response of the dairy farmers both their participation in the dairy sector (stay in or drop out) and their herd size. Using descriptive and multivariate analyses on the changes in dairy production in the sample villages, the paper finds that, although dairy participation fell and herd sizes were reduced after the Milk Scandal, government policies did matter. Specifically, Marketing Management Policies were shown to have limited the fall in both participation and herd size.

A poor diet is a key explanatory factor to this development. Previous research has addressed the problem of unhealthy food consumption behavior by looking at how taxes may function as an instrument to change purchase behavior from less healthy products to healthier ones. In this paper we address this issue by looking at the effects of discounts depending on whether healthy or less healthy products are available at a discount. Our study is based on weekly purchase data from a Danish household panel for the period 2010-2011. Interestingly, from a public health perspective our findings suggest that there is an asymmetric effect of discounts depending on the fat content of the product. Furthermore, our results point at two classes of consumers where the asymmetric effects go in different directions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using survey data and accounting for selection bias in technology adoption, we analyze the impact of TC banana technology on household income and food security in Kenya. To assess food security outcomes, we employ the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) - a tool that has not been used for impact assessment before. Estimates of treatment-effects models show that TC banana adoption, combined with improved crop management, causes considerable increases in farm and household income. Technology adoption also reduces relative food insecurity in a significant way. These results indicate that TC technology can be welfare enhancing for adopting farm households. Adoption should be further promoted through upscaling appropriate technology delivery systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A better understanding of home food production can be used to help explain shortcomings in current nutrition policies and consequently help in designing better nutrition policies. This paper provides results from several home meal production function specifications that are rather robust. The median returns to scale and elasticity of substitution between money and time is in the 1.2-1.9 range and .33-.56 range, respectively, indicating increasing returns to scale but difficulty in substituting money for time in home meal production. A home 'meal poverty rate' is estimated, which is the percentage of the sample that produces fewer meals at home than consistent with dietary guidelines. The estimated home meal poverty rate is about 85%, which is consistent with recent research taking a less rigorous approach. Though the approach taken here is novel, the overall message is consistent with the recent literature: time is a more important factor in achieving nutritional targets than money.

We propose a FVC typology (modern, traditional, modern-to-traditional, and traditional-to-modern) that takes into account the participants, the target market, and the products offered. Next, we propose selected hypotheses on the relationship between each FVC category and elements of the triple malnutrition burden. The primary finding is that the transformation of FVCs creates challenges and opportunities for nutrition in developing countries. For example, Modern FVCs may increase over-nutrition problems and alleviate micronutrient deficiencies for urban people with relatively high incomes. However, they have little nutritional impacts among rural residents and urban poor people, who primarily depend on traditional FVCs to access adequate quantities of calories and micronutrients. In addition, modern food manufacturers are leveraging traditional distribution networks (modern-to-traditional FVCs), substantially increasing access to low-priced processed/packaged foods in rural areas and low-income urban neighbors with mixed impacts on the triple burden of malnutrition. Further research should focus on the influence of FVC transformation on reduction of micronutrient deficiencies, on modeling demand substitution effects across food categories and the attendant policy implications for malnutrition.

The average level of self-reported food insecurity was high but remarkably stable over time, at about 54%. However, this average hides large heterogeneity, both within countries and across countries. In eight of the sample countries, self-reported food security improved, while it worsened in the ten other countries. Our results suggest that heterogeneous effects in self-reported food security are consistent with economic predictions, as they are correlated with economic growth and net food consumption (both at the household and country level). Specifically, in the face of rising food prices, self-reported food security improved on average in rural households, while it worsened in urban households - a finding that holds when using global prices or domestic food prices. Improvements in food security over time were also positively correlated with net food exports and GDP per capita growth. While the self-reported indicator used in this paper requires further study and one should carefully interpret the results, our findings suggest the need for a critical evaluation of the currently used data and numbers in the public debate on food prices and food insecurity.

While the consensus within the literature is that biofuel emergence is likely to have some effect on future world agricultural market, there is a considerable range in the estimated size of the impact. Despite the importance of this topic to policy makers, there has been no study that has tried to reconcile the differences among various outlook studies. This paper undertakes an in-depth review of some key outlook studies which quantify the impacts of biofuels on agricultural commodities, and which are based on either general-equilibrium (GE) or partial-equilibrium (PE) modeling approaches. We attempt to reconcile the systematic differences in the estimated impacts of biofuel production growth on the prospective prices and production of three major feedstock commodities, maize, sugar cane, and oilseeds across these studies. Despite the fact that all models predict positive impacts on prices and production, there are large differences among the studies. Our findings point to a number of key assumptions and structural differences that seem to jointly drive the variations we observe, across these studies. The differences among the PE models are mainly due to differences in the design of scenarios, the presence or absence of biofuel trade, and the structural way in which agricultural and energy market linkages are modeled. The differences among the GE models are likely to be driven by model assumptions on agricultural land supply, the inclusion of the byproducts, and assumptions on crude oil prices and the elasticity of substitution between petroleum and biofuels.

EVIDENCE FROM A REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY ANALYSIS IN CHICAGO,EDUCATION FINANCE AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DECENTRALIZATION; ACCOUNTABILITY; DESIGNS,"School districts throughout the United States are increasingly providing greater autonomy to local public (non-charter) school principals. In 2005-06, Chicago Public Schools initiated the Autonomous Management and Performance Schools program, granting academic, programmatic, and operational freedoms to select principals. This paper provides evidence on how school leaders used their new autonomy and its impact on school performance. Findings suggest that principals were more likely to exercise autonomy over the school budget and curricular/instructional strategies than over professional development and the school's calendar/schedule. Utilizing regression discontinuity methods, I find that receipt of greater autonomy had no statistically significant impact on a school's average math or reading achievement after two years of autonomy. I do find evidence that autonomy positively affected reading proficiency rates at the end of the second year of autonomy. These findings are particularly relevant for policy makers considering the provision of greater school-based autonomy in their local school districts.

However, studying the possible transition paths and development prospects for a hydrogen energy system is challenging. The long-term nature of technological transitions inevitably means profound uncertainties, diverging perspectives and contested priorities. Both modelling approaches and narrative storyline scenarios are widely used to explore the possible future of hydrogen energy, but each approach has shortcomings. This paper presents a hybrid approach to assessing hydrogen transitions in the UK, by confronting qualitative socio-technical scenarios with quantitative energy systems modelling, through a process of 'dialogue' between scenario and model.

Youth livelihoods and extractive industry investment in Sierra Leone",FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Youth; Livelihoods; Mining; Mono District; Sierra Leone,CORPORATE-SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; CONFLICT; POVERTY; EXPERIENCES,"The impacts that increased transnational extractive industry investments are having on local populations in natural resource-rich regions of sub-Saharan Africa are diverse, far-reaching and complex. A surge of recent investment has been variously met by resistance and rejection, by acquiescence combined with demands for better labour conditions, and outright acceptance in anticipation of gainful employment. Drawing on recent field-based research carried out in diamondiferous Mono District in Sierra Leone, this paper critically explores these contrasting responses to mining activities, by focusing on how youth perceive and respond to extractive industry expansion. The analysis is particularly salient in the case of Sierra Leone, as Mono's prime alluvial diamond areas are becoming 'mined out', and artisanal and small-scale operations are being replaced by more capital intensive modes of mechanized extraction. In an environment where the demand for unskilled labour is diminishing, and young people are facing pressing livelihood needs in an employment-constrained economy, youth are playing important roles in rights-based mobilizations around mining. The paper aims to broaden understanding of youth perceptions of mining investment, and illuminate the various factors underlying a diverse range of responses to the expansion of extractive industries. It concludes by reflecting on how youth perceptions of extractive industry expansion may also be influencing the ways in which mining companies understand and fashion their business and social responsibility strategies.

It examines the dynamics of conflict between illegal artisanal and small-scale miners (ASM) and one large-scale mining company, AngloGold Ashanti, in Obuasi. The paper reveals the peculiar nature of the Obuasi ASM-mining company conflict in which grievance seems to factor minimally in explaining the cause. The recent escalation of illegal mining activity on the company's concession has, at times, sparked disputes and violent clashes between the parties. What makes the Obuasi situation unique, however, is that the dispute is not based on grievance over land expropriation per se, as the majority of illegal miners are non-natives who have no ancestral links to the area. It is rather a dispute purely over control of gold resources. The ASM-mining company conflict in Obuasi, therefore, is more of an economically-motivated conflict, which potentially has a longer duration than typical justice-seeking disputes. The formation of a formidable informal association by the illegal miners in Obuasi has proved indispensable in ensuring short-term survival and is potentially a key strategy for ameliorating future disputes in Obuasi.

In this study, patient preferences for different primary care models in the Tuscany region of Italy were elicited. The relative importance of different attributes to the surveyed respondents was then examined, as well as the rate at which individuals trade between attributes and the relative value of different service configurations. A discrete choice experiment survey explored the following attributes in a stratified random sample of 6,970 adults: primary care provider, diagnostic facilities and waiting time for the visit. Respondents (3,263) were likely to prefer a consultation by their own general practitioner (GP) and a practice with many diagnostic facilities. The predicted utilities of different service configurations have shown that a primary care centre with many diagnostic facilities was preferable to a solo GP model or a group general practice. The study demonstrated how a patient choice model could be used by decision makers for developing successful policies that takes into account different healthcare needs, balancing responsiveness with care continuity, equity and appropriateness. Considering that a primary care centre would perform better than a solo GP, especially for younger respondents and for those with minor healthcare needs, for a more rapid diffusion of this model policymakers and managers could direct the care of primary care centres towards these targeted subgroups, at least in the first phase.","[Seghieri, Chiara; Nuti, Sabina] Ist Management Scuola Super Sant Anna, Lab Management & Sanita, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Mengoni, Alessandro] Azienda Sanitaria Unica Reg, I-60131 Ancona, Italy",,"Seghieri, C (通讯作者)，Ist Management Scuola Super Sant Anna, Lab Management & Sanita, Piazza Martiri Liberta 24, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",c.seghieri@sssup.it,,,,,,,70,24,25,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

These links exist after controlling for an extensive set of factors covering family background including income and wealth as well as attempting to control for issues related to reverse causality and endogeneity.

Methods A systematic literature review of MEDLINE database until August 2013 was carried out to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Bayesian mixed treatment comparison method was applied for the pairwise comparison of treatments. Improvement rates by the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20 and ACR50) at week 24 were used as efficacy endpoints, and the occurrence of serious adverse events was considered to assess the safety of the biologicals. Results Thirty-six RCTs were included in themeta-analysis. All the biological agents proved to be superior to placebo. For ACR20 response, certolizumab pegol showed the highest odds ratio (OR) compared to placebo, OR 7.69 [95 % CI 3.69-14.26], followed by abatacept OR 3.7 [95 % CI 2.17-6.06], tocilizumab OR 3.69 [95 % CI 1.87-6.62] and infliximab-biosimilar OR 3.47 [95 % CI 0.85-9.7]. For ACR50 response, certolizumab pegol showed the highest OR compared to placebo OR 8.46 [3.74-16.82], followed by tocilizumab OR 5.57 [95 % CI 2.77-10.09], and infliximab-biosimilar OR 4.06 [95 % CI 1.01-11.54]. Regarding the occurrence of serious adverse events, the results show no statistically significant difference between infliximab-biosimilar and placebo, OR 1.87 [95 % CI 0.74-3.84]. No significant difference regarding efficacy and safety was found between infliximab-biosimilar and the other biological treatments. Conclusion This is thefirst indirectmeta-analysis inRAthat compares the efficacy and safety of biosimilar-infliximab to the other biologicals indicated inRA. We found no significant difference between infliximab-biosimilar and other biological agents in terms of clinical efficacy and safety.","[Baji, Petra; Pentek, Marta; Gulacsi, Laszlo; Brodszky, Valentin] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Pentek, Marta] Flor Ferenc Cty Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, H-2143 Kistarcsa, Hungary; [Czirjak, Laszlo] Univ Pecs, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, H-7632 Pecs, Hungary; [Szekanecz, Zoltan] Univ Debrecen, Med & Hlth Sci Ctr, Inst Med, Dept Rheumatol, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Nagy, Gyoergy] Semmelweis Univ, Dept Genet Cell & Immunobiol, Fac Med, H-1089 Budapest, Hungary; [Nagy, Gyoergy] Semmelweis Univ, Sch Med, Dept Rheumatol, H-1023 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; University of Pecs; University of Debrecen; Semmelweis University; Semmelweis University,"Baji, P (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",petra.baji@uni-corvinus.hu,"Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023; Baji, Petra/JHV-1617-2023; Péntek, Márta/HTQ-3097-2023; Brodszky, Valentin/AFN-4112-2022; Nagy, György/W-6254-2019; Szekanecz, Zoltán/GXN-0235-2022","Baji, Petra/0000-0003-2899-8557; Péntek, Márta/0000-0001-9636-6012; Brodszky, Valentin/0000-0002-6095-2295; Nagy, György/0000-0003-1198-3228; Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746",,,,,66,22,23,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

These problems range from a large number of potentially influential variables, difficulties in capturing and measuring these variables, and large sets of interacting and mediating factors. With respect to quantitative methods, a specific dilemma is their use at or beyond their methodologically accepted limits. More specifically, this paper explores the potential implications of applying multinomial logistic regression techniques in small samples. It does so by drawing upon published data from the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) program to explore potential problems of method from prominent research findings in the literature on forest commons. A subset of the results is then compared to a similar study of tropical deforestation. The results point to considerable inconsistency in the sign of parameter estimates, and a large number of type II errors. However, they also suggest that type I errors are relatively rare. As a whole, this paper demonstrates the general reliability of multinomial logistic regression in small samples by showing that statistically significant parameters are unlikely to lead policymakers in the wrong direction. Nevertheless it also suggests that this approach is likely to overlook several influential factors, posing potential dilemmas for the development of a theory of sustainability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The high revenue decentralization and the proliferation of extrabudgetary revenue items in the FCS generally weakened the central government's ability to support interprovincial risk sharing. This situation was reversed in the TSS period. In addition, the effect of central-to-local transfer (transfer-in) and local-to-central transfer (transfer-out) on risk sharing was asymmetric in the sense that transfer-out enhances risk sharing but transfer-in does not.","[Lai, Jennifer T.] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [So, Erin P.

A mixed quantitative and qualitative research design involving various data collection tools was employed to examine the significance of dry forest income and associated conditioning factors in the context of pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems of southeastern Ethiopia. Income from livestock and dry forests were the first and second most important components of the total household income. Dry forest income accounts 34.8% and 35.2% of the total household income and 38% and 46% of the total household cash income in the Liben and Afdher Administrative Zones of Somali National Regional State, respectively. It was the largest income compared to all other incomes added together for 45% of the respondents. Most notably, for very poor households, dry forest income contributes up to 63% of their total income. Dry forest income levels varied significantly with occupation (P < 0.05), pastoralists generating more income than agro-pastoralists. Dry forest income enables 24% of households to remain above the poverty line, and it reduces income disparity by 13.7%. Moreover, dry forest income has become increasingly important for households' ex-ante risk and ex-post drought coping strategies. The number of youths per household (P < 0.001), access to extension services (P < 0.001), and being member of a cooperative (P < 0.05) significantly affected dry forest income levels in both Zones. Findings of this study could apply to similar dryland eco-regions in the Horn of Africa and contribute to enhance promotion of sustainable management of dry forests for integrated livelihood adaptation, biodiversity conservation and combating desertification. Further research is needed to quantify the contribution dry forests make to livelihoods through livestock production and to develop options that will guide policy making process to generate additional economic incentives for communities and countries to be engaged in sustainable management and use of dry forests.

In less than thirty years, half of India's population will have to cope with urban life and there will be tremendous transformation of landscape, economic structure and social life. In order to forecast India's urban future, we assumed that secular and contemporary growth trajectories of all individual urban agglomerations are key drivers of future urbanization trends. We demonstrate that India's city-system conforms to the distributed growth model and that its hierarchical distribution is evolving regularly. India's plurisecular city-system fits well with the canonical model that describes universally the system dynamics. It shares common characteristics with several mature urban structures around the world. We show also that the location of the town has little influence on its growth trajectory.

The stylized fact that women produce less than men, while on average occupying smaller farms, presents a quandary as it is also a stylized fact that smaller farms have higher yields per unit of area. Using data from the 2006 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey, this study examines whether there is a gap in output per acre between men and women farmers in Kenya. Using ordinary and two-stage least-squares (OLS and 2SLS) analyses, it shows that when crop choice is taken into account, women are as productive as men. Specifically, the study finds that market-oriented crops are the source of differences. This suggests that further research into what determines crop choice is needed, in addition to policy that ensures that women have the same access as men to support for market-oriented crops.","[Githinji, Mwangi Wa; Barenberg, Andrew] UMass Amherst, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Konstantinidis, Charalampos] UMass Boston, Dept Econ, Boston, MA USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Githinji, MW (通讯作者)，UMass Amherst, Dept Econ, Thompson Hall,200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",mwangi@econs.umass.edu; konstantinidis@umb.edu; andy.barenberg@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,17,21,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The value chain of wild captured snakeheads in Cambodia was focused on 11 marketing channels, and for cultured snakeheads in Vietnam, 10 market channels. The distribution of benefits among the chain actors was unequal, with the highest proportion of profit going to wholesalers in Cambodia and collectors in Vietnam.

Concretely we analyse endowment contracts, which are present in several financial real-world contexts as residential mortgage loans or retirement plans. We show that modelling the present value of these contracts with fuzzy random variables allows a well-founded quantification of their fair price and the risk resulting from the uncertainty of mortality and discounting rates. To do this, we firstly describe fuzzy random variables and some associated measures (mathematical expectation, variance, distribution function and quantiles) are defined.

This article sets out to both illuminate the precarious conditions of nonstandard workers in New York's vaunted creative sectors and identify emerging collective responses to precarity in this city. Three areas of labour activity are focused upon: fashion industry frictions, art world agitations, and independent worker initiatives. Under each of these headings, the article profiles two organizations that are variously exposing, resisting, and mitigating precarity among flexible labour forces in the arts, the media, cultural industries, and beyond. The discussion of these organizations is informed by interviews with some of their protagonists, by documents produced by the organizations, and/or by media coverage of them. Challenging the assumption that getting by in informal cultural labour markets obliges individual coping strategies, this article reveals scenes from a metropolitan laboratory of precarious labour politics. These initiatives are inklings of a recomposition of labour politics in which flexible workforces in creative industries are important participants.","[de Peuter, Greig] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Commun Studies, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"de Peuter, G (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Commun Studies, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",gdepeuter@wlu.ca,,,,,,,72,19,21,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

In a model with emission reduction through clean energy deployment, and with R&D increasing the overall productivity of clean energy, we describe optimal R&D policies jointly with emission pricing policies. We find that while emission prices can be set at the Pigouvian level independently of innovation policy, the optimal level of R&D subsidies and patent lifetime change with the stages of the climate problem. In the early stages of clean energy development, innovators find it more difficult to capture the social value of their innovations. Thus, for a given finite patent lifetime, optimal clean energy R&D subsidies are initially high, but then fall over time. Alternatively, if research subsidies are kept constant, the optimal patent lifetime should initially be long and fall over time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Confidence intervals are constructed to account for two types of input variation in impact estimates sample variation in sportfishing-related expenditures and stochastic variation from parameters in the recreation participation model. For five of six policy scenarios examined, estimated impacts are not statistically different from zero. Tests for differences in estimated impacts between scenarios show that no statistical differences are found whenever stochastic variation is considered (statistical differences occur only when sample variation alone is accounted for). Due to the lack of statistical differences in this case, a comparison of economic impacts does not provide a clear-cut preferred alternative, and consequently other economic and non-economic criteria for evaluating policy scenarios should bear greater weight in policy decisions.","[Lew, Daniel K.; Seung, Chang K.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Lew, DK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",Dan.Lew@noaa.gov; Chang.Seung@noaa.gov,"Lew, Daniel K./AAL-3013-2021","Lew, Daniel/0000-0002-3394-138X",,,,,43,6,6,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The purpose of the fractal market theory approach of this paper is to investigate whether the selected capital markets abide by a particular evolution pattern or the random walk hypothesis. In this paper, the Hurst exponent calculated by the R/S analysis is our measure of long range dependence in the series. As a result, we may note that the Brazilian financial market is the closest one to the random walk hypothesis, a characteristic of efficient market hypotheses. Nevertheless, the Estonian, Chinese and Romanian financial markets are the furthest ones from the random walk premise, as they observe the fractal Brownian motion.","[Oprean, Camelia; Tanasescu, Cristina; Bratian, Vasile] Univ Lucian Blaga Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Oprean, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lucian Blaga Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania.",camelia.oprean@ulbsibiu.ro,"Tanasescu, Cristina/ABE-9989-2020; Oprean-Stan, Camelia/AAL-5673-2020; Tanasescu, Cristina/AAM-3983-2020","Tanasescu, Cristina/0000-0001-8347-4014; Oprean-Stan, Camelia/0000-0003-3492-2401",,,,,12,3,3,0,18,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

It therefore integrates conventional criteria of validity with non-scientific criteria of usefulness. This paper seeks to better understand how university-government-industry-civil society (UGICS) research networks can produce more socially robust science. In Canada, there are numerous provincial, regional, and national forest research networks. One of the most notable of these organizations, in terms exemplifying a UGICS research network, was the Sustainable Forest Management Network (SFMN) (1995-2009), a Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence (NCE). The objective of this study was to elicit participants' experiences with, and perceptions of, the SFMN over its 14 years of operation. This paper reports the results of our survey research and draws upon the authors' previous evaluative research on the SFMN to offer suggestions for the design and management of UGICS research networks that seek to foster more socially robust science. These include considerations about network management and governance, funding allocation and partnership models, knowledge exchange and management and research capacity development. Specific attention is also given to how formal research networks might attract and retain partnership with civil society groups.

To compare the proportion of RA patients treated with biologics across Europe and investigate the factors that most influence it, with focus on the Portuguese case, reportedly with low access rates to biologics. The biologics' market was characterized for 15 selected European countries. Variables potentially influencing patients' access to biologics (PAB) in RA were also collected, including demographic, disease, economic, funding and biologics' market-related data. A multivariable regression model identified the factors that best explain PAB. Based on these determinants, a cluster analysis was performed to group the countries with most similar behaviour regarding PAB allowing the evaluation of Portugal's relative position among these countries. The regression model (R (2) = 0.953) indicated that PAB in selected countries is explained mostly by its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the usage of methotrexate (MTX) and the biologics' distribution channel. Current MTX usage in Portugal shows similarity with practice from UK, France, Germany or Spain 5 years before, explaining why PAB in Portugal stood at 7 % in 2010, 12 percentage points below the average of selected countries. Variations in RA PAB were found across selected countries with Portugal showing the lowest proportion. GDP per capita, biologics distribution channel and consumption of MTX appear to be the best explanatory factors for these fluctuations in European countries.","[Laires, P. A.; Martins, A.

Instead of employing a common approach that focuses on certain education levels, an alternative method is proposed that allows a study of the entire schooling attainment distribution for youths in different wealth quartiles. Even without access to a direct measure of scholastic ability, the study finds that differences in the long-run family factors perceived to be important in shaping cognitive ability account for the bulk of inequality in schooling attainment in the 1991 youth cohort. However, a decline in the relative importance of family backgrounds is observed in later cohorts. The surge in the relative importance of family wealth on college enrollment could be caused by either the increasing cost of college education or by the relatively rich and academically less able individuals taking a larger share of recent increases in college enrollment.

These conditions are also an opportunity for regulators and analysts to distinguish the 'hyper-real' economy, represented by derivatives, from the real economy, which requires assessment through an analysis of human as well as financial capital. Regulators are required to demonstrate that they are skilled in conducting the most thorough analysis of all elements of the finance system in order to help the investing public to manage risk as much as possible. The contribution of this article is to overview the limitations inherent in regulators' traditional focus on financial analysis, as well as in financial analysts' failure to consider the relevance of people management data when evaluating the potential performance of knowledge-intensive, service-based organisations. The article argues for a stronger focus on analysis of non-financial capital, including human capital, to provide a more effective 'early warning' of potential financial distress.","[Royal, Carol] Univ New S Wales, Sch Management, Sydney, NSW 2062, Australia; [Royal, Carol] Univ New S Wales, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2062, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Royal, C (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London, England.",c.royal@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,72,1,1,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Using 2010 data, the study analyzes how labor market conditions are reflected in pension type and amount for women pensioners, yielding two important conclusions: the income of women pensioners decreases, relative to men, with age; and the degree of inequality of pensions among women is lower than that among men. These gender differences owe to the contributory character of the system, which reproduces the labor market inequalities of both genders - inequalities that ultimately derive from the social division of roles in which women remain responsible for unpaid care work. This conclusion is consistent with similar studies on other European countries and world regions.","Autonomous Univ Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Vara, MJ (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",maria.vara@uam.es,,,,,,,41,17,18,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Greenlandic patients with renal failure needing dialysis thus have to travel to Denmark to obtain treatment. For patients in haemodialysis this necessitates a permanent residence in Denmark. Our study was aimed at examining Greenlanders' preferences for establishing nephrology facilities in Greenland at Queen Ingrid's Hospital in Nuuk, and to estimate the associated change in welfare. Preferences were elicited using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). A random sample of 500 individuals of the general population was sent a postal questionnaire in which they were asked to consider the trade-offs of establishing nephrology facilities in Greenland as opposed to the current situation. This involved trading off the benefits of having such facilities in their home country against the costs of the intervention. Besides including a payment attribute described in terms of incremental tax payment, the DCE included two interventions attributes related to (1) the organisation of labour, and (2) the physical settings of the patients. Respondents succeeded in answering the DCE despite cultural and linguistic disparity. We found that all the included attributes had a significant effect on respondents' choices, and that respondents' answers to the DCE were in keeping with their values as stated in the questionnaire. DCE data was analyzed using a random parameter logit model reparametrized in willingness-to-pay space. The results showed that establishing facilities in Greenland were preferred to the current treatment in Denmark. The welfare estimate from the DCE, at DKK 18.74 million, exceeds the estimated annual costs of establishing treatment facilities for patients with chronic renal failure. Given the estimated confidence interval this result seems robust. Establishing facilities in Greenland therefore would appear to be welfare-improving, deriving positive net benefits. Despite the relatively narrow policy focus, we believe that our findings provide some insight into individuals' preferences for decentralization of public services and on citizens' views of 'self-governance' that go beyond the case of Greenland. More generally, this paper illustrates how DCE can be applied successfully to developing countries with culturally, demographically, and geographically distinct features.","[Kjaer, Trine; Morkbak, Morten Raun] Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Bech, Mickael; Kronborg, Christian] Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark,"Kjær, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE, Winslowsvej 9B,1, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark.",tkj@sam.sdu.dk,"Bech, Mickael/G-2588-2011; Kronborg, Christian/AHB-2686-2022; Kronborg, Christian/GYQ-7946-2022","Kronborg, Christian/0000-0001-9627-1419; Bech, Mickael/0000-0003-3084-2068; Kjaer, Trine/0000-0002-9554-374X",,,,,25,9,10,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We consider governments with sign-unconstrained emission taxes at their disposal and seeking to prevent world emissions from exceeding some binding aggregate emission ceiling in the medium term. Such a ceiling policy can be carried out either in full cooperation or by a sub-global climate coalition. Unilateral action has to cope with carbon leakage and high costs, which makes a strong case for choosing a policy that implements the ceiling in a cost-effective way. In a two-country, two-period general equilibrium model with a non-renewable fossil-energy resource, we characterize the unilateral cost-effective ceiling policy and compare it with its fully cooperative counterpart. We show that with full cooperation there exists a cost-effective ceiling policy in which only first-period emissions are taxed at a rate that is uniform across countries. In contrast, the cost-effective ceiling policy of a sub-global climate coalition is characterized by emission regulation in both periods. The share of the total stock of energy resources owned by the sub-global climate coalition turns out to be a decisive determinant of the sign and magnitude of unilateral cost-effective taxes.

In the United States, recent awareness of this externality has led to intra- and inter-state conflict and rapidly-changing water management policies and institutions. Although the marginal damage of groundwater use on stream flows depends crucially on the location of pumping relative to streams, current regulations are generally uniform over space. We use a population data set of irrigation wells in the Nebraska portion of the Republican River Basin to analyze whether adopting spatially differentiated groundwater pumping regulations leads to significant reductions in farmer abatement costs and costs from damage to streams. We find that regulators can generate most of the potential savings in total social costs without accounting for spatial heterogeneity. However, if regulators need to increase the protection of streams significantly from current levels, spatially differentiated policies will yield sizable cost savings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding the causes and impacts of community-outsider conflict can provide important insights into improving forest governance. This study analyzes seven community-outsider conflicts from five countries in Southeast Asia. All cases involved local communities in conflict with external actors (e.g. logging and mining companies, plantation estates and conservation agencies). Our findings from these cases suggest that conflict often arises as a result of contested tenure, exclusionary economic development and conservation policies, and a lack of coordination among state agencies related to land-use planning. This study underlines the complex nature of conflict, which often involves not only material issues but also deep cultural connections between communities and their land. Conflict impacts were usually very negative and included fear, anxiety, distrust, division between social groups, and high economic and environmental costs. To a limited extent, conflict impacts were also positive, such as where conflict strengthened collective action at a community level and/or increased awareness of the need to clarify tenure. The study provides a number of practical suggestions to address community-outsider conflict and improve forest governance in Southeast Asia. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We compare the pledged patents to other patents in the same technologies or held by the same multinationals to investigate the motives of the contributing firms as well as the potential for such commons to encourage innovation and diffusion of climate change related technologies. We find pledged patents to protect environmentally friendly technologies and to be of similar value as the average patent in a pledging firm's patent portfolio but of lower value than other patents in their class. Our analysis of the impact of the patent commons on diffusion of patented technologies suggests that making patents accessible royalty-free did not result in any significant increase in diffusion as measured by citing patents. This study, therefore, indirectly provides evidence on the role of patents in the development and diffusion of green technologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous international policies have been developed aimed at addressing these issues. This article studies two of these regimes, the European Union's Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) action plan and its Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with Ghana, and the climate mitigation policy of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). The interactions between these two international policies at the national level, namely in Ghana, are analyzed. The research shows numerous current and anticipated interactions between the two regimes. Most of these interactions potentially have a positive influence, but much depends on the future implementation of both regimes. The article makes recommendations on how to manage the interactions in order to improve the synergies and enhance effectiveness, including institutionalizing information sharing and learning, jurisdictional delimitation, and improving collaboration.

Nevile, held at the University of New South Wales on 10 October 2012. Taking a practitioner's perspective, the article surveys the management of the Australian economy from the 1970s to the present, with a focus on the reasons Australia escaped the global financial crisis of 2008 and the lessons for macroeconomic policymakers to be drawn from that experience. The author concludes that macroeconomic policy practitioners have to think deeply about microeconomic connections and the potency of different instruments in addressing shocks with different sources. They also have to deal with considerable uncertainty. The global financial crisis demonstrated forcefully that there is no separation between macroeconomics, financial system stability, prudential regulation, micro-level incentive structures and market efficiency.","[Henry, Ken] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Henry, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Inst Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",drkenhenry@gmail.com,,,,,,,1,2,2,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user friendly manner. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines efforts into one current, useful reporting guidance. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication. The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. A list of possible items based on a systematic review was created. A two round, modified Delphi panel consisting of representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, government, and the editorial community was conducted. Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed. The recommendations are contained in a user friendly, 24 item checklist. A copy of the statement, accompanying checklist, and this report can be found on the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluations Publication Guidelines Task Force website (www.ispor.org/TaskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp). We hope CHEERS will lead to better reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the CHEERS statement is being co-published across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups, to endorse CHEERS. The author team plans to review the checklist for an update in five years.","[Husereau, Don] Inst Hlth Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Ottawa, Dept Epidemiol & Community Med, Ottawa, ON K2B 5C4, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Petrou, Stavros] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Carswell, Chris] Adis Int, Pharmacoecon, Auckland, New Zealand; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp, Res Inst, Clin Epidemiol Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Greenberg, Dan] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Fac Hlth Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Greenberg, Dan] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Augustovski, Federico] Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy IECS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Augustovski, Federico] Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Briggs, Andrew H.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Loder, Elizabeth] Faulkner Hosp, Div Headache & Pain, Brigham & Womens Faulkner Neurol, Boston, MA USA; [Loder, Elizabeth] BMJ, London, England",University of Ottawa; University of York - UK; University of Warwick; Adis International; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; Ben Gurion University; Tufts Medical Center; University of Buenos Aires; University of Glasgow; Research Triangle Institute,"Husereau, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Epidemiol & Community Med, 879 Winnington Ave, Ottawa, ON K2B 5C4, Canada.",donh@donhusereau.com,"Husereau, Don/AAJ-7722-2021; Carswell, Chris/AAU-3160-2021; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Moher, David/I-3408-2019","Husereau, Don/0000-0002-4416-6876; Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Moher, David/0000-0003-2434-4206; Greenberg, Dan/0000-0002-6759-3985; Carswell, Christopher/0000-0003-0828-0548; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548",,,,,24,134,141,0,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Programs of such early intervention, aimed at children's health and well-being, are spreading considerably in the US and are currently being tested in several European countries. In a discrete version of the Mirrlees model with a parents' and a children's generation, we model the intra-generational and the inter-generational redistributional consequences of such intervention programs. It turns out that the parents' generation loses whenever such intervention programs are implemented. Furthermore, the rich part of the children's generation always benefits. Despite the expectation that early intervention puts the poor descendants in a better position, our analysis reveals that the poor among the children's generation may even be worse off, if the effect of early intervention on their productivity is not large enough.","[Lohse, Tim] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany; [Lohse, Tim] Social Sci Res Ctr Berlin WZB, Berlin, Germany; [Lutz, Peter F.; Thomann, Christian] Leibniz Univ Hannover, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Thomann, Christian] Minist Finance, Stockholm, Sweden",Berlin School of Economics & Law; Leibniz University Hannover,"Lohse, T (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany.",Tim.Lohse@hwr-berlin.de,,,,,,,31,0,0,2,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, there is less agreement on the nature of the evidence needed. In addition, there may be problems in evaluating that evidence. This is particularly the case when experts offer conflicting advice. This article presents the position held by Professor Nevile that in giving policy advice to the government, it is almost always desirable to draw on a range of different policy instruments. While theoretical input is usually important, it is even more important that theory does not lose contact with the real world. Factual descriptions of the real world and the use of a theoretical toolkit containing more than one theory are essential in achieving this goal. These principles are illustrated by a discussion of a particular category of policy advice - the evaluation of government programmes.","[Nevile, Ann] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Nevile, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Ann.Nevile@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,12,0,1,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

In particular, the paper describes a tool, The Imagination Workshop, which business people can use to drive near and far term product innovation, futuristic business and entrepreneurship. A key contribution of this article is the use of a modified evolutionary model of the Science Fiction Prototyping creation process (cyclic SFP), which, instead of being linear process (as in earlier approaches), is based around a set of feedback loops in the form of an iterative evolutionary co-creative process. In addition, the paper describes how the SFP methodology has been applied to business innovation and entrepreneurship in two small UK companies.

A study of trends was performed using data from six Spanish National Health Surveys (1993, 1995, 1997, 2001, 2003 and 2006). Sample sizes were 21,061; 6,396; 6,396; 21,066; 21,650 and 29,478, respectively. The following dependent variables were analysed: having visited a general practitioner (GP) or specialist in the previous 2 weeks, having visited a dentist within the previous 3 months and having visited a gynaecologist, having used the emergency services or having been hospitalised in the previous year. The main independent variable was social class, classified as manual or non-manual occupation. For each service, age-standardised proportions of use were calculated by survey year, sex and social class, and indices of relative (RII) and absolute (SII) inequality were computed. Trend tests were applied. An increase in the proportion of use was observed for all services, particularly emergency services. Individuals from manual classes were more likely to visit the GP and emergency services than those from non-manual classes. Conversely, those from non-manual classes were more likely to use specialised services. This trend was most notable for dentist visits. Social inequalities did not change significantly during the study period. Despite the increase in the use of health care services, the relationship between social class and the use of these services has remained stable throughout the study period. Achieving equity in the use of specialised care services is still a challenge for universal health care systems.","[Palencia, Laia; Espelt, Albert; Rodriguez-Sanz, Maica; Isabel Pasarin, M.; Borrell, Carme] CIBER Epidemiol & Salut Publ CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain; [Palencia, Laia; Espelt, Albert; Rodriguez-Sanz, Maica; Rocha, Katia B.; Isabel Pasarin, M.; Borrell, Carme] Agencia Salut Publ Barcelona, Barcelona 08023, Spain; [Palencia, Laia; Espelt, Albert; Rodriguez-Sanz, Maica; Rocha, Katia B.; Isabel Pasarin, M.; Borrell, Carme] Inst Invest Biomed St Pau IIB St Pau, Barcelona, Spain; [Palencia, Laia; Isabel Pasarin, M.; Borrell, Carme] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Espelt, Albert] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Psicobiol & Metodol Ciencies Salut, Bellaterra, Cerdanyola Del, Spain",CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; Public Health Agency of Barcelona; Pompeu Fabra University; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Palència, L (通讯作者)，Agencia Salut Publ Barcelona, Placa Lesseps 1, Barcelona 08023, Spain.",lpalenci@aspb.cat,"Espelt, Albert/G-2281-2014; Bones Rocha, Katia/F-1762-2017","Espelt, Albert/0000-0002-8625-4356; Borrell, Carme/0000-0002-1170-2505; Bones Rocha, Katia/0000-0001-7603-1709",,,,,38,34,35,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

With the exception of Japan, all Asian forms of capitalism are fundamentally distinct from Western types of capitalism. We conclude that the Varieties of Capitalism (VOC) dichotomy is not applicable to Asia; that none of the existing major frameworks capture all Asian types of capitalism; and that Asian business systems (except Japan) cannot be understood through categories identified in the West.

The findings indicate that the probability of enrolling in a scientific track increases by 3% for males. We find no effect for females.

We also find that academic undermatch affects students with a range of academic credentials, but is more common among those students from low socioeconomic status families, who live in rural areas, and whose parents have no college degree. Finally, we show that between the 1992 and 2004 high school senior cohorts, academic undermatch has decreased by nearly 20 percent.

We set up a model that shows multiple Nash equilibria to explain schooling and labor market behaviors for females and males. Our evidence from unique sibling data of schooling and work history and from the Philippine Labor Force Survey support that family arrangement to tighten commitment between daughters and parents keeps a high level of schooling investments in daughters. Because wage penalty to females in labor markets means that education is relatively important as a determinant of their earnings, parental investments in their daughters' education has larger impacts on the income of their daughters than on their sons. Parents expect larger income shared from better-educated adult daughters. In contrast, males stay in an equilibrium, with low levels of schooling investment and income sharing. Our results also imply that the above institutional arrangement is stronger among poor families.

The mountain pine beetle altered the value of pine, reducing rents and impacting the silvicultural re-imbursement of regulated practices. As a result, forest companies continuing to log stands of damaged pine seek to meet the minimum regulatory regeneration outcomes at lowest possible costs. We use a principal-agent approach to examine outcomes in the interior of British Columbia. Two mathematical programming formulations, namely, cost minimization subject to productivity goals and maximization of forest productivity subject to fixed silvicultural budgets, are used in a series of scenarios meant to highlight deficiencies in the current silvicultural funding system. We find that providing the agents with incentives to manage stand treatments in the forest, rather than solely their harvesting actions, may lead to cost savings or improvements in productivity. However, if the agents' profitability is compromised, they will seek to rely solely on natural rather than artificial regeneration, or give up forest operations on beetle-impacted stands entirely. This depends on the ability of the principal to provide agents with access to timber while incentivizing protection of living trees and regeneration of forest stands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These can be addressed by the use of nanomedicine, especially its platform nanotransporters, in which cytostatic drug can be encapsulated. These nanotransporters can be dispersed in tumors through relatively large pores in tumor blood vessels but not in normal blood vessels. The nanotransporters can be coupled with antibodies, thus allowing targeted delivery of drugs. For this coupling we chose the method using linker, small peptide that interacts with Fc region of IgG antibodies, presenting the antigen binding site facing out. The aim of this experiment was to create, characterize and test a nanotransporter based on apoferritin nanocage with encapsulated doxorubicin, modified with specific antibody. As a linker, heptapeptide HWRGWVC was used. Cysteine has known affinity towards gold, two methods of apoferritin surface modification were proposed and better results were obtained with apoferritin modified with gold nanoparticles. The presence of gold on apoferritin was proved by separation in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) measurement. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to prove the apoferritin ability to specifically bind to target cells. Apoferritin retained its ability to open and release doxorubicin in low pH. This is very convenient, since there is lower pH in tumors due to hypoxemia.","[Dostalova, S.; Konecna, R.; Blazkova, I; Vaculovicova, M.; Kopel, P.; Krizkova, S.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Vaculovic, T.] Masaryk Univ, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; [Vaculovicova, M.; Krizkova, S.; Vaculovic, T.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Brno University of Technology,"Dostálová, S (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",simona1dostalova@gmail.com; kizek@sci.muni.cz,"Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Vaculovic, Tomas/AAF-3312-2020; Blazkova, Iva/J-6430-2012; Vaculovic, Tomas/E-3008-2012; Kopel, Pavel/E-5711-2012; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Vaculovicova, Marketa/E-5583-2016; Krizkova, Sona/E-9617-2012; Rex, Simona/D-4951-2013","Vaculovic, Tomas/0000-0002-1341-6430; Vaculovic, Tomas/0000-0002-1341-6430; Kopel, Pavel/0000-0003-4216-9544; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Vaculovicova, Marketa/0000-0002-6771-1304; Krizkova, Sona/0000-0002-0479-8369; Rex, Simona/0000-0003-0737-3144",,,,,15,1,1,0,12,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,908,912,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800160,0

For beekeeping in majority of European countries, including Slovakia, the low level of professionalization of beekeepers is common. According to European Legislation the professional beekeeper is considered to be the farmer with 150 and more colonies of bees. This group of beekeepers comprises approximately 0.3 % of all farmers in Slovakia. Other beekeepers, who take beekeeping as avocation or subsidiary gainful activity, these beekeepers are commonly denoted as hobby beekeepers. But the low level of professionalization of Slovak beekeeping is changing the perspective regarding the labor costs. It is possible to state that the level of spent time dedicated to beekeeping is not the decisive factor for a beekeeper. The frequent argument is that only by detailed control of colonies of bees can a beekeeper obtain information about the condition of bees, but the situation is changing with increased intensity of beekeeping, when the beekeepers are forced to reduce the time spent on work with the colonies of bees to the minimum, the aim of the thesis is to analyze through the verification of postulated hypothesis the selected factors affecting the time consumption in beekeeping. The source of analyzed data is the questionnaire survey represented by 162 beekeepers. The structure of respondents participating at the survey from the perspective of the precept of law and the number of bee colonies reflects the structure of population. The respondents answered the questions in the questionnaire centered on economical aspects of beekeeping. The beekeeper's work consists of various operations. Due to the scope and general focus of questionnaire survey we therefore concentrated only at ascertaining on the time spent by beekeeper in order to perform his work directly with bee colonies ( the direct activity with bees). The literature sources list namely at this operation the greatest variability in relationship to various technological aspects in the interval from 40 to 240 minutes. Based on the obtained data we focused on testing three hypotheses. The first hypothesis contends that there is not statistically significant difference in time consumption between beekeepers in relationship to the extensity of their beekeeping. Concerned is the verification of the basic theoretical assumption according to which, with the increased scope of production, the time consumption must decrease. The second hypothesis was centered on the technological aspect of beekeeping represented by the type of used beehive. The hypothesis claimed that there is not significant difference in the time consumption in relationship to used beehive frame measure. We assume that with regard to the technological characteristic of single bee hive types, there can be the differencing form the viewpoint of handling and therefore the time consumption. With the third hypothesis we would like to find out whether there is correlation between the time and level of natural honey production. The verification of hypothesis was carried out by relevant statistical tests. In order to test the normality of separation we used Shapiro - Wilk test and Kolmogorov - Smirnov test. Based on the obtained test results of normality and nonaccomplishment of further assumptions, we selected nonparametric methods for testing. We applied Kuskal - Wallis, Dunn post test, Spearman rho and Kendall tau. The calculations were performed by software SPSS and XLSTAT. Based on the results of statistical hypothesis testing, we rejected the first hypothesis and we contend that there is statistically significant difference in the spent amount of time with regard to the extensity of beekeeping. The result of hypothesis confirmed the validity of the basic theoretical scope. Likewise we reject also the second hypothesis and so we ascertained that there is a difference in spent time with respect to the used technology of beekeeping represented by the type of beehives. We cannot reject the third hypothesis because the statistically significant dependence between the amount of spent time and the amount of produced honey does not exist.","[Levicky, Michal; Gurcik, L'ubomir; Porhajas, Viktor; Horvathova, Jarmila] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra 94901, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,,lubomir.gurcik@uniag.sk,"Levický, Michal/E-9880-2019","Levický, Michal/0000-0002-5297-1664",,,,,7,3,3,1,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,349,356,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600032,0

Removal of the shoot apex, the starting point of polar auxin transport (PAT), leads to release of inhibited or dormant axillary buds to form branches. PAT system is necessary to establish various developmental processes in plants and has an essential role also in apical dominance. One of the latest theories explaining the mechanism of apical dominance is the theory of competitive auxin canalization, by which canalization from the lateral auxin source is possible only if the primary source is removed or weakened. After decapitation axillary buds in pea (Pisum sativum L.) establish directional auxin export by subcellular polarization of PIN1 auxin efflux transporters. In this work, initiation of bud outgrowth based on the polar auxin export was characterized by expression profiles of PsPIN1 and PsAUX1 genes coding auxin transmembrane carriers, and of the dormancy marker gene PsDRM1. Application of auxin efflux (NPA, TIBA) or protein synthesis (cycloheximide) inhibitors to the second axillary bud of decapitated plants reduces bud outgrowth. Inhibition of outgrowth of the second axillary bud in these plants caused outgrowth of the first bud. This competition between the second and first axillary buds as new potential sources of auxin after decapitation is associated also with changes in expression profiles of PsAUX1, PsPIN1 and PsDRM1 genes. The obtained results are in accordance with the competitive auxin canalization theory.","[Medved'ova, Z.; Balla, J.; Prochazka, S.] Mendel Univ Brno, CEITEC Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Balla, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Plant Biol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Medved'ová, Z (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, CEITEC Cent European Inst Technol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",zuzana.medvedova@mendelu.cz,"Balla, Jozef/D-5257-2012","Balla, Jozef/0000-0002-7512-2040",,,,,15,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,654,658,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800113,0

We have selected our sample respondents from a list of a gynaecological health care forum members, namely women from Bucharest who should have posted messages on the chosen forum no more than three months before the study was conducted and the messages should have comprised their experiences with certain physicians. The internal consistency, validity and reliability of the SERVQUAL scale were assessed with the Cronbach's alpha values and factor analysis. The perceived service quality was measured as the difference between perceptions and expectations known as the gap.

Dealing with crises is even more important to date, because of the large amount of corporate failures determined by the current macro-economic recession worldwide. While a number of reliable research methodologies on crises' antecedents exist, it is still maintained that both the literature and practice of management lack appropriate theoretical perspectives for holistically capturing the overall dynamics of crises' paths. This conceptual article aims at contributing to filling this gap by suggesting that patterns of corporate crises can be conceived through extensively drawing on the evolving literature about organizational adaptation. The article follows one of the latest streams of research published in Futures. In fact, through adopting co-evolutionary lenses to adaptation, the article provides its readers with an interpretative framework that conceptualizes crises' patterns as an ineffective adaptation process.

Financial innovation was accused of having played a decisive role in the recent financial turmoil. In the wake of the crisis and after the adoption of generous rescue packages and liquidity facilities by several governments, a coordinated effort is being made to revise prudential standards, both at the micro- and the macro-prudential level. In these efforts, governments appear to follow the rules promulgated within the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). After an examination of the interaction between prudential regulation and financial innovation, the paper critically reviews the new prudential standards adopted within the BCBS known as 'Basel in particular those relating to regulatory capital and liquidity. One of the essential lessons of the crisis is that such requirements can no longer be limited to banks, in view of the contribution of the shadow banking system to the crisis. Furthermore, relevant national initiatives in the EU and the US are discussed and potential conflicts with the Basel III framework are pinpointed. In addition, the relevance of the prudential carve-out within the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is examined. As rule creation outside the GATS grows, rule outsourcing in the area of financial services becomes well-established, thereby increasingly pointing to the limited role of the GATS in this area.","[Delimatsis, Panagiotis] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr TILEC, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Delimatsis, Panagiotis] World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland",Tilburg University,"Delimatsis, P (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr TILEC, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",p.delimatsis@uvt.nl,"Delimatsis, Panagiotis/JNS-9156-2023","Delimatsis, Panagiotis/0000-0002-4121-1555",,,,,114,8,9,0,18,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

When regulation is weak, a firm signals cleaner technology through higher price; in this case, the firm earns lower profit when it has cleaner technology and thus, has no incentive to invest in cleaner technology. The price charged by the clean firm declines sharply beyond a critical level of regulation. When regulation is sufficiently stringent, the firm with cleaner technology charges lower price but earns higher signaling profit, and ex ante the firm has positive incentive to invest in cleaner technology. With weak regulation, the incentive of the firm to directly disclose its environmental performance rather than signal it through price is increasing in the level of regulation; the opposite holds when regulation is sufficiently stringent.

The main novelty brought by the reform was a reduction of the length of study to get a first level degree together with the introduction of a two-years, second level, master degree. This paper aims at studying the effects of the reform in terms of fairness. To this end, we first define fairness criteria following a well developed theory of equality of opportunity, we then discuss existing inequality measures consistent with these criteria, we show their relationship, and adapt them to the educational framework. We finally employ this set of measures to show the evolution of fairness in the access to university in Italy before and after the reform. Although not all fairness measures we estimated show a higher degree of fairness after the reform, the large majority does, suggesting a positive effect of the reform under a vast range of possible definitions of fairness.

Uganda's universal education policy offered free tuition, fees, and supplies to up to four children per family, including two daughters. The empirical method includes an estimation of a child-specific price of schooling. Despite widespread subsidies, the cost of primary school remained an obstacle under this policy, but the effects of price were similar for boys and girls. Regressions by wealth quintile estimate nonlinear effects of wealth and price, suggesting that there are opportunities to expand education through targeted cash transfer and subsidy policies.

In this paper the key features of the Korean approach to formulating and implementing a green growth strategy are outlined, and the progress achieved so far (2009-2012) is reviewed. Comparisons with China's green development strategy, as embodied in the 12th Five Year Plan (2011-2015), present themselves in that both strategies are concerned with industrial restructuring and the building of new growth engines designed to create export platforms for the 21st century. Reductions in levels of carbon emissions flow from these industrial policy initiatives. The paper concludes that the Korean strategy is carefully crafted and implemented with full government commitment and leadership, demonstrating that such commitment is feasible in a democracy. What cannot be guaranteed is continuing commitment from successive political administrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, it assesses compliance with rules that regulate and/or prohibit: (i) felling of timber trees on farmlands, (ii) farming in forest reserves, and (iii) use and management of fire on farmlands. The results are based on self-reported responses about compliance with rules and indicate a high level of compliance with farming and bushfire rules, while the tree-felling' rule is violated by many farmers. Compliance behaviour is influenced by numerous normative and instrumental factors, such as perceived fairness of rules, need for resources for livelihood and domestic use, and fear of sanction; but also, by some contextual factors, such as regulatory and socio-economic contexts. In the case of Ghana, efforts to strengthen forest law compliance, in particular the felling of trees on farmlands, need further consideration of the normative perspectives to compliance, and may point towards legal reforms that bring the legislation more in accordance with the norms held by farmers.

This frontier does not wait for us in the future; it already belongs to our past. If population and the economy are truly beyond the limits, then current visions and theories of social change would be deeply perturbed. If the development era is approaching its end, then many sociological theories on current societies will share the same destiny, sustainable development doctrines between them. It is worth to examine theories that explicitly look at the social world this way or that - at least - are not incompatible with it. Differences between these theories depend on sociological, psychological and anthropological questions; or, in other words, they depend on the human nature. Exploring the relationship between degrowth and the human nature gives rise to debates about selective pressures under conditions of scarcity (human evolution), historical and anthropological evidence, philosophy, and sociology (institutional resilience, utopies as whole society experiments ...). As its conclusion, the argument accepts that an evolutionary perspective supports that there are some potentials for conscious social change even in a way-down era, but it does not justify the belief in a particular only line of history. This conclusion does not satisfy the desire of knowing the future; nevertheless it may be the only one possible. The future is not written. Neither in history nor in evolution; not even in the mixture of history and evolution that conforms us as inhabitants of the Earth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The CFP case has followed a similar approach to that of other WTO Members (such as the United States) vis-a-vis China. This paper analyzes the main issues in the CFP case: policy plans, loans and land-use rights. It is found that a mere allegation of government interference by the petitioners can trigger a request for nation-wide information on company ownership and operations. This takes the scope of investigation far beyond the producers and exporters of the relevant product, encompassing nation-wide providers of credit, raw materials, electricity and land. Any shortfall in the amount of information provided can instantly lead the investigating authority to apply 'facts available' when making decisions. This practice is inconsistent with the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), as it aims to deal with government activities only. An unfairly high burden of proof was also imposed on China in the CFP case. Solutions are proposed in conclusion for a return to fair and legal anti-subsidy practices.","Gaopeng & Partners PRC Lawyers, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Qian, WJ (通讯作者)，Gaopeng & Partners PRC Lawyers, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lightlemon@yahoo.com,,,,,,,5,2,2,0,11,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We show that the correct trade-offs in production are best captured if a pollution-generating technology is modeled as an intersection of an intended-production technology of the firm and nature's residual-generation set. The former satisfies standard disposability properties, while the latter violates free (strong) disposability of pollution and pollution-causing inputs. As a result, the intersection which we call a by-production technology violates standard free disposability of pollution and pollution-causing inputs. Employing data envelopment analysis on an electric-power-plant database, we illustrate shortcomings, under by-production, of two popular efficiency indexes: the hyperbolic and directional-distance-function indexes. We propose and implement an alternative index with superior properties. Under by-production, most efficiency indexes decompose very naturally into intended-production and environmental efficiency indexes. This decomposition is difficult to find under alternative specifications of pollution-generating technologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Our analysis is based on psychometric measures from a longitudinal cohort study of children in the Rhine-Neckar region in central Germany. In children with a higher ASE due to a birthday late in the year, we find more favorable outcomes with respect to several temperamental dimensions: these children are more persistent and less often hyperactive. The findings are robust if we control for the respective temperamental dimension before entering school. We also show that the ASE effect on persistence is stable over time by comparing the children at age eight and age eleven, after the children have entered Germany's segregated secondary-school tracks. At age eleven, we additionally find significant ASE effects on adaptability to change. Overall, the results point to a high degree of malleability in the considered non-cognitive skills after school entrance. By contrast, we do not find a significant effect of ASE on cognitive skills as measured by IQ. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Gender differences and reporting heterogeneity in self-assessed health,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Reporting heterogeneity; Generalized ordered probit; Self-assessed health,RETIREMENT,"For empirical analysis and policy-oriented recommendations, the precise measurement of individual health or well-being is essential. The difficulty is that the answer may depend on individual reporting behaviour. Moreover, if an individual's health perception varies with certain attitudes of the respondent, reporting heterogeneity may lead to index or cut-point shifts of the health distribution, causing estimation problems. An index shift is a parallel shift in the thresholds of the underlying distribution of health categories. In contrast, a cut-point shift means that the relative position of the thresholds changes, implying different response behaviour. Our paper aims to detect how socioeconomic determinants and health experiences influence the individual valuation of health. We analyse the reporting behaviour of individuals on their self-assessed health status, a five-point categorical variable. Using German panel data, we control for observed heterogeneity in the categorical health variable as well as unobserved individual heterogeneity in the panel estimation. In the empirical analysis, we find strong evidence for cut-point shifts. Our estimation results show different impacts of socioeconomic and health-related variables on the five categories of self-assessed health. Moreover, the answering behaviour varies between female and male respondents, pointing to gender-specific perception and assessment of health. Hence, in case of reporting heterogeneity, using self-assessed measures in empirical studies may be misleading and the information needs to be handled with care.","[Schneider, Udo; Pfarr, Christian; Schneider, Brit S.; Ulrich, Volker] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Law & Econ, Inst Publ Finance, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Schneider, U (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Dept Law & Econ, Inst Publ Finance, Bayreuth, Germany.",udo.schneider@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Pfarr, Christian/0000-0003-4828-2732",,,,,26,43,44,3,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Additionally, larger cohorts of resident students result in increased nonresident tuition at flagship universities but not at non-flagship schools.

In recent years, the Republic of Korea's (South Korea's) marine aquaculture production of finfish has drastically increased while prices have declined. This study conducts a comparative analysis of the economic relationships between wild-caught and farmed fish species, examining the relationship between fish price and supply resulting from the development of marine aquaculture. Major marine aquaculture species, in particular the most favored sashimi species in Korea, are evaluated. These are: flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), black rock fish (Sebastes schlegeli), red sea bream (Pagrus major), and grey mullet (Mugil cephalus). This paper illustrates that the prices for both wild-caught and farmed fish declined as the farmed products entered the market and production expanded. However, the magnitude of price changes varied by species depending on if the farmed species has the same value or substitute value as the wild-caught fish and the development of aquaculture technology. The study shows aquaculture seems to play a role in helping to meet the demand for fish and can reduce the pressure on wild-stock fisheries.","[Pan, Minling] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96814 USA; [Davidson, Kelly] Univ Hawaii, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Park, Seong Kwae] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Marine Business & Econ, Pusan, South Korea",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; Pukyong National University,"Pan, ML (通讯作者)，NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, 1601 Kapiolani Blvd,Suite 1000, Honolulu, HI 96814 USA.",Minling.Pan@NOAA.gov,,,,,,,5,5,5,0,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

I develop a theoretical model linking the shape of the ethanol demand curve to the underlying distribution among households of willingness to pay for ethanol. I estimate the model using instrumental variables techniques and data from many retail fueling stations. I find that a $0.10-per-gallon increase in ethanol's price relative to gasoline leads to a 12-16% decrease in the quantity of ethanol demanded. My findings imply that preferences for ethanol are heterogeneous and that a substantial fraction of households are willing to pay a premium for the fuel. This reduces substantially the simulated efficiency cost of an ethanol content standard, since some households choose ethanol without large subsidies, mitigating deadweight losses.

J,"Hicks, D",,,,"Hicks, David",,,The future only arrives when things look dangerous: Reflections on futures education in the UK,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,This article takes the form of a personal reflection on the struggle to establish futures education in the UK school curriculum. After promising beginnings in the 1980s under the aegis of global educators the 1990s saw a retrenchment in order to create a research base and to develop appropriate support materials for teachers. Whilst until recently not understood or accepted by most mainstream educators a futures perspective is now beginning to be included in the work of geographical educators. In particular some aspects of futures thinking are also becoming enshrined in initiatives relating to education for sustainability. Encouraging teachers to develop a futures perspective in their own curriculum area may be a more profitable way forward than trying to promote futures education as a separate entity. Dominant neoliberal ideology and its influence on education will always make it difficult to challenge mainstream views of the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

If the political position of countries in anti-dumping cases is influenced by domestic lobbying efforts, we expect that the empirical pattern of country distribution of petitioning firms in EU anti-dumping cases corresponds closely to the empirical pattern of EU country distribution in Council voting. Our results show a low petitioning intensity for anti-dumping investigations and a high voting intensity against anti-dumping measures in Northern Europe.

The article tests hypotheses on household context and paid working conditions as determinants for men's and women's absences from employment. The empirical analysis is based on selected waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) between 1985 and 2001. The results of ordered probit estimations confirm that women's and men's sickness absences were related to both working conditions and household context. The findings thus indicate the potential empirical relevance of the double burden for German women and men. The stereotype of higher absences of women due to family obligations does not seem to fully represent the actual behavior of German employees, at least for the 1985-2001 period. However, the relative importance of specific working conditions and the relative importance of household structure versus amount of time spent in household production differed between men and women.","[Beblo, Miriam] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, D-10825 Berlin, Germany; [Ortlieb, Renate] Graz Univ, Dept Human Resource Management, A-8010 Graz, Austria",Berlin School of Economics & Law; University of Graz,"Beblo, M (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Badensche Str 52, D-10825 Berlin, Germany.",beblo@hwr-berlin.de; renate.ortlieb@uni-graz.at,,"Ortlieb, Renate/0000-0002-2999-4921",,,,,53,8,8,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

This paper presents a model for personnel assessment and ranking, which is based on expert evaluation method to determine criteria weights and on additive ratio assessment (ARAS) method to aggregate criteria values. The set of criteria is determined by leading security managers. They are as follows: theoretical and practical training - length of service in defence structure (years); professional activity - professional knowledge (number of mistakes made in professional questioning test) (units); mental qualities - aggressiveness-fighting capacity (units); physical development - circumference of chest; motor skills - measurement of speed, measurement of cardio respiratory condition, measurement of strength, the physical development rates are summarized; and fighting skills - the Sumo wrestling is the efficiency ratio. This methodology can help personnel managers to determine and localize problems of personnel, to enhance motivation and versatility of decisions.

Among such institutions, the prevailing wisdom is that those characterized as encompassing multi-stakeholder governance are generally seen as having greater legitimacy than other forms of voluntary action, and such institutions have proliferated as a result. At the same time, business-driven programmes that exclude societal stakeholder groups are believed to be increasingly emerging as competitors to multi-stakeholder-governed programmes. This paper explores the relationship between these two trends and, in particular, highlights the potential for competition between multi-stakeholder and business-driven programmes to lead to a diverse range of outcomes which are shaped by legitimation politics. This perspective emphasizes the open-ended and contingent nature of voluntary programme interactions and the importance of strategy and choice of voluntary programmes and their participants in shaping the institutional design of programmes. Drawing upon a review of prior research and an in-depth case study of business-driven voluntary programmes within the European multi-product retail industry, the study shows that one key implication of legitimation politicking is a divergence between the surface appearance of the governance of programmes and the programmes' actual institutional design.","[Fransen, Luc] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Fransen, Luc] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy",University of Amsterdam; European University Institute,"Fransen, L (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",luc.fransen@eui.eu,,"Fransen, Luc/0000-0002-9846-8386",,,,,42,148,156,2,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

While the significance of the relation between the bios and circuits of finance has begun to be recognised, biofinancialisation remains little interrogated. In seeking to address this lacuna, the paper focuses on the recent transformation of the UK after-retirement market and, in particular, the invention of enhanced and impaired pension annuities. Enhanced annuity products like the 'smokers' pension' provide, we argue, a striking example of the ways in which biofinancialisation works to fashion new worlds for capitalist accumulation, in this case through the capitalisation of morbidity and of the residual vital capacities of life, and the ways in which novel forms of biofinancial subject and subjectivity are produced to populate such worlds - to make them live. The paper concludes by identifying three political fracture points or fault lines in the enterprise to secure life biofinancially through the enhancing of annuities: first, the promise of reconciliation; second, the promise of autonomy and freedom; and, third, the promise of a good retirement.","[French, Shaun] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Kneale, James] UCL, Dept Geog, London, England",University of Nottingham; University of London; University College London,"French, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",shaun.french@nottingham.ac.uk; j.kneale@geog.ucl.ac.uk,,"French, Shaun/0000-0002-6139-8070",British Academy small grant programme [SG090467],British Academy small grant programme,"We would like to thank Ben Anderson and the two other anonymous referees, Paul Langley and Andrew Leyshon for their generous comments which have considerably improved the paper's argument.

In upcoming research, effectiveness of the preparation will be tested on grains artificially infected by isolates of pathogens and vitality of germinating plants under modified environmental conditions will be studied.","[Kovarnik, J.; Bezdekova, K.; Safrankova, I.; Malachova, A.; Cerkal, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Ryant, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Kovárník, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jaromir.kovarnik@mendelu.cz; radim.cerkal@mendelu.cz,"Ryant, Pavel/I-9294-2018; Šafánková, Ivana/E-8906-2016; Cerkal, Radim/C-2530-2009","Ryant, Pavel/0000-0002-4975-7405; Šafánková, Ivana/0000-0002-0186-5167;",,,,,4,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,104,110,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200011,0

A Faustmann Land Expectation Value (LEV) can be calculated for the two recurring cashflow streams one associated with forestry operations and the other associated with annual carbon trading. However the requirement to surrender carbon units (a) for removals at the time of harvest; and (b) for the subsequent decay of residues, means that the carbon component of crop value is negative from about mid-rotation. This negative value persists after harvesting when there is no forestry crop value to offset it. An additional issue is determining the appropriate discount rate for cashflows arising from carbon trading. A complication is that although LEV and crop value decrease as discount rate increases, carbon value increases. This confirms that the preferred approach to deal with risk and uncertainty is to adjust cashfiows rather than the discount rate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

From the perspective of all mentioned subjects it is necessary to be able to evaluate the efficiency of the knowledge processes, the extent of the utilisation of their potential and the ability to appropriately handle knowledge. The knowledge intensity index should represent a useful tool for the aforementioned purposes. Therefore, this paper deals with the theoretical fundaments of this concept and outlines three potential approaches to knowledge intensity measurement. These are represented by the additive model, multiplicative and incremental model of knowledge intensity. Furthermore, these models require relevant data for their construction. For these purposes, two methods - the bottom-up and top-down - are introduced. Both the limitations of the knowledge intensity modelling and further research options are also discussed.","[Otcenaskova, Tereza; Bures, Vladimir; Mikulecka, Jaroslava] Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,,tereza.otcenaskova@uhk.cz; vladimir.bures@uhk.cz; jaroslava.mikulecka@uhk.cz,"Mikulecka, Jaroslava/M-3419-2014; Bureš, Vladimír/A-4353-2013","Mikulecka, Jaroslava/0000-0002-1009-4309; Bureš, Vladimír/0000-0001-7788-7445",,,,,23,1,1,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,1232,1243,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801002,0

In addition, we show that in a linear and homoskedastic environment, this superior predictive ability of forecast weight averaging holds true irrespective whether the coefficients are tested by t statistic or z statistic provided the significant level is within the 10% range. By theoretical proofs and simulation study, we have shown that model averaging like, variance model averaging, simple model averaging and standard error model averaging, each produces mean squared forecast error larger than that of forecast weight averaging.

Bolivia adopted wide-reaching forest, land and democratic regulatory changes since the mid-1990s that were partly intended to reduce illegal logging and related practices. The new forest regulations, in turn, led to new illegal practices because implementation and sanctioning were poor, but also because new forest and land regulations were inadequate and often contradictory. In response, the government and various forest agencies adopted new measures to address the new illegal practices. These forest regulatory and forest policy renovations and modifications of the last two decades are, for instance, reflected in the domestic timber market of the northern Bolivian Amazon, a region that relies heavily on the forest sector. The paper analyzes Bolivia's regulatory changes that were relevant for legality in the forest sector and the multiple modifications that were made to address shortcomings of these reforms. It also analyses legality in the domestic timber value chain in northern Bolivia. The new actors involved in especially the domestic timber value chain have moved away from formal and legal mechanisms to benefit from timber that grows on their land and forests to practices that were not considered or actually shunned in the law and that appear difficult to regulate. Unless these new practices are recognized adequately in a new forestry law, some of the production and trade of the timber value chain will likely continue to operate at the margin of legality.

The total effect of disability on absenteeism amounts to a marginal increase of six to 26 days per year (depending on the country).","[Garcia-Serrano, Carlos] Univ Alcala, Madrid, Spain; [Malo, Miguel A.] Univ Salamanca, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain",Universidad de Alcala; University of Salamanca,"García-Serrano, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala, Madrid, Spain.",carlos.garcia@uah.es; malo@usal.es,"Malo, Miguel Ángel/B-5160-2017; Garcia-Serrano, Carlos/A-4411-2012","Malo, Miguel Ángel/0000-0002-1057-8397; Garcia-Serrano, Carlos/0000-0002-5143-8278",,,,,11,3,3,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

An important argument against privatization is that privatization may lead to employment reductions. In the hospital sector, potential employment reductions might also lead to a decrease in the quality of care. This is the first study to investigate the employment effects of different types of hospital privatization (i.e., for-profit vs non-profit privatization) on different categories of staff. A combination of propensity score matching and difference-in-difference methods was used to identify the causal effect. We found large employment reductions after for-profit privatization, while there were no permanent reductions after non-profit privatization. Moreover, even for-profit privatization does not affect all types of staff. While there are large reductions in non-clinical staff, we could not detect any reduction in the number of physicians. The consequences of the detected employment effects of privatization have to be addressed in greater detail in future research.","[Heimeshoff, Mareike; Schreyoegg, Jonas; Tiemann, Oliver] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Heimeshoff, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Esplanade 36, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",mareike.heimeshoff@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,"Schreyögg, Jonas/AAY-6182-2021","Schreyögg, Jonas/0000-0001-8030-2161",,,,,42,13,14,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In the absence of a global carbon tax and of border carbon adjustments, output-based allocation is a third-best solution and is actually implemented (Australia, California, New Zealand). The EU has followed a different route; free allowances are allocated to existing or new capacities in proportion to a benchmark, independent of actual production. This paper compares these two schemes in a formal setting and shows that the optimal one is in fact a combination of both schemes, or output-based allocation alone if uncertainty is limited. A key assumption of our analysis is that the short-term import pressure depends both on the existing capacities and the level of demand, which is typical in capital intensive and internationally traded sectors. A calibration of the model is used to discuss the EU scheme for the cement sector in the third phase of the EU-ETS (2013-2020). This allows for a quantification of various policies in terms of welfare, investment, production, company profits, public revenues and leakage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, we focus on a particular type of social process that has received limited attention in the literature and in which inter-subjective meaning-making is central: cultural processes. Much of the literature on inequality has focused on the actions of dominant actors and institutions in gaining access to material and non-material resources, or on how ecological effects cause unequal access to material resources. In contrast, we focus on processes that contribute to the production (and reproduction) of inequality through the routine and taken-for-granted actions of both dominant and subordinate actors. We highlight two types of cultural processes: identification and rationalization. We describe and illustrate four processes that we consider to be significant analytical exemplars of these two types of cultural processes: racialization and stigmatization (for identification) and standardization and evaluation (for rationalization). We argue that attention to such cultural processes is critical and complementary to current explanations of social inequality.","[Lamont, Michele; Beljean, Stefan; Clair, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Lamont, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mlamont@wjh.harvard.edu,"lamont, michele/J-2098-2012","Lamont, Michele/0000-0002-0221-0402",,,,,153,274,342,4,127,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Thus far few studies explicitly distinguish between effects of income inequality as such and effects of redistributing public interventions to equalize incomes on economic growth. In fact, most studies rely on data that do not make this distinction properly and in which top-coding is applied so that enrichment at the top end of the distribution is not adequately captured. This study aims to contribute using a pooled time-series cross-section design covering 29 countries, using OECD, LIS, and World Top Income data. No robust association between inequality and growth or redistribution and growth is found. Yet there are signs for a positive association between top incomes and growth, although the coefficient is small and a causal interpretation does not seem to be warranted.","Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Thewissen, S (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",s.h.thewissen@law.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,,,64,14,18,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In a unique field experiment in the residence halls at the University of California - Los Angeles, we test the efficacy of detailed private and public information on electricity conservation. Private information was given through real-time appliance level feedback and social norms over usage, and public information was given through a publicly visible conservation rating. Our analysis is based on 7,120 daily observations about energy use from heating and cooling, lights and plug load for 66 rooms collected over an academic year. Our results suggest that while private information alone was ineffective, public information combined with private information motivated a 20 percent reduction in electricity consumption achieved through lower use of heating and cooling.

The purpose of the scenario study is to describe links between the significance of emerging lifestyle patterns and infrastructure, policy and technological development. Despite the normative constraint regarding material footprint, the scenarios offer a diverse set of lifestyle patterns. The study answers the following question: what lifestyle-level changes could have potential to drive the transition towards low-carbon futures that are within planetary boundaries.

However, due to centuries of resource exploitation and the expansion of agricultural land the island has the second lowest forest cover in the EU. An increased forest cover would encourage the establishment of a range of processing industries and thus support necessary economic development in rural areas. Furthermore through farm afforestation farmers are given the opportunity to diversify their businesses, as market output of the majority of cattle and sheep farms in Ireland often does not cover the production cost To increase forest cover, the Government in 1989 introduced a scheme supporting farm afforestation, which is encouraged through premium payments that are high enough to make forestry more profitable than the majority of drystock farming. Afforestation targets, however, have not been met and previous studies have failed to offer a consistent explanation for the shortfall in planting rates. Thus, the objective of this work was to identify the factors influencing farmers' afforestation decision. More specifically the study aimed at identifying the combined effect of structural, socio-demographic and attitudinal factors on the probability to plant Based on previous findings from in-depth interviews with Irish farmers' about their goals and values regarding farming and afforestation, a postal survey was conducted in Spring 2012 including question on farm structure and socio-demographic variables as well as questions on reasons for planting/not planting. The data was analysed using logistic regression. The developed logit model showed that while profit goals did not significantly influence the decision-making with regard to farm afforestation, structural as well as attitudinal factors played a vital role in this process. This was identified as one reason as to why the current incentive scheme failed to deliver the outlined afforestation targets. Other policy tools are needed in addition to the incentives to further encourage afforestation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

From this experience have been extracted a number of lessons, but also new challenges to the monetary authorities on the management of such situations in the future. The measures taken to reduce the vulnerabilities of the banking system have led to actions at both micro and macroeconomic level, being accompanied by additional costs and new risks. The objective of this article is to emphasize the risks propagated on the banking system in the recent economic and financial crisis, the measures who have been undertaken to reduce them and the evaluation of the level in which one adequate risk management can ensure the positive development of banking activity and the stability of the economy. Into crisis context we could identify a number of destabilizing factors that have affected the performance of banks and created the instability in the entire system. As a reaction to these events, monetary authorities have acted by implementing legislative measures that have targeted the business model implemented in banks, but also the liquidity and capital level. However, to achieve the proposed goals is required the adoption of some actions on banks level, taken individually, which were materialized in the modification of investment policies, mergers, corporate governance, entry into other markets and so on. The analysis shows that the banking system is characterized by a high level of sensitivity, subjected to vulnerabilities caused by the recent international crisis and the increase of risks at his structure. The measures taken to reduce the risks were differentially according to the level of development of each country, but the compliance therewith has reduced the negative effects of the crisis and provided a better risk management to help avoid such situations in the future.

We register a historically low global growth for the second consecutive year. Advanced and large emerging economies are expected to slow in 2013, confirming the conviction that global economy has a weak recovery. As in previous years, growth remains unequally distributed. Emerging and developing countries are growing faster than advanced economies. Despite the compex economic picture, prospects for the Travel & Tourism industry are not entirely gloomy and direct us to a challenging time. According to the World Tourism Organization, international tourist arrivals grew by 4 percent between January and August 2012 compared with the same period in 2011, and total expenditure on tourism has also increased. Competitiveness has become a key-concept employed to approach and describe the sustainable development of the travel and tourism industry. Due to multiple positive effects it generates on the economy and to continuous growth in the last period of time, tourism attracts, each year, new other players. The purpose of this paper is to realise a study of tourism competitiveness among the top 15 most competitive countries from the economic perspective as The Global Competitiveness Report present them. With Pearson correlation coefficient (r), we aim to identify the correlation between tourism competitiveness indicator and the 3 major categories above mentioned, the consistency of these major categories and specific pillars of competitiveness. Analyzing the competitive 15 countries of the world leads us to the conclusion that they are not a homogenous group and there are some differences, strengths and weaknesses distinct from each other.

Cooperation and interconnectivity become more and more important in the research-and-development and educational areas. In this trend, while the potential of Social Media seems immense, some inherent risks create uncertainty in using them in an appropriate way. There seems to be a mismatch between the logic of participatory media and the still-reigning centralized-reminiscent model of Romanian universities, with its emphasis on inflexible processes and control. By its nature, Social Media encourages horizontal collaboration and more relaxed conversations that travel in random paths across professors and students. It there by short-circuits established power dynamics and traditional lines of communication and may affect the traditional image of the university. This article discusses some challenges and opportunities that emerge from the contemporary Social Media evolution for universities, and provides structure to better understand the benefits and pitfalls of using Social Media in this field. We begin by focusing on some relevant traits in the profiles of the innovating and performer employees from Romanian universities, in order to approximate their Social Media readiness. After that, we analyze profoundly, in a study based on a questionnaire, the new dimensions added by Social Media to these traits as noticed in a very recent McKinsey study, which looks at the individual as a producer, distributor, recipient, advisor architect and analyst in order to consider him a Social Media literate. Based on this analysis, we then derive a set of observations about Social Media literacy in Romanian academic environment.","[Georgescu, Mircea; Popescul, Daniela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Popescul, D (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Bd Carol Nr 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",rdaniela@uaic.ro,"Popescul, Daniela/ABC-5038-2020; Popescul, Daniela/Q-5160-2019; Georgescu, Mircea/ACU-9410-2022","Popescul, Daniela/0000-0002-6230-9914;",,,,,12,3,3,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-5671,,,PROC ECON FINANC,,,2014,15.0,,,,,,437,444,,10.1016/S2212-5671(14)00475-4,0.0,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EB,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357094000055,0

I describe a shift from expert defined closure to lay based openness and tinkering as a shift from prototyping to allotyping: Since the early 1970s, change of use and building conversion have become a central and fashionable discourse among architects and architectural theorists. Before the 1970s, buildings were understood as technologies, as 'society made durable'. The notion of building type was central to link a building to a given use. A bank was a bank because architects applied existing templates, prototypes, to turn a building into a bank. In the 1970s, suddenly buildings became flexible - discursively, since building conversion always existed: 'Building type' no longer was a meaningful link between a building and its use. A bank should not stay a bank, but become a hotel, a theatre or a flat, in short: an allotype. The chapter elucidate this central shift in thinking about buildings and reflects on the special case of allotyping buildings and how it continues to vex thinking about buildings.","[Guggenheim, Michael] Univ London, Goldsmiths, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Guggenheim, M (通讯作者)，Univ London, Goldsmiths, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England.",m.guggenheim@gold.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,9,9,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The article provides background to the topic of stakeholders from the first usage of the term in 1963, supplemented by an analysis of project stakeholder management strategies. The article will provide the reader with insight to how one can increase the success factor of the project with the usage of appropriate stakeholder management tools. This article contributes to the body of literature by detailing about how project stakeholder management influences projects and their success. It is prepared as a response to an increasing role of projects, the influence of different stakeholders on the execution of projects and their own evaluation of project success factors. By analyzing the literature of the concepts and empirical research from 1980s till now, this article will provide the potential project agents (project managers, project teams, etc.) with a better understanding of the role of stakeholders in conducting successful projects. The literature reveals that effective stakeholder management is a critical success factor of projects as they should satisfy the needs of different groups of people in each part of the their lifecycle. The conducted analysis is a foundation for the future research about effective project stakeholder management and a base for additional research.","[Ksiazek, Martyna J.] Warsaw Sch Econ, Coll World Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Ksiazek, MJ (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Coll World Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",mk51705@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,8,WYZSZA SZKOLA BIZNESUNATL-LOUIS UNIV,NOWY SACZ,"ZIELONA 27, NOWY SACZ, 33-300, POLAND",2543-540X,2543-5388,978-83-62550-98-2,BUS NON-PROFIT ORGAN,,,2014,13.0,,,,,,141,156,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE4CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371505700011,0

To discuss this question, this article examines how life insurance is pictured, that is, explained and concretized with words and visual images, in the promotion of private life insurance in Finland between 1945 and 2000. In principle, life insurance can only be used for assessing and securing the economic value of life. The empirical material shows, however, that life insurance, as an object, can only exist if economic value and other values constantly overflow into each other, and calculation and affect are made to intertwine. In order to objectify their potential customers' lives as economic potential, as commodities, insurance companies have indeed had to objectify life - yet not only in terms of monetary value, but simultaneously and as importantly, also as something that is irreducible to monetary value. Hence the promotion of life insurance enacts a double stabilization of objects. On the one hand, advertisements and leaflets show how life insurance matters, what it is capable of, and thus stabilize the understanding of insurance itself as a tool. On the other hand, the promotional materials both stabilize and mobilize 'life' as an assemblage of heterogeneous practices and modes of valuation that is irreducible to economic potential.","[Lehtonen, Turo-Kimmo] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Coll Adv Studies, POB 4, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Lehtonen, TK (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Coll Adv Studies, POB 4, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",turo-kimmo.lehtonen@helsinki.fi,,"Lehtonen, Turo-Kimmo/0000-0002-6063-2056",Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies; Academy of Finland [128334]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [128334] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"Many thanks to the two anonymous reviewers and to Ine Van Hoyweghen, Liz McFall, Jyri Liukko, Eeva Luhtakallio and Olli Pyyhtinen for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Full play should be given to the advantages of the education system of four linkages of society, schools, teachers and undergraduates and the network platform so that the integrated network humanistic spirit training and teaching system can be formed in the colleges and universities and the undergraduates can use the network to finish the self-shaping and education of humanistic spirit while distinguishing between right and wrong and seeking advantages and avoiding disadvantages. The information network with internet as the core has brought profound revolution to human society. Although China has only joined the internet for a short time, it has formed its own network development pattern and internet culture development direction at a high starting point because the internet framework has been formed at that time. The so-called internet culture mainly refers to the spiritual and cultural achievements that are expressed in words, voices, images and video in the network. The internet culture with Chinese characteristics is the concentrated reflection of Chinese socialist core values and traditional Chinese culture. The network mainstream culture not only inherits the traditional Chinese culture, but also absorbs the outstanding achievements of world network culture to service the masses. As the most creative group in the contemporary society, the undergraduates are more able to accept new things, new concepts and new knowledge. Hence, the internet and the internet culture it carries affect the undergraduates widely and profoundly. The internet culture influences the undergraduates in the aspects of political subject consciousness, social equality consciousness, knowledge opening spirit and consciousness of thought inclusiveness at all times and places. However, the undergraduates are still forming their own world views, outlooks on life and values and thus are characterized by immaturity and plasticity, and their life experiences are limited and their rational choice abilities and the abilities to distinguish good from evil are weak, therefore, they may be misguided in the selection of ethical ideology. The internet culture also brings some negative ripple effects while bringing the great information resources, such as moral nihilism, responsibility inefficiency and flattening of affect. Therefore, the internet culture brings both tremendous opportunities and serious challenges to the humanistic spirit cultivation of undergraduates in colleges and universities. The types of undergraduates to get on the Internet under the network environment, the psychology of university network group, the campus network environment and the development tendency of social network are studied to explore how to combine the university education during the information age with the guidance of government supervision departments and social mainstream value system on the network environment so as to establish and improve the school network instruction and activity platform, how the teachers of colleges and universities use the network teaching mode and combine with the practical teaching to guide the students to form the good web habits and how the undergraduates form the correct network morality with the help of the society, school and teachers. Only through the four linkages of society, school, teacher and undergraduate can the ultimate goals be achieved through the abundant network resources to cultivate the undergraduates' humanistic spirit, establish the socialist core values, inherit the Chinese civilization, promote the traditional virtues and form the national confidence. Hence, the practical methods for humanistic spirit cultivation of undergraduates through internet culture can be divided into four parts.","Baicheng Normal Coll, Sch Hist, Jinlin, Peoples R China",,"Lv, XF (通讯作者)，Baicheng Normal Coll, Sch Hist, Jinlin, Peoples R China.",Ivxuefei1981@126.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2339-5133,,978-981-09-1682-4,ADV SOC BEHAV SCI,,,2014,5.0,,1,,,,110,114,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC9JJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356465000020,0

Such global changes in the sphere of grocery retailing served as the basis for the research aim - to determine the main development trends of grocery retail sector in three neighbouring countries - Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia during the period from 2006 to 2011. Research results showed that Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian grocery retail sectors have undergone structural changes; as a result, food products mainly are distributed through modern grocery retailers, like hypermarkets, supermarkets, and convenience stores. Although, a constant decline of traditional retailing can be observed in all the countries studied, there are signs of change.

Given the fact that Russia is the last of the 'BRICS' and G20 acceding to this organization, there are considerable hopes that this event might not only modernize the Russian economy but also have a vitalizing effects on other national economies. Apart from potential economic gains there are hopes that the WTO membership will have a favourable effect on transparency and predictability of Russia as an actor in international trade. Notwithstanding, the matter remains controversial as sceptics invoke that instruments provided by the WTO are insufficient for controlling a Russia that in regard to the world's dependency on energy holds a strong political bargaining position. The guiding question thus is whether the WTO can be effective in 'putting the Russian bear on a leash' in the sense of making Russia adhere to trade rules. This article will provide an overview of Russian trade relations and highlights trade disputes with several EU Member States. Hence, it will introduce the changes under WTO Membership and provide a prediction as to how these developments might influence legal structures in the country.",,,"Schewe, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",schewe@lu.lv,,/0000-0001-6716-4403,,,,,44,3,3,0,9,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Forestry includes countless and complex types of human interactions concerning forests. Humans have found complex and nearly endlessly diverse institutional structures. Differences in the results of interactions are often caused by different institutional structures. Economic theories as explanations of human interactions are not detached from institutional structures. Their predictions are only valid in these institutional settings. In this paper, existent economic theories and models of forestry, like the Faustmann approach, the public choice school, Ostrom's Governing the commons, and others will be systematised according to their underlying institutional structures. In a second step, the interrelations among these approaches will be studied. From this point of view, some identification of unanalysed or less analysed areas of forestry are possible which finally allow some comments for future research in forestry economics. For solving these aims, a classification of the diverse institutional structures is necessary which will be developed stepwise. I will introduce the two independent characteristics range of publicness in sub-constitutional contracts and forms of moral order. The first characteristic is distinguished into the two institutional contractual types politics and markets, the second characteristic is distinguished into the external and extended moral order.

However, modern standardized testing systems are not designed to produce performance metrics for teachers or principals. They are designed to produce reliable measures of individual student achievement in a low-stakes testing environment. The design features that promote reliable measurement provide opportunities for teachers to profitably coach students on test-taking skills, and educators typically exploit these opportunities whenever modern assessments are used in high-stakes settings as vehicles for gathering information about their performance. Because these coaching responses often contaminate measures of both student achievement and educator performance, it is likely possible to acquire more accurate measures of both student achievement and education performance by developing separate assessment systems that are designed specifically for each measurement task.","[Neal, Derek] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Neal, Derek] Univ Chicago, Comm Educ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Neal, Derek] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Neal, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",d-neal@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,20,13,19,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

It is extremely demanding on applicant countries, time consuming and essentially power- rather than rule-based. This article argues that existing WTO members select themselves into the Working Party of applicant countries, the body which determines the timing and conditions of accession, in order to have the option to strategically delay membership by the applicant and/or extract concessions from it. Existing members will select themselves into a specific Working Party if their own trade interests are strongly affected, which will be the case if the existing member's bilateral trade with the applicant country forms a large share of its income, unless both countries already have a preferential trade agreement (PTA) between them. Trade interests are also strongly affected if the existing member competes with the applicant in terms of export product and market structure. Conversely, where both member and applicant have more PTAs with third countries of large economic size in common, potential accession will affect the member's trade interests less. An empirical analysis of Working Party membership since 1968 estimates to what extent these three different facets of trade interests are substantively important determinants of Working Party composition.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Neumayer, E (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",e.neumayer@lse.ac.uk,"Neumayer, Eric/A-3971-2012; Neumayer, Eric/ABF-3741-2021","Neumayer, Eric/0000-0003-2719-7563; Neumayer, Eric/0000-0003-2719-7563",,,,,43,6,7,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2013,12.0,4,,,,,669,692,,10.1017/S147474561300013X,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,217CA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324333000003,0

We assume that young people that complete upper secondary education are faced with three choices, go to higher education, not go to higher education or go to higher education and work part time. We model this choice using Irish data incorporating variation in costs (direct and indirect), the estimated lifecycle returns and household credit constraints. Using a mixed nested logit choice model we find that simulated lifecycle earnings and a choice-specific household income variable impact the educational/labour choices of young people. We also find evidence that preference for choices with higher simulated lifecycle earnings and household income vary significantly across individuals. Policy simulations undertaken find that varying student financial aid can lead to increases in higher education participation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this paper is to examine corporate social responsibility (CSR) of the forest companies in Russia and how CSR evolves. In this paper, CSR is analyzed by studying the stakeholder relations of the forest companies, to whom forest companies bear responsibility and why certain stakeholder relations are emphasized by the forest companies. CSR in the Russian forest sector is evolving along with the whole economic system and institutional framework. The business practices of forest companies are influenced by Russia's past, informal constrains, as well as global private regulation. CSR in the Russian forest sector has traditionally materialized in the relationship between the forest company, its employees, and local communities. The role of private regulation, in the form of forest certification, and markets is nowadays very significant. The forest sector in Russia is dominated by large forest companies which have adopted the policy of certifying their operations. Forest certification is a significant CSR initiative in the Russian forest sector. It emphasizes the environmental dimension of corporate social responsibility and the company relations with its customers. Forest companies that are committed to forest certification as well as foreign forest companies that operate in Russia are evolving corporate social responsibility in the Russian forest sector.

This study was done to measure the costs of treating terminal patients during the final month of life in a sample of Belgian nursing homes from the health care payer perspective. Also, this study compares the costs of palliative care with those of usual care. This multicenter, retrospective cohort study enrolled terminal patients from a representative sample of nursing homes. Health care costs included fixed nursing home costs, medical fees, pharmacy charges, other charges, and eventual hospitalization costs. Data sources consisted of accountancy and invoice data. The analysis calculated costs per patient during the final month of life at 2007/2008 prices. Nineteen nursing homes participated in the study, generating a total of 181 patients. Total mean nursing home costs amounted to 3,243 a,not sign per patient during the final month of life. Total mean nursing home costs per patient of 3,822 a,not sign for patients receiving usual care were higher than costs of 2,456 a,not sign for patients receiving palliative care (p = 0.068). Higher costs of usual care were driven by higher hospitalization costs (p < 0.001). This study suggests that palliative care models in nursing homes need to be supported because such care models appear to be less expensive than usual care and because such care models are likely to better reflect the needs of terminal patients.","[Simoens, Steven; Keirse, Emmanuel] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Pharmaceut Care & Pharmacoecon, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Kutten, Betty; Menten, Johan] Katholieke Univ Leuven Hosp, Louvain, Belgium; [Keirse, Emmanuel; Vanden Berghe, Paul] Federat Palliat Care Flanders, Wemmel, Belgium; [Beguin, Claire; Desmedt, Marianne] Catholic Univ Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Deveugele, Myriam] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Leonard, Christian; Paulus, Dominique] Belgian Healthcare Knowledge Ctr, Brussels, Belgium",KU Leuven; Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB); KU Leuven; University Hospital Leuven; Universite Catholique Louvain; Ghent University,"Simoens, S (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Ctr Pharmaceut Care & Pharmacoecon, Onderwijs Navorsing 2 Bus 521,Herestr 49, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",steven.simoens@pharm.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,15,6,6,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The effects of wind capacity, electricity transmission line coverage and grid regulation, as well as state and federal subsidies from 1998 to 2007 are estimated via random effects Tobit, Probit, and ordinary least squares instrumental variables regression. The results indicate that the federal production tax credit, state-level sales tax credit and production incentives play an important role in promoting wind power. In addition, higher wind power penetration levels can be achieved by bringing more parts of the electricity transmission grid under independent system operator regulation. This paper concludes that state and federal government policies play a significant role in wind power development both by providing financial support and by improving physical and procedural access to the electricity grid.

Various approaches to understanding student achievement may inform the understanding of how wealth seems to influence children's educational experiences. This paper describes several perspectives from the student achievement literature within the fields of economics and psychology that are categorized as either resource-based or person-based. Resource-based approaches prioritize the importance of investments that are made in youth to enrich contexts, expand opportunities, and improve outcomes. Person-based approaches, on the other hand, focus on how beliefs, values, and perceptions shape achievement. To better understand wealth effects, an integrative framework presents identity as a unifying construct that is contextually-constructed through a combination of resource- and person-based influences to drive student motivation and achievement.

Bivariate association tests for individual racial groups and logistic regressions for the full sample are conducted (weighted N = 2567). These investigate variation in mothers' educational expectations by race and ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The study finds that non-Hispanic Whites hold higher educational expectations for their children than do African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics. However, these differences by race and ethnicity disappear when the models control for demographic and socioeconomic measures.

These aspirations and expectations matter - predicting college attendance and graduation when present and failure to attend college otherwise. But aspiring to college does not necessarily result in relevant behavior; many children with high aspirations do not take sufficient action to work toward their school goals. This paper uses identity-based motivation theory (IBM, Oyserman, 2007, 2009a) to predict that school-focused expectations and aspirations predict action if at the moment of judgment, they are accessible (come to mind) and feel relevant. Relevance is operationalized in three ways. (1) Feeling congruent with important social identities (e.g., race-ethnicity, social class), (2) feeling connected with relevant behavioral strategies (studying, asking questions), and (3) providing an interpretation of difficulties along the way as implying task importance, not impossibility. Family assets and child savings are likely to influence each element of identity relevance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, achieving behavioral change is a complex process involving several steps towards a change in behavior. Delayed effects may occur after an intervention period ends, which can lead to underestimation of these interventions. To account for such delayed effects, intermediate outcomes of behavioral change may be used in cost-effectiveness analyses. The aim of this study is to model cognitive parameters of behavioral change into a cost-effectiveness model of a behavioral intervention. The cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of an existing dataset from an RCT in which an high-intensity smoking cessation intervention was compared with a medium-intensity intervention, was re-analyzed by modeling the stages of change of the Transtheoretical Model of behavioral change. Probabilities were obtained from the dataset and literature and a sensitivity analysis was performed. In the original CEA over the first 12 months, the high-intensity intervention dominated in approximately 58% of the cases. After modeling the cognitive parameters to a future 2nd year of follow-up, this was the case in approximately 79%. This study showed that modeling of future behavioral change in CEA of a behavioral intervention further strengthened the results of the standard CEA.

These policies led to an increase of production forests, maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) first and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) later to support establishment and development of wood based industries (sawn, pulp and paper). The most recent forest inventory from 2005/6 estimated an area of 885,000 ha for maritime pine (8.9% of the country) and 740,000 ha for eucalyptus (7.5%). Today wood based industries (sawn, pulp and paper) are important for jobs and economy, using essentially the raw material produced in the country. However, forests are at high risks of wildfires, with pine and eucalyptus burning at an annual rate of 3-4% between 1996 and 2005. This resulted in great concerns about the sustainability of the national supply of wood to forest industries. As a consequence the National Forest Strategy (DGRF, 2007) recognized the decrease of risks associated with wildfires as a main policy objective. We predict the effect of different wildfire scenarios on wood availability for pine and eucalyptus forests with Markov chain models, by using national forest inventory and wildfire data.

The United States ranks last: its employers are not required to grant annual leave and employees can take no more than 12 weeks' family leave per year. The United States' comparatively low labour standards, the authors argue, may be due to the dominance of a market-based conception of employment and the assumption of equal employeremployee bargaining power, neither of which is fully shared by the other industrialized democracies.","[Block, Richard N.] Michigan State Univ, Sch Human Resources & Labor Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Park, Joo-Young] Samsung Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Young-Hee] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Samsung; Michigan State University,"Block, RN (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Sch Human Resources & Labor Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",block@msu.edu; 2036724@gmail.com; iwin02@hanmail.net,,,,,,,28,7,8,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

A firm's probability of withdrawing its PP proposal is negatively related to changes in its market-to-book ratio and changes in the strictness of regulations, measured by changes in the issue market (hot/cold) occurring between proposal announcement and outcome day.

Based on a unique data set of bank ownership, performance, corporate governance, and stock returns from 1997 to 2010, our regression and event study analysis results suggest that active involvement of foreign strategic investors in bank management has improved the corporate governance model of Chinese banks from a control-based model to a market-oriented model, and accordingly has promoted bank performance.","[Hasan, Iftekhar] Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Xie, Ru] Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor, Wales",Fordham University; Bangor University,"Hasan, I (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",ihasan@fordham.edu; r.xie@bangor.ac.uk,,"Xie, Ru/0000-0002-9461-4956",,,,,15,28,32,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Some theoretical papers also make this prediction, arguing that property rights decrease discount rates applied to a long-term investment in forestry. However, the effect is theoretically ambiguous. The paper takes a novel instrumental variables approach based on Nicaragua's agrarian reform to test for the effect, using a new dataset-Nicaragua's 2001 agricultural census. It finds that property rights significantly increase deforestation. The model, supported by the data, suggests a likely mechanism for this relationship: property rights increase investment, increasing agricultural productivity and therefore the returns to deforestation.

This paper addresses this knowledge gap by analyzing the online activities of teachers in one mid-size urban district.

The largest problem for the staff of the School of Tourism & Hospitality (SCOTH) of WSU was that there was a distinct lack of knowledge concerning, firstly, the theory behind the PBL methodology, and secondly, the practicalities of how and when this methodology was to be introduced to the cohort of students. In addition, there was some doubt concerning the adoption of a new and very different learning style by the student body. Accordingly, a decision was taken that PBL would be introduced to all the 1st year students at the Buffalo City (BC) Delivery site as part of their Lifestyle Management (LSM) offering. This particular approach was thought to offer the best option for a successful introduction of PBL, together with best chances of successful academic recovery if a fallback position was found to be necessary. Given that the facilitator of the subject would be intimately involved in the conception, the presentation of subject material, the collection of support material and of the rewriting of the support material, the evaluation and the ultimate reflection on its success, the progress of the initiation of PBL would be treated as an Action- Research project and would be logged and notated as such. Following a review of applicable literature and the ensuing analysis, this paper seeks to provide a documented history of the academic foundation to the decisions referred to above, and some insight into how the challenges experienced to date have been met. Progress to date is assessed and some reflections of the acceptance of the PBL methodology are put forward. A tentative plan for future progress is offered together with some proposals on the overcoming of anticipated challenges.","[Ellis, Malcolm] Walter Sisulu Univ, Dept Hospitality, BC, Fac Business, Mthatha, South Africa; [Wright, Graham] Walter Sisulu Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Mthatha, South Africa",Walter Sisulu University; Walter Sisulu University,"Ellis, M (通讯作者)，Walter Sisulu Univ, Dept Hospitality, BC, Fac Business, Mthatha, South Africa.",mellis@wsu.ac.za,"Wright, Graham/K-7932-2012","Wright, Graham/0000-0002-8642-7405",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,149,158,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600015,0

The colostrum cows were measured with following values Ig G 0 = 97.19 +/- 33 197 gl(-1), 6 = 94.46 +/- 50.092 gl(-1) 12 = 43.71 +/- 24 310 gl(-1), 24 = 23.39 +/- 15 078 gl(-1), 48 = 9.60 +/- 7.113 gl(-1), 72 = 6.08 +/- 7.173 gl(-1). GGT levels in calves after cows were 18.74 +/- 10,435 U / l. The results were statistically processed in Microsoft Excel.

The analysis draws on a combination of fieldwork done in two colleges in East London and Leeds in 2007 and secondary data collected by the Higher Education Statistical Agency on students who graduated from British higher education institutions in 2006. Although it focuses on the reality of young British-Bangladeshi women, the study shows that-especially for certain ethnic minorities-the absence of social resources, social networks, and egalitarian class relations can hamper the process of making good on educational achievements.","[Niven, James] Teach First, London SE1 2LA, England; [Faggian, Alessandra] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ruwanpura, Kanchana N.] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton S017 1BJ, Hants, England",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Southampton,"Niven, J (通讯作者)，Teach First, London SE1 2LA, England.",jamniven@hotmail.com; faggian1@osu.edu; k.n.ruwanpura@soton.ac.uk,"Faggian, Alessandra/K-8548-2019; Faggian, Alessandra/B-5332-2012","Faggian, Alessandra/0000-0002-2479-2933;",,,,,50,8,8,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

It is a conscious or unconscious observance of basic human principles of behavior, enabling them to maintain the holistic of personality. A man becomes social mature through qualities that he receives either through genetic heritability or the environment in which he raises and educates. Through questionnaire method, we examined opinions of management subjects on each of the three pillars of the holistic managerial competence. 300 respondents from Slovakia and Czech Republic belonged either to a group of managers, full-time or part-time students. The aim of this paper is to outline the views of management subjects on the social maturity in the concept of holistic management and to make recommendations for improvement of the operation of the holistic model of managerial competence.","[Porvaznik, Jan; Misun, Juraj] Univ Econ, Dept Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Presov; University of Economics Bratislava,,jan.porvaznik@euba.sk; juraj.misun@euba.sk,"Misun, Juraj/AAW-5042-2020","Misun, Juraj/0000-0002-1586-1351",,,,,6,2,2,0,1,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-1-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,217,232,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336025300016,0

CRM on demand is a good choice for companies that want to implement standard processes that can use data structures out of box with little or not at all internal IT support and does not require complex or real-time integration with back office systems. However, on -demand CRM software is not always as simple as vendors want us to believe. Customizing can be problematic and interface tools of CRM vendors can not provide desired levels of integration. Implementing a hosted CRM system should not take so much as traditional software packages does, but with very large and complex variants it may take even a year. In addition, some companies that hold sensitive data such as financial services could refuse to entrust control of such data to third parties for security reasons. For these reasons, AMR Research believes that by 2012, hosted CRM applications market will be only 12 percent of the total CRM market. In the last decade, CRM products were a market with strong growth, which has attracted a lot of companies, causing them to create their own CRM solutions. They created flagship solutions of small companies, specialized in such services or solutions belonging to specialized divisions of major solutions providers such as SAP, Oracle, Microsoft.

Quantum dots (QDs) are widely studied. They can emit light radiation and from this reason they could be used like a fluorescence label for in vivo imaging. QDs can also bind proteins by unspecific binding. One from the most important protein in human body is metallothionein (MT), small cysteine-rich protein, which is responsible for binding of heavy metals, for accumulation of Zn, protection of cells to oxidative stress and it participates in the regulation of expression a number of major genes and enters to oxidative-reductive balance in a cell. From these reasons the interaction of MT with QD could play the important role at using QD in living organism. The study of this interaction is possible due to the electroactivity of both integrated components by electrochemical methods. The aim of this experiment was the study complexes MT-QDs created during the interaction of metallothionein with CuS QDs.

Interviews and field observations revealed that mining affects forests in a number of direct and indirect ways; from deforestation during green site development and sourcing of high quality timber to the sharp but indirect pressures over forests through the population pull effect of mining towns. Impacts on forest communities were in large part negative and huge investment in mining were in sharp contrast with levels of poverty and environmental degradation. Findings illustrate the need for concerted efforts to mitigate negative impacts from mining on the copper belt. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the recovery from a banking crisis, policymakers attempt to recapitalize the banking system, but this has the potential to impose significant costs. Turkey has restructured the banking system through recapitalization, and this has directly caused the shadow return on equity to turn negative. This negative shadow return on equity is an offset to total factor productivity change, and there is an important policy lesson that a successful recapitalization has a cost in restricting the banking system's overall productivity growth.","[Fethi, Meryem Duygun; Shaban, Mohamed] Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Weyman-Jones, Thomas] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Leicester; Loughborough University,"Fethi, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",m.fethi@leicester.ac.uk; m.shaban@leicester.ac.uk; t.g.weyman-jones@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,10,12,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We further claim that the use of basic values in this context is an effective way of operationalizing the role of societal interests embedded in the rational choice explanations for union membership. The econometric workwhich features a three-way outcome variable identifying current, former and never-membersreveals that, along with socio-demographic, ideological, firm-level and sectoral characteristics, basic values are closely related to union membership status.

Employing qualitative research methods, this study documents the pengengewiran, a type of indigenous agroforestry system practiced by the Erumanen ne Menuvu, an indigenous group in Southern Philippines. Based on existing form of classification, the study revealed that pengengewiran is an integral form of swidden system which is also a type of agroforestry. Further analysis of the data showed that the Erumanens' adherence to the customary practice of pengengewiran is influenced by existing communal resources, social relations, and high regard for deities. On the other hand, recent changes in their farming practices, including the shortening of fallow period and the incorporation of lowland rice into indigenous farming system, are attributed to the changing ecological condition of the uplands and the socio-economic process upon which they are embedded. The paper contends that socio-economic and environmental factors trigger changes in indigenous agroforestry practices and these dynamics have to be understood and better appreciated if just and effective policies and programs on forest resource management are to be crafted.

I find that determinants of substitutes' offer-acceptance decisions include the offer's arrival time, commute time, day of week, classroom type, school type, and school quality. Interestingly, conditional on school quality student demographics do not significantly influence substitutes' decisions. Longer and higher paying full-day jobs are preferred to half-day jobs, although conditional on daily pay, job length does not significantly impact daily labor-supply decisions.

Few studies, however, have focused on the circumstances under which mechanical wildfire hazard reduction treatments can yield positive net economic wildfire benefits for landowners and managers. This study describes an economic assessment tool built from a representative area sample frame inventory of hazardous and potentially treatable timberland in twelve western states of the U.S. Base case parameter assumptions about values at risk, timber product prices, stand re-growth following treatment and wildfire impacts enable an initial estimate of the amount of timberland with positive discounted expected net economic benefits under four policy scenarios. These assumptions are then varied in a Monte Carlo simulation to provide some bounds of uncertainty around base case levels. A policy that allowed optimal prescriptions and product sales and which incorporates wildfire costs and benefits would result in more than 25% of treated area with positive net benefits. This is reduced somewhat if wildfire reduction costs and benefits are not considered, and reduced again to 14% when large trees are excluded from product sales. A policy that prohibits sale of products from these treatments results in less than 1% of area with positive net benefits.

The empirical analysis contributes to the discussion on the outcome of federalism in the Swiss health care system by improving the understanding of the determinants of the differences in HCE. Our econometric estimations indicate that HCE are significantly related to the density of specialist physicians, density of dispensing doctors, per capita income, proportion of managed care, medical and technological progress and socio-economic factors. Due to the presumptive importance of the organisation of ambulatory care, we suggest policy makers should particularly concentrate on promoting the supply of managed care models in Switzerland.

This paper insists on the tension between the former and the latter. Controlling pollution either through Pigovian taxes or through tradable quotas schemes encourages agents to shift away from production to tax free activities such as procreation and leisure. This natalist bias will deteriorate the environment further, entailing the need to impose ever more stringent pollution rights per person. However, this will in turn gradually impoverish the successive generations: population will tend to increase further and production per capita to decrease as the generations pass. One possible solution consists in capping population too. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Yet less than half of students at degree-granting institutions are in the traditional 18-22 age range; nearly 40% are at least 25. This paper examines the enrollment behavior of persons 25 or older. We use data from a large-scale 1998 Department of Labor (DOL) policy demonstration in Greater Baltimore. By studying the behavior of older people we can examine factors such as age, earnings and marital status that vary little among the much-studied traditional students. Our results conform to the (rarely tested) predictions of human capital theory that age and opportunity costs are impediments to enrollment.

The advocacy of property rights in environmental management is taken further in the libertarian free market' approach and this 'privatisation' perspective is reflected in the growing use of property rights instruments in climate change policy. This article examines the efficacy of using economic instruments in the environmental context where 'market ecology' promotes the commodification of environmental 'goods' and 'bads' and their management by market forces. It argues that the pricing of 'nature' or its useful properties is a crude abstraction that implies ecological values can be alienated, but this is incompatible with the material and relational qualities of such values. The limits of this conceptualisation are further demonstrated through an examination of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a price and property rights instrument which enables private project developers in developing countries to produce carbon credits in order to offset greenhouse gas pollution in developed countries. The evident negative social and environmental effects flowing from implementation of the CDM reinforce the limitations of economic logic in the environmental context.","[Paton, Joy] Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Paton, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",joy.paton@sydney.edu.au; gareth.bryant@sydney.edu.au,,"Bryant, Gareth/0000-0002-6987-2291",,,,,73,6,6,0,24,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

First, using an economics framework, there are rational and logical reasons why different individuals and different organized human systems have different levels of adaptive capacity and these differences do not necessarily correlate to differences in vulnerability. An alternative approach is to determine where there are factors leading to socially inequitable or economically sub-optimal investment in adaptive capacity assets or reduced effectiveness of adaptive capacity assets resulting in adaptive capacity deficits. Factors contributing to adaptive capacity deficits include cases of irrational agent behaviour and cases where there are political, social, and economic system failures. A second way current adaptive capacity constructs can be enhanced is by taking explicit account of the adaptive capacity of economic systems. Economic system properties such as scale, diversity, relative mix of the private and public sectors, innovation, organizational/managerial capital, substitutability of inputs, factor mobility, liquidity of assets, etc. will affect the capacity of economic systems to adapt.

However, we argue that the global financial crisis had cultural conditions of possibility that were imbricated with economic factors in complex ways. The idea that the crisis was the function of independent financial forces that spread through society fails to consider cultural rationalities that constituted the citizen as someone enjoined to improve their lives through consumption and speculative personal investment. The message that continual economic growth was both possible and the grounds for personal growth was normalised in the public sphere, reinforced by political spruiking and pervasive lifestyle media. But do we have the disciplinary resources to take cultural factors in the crisis seriously? A greater attention to culture and materiality, including the cultures of finance and markets, does not mean simply regarding 'culture' as the context in which markets take place: it involves examining the fashioning of financial identities and everyday consumption practices in arenas that are cultural as much as they are economic. This also includes addressing the complexities of financial subjects for whom the pursuit of life security and private wealth accumulation (through home ownership, property investment and equity withdrawal, for example) is increasingly dependent on debt and underpinned by greater levels of risk and insecurity.","[Allon, Fiona; Redden, Guy] Univ Sydney, Dept Gender & Cultural Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Allon, F (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Gender & Cultural Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",fiona.allon@sydney.edu.au; guy.redden@sydney.edu.au,,"Allon, Fiona/0000-0003-1932-1464",,,,,60,31,33,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Using data from Statistics South Africa's 2000 Income and Expenditure Survey, the study investigates differences in tax incidence between female-type and male-type households, classified according to their demographic and economic attributes. The results suggest that zero-rating a well-targeted selection of basic foodstuffs and fuel for household use is important in protecting female-type households, especially those in the lowest quintiles and with children, from bearing an otherwise disproportionate share of the tax burden. In contrast, high taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and fuel for private transport result in a larger incidence on male-type households. The study also suggests ways in which the indirect tax structure could be refined to further reduce the large gender (and income) inequities that exist in South Africa.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Dev Studies, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Casale, DM (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Dev Studies, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa.",casaled@ukzn.ac.za,"Casale, Daniela/HTL-3497-2023","Casale, Daniela/0000-0003-1337-1196",,,,,38,9,12,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The use of low pesticide applications and non-chemical pest control technologies is limited. A stochastic bio-economic Monte Carlo simulation model permits the efficiency of alternative pest control methods to be identified in order to assess the likelihood that such technologies will be adopted. Data were collected from a field survey of 134 vegetable producers in Denmark, Germany and The Netherlands cultivating carrot, leek and onion. The analysis focuses on the main insect pests and on weeds. Simulation results for Germany show that controlling carrot flies by timing pesticide applications with warnings from the advisory service is more profitable than routine calendar spraying. Due to low onion fly infestation levels in Germany, neither seed coating nor the sterile male onion fly technique are profitable. Conversely, threshold-based thrip control in leek production is less profitable than routine spraying, due to the greater control effectiveness of the latter. In all three countries, combined chemical-mechanical weed control using reduced herbicide rates is more efficient than the application of full rates or non-chemical weeding. It was found that the risk of low pesticide use technologies is not necessarily higher than that of routine pesticide applications. Since low pesticide use technologies are rarely applied in Germany, although such technologies are profitable, it can be assumed that path dependence in pest control in open field vegetable production exists.","Fed Res Inst Rural Areas Forestry & Fisheries, Braunschweig, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Dirksmeyer, W (通讯作者)，Fed Res Inst Rural Areas Forestry & Fisheries, Braunschweig, Germany.",,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,11,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66050-68-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2012,930.0,,,,,,83,89,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BDT45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314782400010,0

Using a Markovian approach, along with uni- and multivariate econometric techniques, this study employs the Austrian Household Survey on Housing Wealth to show strong persistence in educational attainment that differs according to the gender of the parent and child. In Austria, the difference between women's and men's educational attainment has been shrinking over time while educational mobility for both genders has increased. This study finds that controlling for changes in the distribution of educational attainment over time, the relevance of a father's education is generally higher than that of a mother's. Further, Austrian mothers' and fathers' same-gender relationships to their children are stronger than cross-gender relationships of intergenerational educational transmission. These patterns clearly document the importance of gender for analyses of the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment.","[Fessler, Pirmin] Oesterreich Natl Bank, Econ Anal Div, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schneebaum, Alyssa] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Fessler, P (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Natl Bank, Econ Anal Div, Otto Wagner Pl 3, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",pirmin.fessler@oenb.at; aschneeb@econs.umass.edu,,"Schneebaum, Alyssa/0000-0002-0320-5525",,,,,46,18,23,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Unfortunately, huge investments such as those conducted in China under the Grain for Green Program (GGP) and elsewhere around the world have historically provided few long-term benefits. To design a cost-effective compensation policy for ecological restoration, the approach must integrate economic and ecological components. Here, we describe such a policy model (Buying Green Cover) and compare it with an existing approach, the GGP, using data from China's Northern Shaanxi Province. The modified compensation program pays farmers to build terraced farmland or perform other green activities that will also sustain their livelihoods once the program ends. The resulting program costs 30% less than the GGP, and will take only 3 to 7 years to achieve the GGP's 16-year goal of converting sloping farmland into forests and grassland. In contrast with the failures of the GGP and related programs, the new approach improves the management and restoration of rapidly degrading landscapes and should be applicable both in China and around the world.

Goal of this research is proposing a novel bi-objective facility location problem within batch arrival queuing framework under capacity, budget, and nearest-facility constraints. Two objective functions are considered which are minimizing sum of the travel time and waiting and minimizing maximum of ideal time pertinent to each facility, respectively. Second objective causes to obtain the best combination of the facilities which are more equilibrium for the proposed model solutions. Since this type of problem is strictly NP-hard, an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm namely particle swarm optimization algorithm with considering a specific representation process has been proposed. Since the output quality of the metaheuristic algorithms is severely depending on its parameters, we proposed an adaptive version of particle swarm optimization to be tuned the parameters of the algorithm.

Specifically, it explores the fishing behaviour and targeting options of fishermen in Dominica, with the objective of identifying catch-sets that can reduce the variance in the mean net income earned by artisanal fishers over a fishing season. The objective therein is to enable fishers to earn a more stable income, thus reducing their vulnerability to economic shocks. This is explored within the context of a risk tradeoff model for mean-variance portfolio optimization. Literature supports the view that the high degree of variability in mean catch rate contributes to the unprofitability and vulnerability of fishers and may also encourage their use of unsustainable harvesting practices in an attempt to improve fishing net revenue. The article also estimates the efficacy of targeting strategies employed by artisanal fishers, as evidenced by the ability to land the ex ante target species. The results show that there exists catch portfolios capable of reducing variance in net trip revenue across a fishing season returns for all sites, and that some fishers are in fact able to effectively land ex ante targets, which are important to overall reduction in the variability of trip net revenue. This suggests that there is scope for increasing the profitability of artisanal fishing activity in Dominica with existing vessels and gear operations of the artisanal fleet.","[Theophille, Brent] Caribbean Reg Agr Policy Network CaRAPN, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Hutchinson, Sharon D.] Univ W Indies, Fac Food & Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine,"Theophille, B (通讯作者)，Caribbean Reg Agr Policy Network CaRAPN, 10 Austin St, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",Brenttheo@gmail.com; Sharon.Hutchinson@sta.uwi.edu,"Hutchinson, Sharon D/KAZ-9847-2024","Hutchinson, Sharon D/0009-0000-1534-6192",,,,,24,5,6,0,23,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

We used three different GARCH models to examine the volatility. The study confirmed that during the global financial crisis volatility significantly increased on both stock markets. The results of this study thus do not support the common belief that the developed capital market is subject to relatively lower volatility than the developing market.

EQ-5D and KIDSCREEN-10 data were collected using a questionnaire survey performed among parents with a child or adolescent diagnosed with ADHD. The measurements were compared to assess (dis)similarities of the instruments' constructs and responsiveness to different health states. Principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was used to identify factors underlying the constructs of both instruments. Instruments' index scores of respondents with different treatment and comorbidity profiles were compared using Student's t tests. Cohen's effect sizes were calculated for an indirect comparison of the instruments' responsiveness and discriminating ability. Separate analyses were performed in children aged 8-12 and 13-18 years. A strong relation was found between the EQ-5D and KIDSCREEN-10 index scores. However correlations between EQ-5D and KIDSCREEN-10 items were moderate or low. The PCA identified five separate factors of quality of life. A physical and a mental factor included a combination of three EQ-5D dimensions and six KIDSCREEN-10 items; the remaining EQ-5D and KIDSCREEN-10 items constituted complementary factors without any overlap between the separate instruments. Scores of both instruments differed significantly according to respondents' response to treatment and comorbidity profile. Cohen's effect sizes indicated comparable results of the instruments' responsiveness and discriminative ability. The results highlight that the instruments measure different constructs of QoL in children with ADHD. Despite this, the analyses showed comparable responsiveness and discriminative ability of the instruments. These results suggest that for economic evaluations, the EQ-5D is an appropriate and valid instrument for measuring QoL in children.","[Bouwmans, Clazien; Oppe, Mark; Schawo, Saskia; Stolk, Elly; van Roijen, LeonaHakkaart] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van der Kolk, Annemarie; van Agthoven, Michel] Janssen Cilag BV, NL-5026 RH Tilburg, Netherlands; [Buitelaar, Jan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Dept Cognit Neurosci, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Johnson & Johnson; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Bouwmans, C (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bouwmans@bmg.eur.nl,"Buitelaar, Jan Koenraad/AAY-7522-2020; Schawo, Saskia J/D-9805-2013","Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona/0000-0003-0635-7388",,,,,40,13,13,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, technological innovations in health care may often induce friction in the organization of care supply, implying the congestion of services and subsequent waiting times. Our objective here is to measure how these short run rigidities can challenge cost-effectiveness recommendations favorable to an innovative mass screening test for colorectal cancer. Using Markov modeling, we compare the standard Guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) with an innovative screening test for colorectal cancer, namely the immunological fecal occult blood test (iFOBT). Waiting time can occur between a positive screening test and the subsequent confirmation colonoscopy. Five scenarios are considered for iFOBT: no further waiting time compared with gFOBT, twice as much waiting time for a period of 5 or 10 years, and twice as much waiting time for a period of 5 or 10 years combined with a 25 % decrease in participation to confirmation colonoscopies. According to our modeling, compared with gFOBT, iFOBT would approximately double colonoscopy demand. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis enables concluding that the waiting time significantly increases the uncertainty surrounding recommendations favorable to iFOBT if it induces a decrease in the adherence rate for confirmation colonoscopy.","[Chauvin, Pauline] Univ Paris 05, LIRAES, EA4470, F-72270 Paris 06, France; [Josselin, Jean-Michel] Univ Rennes 1, Fac Econ, CNRS, CREM,UMR6211, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Heresbach, Denis] Ctr Hosp Cannes, Dept Gastroenterol, F-06414 Cannes, France",Universite Paris Cite; Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Chauvin, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 05, LIRAES, EA4470, 45 Rue St Peres, F-72270 Paris 06, France.",pauline.chauvin@parisdescartes.fr,,"Chauvin, Pauline/0000-0002-8183-3164",,,,,36,6,6,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

These reviews have covered different aspects of economic evaluations, using a variety of methodological approaches. The aim of this study is to analyze the methodological characteristics of the reviews of economic evaluations in health care, published during the period 1990-2010, to identify their main features and the potential missing elements. This may help to develop a common procedure for elaborating these kinds of reviews. Methods We performed systematic searches in electronic databases (Scopus, Medline and PubMed) of methodological reviews published in English, period 1990-2010. We selected the articles whose main purpose was to review and assess the methodology applied in the economic evaluation studies. We classified the data according to the study objectives, period of the review, number of reviewed studies, methodological and non-methodological items assessed, medical specialty, type of disease and technology, databases used for the review and their main conclusions. We performed a descriptive statistical analysis and checked how generalizability issues were considered in the reviews. Results We identified 76 methodological reviews, 42 published in the period 1990-2001 and 34 during 2002-2010. The items assessed most frequently (by 70 % of the reviews) were perspective, type of economic study, uncertainty and discounting. The reviews also described the type of intervention and disease, funding sources, country in which the evaluation took place, type of journal and author's characteristics. Regarding the intertemporal comparison, higher frequencies were found in the second period for two key methodological items: the source of effectiveness data and the models used in the studies. However, the generalizability issues that apparently are creating a growing interest in the economic evaluation literature did not receive as much attention in the reviews of the second period. The remaining items showed similar frequencies in both periods. Conclusions Increasingly more reviews of economic evaluation studies aim to analyze the application of methodological principles, and offer summaries of papers classified by either diseases or health technologies. These reviews are useful for finding literature trends, aims of studies and possible deficiencies in the implementation of methods of specific health interventions. As no significant methodological improvement was clearly detected in the two periods analyzed, it would be convenient to pay more attention to the methodological aspects of the reviews.","[Hutter, Maria-Florencia; Rodriguez-Ibeas, Roberto; Antonanzas, Fernando] Univ La Rioja, Dept Econ, Logrono 26004, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja,"Antonanzas, F (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Dept Econ, Logrono 26004, Spain.",fernando.antonanzas@unirioja.es,"Antonanzas, Fernando/F-4610-2016; Rodriguez Ibeas, Roberto/F-3109-2016","Antonanzas, Fernando/0000-0001-6122-9130; Rodriguez Ibeas, Roberto/0000-0001-6604-7993",,,,,100,10,10,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

On the one hand, our results suggest that time spent in educational activities, particularly with parents, is the most productive input for cognitive skill development. On the other hand, noncognitive skills appear insensitive to alternative time allocations. Instead, they are greatly affected by the mother's parenting style.","[Fiorini, Mario] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Keane, Michael P.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Technology Sydney; University of Oxford,"Fiorini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",mario.fiorini@uts.edu.au,"Keane, Michael/R-6329-2019; Keane, Michael/O-2840-2013","Keane, Michael/0000-0002-3918-1377",,,,,29,163,184,0,41,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

The crisis simultaneously reverberated to banks around the world, and eventually brought about a worldwide recession. The biggest banks in the developed world got in trouble because they were pursuing the same strategies to make profit as the American banks. They had joined the market in the USA for mortgage-backed securities and funded them by borrowing in the asset-backed commercial paper market. When the housing market turned down, they suffered the same fate as their US counterparts. Financial deregulation played a complex role in this process. Most of the banks that participated in this market came from countries where financial deregulation occurred. But not all banks from countries with financial deregulation entered this market. Countries with high levels of financial deregulation also experienced deeper recessions, suggesting that in the home market, banks had taken on riskier loans as well. Our study makes a broader theoretical point, suggesting that subsequent studies of global finance and financial markets need to consider the identities and strategies of the banks as their tactics explain a lot about how the global markets for different financial products are structured.","[Fligstein, Neil; Habinek, Jacob] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Fligstein, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fligst@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,58,29,33,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This can occur because richer, low-minority towns tend to have more successful override votes that attract similar households with relatively high demands for public services who can afford to pay for them. To evaluate this hypothesis, I collect panel data on override behavior from 1982 to 2012 and merge this with data on school district enrollments and other district-and town-level characteristics. I find evidence that passing overrides earmarked for schools results in a significant decrease in the percent of nonwhite students enrolled in Massachusetts school districts.

We discuss different contrasting hypotheses on the role of employment during university on academic outcomes: the zero-sum perspective, the reconciliation thesis, the positive and the negative selection to work hypotheses. In the empirical part we analyze data from the Eurostudent survey, which collected data on a representative sample of university students who were enrolled in the academic year 2002/03, after the implementation of the 'Bologna Process'. We use a negative binomial regression model considering work experience as an endogenous multinomial treatment. Results indicate that, conditional on observed covariates (socio-demographic variables, school-related and university-related variables), there is a positive self-selection into employment, especially for low-intensity work. Traditional multivariate regressions show a penalty in academic progression only for high-intensity workers, but once accounted for unobserved heterogeneity also the low-intensity work experience appears to negatively affect academic progression.

Fewer three year olds are enrolled in preschool. To investigate the importance of enrollment duration, this study is the first to estimate long-term dosage effects of years of preschool. We use data from a cohort of 1500 students in the Chicago Longitudinal Study who enrolled in the Chicago Public Schools in the mid-1980s. Many of these students participated in a high-quality preschool program called Child-Parent Centers (CPC) for one or two years. To address selection with multiple treatments, we employ inverse propensity score weighting. Relative to children who attended one year of CPC preschool, the two-year group is significantly less likely to receive special education or be abused or neglected or to commit crimes.

Motives behind the selection of foresight methods, the timing involved in using insights from foresight studies in strategic policy-making processes, the added value of foresight methods, and the barriers and leverage points experienced by policy-makers are described and compared at the local and the national level. Different insights are related to different activities in the policy cycle, i.e., agenda-setting, policy preparation, decision-making, implementation, and evaluation. In most evaluative studies on foresight, the added value is addressed from a 'supply-driven' point of view, by which we mean from the point of view of experts on the production or methodology of foresight studies. In this paper, the evaluation is approached from a demand-driven perspective, in other words, from a user perspective - i.e., that of policy-makers who have applied the results of foresight methods in policy-making processes. The insights presented in this paper are based on recent policy document analyses, in-depth interviews, and questionnaire research involving users in the local and national policy domain.

Methods Data on patients suffering from AS and treated with at least one TNFi between November 2005 and 2013 were extracted retrospectively from the database of a single clinical centre. Beside demographic data, the disease activity measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), the response rates (BASDAI50), reasons for switching and survival curves of TNFis were analysed in general and in subgroups of patients treated with each of the available TNFis. The reasons for switching were defined as inefficacy, side effects of the given drug, patient's request and occurrence of extra-articular manifestations. Results Altogether, 175 patients were on TNFis and 77 of them received at least two TNFis. The patients' age at the initiation of the first TNFi was higher among switchers compared to non-switchers (42.5 +/- 12.6 vs. 38.8 +/- 11.2 years, p = 0.049); otherwise, gender, disease duration and initial disease activity had no influence on the risk of switching. The decrease of the BASDAI was similar among non-switchers and switchers using either the first or second TNFi, but the response rates to the first and second TNFi were worse in switchers than in non-switchers. Following the failure of the first TNFi, the retention on therapy was unfavourable, especially in patients on infliximab after 1 year of treatment. The main reason for switching from the first drug was inefficacy. The frequency of side effects that led to switching was higher in the infliximab group than in patients treated with other agents. Conclusion Although the retention rate to a second-line TNFi was somewhat worse than that to the first-line TNFi, the switching of TNFis is a good therapeutic option in AS patients who failed to respond to the first TNFi.","[Gulyas, Katalin; Bodnar, Nora; Nagy, Zsofia; Szamosi, Szilvia; Horvath, Agnes; Vancsa, Andrea; Vegh, Edit; Szabo, Zoltan; Szucs, Gabriella; Szekanecz, Zoltan; Szanto, Sandor] Univ Debrecen Med & Hlth Sci Ctr, Inst Med, Dept Rheumatol, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Szanto, S (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen Med & Hlth Sci Ctr, Inst Med, Dept Rheumatol, Nagyerdei Krt 98, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",szanto.sandor@med.unideb.hu,"Szekanecz, Zoltán/GXN-0235-2022; Szabo, Zoltan/H-9983-2015; Szucs, Gabriella/G-7494-2016",,,,,,27,25,25,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Free riders are defined as those who are medically capable to donate blood but do not. In addition, we distinguish four different types of free riding depending on the reason given for not donating. Binomial and multinomial logit models estimate the effect of individual characteristics on the propensity to free ride and the likelihood of the free rider types. Amongst those who are able to donate, there is a 67 % probability of being a free rider.

The Panel ruled that the EU's presumption that Chinese exporters are subject to economy-wide non-market-economy anti-dumping duties was inconsistent with WTO obligations. The EU declined to appeal this outcome and subsequently changed its anti-dumping regulation in response. This dispute also illustrates the rapidly changing structure of global manufacturing and how these changes can scramble the traditional political economy of import restrictions. In addition, the case highlights how EU members' positions on trade remedy actions can depend importantly on national production patterns and firms' responses to economic pressures from globalization and the further development of global supply chains.","[Dunoff, Jeffrey L.] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Moore, Michael O.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; George Washington University,"Dunoff, JL (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",jeffrey.dunoff@temple.edu; mom@gwu.edu,,"Dunoff, Jeffrey/0009-0007-6093-332X",,,,,20,12,13,1,31,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2014,13.0,2,,,,,149,178,,10.1017/S1474745614000056,0.0,,,30,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AG5GA,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335446300002,0

This will require a complete change in power generation over the next 40 years. The system involved is immensely complex, with multiple agents, levels of description, new technologies and new policies and actions. However, here we develop a relatively simple spatial, dynamic model representing a basic part of the problem - the changing geographical distribution of electrical generation capacity in the UK. It runs from 2010 until 2050 and allows the exploration of the different pattern of investments in, and closures of, generation capacity. It was develop as part of the CASCADE project on Smart Grids to provide scenarios for annual changes in generating capacity. It provides generation scenarios for much more complex, multi-agent models, such as that developed in the CASCADE project, that represent the short-term (30 mm time step) dynamics of the wholesale and retail energy markets. The model allows us to explore different possible pathways to 2050 and the difficulty of the overall endeavour. In order to increase electricity production but reduce CO2 emissions, we shall need to close our current coal/gas generating plants and make a vast investment in new low carbon generating capacity.

Using difference-in-difference approaches and sample children from the China Health and Nutrition Survey 2000, 2004, and 2006 waves, we find that tuition control has had a minimal effect on primary and junior high school enrollment. Furthermore, a policy that includes tuition waivers, free textbooks, and living expense subsidies starting from 2003 had a significantly positive effect on school enrollment of rural girls, but not rural boys. This gender differential effect results from the improvement in the enrollment of girls who live in poor households. Finally, the provision for tuition waive for all rural children since 2006, although having no statistically significant effect on the overall enrollment, indeed improved the enrollment of children who were less likely to have enjoyed two-waiver-one-subsidy.

A large literature has developed focusing on the relative educational performance of different school types. Beyond these important outcomes, variations in schooling may have direct effects on students' contemporaneous welfare. For instance, private schools may generate better performance by requiring greater effort from students and exerting more pressure upon them. This paper uses data from three Spanish regions to examine how private schooling affects one domain of student wellbeing, satisfaction with education. While naive estimates suggest a positive effect of private schooling on student satisfaction. These effects disappear, and even turn negative, after introducing controls for school quality and/or taking into account selection on unobservables. This suggests that while private schools may generate better educational outcomes, they do not necessarily maximize, and may even reduce, adolescents' contemporaneous welfare. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

India was ahead of its times when it first ushered in financial inclusion by nationalizing its banks in mid-1969 and then coming up with a slew of policies to operationalize it. The track record is a mix of successes and failures. This paper tries to capture some of these and visualize where India will gain and what it may lose over the next three or four decades. Considering India's growing economic importance and the projections that the Indian economy will be as big as the United States economy around 2050, the paper tries to understand how the economic upswing will mesh with India's socio-political and environmental processes that also influence financial inclusion; and what the different scenarios might be in 2050. This paper discusses what role financial inclusion will play in India's economy in the year 2050. It suggests some possible scenarios and policy measures to move towards a desirable scenario.

Males tend to postpone, but not abandon, their dropout decision when surrounded by more females and perform worse on courses with high math content. There is also a modest reduction in absenteeism early in the year. Overall, however, we find no substantial gender peer effects on achievement.

However, it is unclear whether these associations are causal in nature or whether they can be explained by difficult-to-measure heterogeneity at the community, family, or individual level. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and ordinary least squares, we show that stuttering is negatively associated with high school grades, the probability of high school graduation, and the probability of college attendance. However, empirical specifications with family fixed effects or controls for learning disabilities such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder suggest that these associations can, in large part, be explained by difficult-to-measure heterogeneity.

It specifically analysed the socioeconomic characteristics of women entrepreneurship and assessed the contribution of female-owned businesses to poverty alleviation in the study area. The main reason for this study was due to the fact that most studies on the relationship between businesses development and poverty alleviation have concentrated on aggregate effects of small businesses on poverty reduction with little attention on individual traits of the businesses and gender issue in rural areas. The target population was all the women-owned enterprises from five communities in Akoko North-East Local Government Area in Ondo state of Nigeria. The choice of these communities was based on the concentration of women enterprises. The businesses were first identified and 50 per cent of the enterprises in each community were sampled using systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected using questionnaire on a sample of 205 enterprises. The result of descriptive statistics showed that 75% micro enterprises owners sourced their income mainly from their businesses, 85% of small scale enterprises (SSEs) sourced their income from their businesses while 67% of the medium scale enterprise owners sourced their income from their businesses. This suggests that the SMEs businesses constitute the main source of livelihood for all the scales of business women owners. Majority of respondents (82%), who chose income from small businesses as their number one source, indicated an improvement in their standard of living, and 18% reported no change. There was also evidence of an increase in the number of SMEs that have grown from microenterprises to small scale and medium scale over the span of the last five years apart from the substantial improvement in the income and consumption. The study therefore concluded that female-owned microenterprises have played key role in poverty reduction among the businesses' owners in Akoko Division through income generation and job creation.","[Bowale, Ebenezer Kayode; Longe, John B.] Adekunle Ajasin Univ, Akungba Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria; [Suaibu, Olufemi] Univ Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria",University of Lagos,"Bowale, EK (通讯作者)，Adekunle Ajasin Univ, Akungba Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria.",kayobowale@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,29,1,1,1,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,133,150,,,,,,18,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000011,0

Other specificities are function accumulation, informal leadership, preference for oral communication before written, etc. Nevertheless, implementation of strategic management can increase competitiveness, reduce costs, improve decision-making, facilitate implementation of the employee motivation system, shorten delivery times, higher quality of customer satisfaction, etc. The aim of this article is to find how much SME include principals of the strategic management by their aims.","[Brezinova, Monika; Prusova, Jindriska] South Bohemia Univ, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Brezinová, M (通讯作者)，South Bohemia Univ, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",brezina@ef.jcu.cz; brezina@ef.jcu.cz,"Březinová, Monika/HMW-0699-2023; Brezinova, Monika/F-5482-2016",,,,,,7,6,11,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,529,535,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000052,0

Using a panel sample of 192 firms from 2005 to 2009, we find that foreign shareholders invest less in companies with high ownership-control disparity, which suggests that distorted ownership structure negatively affects foreign investors' shareholdings. We also find that foreign industrial investors invest less in companies with high disparity than do foreign financial investors.

This allows us to address several interesting questions such as volatility of prices of aquaculture products relative to capture fisheries, or how does volatility vary across species or product forms. In addition we compare the volatility of fish prices to other commodities to investigate their volatility in a broader context. Given the importance of trade in fisheries and aquaculture, our analysis also sheds light on the relative importance of price risk as part of trade revenue risk and the riskiness of various fish enterprises at the market level.","[Dahl, Roy Endre; Oglend, Atle] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Dahl, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",roy.e.dahl@uis.no; atle.oglend@uis.no,,"Dahl, Roy Endre/0000-0002-1874-795X",,,,,51,94,97,2,32,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

In order to achieve its goal, the study uses a pooled dataset consisting of annual observations over the crisis time. Even though a countercyclical fiscal policy is highly recommended from the theoretical point of view, the empirical evidence points to an extensive use of pro-cyclical fiscal policy. In this perspective, the paper provides some empirical basis for the argument that pro-cyclical fiscal policy does not assist in dampening the GDP shocks. Being focused on empirical, contextualized analysis, this study highlights the cyclical dynamics of macroeconomic aggregates and only offers conjectures as to the reasons behind the behavior of fiscal policy and its influence on the macroeconomic output.

Although the effects of imports on growth are generally negative, in our disaggregated analysis by country, we find results for eight countries support the ELG theory, results for five countries support the ILG theory, results for one country support both theories and results for one country support neither theory. An interesting finding is the negative correlation between the impacts of exports and the impacts of imports on GDP growth, which implies that, in theory, ELG and ILG cannot exist simultaneously in a country.","[Kristjanpoller R, Werner] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Ind, Valparaiso, Chile; [Olson, Josephine E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Olson, Josephine E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Joseph M Katz Grad Sch Business, Int Business Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Kristjanpoller, W (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Ind, Valparaiso, Chile.",werner.kristjanpoller@usm.cl; jolson@katz.pitt.edu,"Kristjanpoller, Werner/V-1239-2019","Kristjanpoller, Werner/0000-0002-5878-072X",,,,,84,12,14,4,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

To correct for the problem of endogeneity of the education variable, the method of instrumental variables was used, taking the number of family members and the number of schools by Brazilian state when the individual was ten years old as instruments for human capital. The analysis shows that for all individuals, human capital (educational level) is important in determining health status. It is even more important for those with chronic diseases. One additional year of education improves the probability of a good health status by as much as ten percentage points for those with chronic disease and seven percentage points for those without reporting chronic disease.","[Russo, Leticia Xander] PCE UEM, Econ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Dias, Joilson] State Univ Maringa UEM, Dept Econ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Maringa,"Russo, LX (通讯作者)，PCE UEM, Econ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",leticia_xr@hotmail.com; jdias@uem.br,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,1,DENFAR TRANSNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,ONTARIO,"58 RIDEAU HEIGHTS DR, ONTARIO, OTTAWA NEPEAN K2E 7A6, CANADA",,,978-0-9868210-5-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,282,295,,,,,,14,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353691000018,0

Yet for many fisheries, harvesting activities may affect the underlying biological productivity of the fish stock by impacting the forage or habitat quantity or quality. We refer to this as an ecosystem externality. Ecosystem externalities may be positive as well as negative. While fishing may damage habitat in ways that reduce productivity, in some cases it may increase food availability and thereby increase productivity of the target species of a fishery. Extending the model of Smith (1968), we use three equations to characterize dynamics of a resource stock, profit-maximizing individual behavior, and vessel entry/exit. We use this simple model to show how ecosystem externalities, in conjunction with stock externalities and crowding externalities, affect system dynamics, open-access equilibria, and optimal fishery regulation implemented through a tax.","[Ryan, Richard W.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Holland, Daniel S.] NOAA Fisheries, Conservat Biol Div, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Herrera, Guillermo E.] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Bowdoin College,"Ryan, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, 238 Lorch Hall,611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",richryan@umich.edu; dan.holland@noaa.gov; gherrera@bowdoin.edu,,"Holland, Daniel/0000-0002-4493-859X","National Science Foundation, Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program [0709527]; Gail Roggin Wilensky Fellowship Program; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences [0709527] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation, Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program; Gail Roggin Wilensky Fellowship Program; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","Funding for this research from the National Science Foundation, Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program, Award# 0709527 is gratefully acknowledged.

For almost four years, the authors have been using a wiki platform as part of a blended learning programme of English for Academic Purposes for non-native adult learners. The present study aims to determine the efficiency of this tool so as to improve it to match better learners' needs. Data were collected for the academic year 2011-2012 and the non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis method was employed to estimate efficiency. The input measures were assembled from the number of students, the number of accessed pages and the respective number of views. The output measures were constructed from the exam success rates and the number of edits on personal pages accounting for independent work. By using boundary analysis, we could separate pages that may qualify as efficient for the language learning process from those that may need improvements so that the wiki platform may become more effective. This may involve a better allocation of teaching/learning resources such as instructional design elements and contents. On the other hand, the study may also offer a prototype of measuring the efficiency of a Web 2.0 tool designed for teaching and learning in the larger context of companies delivering lifelong learning and continuous training to their employees.

In line with international developments in public research policy, a number of important changes have been occurring in the administration of publicly-funded forest research programs. These include the privatization of government research functions, a move towards more collaborative research partnerships with community and industry, and an increased demand for research competition and evaluation based on key performance measures. Through these actions, governments are embracing the need for publicly-funded forest research to be framed as an applied endeavor, capable of delivering public value through industry innovation, education and sustainable forest management.

Using a unique dataset, we estimated the productive efficiency of each hospital through a bootstrapped data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. In a second stage, we explored, using a bootstrapped truncated regression, the impact of environmental factors on hospitals' technical and scale efficiency. Our results reveal that over 80 % of the examined hospitals appear to have a technical efficiency lower than 0.8, while the majority appear to be scale efficient. Moreover, efficiency performance differed with inclusion of medical examinations as an additional variable. On the other hand, bed occupancy ratio appeared to affect both technical and scale efficiency in a rather interesting way, while the adoption of advanced medical equipment and the type of hospital improves scale and technical efficiency, correspondingly. The findings of this study on Greek hospitals' performance are not encouraging. Furthermore, our results raise questions regarding the number of hospitals that should operate, and which type of hospital is more efficient. Finally, the results indicate the role of medical equipment in performance, confirming its misallocation in healthcare expenditure.","[Kounetas, Kostas] Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Patras 26504, Greece; [Papathanassopoulos, Fotis] Univ Patras, Dept Med Phys, Biomed Engn Unit, Patras 26504, Greece",University of Patras; University of Patras,"Kounetas, K (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Univ Campus Rio, Patras 26504, Greece.",Kounetas@upatras.gr; fpap@upatras.gr,"Kounetas, Kostas/AAI-5354-2020; Kounetas, Kostas Elias/C-3395-2013","Kounetas, Kostas/0000-0003-4976-6747; Kounetas, Kostas Elias/0000-0003-4976-6747; Papathanassopoulos, Fotis/0000-0001-8281-9535",,,,,48,62,64,1,87,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Current policies, however, still pursue a development model that is oriented towards global commodity markets and the capacity of well-qualified entrepreneurs with the capital required for large-scale investments, despite a growing consensus on its ecological incompatibilities, social limitations and economic risks. Decision makers from both governmental and non-governmental organisations widely disregard the possibility that smallholders could more actively contribute to rural development. Instead, the production practices of smallholders and their modes of social organisation are perceived as obsolete and inefficient. By presenting examples from the region, this paper argues that smallholders have the potential to manage production systems that maintain environmental stability while effectively contributing to local well-being. Therefore, the paper advocates to more effectively using local capacities for the development of rural Amazon through the promotion of small-scale production systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

According to the population census of 1802, married women's participation rates were conspicuously low compared with the rates of unmarried women and widows and therefore deserve additional investigation. First, the study points out the value of a methodological approach based on the use of nonprincipal breadwinner-oriented sources, such as registers of applicants for poor relief. Here, all members of the family were encouraged to declare their occupations and activities in some detail in order to demonstrate concrete contribution to the survival of the family. Finally, the study discusses the occupational patterns of women employed as servants and as artisans and laborers in silk manufacturing. This highlights the crucial role played by migration flows and by women's access to skilled or low-qualified jobs in determining the extent of women's participation in preindustrial Turin's labor market.","Univ Rouen, Grp Rech Hist GRHIS, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France",Universite de Rouen Normandie,"Micheletto, BZ (通讯作者)，Univ Rouen, Grp Rech Hist GRHIS, Rue Lavoisier, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France.",beatrice.zucca@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,9,9,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Health care costs were estimated following a micro-costing approach from two perspectives: (1) costs incurred to society in general, and (2) costs incurred to statutory health insurance. Data were obtained using questionnaires. Several empirical models for identifying the relationship between health care costs and independent variables, including age, gender, route of transmission and CD4 cell count at baseline, were developed. Average annual health care costs were a,not sign23,298 per patient from the societal perspective and a,not sign19,103 from the statutory health insurance perspective. Most expenses are caused by antiretroviral medication (80 % of the total and 89 % of direct costs), while hospital costs represented 7 % of total expenditure. A statistically significant association was found between health care costs and clinical variables, with higher CD4 count and female gender generating lower costs, while increased antiretroviral experience and injection drug use led to higher expenditures (P < 0.05). Expenditures for HIV-infection are driven mainly by drug costs. We identified several clinical variables influencing the costs of HIV-treatment. This information could assist policymakers when allocating limited health care resources to HIV care.","[Mostardt, Sarah; Wasem, Juergen; Neumann, Anja] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Hlth Care Management & Res, D-45127 Essen, Germany; [Hanhoff, Nikola; Goetzenich, Armin; Schewe, Knud; Mayr, Christoph; Jaeger, Hans; Dupke, Stephan] German Assoc Phys Specialized HIV Care eV, DAGNA eV, Berlin, Germany; [Schewe, Knud] ICH Study Ctr, Hamburg, Germany; [Wolf, Eva] MUC Res, Munich, Germany; [Mayr, Christoph] Arzteforum, Berlin, Germany; [Jaeger, Hans] MVZ Karlspl HIV Res & Clin Care Ctr, Munich, Germany; [Pfaff, Holger] IMVR, Cologne, Germany; [Pfaff, Holger] Zentrum Versorgungsforsch Koln ZVFK, Cologne, Germany; [Dupke, Stephan] Schwerpunktpraxis, Berlin, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Mostardt, S (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Hlth Care Management & Res, Schutzenbahn 70, D-45127 Essen, Germany.",sarah.mostardt@medman.uni-due.de,"Pfaff, Holger/D-2630-2009; Wasem, Juergen/AAT-8398-2021; Pfaff, Holger/AAT-6014-2020","Pfaff, Holger/0000-0001-9154-6575; Pfaff, Holger/0000-0001-9154-6575; Wasem, Juergen/0000-0001-9653-168X",,,,,32,18,20,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Traditionally, assessments of resource equity have focused on per-pupil expenditures and more proximal inputs, such as teacher credentials and class size, despite the inconsistent and/or weak relationships between these measures and student performance. Given the sizable and direct effects of teachers on student achievement, we argue that (1) teachers' value-added scores should be incorporated into assessments of resource equity and (2) providing schools with greater flexibility for setting salaries or using strategic staffing initiatives may be necessary to achieve an equitable distribution of effective teachers. To illustrate these assertions we incorporate teacher value added into a case study of resource allocation in the public high schools of Wayne County, North Carolina, which have been the target of a complaint by the North Carolina National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.","[Bastian, Kevin C.; Thompson, Charles L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Bastian, Kevin C.; Thompson, Charles L.] Univ N Carolina, Educ Policy Initiat Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Henry, Gary T.] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Dept Leadership Policy & Org, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College,"Bastian, KC (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",kbastian@email.unc.edu; gary.henry@vanderbilt.edu; cthomps@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,53,8,8,0,17,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The teachers' unions at the state and national levels contribute a great deal of money to candidates for state and federal offices. This gives the unions some influence in passing (defeating) bills that would help (harm) the state's teachers. We introduce two novel measures of the strength of the state-wide teachers union: union dues per teacher and union expenditures per student. These reflect the key role of political influence for state-wide unions. We provide remarkably strong evidence that students in states with strong teachers unions have lower proficiency rates than students in states with weak state-wide teacher unions.

The empirical results for the 1983-2009 period confirm that a wage premium exists for individuals working in managerial and financial occupations, and that this finance wage premium is not equally distributed among all gender and ethnic groups. For each ethnic group, men have taken an increasing share of the finance wage premium at the expense of women. More specifically, white - and, to a lesser degree, Hispanic - men have enjoyed a disproportionate share of the finance wage premium.

The goal of the capstone is to provide a research experience similar to those in the honors college but on the smaller scale of a one-semester course. The revisions for converting an existing course to a capstone, the student activities adopted, and sample outcomes are addressed. The hurdles overcome within the respective colleges in order to create a capstone course are discussed. Summaries of several student projects as well as publication of faculty-mentored student research papers illustrate the viability of econometrics as a capstone course for institutions unable to establish a stand-alone research course for that purpose.","Middle Tennessee State Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA",Middle Tennessee State University,"Klein, CC (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA.",cklein@mtsu.edu,,,,,,,18,9,9,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0485,,,J ECON EDUC,J.

Trust can partly be created through trust-building institutions. This article scrutinizes the role played by forest certification in building trust at the local level of the forest sectors of Finland and Russia. The requirements for public participation of forest certification schemes are being used as a tool for analyzing the trust-building capacity of forest certification schemes. The need for extra trust is different in these countries. Hence, it is no surprise that forest certification plays different roles in trust-building in Finland and Russia. From the Russian experience we can learn that a non-state regulation can increase openness, participation and trust in a country of a low level of trust and very little participatory rights in environmental legislation. In Russia, trust-building can be a win-win situation, where participatory mechanisms can benefit all stakeholders at the local level. Yet, enhancing trust requires both procedural and substantive rights for local communities. In Finland participatory rights are in general well defined in environmental legislation. Forest legislation is, however, an exception, and forest certification has not been able to increase the amount of participation in forest management. The different trust-relationships are considered to be in conflict and especially the current interpretation of private ownership encumbers the local-level trust-building through participation and openness. It is therefore apparent that increasing openness would require wide public discussion and changes in Finnish forest legislation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Interestingly; there is little research about how pupils in Germany perceive the concept of social change and what drives social change. This article presents the outcome of a three year long research project that aimed to analyse how a sample of German pupils makes sense of social change and what forces drive social change in society through future narratives (written assignments and interviews). The study finds that pupils have an implicit and explicit understanding of politics and the state as a driving force, but that this is challenged by external drivers such as the global economy/technology and internal drivers such as human self-interest/egoism and insecurity/fear. In this study, the pupils often describe the present economy as being organised and the future economy to become more and more disorganised. Using future narratives in critical pedagogy can be a way to work more closely with the students and their perceptions of social change and drivers of change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study asks whether or not young adults (ages 18-22) in 2007, particularly among lower income households, are significantly more likely to own savings accounts and to accumulate more savings when they have access to savings accounts at banking institutions as adolescents (ages 13-17) in 2002. We investigate this question using longitudinal data (low-to-moderate income sample [LMI; N = 530]; low-income sample [LI; N = 354]) from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its supplements. Results from propensity score weighting and bivariate probit estimates support this hypothesis. Asset-building policies that extend early access to savings accounts may improve savings outcomes for young people from lower income households, which hopefully affords them with the economic resources needed to lead productive and satisfying lives.

Subsequently, the United States has imposed concurrent ADDs and CVDs in numerous cases against China. China challenged a number of aspects of the US practice, most notably the double-remedies issue, which occurs when a domestic subsidy is offset by both an ADD and CVD. The Appellate Body (AB) correctly ruled that double remedies are inconsistent with the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and that the burden was on the investigating authorities to ensure that double remedies were not being imposed; however, the AB largely limited its discussion to measurement concerns, an approach that may have inadvertently opened the door to future double-remedies disputes involving other methods for computing normal value. Two other issues that are likely to have significant long-term ramifications are (i) the scope of the term 'public body' and (ii) the appropriate use of out-of-country benchmarks.

We argue that such estimates may overlook important treatment effect heterogeneity; in order to appreciate the full extent of a policy's distributional impacts one should also exploit alternative methods. We demonstrate this using data from Project STAR, where we find evidence of substantial treatment effect heterogeneity across achievement quantiles. While all children appear to benefit from being placed in small classes, the largest test score gains are at the top of the achievement distribution. This result seems to be at odds with previous evidence that smaller classes benefit disadvantaged children most, but the discrepancy is reconciled by the fact that there are similar patterns of treatment effect heterogeneity within demographic groups, and that gains for disadvantaged students are larger throughout much of the achievement distribution.

Our hypotheses were that differences between countries can probably be explained by methodological differences in cost calculations, by differences in medical practices and by differences in cost structures within the two countries. Classifications of DRG used in the two countries differ (AP-DRGs version 1.7 in Switzerland and APR-DRGs version 15.0 in Belgium). The first step of this study was to transform Belgian summaries into Swiss AP-DRGs. Belgian and Swiss data were calculated with a clinical costing methodology (full costing). Belgian and Swiss costs were converted into US$ PPP (purchasing power parity) in order to neutralize differences in purchasing power between countries. The results of this study showed higher costs in Switzerland despite standardization of cost data according to PPP. The difference is not explained by the case-mix index because this was similar for inliers between the two countries. The length of stay (LOS) was also quite similar for inliers between the two countries. The case-mix index was, however, higher for high outliers in Belgium, as reflected in a higher LOS for these patients. Higher costs in Switzerland are thus probably explained mainly by the higher number of agency staff by service in this country or because of differences in medical practices. It is possible to make international comparisons but only if there is standardization of the case-mix between countries and only if comparable accountancy methodologies are used. Harmonization of DRGs groups, nomenclature and accountancy is thus required.","[Pirson, M.; Martins, D.; Leclercq, P.] Univ Libre Brussels, Unite Econ & Gest, Inst Soins, Dept Econ Sante,Ecole Sante Publ, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Schenker, L.; Dung, Duong; Chale, J.

The productive efficiency of Lithuanian family farms was estimated on a basis of Farm Accountancy Data Network sample by the means of data envelopment analysis, which did indicate that the average technical efficiency fluctuated around 65.8%, whereas the mean allocative efficiency approached 70.5%. The mean economic efficiency, therefore, was rather low, namely 46%. These figures imply that Lithuanian family farms should improve both technological and managerial practices and thus achieve higher productivity in order to successfully compete in the single market of the EU. The second stage analysis of efficiency scores which, indeed, had not been performed for Lithuanian agricultural sector before revealed some causes of inefficiency. Specifically, the tobit model was employed to quantify efficiency effects, whereas the logit model was fitted to estimate factors of increase in efficiency. Basically, these analyses showed that large livestock farms adopted organic farming practices are those most efficient. Moreover, they were more likely to exhibit an increase in the productive efficiency.","[Balezentis, Tomas; Krisciukaitiene, Irena] Lithuania Vilnius Univ, Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Vilnius University,"Balezentis, T (通讯作者)，Lithuania Vilnius Univ, Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",tomas@laei.lt; irena@laei.lt,"Krisciukaitiene, Irena/HPD-8633-2023; Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711",European Social Fund under the Global Grant measure,European Social Fund under the Global Grant measure,This research was funded by the European Social Fund under the Global Grant measure.,,25,1,1,0,17,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In this article we estimate the value of a healthy waterbody through a hedonic property price analysis utilizing water quality as the amenity of interest. We compare hedonic analysis results using technical measures of water quality to the results using a non-technical measure of water quality location grade available in an urban coastal housing market of South Florida. Our results indicate that water quality improvement is associated with higher property values. In the comparison between technical and non-technical measures of water quality, we find that the technical measures provide better prediction of housing prices than the non-technical location grade. We further impute implicit prices for water quality improvement where significant mean willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates range from $7,531 to $43,158.","[Bin, Okmyung] E Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Czajkowski, Jeffrey] Univ Penn, Wharton Risk Management & Decis Proc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University of Pennsylvania,"Bin, O (通讯作者)，E Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Brewster Bldg A-435, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",bino@ecu.edu; jczaj@wharton.upenn.edu,,,Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1204780] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),,,31,28,33,3,25,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The growth in demands for energy and raw material and also the increasing demands on people's quality of life deepens the states' dependence on vital resources and the likelihood of raw material and energy crises. The energy that we use today, whether in the form of heat, electricity or fuels for motor vehicles has its origin mainly in fossil fuels, especially in oil, coal and natural gas. Each of these resources is still created by the action of natural forces, but not fast enough and not everywhere. As the majority of energy sources are non-renewable, such dependence is highlighted even more. The current consumption of fossil fuels for energy production exceeds their creation many times, and so it may be that they will be exhausted in the near future. It is for this reason fossil fuels are considered to be nonrenewable. Their limitation is not the only problem that humanity is facing. Imprudent and inefficient exploitation of natural resources can lead to their exhaustion, irreversible damage to the environment and the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, it is necessary to highlight the importance of renewable energy sources as a substitute for fossil fuels, rural development and the need for good energy policy that will create favorable conditions for the expansion of energy production from renewable energy sources. In addition to environmental benefits, the application of renewable energy sources increases the country's energy independence on imported fuels and energy. They are domestic resources, which help to increase the security of energy supply and its diversification. Renewable energy sources have a major role in local and regional development, as well as employment. This contribution presents the current state of the energy sources usage in the European Union and the Slovak Republic and the comparison between their consumption. It refers to the management of energy production from renewable sources, particularly biomass, its use in the agricultural and heat generation enterprise and the economic benefit quantification of energy production from this source for the enterprise's needs, as an option for reducing the use of fossil fuels for energy production. Next, the situation in the use of gas as an energy source before and after the construction of a straw burning boiler, cost analysis associated with the operation and the quantification of economic benefit of replacing the conventional energy source with biomass is compared. In addition, the contribution includes a model project for the construction of a straw burning boiler in conditions of Slovak farms and transparently handles the procedure of replacing conventional sources with renewable sources in the model farm. This process includes an initial analysis of the annual heat demand for objects, which are to be heated by energy from biomass, determination of the required average boiler power, quantifying the cost of investment and return on such investment.","[Culikova, Martina; Richterova, Lucia] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra 94901, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,,xculikova@is.uniag.sk; xrichterova@is.uniag.sk,,,,,,,8,2,2,0,17,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,78,89,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600008,0

Based on the results of these parameters yield of roots, yield of tops, sugar content and sugar content in molasses were assessed. The highest root yield was achieved with application of Fertiacyl Starter (131 t.ha(-1)). The highest production of tops was observed with application of Glukorapid (44 t.ha(-1)). Record sugar content - more than 20% - was achieved with application of Elitic (70) + Thiotrac. The lowest losses of sugar in molasses 1.27% were detected with the variants treated with Glukorapid.","[Pechkova, J.; Hrivna, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Food Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Pechková, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Food Technol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",pechkovajana@tiscali.cz,,,,,,,8,1,1,1,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,597,602,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800103,0

The essential oil content was determined by the means of steam distillation. Analysis of individual components was performed via gas chromatography / flame ionisation detection (GC/FID). Gas chromatograph HP-4890D with FID was used for the identification and ratio determination of the analytes of interest. The differences in the essential oil content were found in both evaluated years. The essential oil content found in the samples from 2011 was much higher compared to the year 2010. The amount of selected components - myrcene, caryophyllene, farnesene and humulene - was determined in the essential oil. The highest content of myrcene was found in samples from 2011 from hop-growing region Trsice (56.9 %). The highest content of caryophyllene was found in samples from 2011 from hop-growing region Saaz (18.3 %). The content of farnesene wasn't statistically significantly different in both evaluated years in hop-growing regions Trsice and Ustek. The content of farnesene in these samples varied in the range of 12.0 - 12.5 %. Humulene was the second highest contained component in the essential oils. The results indicate that the content and composition of the essential oil depends on the growing region and on the weather course during the harvest year. Hop essential oils have, among others, antibacterial effects and could be used also for the stabilisation of non-beer beverages from the view-point of microbial purity.","[Pokorna, T.; Pluhackova, H.; Kocourkova, B.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Kleinova, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Pokorná, T (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xpokor16@node.mendelu.cz,"Pluhackova, Helena/L-1414-2018; Pluhackova, Helena/JCD-7644-2023","Pluhackova, Helena/0000-0001-9594-6111; Pluhackova, Helena/0000-0001-9594-6111",,,,,9,0,0,0,13,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,136,140,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800022,0

This paper uses data on all middle school students in Wake County, NC from 1999 to 2006 to identify the causal effect of daily start times on academic performance. Using variation in start times within schools over time, the effect is a two percentile point gain in math test scores - roughly fourteen percent of the black-white test score gap. I find similar results for reading scores and using variation in start times across schools. The effect is stronger for students in the lower end of the distribution of test scores. I find evidence supporting increased sleep as a mechanism through which start times affect test scores. Later start times compare favorably on cost grounds to other education interventions which result in similar test score gains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a reduced form model of state-level education policy in which state policy makers, who have objectives that differ from those of Federal policy makers, respond to changes in Federal policies. Our empirical specification treats state and institutional variables as endogenous; we interpret the coefficients as measuring the responses of state and institution officials to changes in Federal policies. We simulate the effects of AGI and find little evidence that states recapture Federal education resources. AGI would have a significant effect on educational quality but a limited effect on enrollments. An equivalent increase in Federal student aid would have greater impact on access and enrollments, but decrease educational quality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In these economies, dollarization plays a dual role: on the one hand, it provides a hedging instrument protecting the value of savings; on the other hand, it generates a currency mismatch on banks' balance sheets and increases default risk. Through these effects deposit dollarization can affect credit extension. This paper investigates the role of deposit dollarization on the financial depth of forty-four emerging market economies.

To test for such spillover effects, we estimate the bubble component of price changes using a nonlinear, structural, state-space model with time-variable parameters. We apply directionality tests to bubbles formed in the United States and Turkey. We find that bubbles originating in the United States lead to bubbles in Turkey. We provide empirical evidence on bubbles formed during the major financial crises of the past two decades in Turkey and the past century in the United States. Despite the improvement in fundamentals and overall economic performance, we find the Turkish asset market is still subject to volatile financial bubbles that might stem from abroad.","[Hatipoglu, Ozan] Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Hatipoglu, Ozan] Bogazici Univ, Ctr Econ & Econometr, Istanbul, Turkey; [Uyar, Onur] Bogazici Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University; Bogazici University; Bogazici University,"Hatipoglu, O (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",ozan.hatipoglu@boun.edu.tr; onur.uyar@boun.edu.tr,,,,,,,41,6,6,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Higher school expenditures, triggered by higher revenues from local taxes on hydropower plants, have a significantly positive effect on pupil performance.

Based on longitudinal student-level data from 2004 to 2009, this paper utilizes two approaches to evaluate the Utah charter school effectiveness: (a) hierarchical linear growth models with matched sample, and (b) general methods of moments with student-fixed effects regressions. Both methods yield consistent results that charter schools on average perform slightly worse as compared to traditional public schools, a result that is primarily affected by the low effectiveness and high student mobility of newly opened charter schools. Interestingly, when charter schools gain more experience they become as effective as traditional public schools, and in some cases more effective than traditional public schools. This research has implications for local and state charter school policies, particularly policies that avoid start-up costs associated with new charter schools. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 and the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988, we show that the increase in time to degree is localized among those who begin their postsecondary education at public colleges outside the most selective universities. We consider several potential explanations for these trends. First, we show that changes in the college preparedness and the demographic composition of degree recipients cannot account for the observed increases. Instead, our results identify declines in collegiate resources in the less selective public sector and increases in student employment as potential explanations for the observed increases in time to degree.","[Lovenheim, Michael F.] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lovenheim, Michael F.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Bound, John] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bound, John] Natl Bur Econ Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Turner, Sarah] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Turner, Sarah] Natl Bur Econ Res, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Virginia; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lovenheim, MF (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jbound@umich.edu; mfl55@cornell.edu; sturner@virginia.edu,"Lovenheim, Michael F/K-7260-2012",,,,,,45,98,172,0,25,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

In particular, we find that (1) state P2 programs had a significant impact on average facility level toxic releases, reducing annual releases by 11-15%; (2) for every $100,000 of federal matching funds awarded for state P2 activities, average facility level releases in the recipient state declined on the order of 1-1.5%; (3) P2-induced reductions are significantly enhanced by information spillovers, diffused primarily via industry networks rather than geographic proximity; (4) facilities respond to technical assistance programs by reducing toxic releases, but only for substances that are not simultaneously regulated by formal command and control strategies; and (5) facilities respond to filing fees and non-reporting penalties by altering their toxic releases, but only for chemicals that are easily monitored by regulators.

However, participation is not always successful. Conflicting values and power inequalities are all factors that can severely undermine participatory processes. Where so far the main focus of research has been on power imbalances and conflicting interests, this article focuses on another source of conflict, i.e. differing views of reality and underlying cultural biases. Research states that cultural theory (CT), which subdivides the divergent notions of reality into four worldviews (hierarchism, individualism, egalitarianism, fatalism), could be a useful tool to gain insight in conflicting views of reality and the consequences of these conflicting views for participatory processes. To investigate the value of CT for participation, a study in Java (Indonesia) was carried out to determine to what extent worldviews can be used to predict preferred strategies in forestry problems. The results show that an empirical identification of worldviews was possible. These worldviews however do not automatically explain how individuals address forestry problems. This might be because of the difficulty of measuring worldviews in relation to individuals' strategies. It might also be that CT's explanatory capacity is overestimated. In either case, we can conclude that CT the way it is used now is not the instrument that will help us solving the problems in participatory processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These are criticized because they are seen to imply intolerable deviations, both upwards and downwards, from a way of living presumed as universal, thereby fostering a segregation of life-worlds and social disintegration.

This contrasts sharply with some OECD tax activity that has focussed on urgent needs for greater international policy congruence.","[Kudrle, Robert T.] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kudrle, Robert T.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Kudrle, RT (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",kudrle@umn.edu,,,,,,,117,6,7,0,14,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Data were sourced from Taipei Veterans General Hospital cancer registry and claim data during 1999-2002. Besides, claimed data from National Health Insurance were used to match the comparison group. To estimate lifetime cost (10 years), the whole disease process was divided into initial, continuing, and terminal three phases. The expected lifetime cost of a specific cancer patient was estimated by incorporating the average phase-specific costs with the survival rate and mortality rate. The undiscounted average lifetime costs (10 years) for lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, and breast cancer were NT$448,371 (1USDa parts per thousand'NTD 33), NT$584,985, NT$351,222, NT$511,563, and NT$674,282 (in 2002 NTD), respectively.

In this study, we propose Landscape Image Sketching Technique as an original, practical methodology to externalise an individual landscape image as a scene sketch aiming to represent the viewer's fundamental way of seeing the landscape. To discuss different perceptions and interpretations of forests in a cultural framework, we conducted cross-national research in Japan and Russia. A total of 325 respondents were asked to make a landscape image sketch of an imaginary forest and to include keywords and text. The sketches were analysed by means of four aspects: 'linguistic knowledge', 'spatial view', 'self-orientation' and 'social meaning', which were represented by landscape elements, the shape of elements, the subject's standpoint and the combination of the elements in the framework. As a result, landscape image sketches revealed differences between respondents in Japan and Russia. The typical landscape images of a forest were represented objectively, as aesthetic scenery in Russia and subjectively, as a practical place in Japan. The results suggested a fundamental difference in ways of seeing the landscape through individual perceptions rather than normative views on forests. This methodology for visualising ways of seeing a landscape can be useful in understanding different assumptions about environmental issues, not only for a global environmental discussion regarding each locality, but also for local environmental management and public participation.

A recent survey of three private concessions in the Imataca Forest Reserve, based on partial consideration of criteria and indicators for the sustainable management of tropical forests, revealed that a new form of management is needed. Compliance with reduced impact logging was very low, with poor planning in logging operations detected in all cases, highly affecting forest stands and biomass recovery. A limited capacity for monitoring was also found. Social assessments showed that local communities in all cases demanded more participation in wood production benefits and tended to value provision services such as timber, food and water above other important regulations and cultural services. Here, three strategies are proposed as an effective way to partially modify NFM into a more integrated approach: 1) strengthening of institutional cooperation between private and public sectors and capacity building in the process of monitoring; 2) creation of a training framework for reduced impact logging techniques 3) a review of current legal structures and national policies related to NFM in order to favour small-scale operations.

Profit maximising agents which choose between forestry and agricultural land uses were simulated under carbon price scenarios of $20, $50 and $0 per tonne CO2 equivalent. The model suggests that an ETS will lead to increased afforestation and rotation age, and decreased silviculture and deforestation. A $20 carbon price or higher led to an overall increase in carbon sequestration by the forestry sector, driven predominantly by afforestation on lower fertility sites. Higher carbon prices increase the range of available land for planting. Future carbon price expectancy was critical. Rising carbon price expectancy led to large scale afforestation, but also to significant deforestation. A falling expectancy prevented deforestation but also stifled afforestation. The most sustainable solution was a stable carbon price expectancy allowing land to consistently work towards an economically optimal use. The recommendation of this report is for policy which promotes a stable long-run carbon price and flexibility for change between land uses. Suggestions include a guaranteed maximum carbon price, or allowing a forest to be felled at reduced penalty if another is concurrently planted. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The objective was to identify bottlenecks militating against improved functioning of the farm-grown timber value chains. A fieldwork was carried from August 2008 to September 2010, to identify the agents and the organisations involved in the value chain. Data were collected on the functions performed, the costs borne and the income received by each category of agent, the marketing channels within the value chain, the interactions among agents, the consumption of the product, and the role of the organisations connected to the value chain. This was done by combining semi-structured interviews, focus group meetings, and structured interviews. In addition, data were collected on the institutional environment from both primary and secondary sources. The following agents were involved in the value chain: nurserymen, planters, local intermediaries, brokers, traders, and consumers. The forest service was the main governmental organisation involved in the functioning of the value chain. The governance structure in the value chain was driven by a mixture of government and the market. Various weaknesses were found in the forest policy, the forest regulation and their implementation. Planters' share of consumer price was lower than traders' return. The relevant policy options to address these issues were discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The notion of the future in Australian education is dominantly singular, vague and abstract. This paper describes research which investigates changes which occur within teacher practices, enacted curriculum and student learning. The case study at the centre of this research focuses on a primary school south-east of Melbourne, Australia, which is internationally acknowledged as 'innovative and leading' in 'educating for the future'. Initially, it was apparent that this notion of the future was assumed, and these specific teachers had given little thought to what that future looked like, or how that related to students' learning requirements. As a result of professional learning, the teachers underwent temporal transformation, in integrating explicit futures dimensions within their curriculum. Arising from this research were significant key findings which highlight the need for a reconceptualisation of the ways in which curriculum and pedagogy are enacted in regards to notions of multiple futures. Furthermore, it generates renewed calls for futures perspectives to be addressed explicitly within education. Importantly it highlights a deficit in current teacher thinking about their roles in 'educating for the future'. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The adequacy of forest policies to reflect regimes of property rights in their design and implementation is examined using content analysis. The analysis synthesises forest policies of four distinct historical time periods, and the embedding of property rights during those periods using Schlager and Ostrom's typology. The findings reveal the inadequacy of the existing state property rights regime to secure the livelihood of 3.5 million people in marginalised and disadvantaged forest-dependent communities, and to achieve sustainability in the SMF by reversing the trend of rapid reduction of forest resources. The challenge, therefore, is to find an alternative property rights regime to address the missing link between conservation and livelihood-security of forest-dependent communities using sustainable management practices in the SMF.

Private Polish forests are in poor condition and have been under great economic stress. This situation has changed somewhat with respect to rural development since Poland's accession to the European Union. However, many antecedents to the innovativeness of forest owners remain unaddressed by scholars. The objective of this paper is to study the effect of forest owners' attitudes towards risk, social responsibility, learning orientation and institutional support on their innovativeness. Additionally, we aim to analyse the forest owners' attitudes towards start-ups based on nature-based tourism, which is a relatively new activity in Poland. We used both quantitative and qualitative approaches in this study and collected data via face-to-face interviews with 105 forest owners. The results showed that, although a forest owner's attitudes towards risk, social responsibility and learning orientation positively impacted the owner's innovativeness, institutional support did not. In the qualitative portion of this study, we examine nature-based tourism as a relatively new phenomenon and the factors affecting an owner's decision to initiate this type of business. The results imply that private forest owners in Poland require greater institutional support to start tourism businesses related to their forest land. However, the present support policies do not seem to have a direct positive effect on the forest owners' innovativeness.

Among German children and adolescents, 15% are overweight (including obese) and 6.3% are obese according to a national reference. This is the first German study to assess aspects of the economic burden associated with overweight and obesity in children and adolescents based on a representative cross-sectional survey. Based on the German Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), direct costs induced by utilisation of healthcare services (physician and therapist visits, hospital stays) were assessed using a bottom-up approach. To investigate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on costs, univariate analyses were performed and multivariate generalised mixed models were estimated. Average annual total costs were estimated to be a,not sign442 (95% CI [402-486]). Bivariate analysis showed considerable differences between BMI groups in physician costs, but not for hospital or therapist costs. High socioeconomic status, residence in west Germany and underweight had a significant negative impact on total costs in multivariate analysis. The effect of overweight on total costs is positive but not significant; neither is the effect of obesity. However, overweight and obese children exhibit significantly higher physician costs and a higher probability of being high utilisers of healthcare services. The economic implications of overweight and obesity are, to some extent, already visible in childhood. The results suggest that obese children should be classified as priority group for prevention. Despite limitations, this study provides important information concerning the relevance of childhood obesity as a health problem.","[Wenig, Christina M.] Univ Munich, Munich Sch Management, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Wenig, Christina M.] Munich Ctr Hlth Sci, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Wenig, Christina M.] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Wenig, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich Sch Management, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Ludwigstr 28 RG, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",wenig@bwl.lmu.de,,,,,,,67,24,25,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The first includes the conceptual framework of literature. It traces the evolution of the office, highlights the living conditions at work related to space, focuses on the psychological disposition of the employee according to his workspace and seeks to understand how individuals interact with each other when they meet in one place. The concept of stress associated with this interpersonal relationship is also studied. Is there a link between the workspace and the different variables affecting the individual (trust, control, culture, etc.)? How to manage more effectively the workspace? Does the open space have an effect on the performance of the employee? The second part of the article tries to answer these questions. An exploratory study was conducted from eighteen semi-structured interviews. The purpose of these interviews is to understand the feelings of the employees regarding their workspace. The results obtained show some pain experienced by employee.

It begins by setting out the analytical deficits in the contemporary analysis of consumer debt collection practices, before tracing the industry's responses to the particular problematic of consumer collections. It focuses on the role played by the 'capture of affect' in collections processes, building on existing work exploring socio-economic objects that may be described as 'non-representational'. A richer understanding of the relationship between markets and the body is thus brought to Actor-Network Theory influenced studies of processes of 'economization'. It follows the debtor's progress along collections 'trajectories', exploring different not necessarily compatible modes of captation being deployed by collectors attempting to enact defaulters as repayers, ranging from the quasi-therapeutic to the disciplinary. It concludes by examining the increasing role for performative forms of in vitro and in vivo experimentation being deployed in the collections process, through the use of econometric modelling techniques. Both the debtors' pasts and their actions as they move through the present are shown to provide the empirical grounding for a process of repeated affective 'testing', aimed at discovering - and profiting from - minute variations in debtor dispositions.","[Deville, Joe] Goldsmiths Univ London, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Deville, J (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, London SE14 6NW, England.",j.deville@gold.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [PTA-031-2006-00457],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Many thanks to the editors of this special issue and to the two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

In spite of great effort in this field, diagnostics of prion protein caused diseases represents a sort of challenge. In this study, we aimed our attention on studying of prion protein interaction with CdTe quantum dots (QDs) by voltammetry as a new and extremely sensitive tool for sensing of these proteins. Primarily, we characterized fluorescent and electrochemical properties of QDs. Further, electrochemical study of their interactions was carried out to find the most suitable conditions for sensitive detection of prion proteins. Detection limit (3 S/N) was estimated as 1 fg in 5 mu l. This makes labelling of proteins with QDs of great importance due to easy applicability and possibility to use in miniaturized devices, which can be used in situ. In addition, we also tested stability of the dots in vitro and in vivo using our ultrasensitive and optimized electrochemical method.","[Sobrova, P.; Zitka, O.; Ryvolova, M.; Janu, L.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Zitka, O.; Ryvolova, M.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Tech 3058 10, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Brno University of Technology,"Sobrová, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",pavlina.sobrova@seznam.cz,"Vaculovicova, Marketa/E-5583-2016; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012","Vaculovicova, Marketa/0000-0002-6771-1304; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X",,,,,10,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1016,1021,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200118,0

In particular, when the ceiling price is supported by introducing new allowances into the market, firms could choose to buy allowances at the ceiling price, regardless of the prevailing market price, in order to lower the equilibrium price of all allowances. Those purchases could either be transacted by firms intending to manipulate the market price or be induced through the introduction of inaccurate information about the cost of emissions abatement. Theory and simulations using allowance elasticity estimates for U.S. firms suggest that the manipulation could be profitable under the stylized setting and assumptions evaluated in the paper, although in practice many other conditions will determine its use.

Advertising usually manipulates and distorts photographs to create dramatic effects that attract consumers. Even the most realistic advertising images do not portray the truth, but instead depict intentionally arranged objects and scenes rather than objective ones.

Currently with citizens' awareness increasing continuously and social contradictions becoming diverse, people show their opinions in an obvious populist trend which can be shown as: the existence of antagonism between official and the common people, criticism of the existing system and sentimental psychology. This populist trend can easily lead to a terrible collective irrationality and serious opposition among groups. As a result, serious division and malignant heterogeneity are formed into destructive social power. So we should take effective measures to guard against populist trend of the network expression. Firstly, the social problems should be solved and psychological mood be calmed to eliminate realistic origin of the populism of network expression.

Its main theoretical basis consists of two mainstream models: rational choice and neo-institutionalism. Since these models rest upon problematic conceptualisations of 'the social', this paper proposes a so-called 'practice based approach', which offers a comprehensive understanding of social dynamics related to trees, forests and biodiversity. It tries to go beyond some of the old dualisms in social theory, such as subject and object, human and nature and agency and structure. Three sensitising concepts - situated agency, logic of practice and performativity - are introduced and their application is illustrated by a number of examples from forest governance practices: joint forest management in India, decentralized forest management in Bolivia and the construction of biodiversity datasets in Europe. The paper also addresses some of the criticisms the approach has received. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We constructed three scenario-based models to study the following two subjects: (1) the relationship between deciding whether to reduce one's cigarette consumption and to practice brand switching (simultaneous or sequential); (2) the key determinants that affect smokers' decisions in terms of their consumption and brand switching when facing higher taxes. We applied data collected from a survey in Taiwan, and the results indicated that both independent and two-stage decision-making models generated very similar conclusions. We also found that gender difference contributed to reduce cigarette consumption. In addition, this study indicated that high-income smokers were less likely to switch brands, whereas well-educated smokers were more likely to switch brands. Most importantly, we questioned the effectiveness of cigarette tax policy, as our results suggested that higher price did not necessarily reduce consumption. Indeed, data indicated that < 24 % of smokers actually reduced their cigarette consumption after the tax on cigarettes increased.","[Chen, Chiang-Ming] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Puli 545, Nantou Hsien, Taiwan; [Chang, Kuo-Liang] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Lin, Lin] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Puli 545, Nantou Hsien, Taiwan; [Lee, Jwo-Leun] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University; South Dakota State University; National Chi Nan University; National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Lee, JL (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan.",ming@ncnu.edu.tw; Kuo-Liang.Chang@sdstate.edu; linlin@ncnu.edu.tw; jllee@nutc.edu.tw,,,,,,,41,10,10,2,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Yet there is a severe lack of evidence on the effectiveness of student aid in encouraging HE participation outside of the US, and none at all for the UK. This paper exploits a reform that took place in the UK in 2004, when maintenance grants were introduced for students from low income families, having been abolished since 1999. This reform occurred in isolation of any other policy changes, and did not affect students from relatively better off families, making them a potential control group.

Declines in health commonly compel workers to retire, so the challenge is to disentangle the simultaneous causal effects. The estimation strategy employs an instrumental variables specification. The instrument is based on workers' self-reported probabilities of working past ages 62 and 65, taken from the first period in which they are observed. Results indicate that the retirement effect on health is beneficial and significant. Investigation into behavioral data, such as smoking and exercise, suggests that retirement may affect health through such channels.

Government and trade unions thus cooperate to fulfil coverage quotas, especially at the local/enterprise level. Though their methods are highly successful at overcoming employers' reluctance, the absence of genuine collective bargaining leaves collective contracts largely devoid of substance. Under this system, the authors argue, the Government is institutionalizing a labour regulation framework aimed at containing the recent rise in labour unrest, while pragmatically postponing collective bargaining for the sake of stability and growth.","[Wu, Qingjun] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Zhaoyang] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Wu, QJ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wqjruc@163.com; sunzy@cass.org.cn,"Wu, Qingjun/S-6494-2017",,,,,,27,16,17,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

A qualitative trend analysis is being used for this purpose, in the context of which three macro trends are combined: (1) higher education that has been developed via five periods; (2) sustainable development that has evolved through three stages; and (3) the nexus between sustainable development and higher education which has strengthened through three phases. The simultaneous analysis of the macro trends regarding their possible interactive effects (through an expert panel discussion) demonstrates that higher education and universities under the influence of sustainable development elements are entering into a new era in which the function of higher education for sustainable development could be interpreted as the seeds of a newly emerging mission for universities. In this regard, it is expected that the concept of sustainable university is likely to become more common to meet the emerging mission. Consistent with the Rio + 20 outcomes, the authors analyzed the concept of sustainable university and identified the fact that it is practically divided into three interrelated and complementary categories, namely social-, environmental-, and economic-oriented university in pursuit of actualizing sustainable development.

By introducing conjectural variations, they capture the different market structures as specific configurations of a more general model. Conjectural variations are based on the assumption that each firm believes its own strategy influences its rival's strategy. Firms derive their optimal choice from these exogenous conjectures, under the form of a conjectural best-response function. The authors' approach fully encompasses the standard measures of market power (the Lerner Index) and concentration (the Herfindahl Index), both depending on the conjectural variations.

World supply of fish oil is not increasing but is the main source of healthy omega-3 fats (n-3 LC-PUFA). Fish oil demand by nutraceuticals is a derived demand for such fats. Demand growth and insecure supply are causing price inflation of fish oil, helping to drive its substitution in aquaculture feeds by vegetable oils. This is reducing the content of n-3 LC-PUFA in aquaculture products, especially salmon, with potentially negative health implications. Given the scope for further substitution of fish oil, it is unlikely that future growth of global aquaculture will be constrained by reducing omega-3 content, although it will complicate consumer marketing of salmon. Nutraceuticals is paying more than aquaculture for fish oil based on omega-3 content, but novel sources of n-3 LC-PUFA will become available in the medium term.","[Bachis, Enrico] IFFO Ltd, London, England",,"Shepherd, J (通讯作者)，18 Clarence Rd, Richmond TW9 3NL, Surrey, England.",drcjshepherd@aol.com,,,,,,,12,24,27,4,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

This paper adds to these studies by investigating how theoretical elements of the innovation system approach can contribute to the design and practice of foresight processes. The paper originates in a foresight project in the Nordic facilities management sector. The goal of the foresight project was to identify the possible futures of the facilities management sector in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) and, based on the findings, to establish a proposal for a common Nordic facilities management research agenda. The paper finds that three elements of the innovation system literature are of particular interest for the practice of foresight: innovation systems and context dependency, learning and user-producer interactions, and the role of knowledge and knowledge production. These elements are embedded into a simple sectoral innovation system model (including actors, knowledge flows, and the strategic environment). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined the impact of evidence, process and context factors on CVZ decisions in 2004-2009. A data set of CVZ decisions pertaining to pharmaceutical technologies was created, including 29 variables extracted from published information. A three-category outcome variable was used, defined as the decision to 'recommend', 'restrict' or 'not recommend' a technology. Technologies included in list 1A/1B or on the expensive drug list were considered recommended; those included in list 2 or for which patient co-payment is required were considered restricted; technologies not included on any reimbursement list were classified as 'not recommended'. Using multinomial logistic regression, the relative contribution of explanatory variables on CVZ decisions was assessed. In all, 244 technology appraisals (256 technologies) were analysed, with 51 %, of technologies recommended, 33 % restricted and 16 % not recommended by CVZ for funding. The multinomial model showed significant associations (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.10) between CVZ outcome and several variables, including: (1) use of an active comparator and demonstration of statistical superiority of the primary endpoint in clinical trials, (2) pharmaceutical budget impact associated with introduction of the technology, (3) therapeutic indication and (4) prevalence of the target population.

Unlike Ohio, the Michigan system restricts districts from generating property or income tax revenue to fund operating expenditures. In both states, districts fund capital expenditures with local tax revenue. Our results indicate that although average revenue and expenditures per pupil in Michigan and Ohio are almost identical, the distributions of the various revenue sources are quite different. Ohio's funding system has greater equality in terms of total revenue, largely due to Ohio redistributing state funds to the least wealthy districts while Michigan does not. We find relatively wealthy Michigan districts spend more on capital expenditures, whereas relatively wealthy Ohio districts spend more on labor and materials. This suggests that constraints on raising local revenue to fund operating expenditures in Michigan could create efficiency issues.","[Conlin, Michael] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Thompson, Paul N.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Michigan State University; Oregon State University,"Conlin, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",conlinmi@msu.edu; paul.thompson@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,19,4,4,0,12,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Patients find that, although therapies are available for many rare conditions, access to care is sometimes restricted. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have responded to the incentives for research embodied in orphan drug legislation, only to find that funds are not made available to pay for therapies once developed. Those funding health care find that most orphan drugs do not justify funding based on standard value for money criteria, yet that they face political problems if they fail to provide funding for therapy. A literature review was conducted in order to determine the precise nature of the problems and to suggest potential solutions. Current orphan drug policies are not fit for the purpose and initiatives need to be taken in the areas of (1) clarifying society's views about the priority to be given to orphan drugs, (2) revising the arrangements for pricing and reimbursement of orphan drugs, (3) defining the priorities for research into rare diseases and (4) developing 'joined up' policies to deal with these issues. Without changes in the current policies, pharmaceutical companies will eventually cease responding to the incentives to develop orphan drugs, because they will increasingly be uncertain whether the drugs, if developed, will be reimbursed.","[Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England",University of York - UK,"Drummond, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",mike.drummond@york.ac.uk,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014",,,,,,35,54,57,0,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

To our knowledge, this is the first study from Eastern Europe that has estimated indirect costs in IBD. Methods Data from 443 (M/F: 202/241, CD/UC: 260/183, mean age: 35.5 (CD) and 40.5 (UC) years, biological drug exposure 31.2/11.5 %) consecutive patients were included. WD data were collected by questionnaire and the work productivity and activity impairment instrument. Disability pension (DP) rates in the general population were retrieved from public databases. Results The overall DP rate in this IBD population was 32.3 %, with partial disability in 24.2 %. Of all DP events, 88.8 % were directly related to IBD. Overall, full DP was more prevalent in IBD (RR: 1.51, p < 0.001) and CD (RR: 1.74, p < 0.001) but not in UC compared to the general population and also in CD compared to UC (OR 1.57, p = 0.03). RR for full DP was increased only in young CD patients (RR<35 year olds: 9.4; RR36-40 year olds: 9.4 and 5.6, p < 0.01 for both). In CD, age group, previous surgery, disease duration, frequent relapses, and the presence of arthritis/arthralgia were associated with an increased risk for DP. Among employed patients, absenteeism and presenteeism was reported in of 25.9 and 60.3 % patients, respectively, leading to a 28 % loss of work productivity and a 32 % activity loss, and was associated with disease activity and age group. Average cost of productivity loss due to disability and sick leave with a human capital approach was 1,450 and 430 (sic)/patient/year in IBD, respectively (total productivity loss 1,880 (sic)/patient/year), the costs of presenteeism were 2,605 (SD = 2,770) and 2,410 (SD = 2,970) (sic)/patient/year in CD and UC, respectively. Conclusion Risk of DP was highly increased in young CD patients (sixfold to ninefold). Previous surgery and presence of arthritis/arthralgia was identified as risk factors for DP. Work productivity is significantly impaired in IBD and is associated with high productivity loss.","[Michael, Mandel D.; Lovasz, Barbara D.; Golovics, Petra A.; Kuerti, Zsuzsanna; Szilagyi, Blanka K.; Mohas, Anna; Lakatos, Peter L.] Semmelweis Univ, Dept Med 1, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Balint, Anita; Farkas, Klaudia; Molnar, Tamas] Univ Szeged, Dept Med 1, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary; [Gulacsi, Laszlo; Strbak, Balint] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Semmelweis University; Szeged University; Corvinus University Budapest,"Lakatos, PL (通讯作者)，Semmelweis Univ, Dept Med 1, Koranyi Sandor Utca 2-A, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary.",lakatos.peter_laszlo@med.semmelweis-univ.hu,"Lakatos, Peter/Q-4797-2019; Molnár, Tamás/GMX-4334-2022; Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023; Kurti, Zsuzsanna/M-1712-2015","Lakatos, Peter/0000-0002-3948-6488; Kurti, Zsuzsanna/0000-0001-8671-6576; Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746",,,,,31,56,58,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We interviewed eight conservation planners working at the county administrative boards in each of the eight administrative counties covering boreal Sweden to establish weightings for different structural biodiversity indicators by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The subjective weightings were applied in a reserve selection model based on a goal programming (GP) approach. The structural indicators were derived from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI) and used as proxy for biodiversity potential. A biodiversity indicator score, based on the values of those indicators, was maximized. The model adjusted this score ensuring that all indicators were represented in the selection, and further also adjusted the influence of the indicators based on the subjective weightings. We evaluated the GP approach by comparing it to a simple linear programming (LP) formulation, only maximizing the indicator richness. In all cases the model was limited either by a budget or an area. The biodiversity potential in young forests are often neglected within present conservation policies, however, the proportion of selected forest under 15 years was relatively high in all our cost-effective cases, varying between 32% and 60% using the individual planners subjective weightings, compared to 80% when using a simple LP model. The proportion of selected forest over 100 years varied between 69% and 85% in the area-effective cases using the subjective weightings, compared to 80% when using a simple LP model. Middle-aged forest was not favored in any of the selections, although they make up a substantial part of the total area. We conclude that there are differences in how conservation planners prioritize the indicators, and depending on how specific biodiversity indicators are weighted the age distribution of the selected reserves differs. This demonstrates the importance of considering how to establish appropriate weightings.

This paper seeks to make a contribution towards this project, by developing an agent-based simulation model of multi-level co-evolution within an organization, with a view towards shedding new light on organizational adaptation. Unlike previous simulation studies of this nature, this study focuses on the co-evolution of behaviour at multiple-levels between interacting individuals, based on the evolutionary mechanisms of variation, selection and retention. In this way it is seen that incremental, punctuated and chaotic patterns of aggregate organizational behaviour arise from the same core building blocks of variation-selection-retention. The findings from this study point to the need for management control in ambidextrous organizations both during times of stability AND transformational change. In the latter case, this control was not that of an overpowering management suppressing variations and innovation from within the organization. Rather it might be interpreted as the voice of calm in the chaos of the storm, providing direction to the many actors within the organization and walking them along the thin line between inaction and chaos.

A mixed integer programming formulation is proposed for the problem. The problem formed in this way is an NP-hard one forcing us to use Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) algorithm to obtain a satisfying solution. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on 150 test problems by statistically comparing in term of the objective function and computational times.

For the data processing, one of multivariate statistical methods - factor analysis is used to indicate the complex factors and compare them with the results obtained in other countries.

This scientific approach is particularly useful since in times of economic crisis, the fiscal policy management is extremely important in order to achieve an optimal compromise between stimulating economic recovery and fiscal consolidation. The results obtained by the SVAR modeling are consistent with those identified in the literature. Thus, the expansionary fiscal policy has rather non-Keynesian effects characteristic of emerging economies, which have a high degree of economic openness and a flexible exchange rate (less Bulgaria, respectively Slovakia, Slovenia, after adopting the euro).","[Dinu, Marin; Marinas, Marius-Corneliu] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dinu, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",dinumarin@gmail.com; marinasmarius@yahoo.fr,"Marinas, Marius-Corneliu/ABG-2780-2020",,,,,,16,1,1,0,22,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Businesses increasingly incorporate social issues into their strategies so that they reflect their actual business goals. For a long time, the concept of corporate social responsibility in Serbia was narrowed to money donations. In recent years, however, it becomes an inspiring, challenging and strategic development path of companies. Recent years, businesses in this region are increasingly involved in solving problems relating to public health that has worsened after decades of social instability, wars and the economic downturn. Serbia has set high standards of healthcare services provision for the population. On the other side, the government is fighting for the sustainability of the health system that is increasingly difficult to finance from the state budget and funds. Promotion of healthy lifestyles and arising of awareness showed good results in Serbia, especially when the innovative CSR initiatives have been undertaken in partnership with government and civil society. In the last decade, the variety of CSR activities was performed in Serbia. Companies were supporting consciousness raising programs, education and continuing medical education of health workers; campaigns for promotion healthy lifestyles; the development of corporate philanthropy, etc. Professionals in the private sector think increasingly about these problems when they plan strategies of corporate social responsibility for their companies. They take in account that their impact on health improvements can have a positive impact on their employees' morale and strengthen ties with customers. Additionally, investments in prevention and health promotion in the community, businesses can enhance their reputation and corporate brand among key stakeholders.","[Karanovic, Nevena] Megatrend Univ, Grad Sch Business Studies, Goce Delceva 8, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Karanovic, N (通讯作者)，Megatrend Univ, Grad Sch Business Studies, Goce Delceva 8, Belgrade, Serbia.",nkaranovic@megatrend.edu.rs,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,417,423,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000039,0

The conclusions reflect not only the possible outcomes of the action plan but also the general macroeconomic field where it should be implemented. (C) 2014 The Authors.

An educational Waqf or endowment is dedication of property to an institution for the purpose of providing free knowledge and education. The form, amount and value of property endowed are managed by an institution frequently referred to as a public charitable body, private foundation or trustee. Among the institutions usually endowed for educational endowments are academic institutions such as a college, university or school. Social and religious institutions which may be endowed are museums, libraries, banks, hospitals, mosques and prayer halls. A Waqf is implemented when it has been clearly determined that its utilization with the principal kept intact is for a benefit in perpetuity or for a fixed period of time. This enables the charity or endowment to have an effect for a longer period of time.

Although the efficient market theory might be considered an ideal model enabling the interpretation of market behavior, it has begun to lose ground, and the rationality hypothesis failed to explain the excessive volatility of the returns and trading volume recorded on both developed capital markets and emerging ones. Adding the behavioral finance perspective to the equation can help us to understand better how market agents will react. In this article, we investigate the factors that may explain the trading volume evolution on two emerging capital markets, Romania and Brazil. We analyze the impact of both investors who ground their trading behavior on rational expectations and investors who show behavioral errors as independent variables on the trading volume as dependent variable. The period under analysis covers four years, from June 2009 to June 2013, and includes the daily values of the most important indices traded on both markets, i.e. BET for Romania and IBOVESPA for Brazil, and the daily trading volume for each of the two indices. The results indicate that trading is influenced by the investors' irrational behavior. Thus, the rationality hypothesis can be rejected for both capital markets. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of remittances in ensuring balance of payments stability in Southeast Europe. This capital flows offset chronic balance of payments deficits by reducing the shortage of foreign exchange and have a more positive impact on the balance of payments than other monetary flows.

The ascension to full time members of the European Union of Bulgaria and Romania has had a tremendous effect on these countries banking systems, determining a series of changes both in the operating strategies and also in the market dynamics. Thus, the aim of our research is to evaluate the liquidity risk of the banks operating in Bulgaria and Romania in the context of the EU ascension process. In order to achieve this we have investigated the role and impact that a series of financial indicators for the capital adequacy, assets quality, management quality and profitability have on the liquidity risk of the banking institutions from our sample, the analysed period being 2003-2011. The obtained results underline that the capital adequacy ratio and the ratio of impaired loans to gross loans have a statistically significant impact on the liquidity risk of the banks operating in Bulgaria and Romania.","[Roman, Angela; Sargu, Alma Camelia] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi 700506, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Sargu, AC (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, B Dul Carol I Nr 11, Iasi 700506, Romania.",s_alina_camelia@yahoo.com,"ROMAN, Angela/G-9223-2018","ROMAN, Angela/0000-0003-0402-7641",,,,,29,6,7,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-5671,,,PROC ECON FINANC,,,2014,15.0,,,,,,569,576,,10.1016/S2212-5671(14)00512-7,0.0,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357094000071,0

Due to the wide applicability and significant utility, its development became remarkable, the industrial revolution and the spectacular development of the computation technique had a significant role. The operational research deals with the determination of an optimal decision as a consequence of the settlement of deterministic and stochastic models made for the study of economic, managerial phenomena. From a scientific approach, the process of the elaboration of a decision is framed by a certain decisional model, as well as the situation needing the settlement by means of a decision is characterized by the volume, structure and quality of the existent information. Therefore, the managers may use: mathematical models of optimization which are helpful for taking a decision under the conditions of reliability, which means all necessary elements are known, as following: Decisional simulation; Decisional table; The method of global utility.

And yet this knowledge is rarely drawn upon in debates around and design of poverty alleviation or land use policies, strategies and projects. Unless the accumulating wealth of empirical evidence can be translated into policies and approaches at higher levels, and integrated into poverty alleviation programmes, it will have little impact on local and national poverty profiles. In this paper we propose and briefly discuss eight steps to facilitate integration of NTFPs into the development agenda, for the benefit of local communities. These include: (1) proper inventory of NTFP stocks, (2) research on NTFP ecology and sustainable harvest levels, (3) introduction of extension services for NTFPs, (4) inclusion of NTFPs in land management and trade-off decisions, (5) integration of NTFPs into sectoral policies, (6) ensuring NTFP commercialisation is not at the expense of local livelihood needs, (7) promoting security of access and use, and (8) examination of local contextual drivers of unsustainable use.

The present research uses the data of surveys of consumers and retail stores for the period of 2010-2013 and concludes that higher consumer loyalty to certain brands or producers can be observed for several groups of food products, while the key factors affecting the loyalty of consumers are the taste of food, whether the product's raw materials are natural, and a lower price.","[Upite, Ilze; Pilvere, Irina; Nipers, Aleksejs; Krievina, Agnese] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Latvian State Inst Agrarian Econ, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,ilze.upite@llu.lv,"UPITE, ILZE/AAC-4097-2021; Nipers, Aleksejs/F-7847-2015; Pilvere, Irina/GNM-7700-2022","Nipers, Aleksejs/0000-0002-6496-6694; Pilvere, Irina/0000-0002-8467-1949",,,,,11,2,2,0,7,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-2-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,35,,,,,62,70,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347133500006,0

We employ unique data collected from persons with hearing, physical, and visual impairments as well as nationally representative survey data from the Nepal Living Standard Survey 2003/2004 (NLSS II). After controlling for endogeneity bias arising from schooling decisions as well as sample selection bias due to endogenous labor participation, the estimated rate of returns to education is very high among persons with disabilities, ranging from 19.3 to 25.6%. The coexistence of these high returns to education and limited years of schooling suggest that supply side constraints in education to accommodate persons with disabilities and/or there are credit market imperfections.

Climate, resources and their access, and spatial position are the primary drivers for the patterns of how settlement structures will evolve. As changes occur in these conditions the settlement structures eventually change. The method presented can be used to study how settlement structures may evolve in the future based on projections and predictions about changes in the drivers. The method is illustrated by using Iceland as a case study. The results of the case study suggest that global warming will induce a pull of settlements towards the warming highland plateau of the country because of less snow, better accessibility, and more vegetation. This will be helped by a push of settlements away from the coast towards the more elevated interior due to a rise in sea level. In Iceland, an opposite pattern - towards the coast - also applies because new transshipment harbours serving Arctic sea routes and oil resources will create a pull towards some parts of the coastline.

Schools change principals frequently; about 20% of public school principals in the United States leave their positions each year. Despite the significance of principals and the regularity of principal departures, little is known about how turnover affects schools. Using twelve years of administrative data from North Carolina public schools, this paper explores the relationship between principal turnover and student achievement. Principal departures follow a downturn in student performance. Achievement continues to fall in the two years following the installation of a new principal and then rises over the next three years. Five years after a new principal is installed, average academic performance is no different than it was five years before the new principal took over. Increases in student achievement following a principal transition may reflect mean reversion rather than a positive effect of principal turnover. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This precariousness is often traced back to the sphere of employment, though recent research also points to the implications of the limited rights entailed by temporary migrant status. This article draws on empirical work among registered nurses who have participated in the Australian 457 visa scheme - the major programme for temporary migrant workers in Australia. Using a range of empirical sources, including in-depth interviews with 26 temporary migrant nurses, we examine whether these nurses experience precariousness and locate the sites and sources of precariousness. The article draws attention to the importance of the regulatory context that defines different pathways from the country of departure to employment in the Australian healthcare system. We suggest that, although temporary migrant nurses are well integrated within the healthcare workforce in terms of formal wages and conditions, other stages in their migration pathways can be associated with precariousness.

Yet, consumer behavior in markets for energy-using durables is generally thought to be far from efficient, giving rise to the concept of the energy-efficiency gap. This paper presents a welfare analysis of energy policies that is based on a behavioral model of temptation and self-control, introduced by Gul and Pesendorfer [23,24]. We find that, in the presence of temptation, (i) Pigovian taxes alone do not yield a first-best outcome, (ii) when viewed as substitutes, energy efficiency standards can dominate Pigovian taxes, and (iii) a policy combining standards with a Pigovian tax can yield higher social welfare than a Pigovian tax alone, implying that the two instruments should be viewed as complements rather than substitutes.

To investigate the impact of non-standard work schedules on young people's relationships, this article draws on data from 50 interviews conducted in 2008 and 4 surveys conducted between 2007 and 2012 with 636 young people (aged 18-24 years), all participating in the Life Patterns Project longitudinal study of youth in Australia. Over the 6 years, a majority of participants were engaged in non-standard work, working weekends, evenings or public holidays. A significant minority also faced weekly variability in their work schedules. The interview data suggest that these patterns of employment can be considered unsocial, making it more difficult to find regular periods of time together with a group of friends. Interview discussion also suggests that as a substitute for a greater quantity of shared time, some young people seek out shared experiences felt to be intense or out of the ordinary, such as that facilitated by alcohol consumption, to make the most of limited opportunities to bond with a group of close friends.","Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Woodman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, John Medley Bldg, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",dan.woodman@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,33,12,12,2,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

However, ideas about what the objectives of FLEGT are and how legality should be interpreted differ among different actors involved. Some advocate a narrow interpretation of legality that promotes a strong role of the state and focuses on law enforcement, while others advocate a broader interpretation that includes issues of participation and sustainability. These different interpretations mirror current developments in international forest governance which are influenced on the one hand by broader trends in governance, which focus on voluntary instruments, participation and marketization, while on the other hand, the nation state remains a very powerful actor. This article uses a discourse analytical approach to analyze the discursive structure of FLEGT, particularly the European Union FLEGT Action Plan and the Indonesian legality standards. Our findings show that FLEGT is first and foremost shaped by state oriented discourses that promote regulatory instruments and a narrow interpretation of legality. Sustainability and participatory considerations are present, both in the EU and in the Indonesian context, but they come in a secondary position. The article concludes by positioning these findings in the international forest governance debate and by discussing the implications of the discursive structure of FLEGT for sustainability, participatory governance and the state.

In consequence, companies working in Russia have to emphasize the development and maintenance of trust with all their interest groups. In this paper we study how trust is built up at the local level with municipalities and local communities. Local level interest groups, however, seem to be less significant for companies in contemporary Russian countryside. This paper will provide an analysis of why local level interest groups are weak and what the consequences are. The paper also discusses legislation and regulations affecting social structures in the Russian countryside showing why and how much social responsibility is transferred to companies. In addition, the paper discusses whether private governance regulation, such as forest certification, will help local communities to be heard. The paper applies Douglass North's approach to economic development with formal and informal institutions, and also the literature on trust and the social responsibility of enterprises. Formal institutions such as national legislation and international privately controlled rules of FSC certification are compared with informal practices at the local level. Cooperation with companies and environmental organizations has complemented traditional Russian social responsibility and increased cooperation between the different interest groups. NGOs can also help local communities to be heard, but since companies are more concerned with the trust of their clients, weak municipalities remain humble receivers of aid. Globalization also makes companies pay more attention to their competitiveness, which will exert pressure on the government to arrange social security and strengthen municipalities. Structural changes in Russia will, however, take time, since Russia not only has to tackle the construction of new formal institutions but it must also deal with the increasing effects of globalization as it changes the traditional structures of democracy and a market economy.

It is based on a foresight research project which investigated the ethical issues of such emerging ID's. The findings of this research suggest that there are numerous well established ethical issues that are currently being discussed and that will remain relevant. These include questions of privacy and intellectual property. In addition, however, there are numerous possible ethical issues that relate to human individual and collective identity that are likely to be affected by novel technical developments. These issues currently are not discussed in academic or policy discourses. In order to render them more tangible and thus promote academic and policy discourses, fictional accounts play an important role. The present paper should therefore be understood as an attempt to translate the research findings on the ethics of emerging ICTs to a broader audience. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

One explanation is that these institutions affect unemployment differently depending on the regime in which they operate. Because of good labour relations, institutional complementarities and a trade-off between external and internal flexibility, they produce distinctive effects in corporatist regimes. Based on empirical evidence from 20 OECD countries over the period 1985-2008, the author finds that, in corporatist labour markets, strict employment protection legislation reduces unemployment, and unemployment benefits have no negative effect. He also shows that high real interest rates, low capital accumulation and restrictive fiscal policy during recessions increase unemployment.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Sturn, S (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",s.sturn@econs.umass.edu,"Sturn, Simon/IVV-7268-2023",,,,,,61,11,11,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

Previous research has indicated that price differentials reflecting risk of flooding become much larger in the wake of a storm. We re-examine these findings for Pitt County, North Carolina, using multiple storm events within a difference-in-differences framework, and we compare flood zone price differentials for a more recent sample of property sales. Prior to Hurricane Fran in 1996, we detect no market risk premium for the presence in a flood zone, but we find significant price differentials after major flooding events, amounting to a 5.7% decrease after Hurricane Fran and 8.8% decrease after Hurricane Floyd. Results from a separate model that examines more recent data covering a period without significant storm-related flood impacts indicate a significant risk premium ranging between 6.0% and 20.2% for homes sold in the flood zone, but this effect is diminishing over time, essentially disappearing about 5 or 6 years after Hurricane Floyd. The lack of a persistent effect suggests that buyers' and sellers' risk perceptions may change with the prevalence of hazard events and that homebuyers are unaware of flood risks and insurance requirements when bidding on properties.

We propose a simple refinement to the hedonic method that accommodates this reality: specifically, we measure localized benefits from the cleanup of hazardous waste sites at the sub-census tract level by examining the entire within-tract housing value distribution, rather than simply focusing on the tract median. Our point estimates indicate that the cleanup leads to larger appreciation in house prices at the lower percentiles of the within-tract house value distribution than at higher percentiles. Though not statistically different from one another, the estimates are monotonically ordered from 24.4% at the 10th percentile, 20.8% at the median and 18.7% at the 90th percentile, respectively. We confirm these results in two ways. First, our analysis using restricted access census block data finds comparable results that cleanup leads to a 14.7% appreciation in the median block-level housing values. Second, our analysis of proprietary housing transactions data show that cheaper houses within a census tract are indeed more likely to be closer to a hazardous waste site, explaining the greater impacts they receive from the cleanup process.

Most college success research has focused on income rather than assets as a predictor, and most college financing policy has focused on tuition support and educational debt, rather than asset accumulation. Nevertheless, there is compelling evidence that household asset holdings, especially savings for education, may have a pronounced positive influence, independent from income, in post-secondary educational success. Moreover, the fundamental reality is that savings plays a role, even though sometimes small, in college financing for most households. For these empirical and practical reasons, it may be important to pay greater attention to savings and asset holding for education in the future than we have in the past. The articles in this volume contribute empirical evidence, theoretical understanding, and potential policy directions regarding saving, asset holding, and educational achievement.

This study uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to generate a sample of two cohorts of children ('84 and '94 cohorts), and it examines whether intergenerational transmission of educational attainment varies by household economic resources, especially household assets. Results show that, among male children in the '94 cohort, household assets increase the strength of the association between parents' and children's years of schooling. Also, household assets are found to interact with parental education to affect educational attainment, as measured by college completion, among female children in the '94 cohort.

Their actual provision depends upon the demand expressed by different stakeholder groups. To comply with the expressed needs for the provision, forest managers have to define management objectives and implement management measures. However, limited financial resources designated for forest management and possible conflicts between different stakeholders often oblige forest managers to make trade-offs. To define the importance of specific services, interaction with stakeholder groups is one of the key features. In case of large stakeholder groups, like the general public, opinion pools can be used to obtain the information needed to make the necessary decisions. In the paper we present the relative importance of fire prevention measures in comparison to recreation, water purification, and animal and plant diversity in Slovenia. This information was obtained by conducting a choice modelling experiment. The results of the study show that the general public does not consider fires as an important threat to Slovenian forests and that fire prevention is less important than provision of other ecosystem services, considered in the study. At the same time, respondents believe that fire prevention measures in Slovenian forests are not adequate. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Vincent, BB",,,,"Vincent, Bernadette Bensaude",,,Between the possible and the actual: Philosophical perspectives on the design of synthetic organisms,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BIOLOGY,"A number of research projects in synthetic biology funded by public institutions sound like science fiction: for instance DARPA Biodesign project in 2011 aimed at eliminating the randomness of natural evolutionary advancement, and designing proteins with a 99.5% precision. How should we take such claims? Are they just fantastic visions or hype meant to impress funding agencies and the public or are they symptoms of a specific epistemic attitude? In considering the visions of the future developed in synthetic biology the paper attempts to evaluate the research agendas of synthetic biology from philosophical perspectives. It will first characterize the ambition to re-engineer life and distinguish the visions of the future underlying the various research agendas assembled under the umbrella synthetic biology. Then addressing the question 'who actually believes in such futures?' the paper contrasts the complicit belief of ethicists and critical activists with the doubts occasionally formulated by synthetic biologists. Doubts however never generate scepticism within the synthetic biology community, which develops an epistemic opportunism. Finally the third section discusses to what extent, and in which sense, the futuristic visions of synthetic biology belong to the genre of techno-utopia. It concludes that imagined futures are integral part of the techno-epistemic culture of synthetic biology and that the tension between the possible and the actual is a criterion of distinction between the various trends that constitute synthetic biology.

However, evidence on P4P effectiveness remains inconclusive. Flaws in program design may have contributed to this limited success. Based on a synthesis of relevant theoretical and empirical literature, this paper discusses key issues in P4P-program design. The analysis reveals that designing a fair and effective program is a complex undertaking. The following tentative conclusions are made: (1) performance is ideally defined broadly, provided that the set of measures remains comprehensible, (2) concerns that P4P encourages selection and teaching to the test should not be dismissed, (3) sophisticated risk adjustment is important, especially in outcome and resource use measures, (4) involving providers in program design is vital, (5) on balance, group incentives are preferred over individual incentives, (6) whether to use rewards or penalties is context-dependent, (7) payouts should be frequent and low-powered, (8) absolute targets are generally preferred over relative targets, (9) multiple targets are preferred over single targets, and (10) P4P should be a permanent component of provider compensation and is ideally decoupled form base payments. However, the design of P4P programs should be tailored to the specific setting of implementation, and empirical research is needed to confirm the conclusions.","Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Eijkenaar, F (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",eijkenaar@bmg.eur.nl,,,,,,,102,107,121,2,77,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

These disturbances cause severe environmental and social damages and may dislodge the forest into a different ecological regime. Forests provide many valuable services, such as the provisioning of timber and the sequestering of carbon that would otherwise contribute to climate change. The high-severity conflagrations that have become regular occurrences in many dry forests impinge the delivery of such benefits, particularly in the event of a regime shift. Sustainable forest management should take these risks into account. This article analyzes the economics of resilience in dry forests with respect to catastrophic fires and ecological thresholds. We illustrate how to price ecosystem resilience for the fire-prone ponderosa pine forests of the western United States. This analysis demonstrates that pricing forest resilience also establishes the economic value of ecological restoration with respect to ecosystem services, thereby operationalizing forest management as an investment in natural capital.

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published an International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) designed for the use by small and medium-sized entities on July, the 9th 2009. The aim of development of a special standard for SME (IFRS for SME) is to meet the financial reporting needs of entities that do not have public accountability and publish general purpose financial statements for external users. This standard could be a suitable instrument for a SME financial reporting harmonization. The IFRS for SME is aimed at millions of companies, which represent over 99% of all companies all over the world. More than 80 jurisdictions have already the IFRS for SME adopted or stated a plan to adopt. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the current approach to the IFRS for SME adoption and implementation over the world, and to develop a model based on indicators describing individual countries concerning adoption of IFRS for SMEs. The statistical methods are used for the comparison of countries which have already adopted the IFRS for SMEs with those which have not adopted it yet. The level of economic development of the particular country and other characteristics are used for comparison. The test has revealed whether the values of the indicators differ in case of countries, which have already adopted IFRS for SME and countries, which do not intend to adopt it. The values of selected indicators are based on The Global Competitiveness Reports 2012-2013.

The resistant strains of S. aureus were prepared using the nitrate solutions of metals (Ag, Cu, Cd, Zn and Pb). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used for observation the changes in the protein composition in the cell wall and also for the determination and identification of the strains using the database MALDI Biotyper. Results obtained from analysis with resistant strains were compared with sensitive control strain of S. aureus. We observed alterations in S. aureus protein composition pointing at resistance development under influence of heavy metals ions. Our results develop the possible option of analysis of resistant strains and may serve as a support for the monitoring of changes in genetic information in resistant strains.","[Chudobova, D.; Dostalova, S.; Ruttkay-Nedecky, B.; Rodrigo, Merlos M.

SVMs are usually viewed as non-parametric models, where the attribute non-parametric does not refer to the lack of parameters in the SVMs models, the learning problem of the SVM's parameters being of crucial importance. The novelty of the proposed method is given by a new expression for the bias parameter and a refined version of gradient ascent method for solving the SVM - QP problem. The tests pointed out good convergence properties and, moreover, the proposed modified variants proved higher convergence rates as compared to the standard SMO algorithm. Also, the performance of the resulted classifier proves better as compared to the standard choice of the bias.","[Cocianu, Catalina] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [State, Luminita] Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti,"Cocianu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",Catalina.Cocianu@ie.ase.ro; lstate@clicknet.ro,"Cocianu, Catalina Lucia/C-1819-2012; Cocianu, Catalina Lucia/AAB-8442-2019","Cocianu, Catalina Lucia/0000-0003-2078-0158; Cocianu, Catalina Lucia/0000-0003-2078-0158",,,,,17,5,5,0,6,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

This article is an attempt to examine the short and long-run relationship between currency demand, real income, tax burden, interest rate and wage ratio in the case of Romania's economy. The bounds testing approach to cointegration and error correction models, developed within an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) framework is applied to quarterly data for the period 2000 to 2010 in order to investigate whether a long-run equilibrium relationship exists between currency demand and its determinants. The result of the bounds test indicates that there is a stable long-run relationship between the currency demand and its determinants. In addition, the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests confirm the stability of the money demand function. This research provides fresh evidence on the size of the SE to the recorded GDP in Romania which ranges from 45% to 37.4% over the estimation period.","[Dobre, Ion] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Econ Cybernet & Informat, Bucharest, Romania; [Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dobre, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Econ Cybernet & Informat, Bucharest, Romania.",dobrerio@ase.ro; adrianaalexandru@yahoo.com,"Alexandru, Adriana AnaMaria/D-2755-2015","Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria/0000-0002-9847-1200",,,,,13,4,4,0,18,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Using Charleston County (SC) property sales data over 13 years we find, to the contrary, that the negative impact of the nuclear waste shipments on property values continues to be felt over the long run. The perception of risk from nuclear waste transport appears to be resilient. We contribute methodologically by comparing well-defined treatment and control groups of properties to estimate the average treatment effect of the nuclear waste shipment program.

Considering the need for understanding this market segment, the objective of our paper is to identify the preference factors in the choice of shopping place by seniors and key factors influencing seniors decisions in grocery stores. To explore views and opinions of older people in relation to preferred place of shopping, a research sample of 126 senior participants was created. Decision factors and motives in 5 areas have been explored: price policy, product policy, staff policy, store characteristics, communication policy. Because the seniors are rather multidimensional and very complex segment, three age subgroupings in the large segment of seniors were formed: seniors aged 60-69, seniors aged 70-79, seniors aged 80+. The principle purpose of the exploration was to determine characteristics affecting store choice and shopping behaviour of older people. Recommendations on how the retail industry could respond best to silver consumers were also developed based on the empirical outcomes.","[Lesakova, Dagmar] Univ Econ, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,,dagmar.lesakova@euba.sk,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,10,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,341,348,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600031,0

First a personal story of contribution to Farsi literature and projects is told which also sheds light on the point that in Iran the field is generally driven by a network of too young people. Next inspired by the third culture and based on insights from empirical scientific findings and linguistics nuances the three fold challenge of spreading the futures meme among human populations is discussed. Attributes of global able futurists are introduced too and a discussion follows about their values. Finally in a philosophical and mathematical turn the infinity of human sphere of thought and experience is re-emphasized and the idea of approaching the end of history is severely refuted. An alternative metaphor inspired form the Italian language is suggested also to emphasize the continuous becoming of the human and nonhuman experiences and the need to overcome them.

When is a grassland quality very low is often inevitable the renewal of grassland. Due to these measures it is possible to obtain the herbage of high forage quality. The highest representation of grasses was observed in 1992 (92 %). The most represented species from grasses was Lolium perenne. In the following years the ratio of grasses was reversed in favour of herbs. The herbs were the most represented in 2012 (52 %). The differences between years 1992 and 2012 in the groups of grasses and other herbs were statistically significant (P<0.05).

The cooling water tank was filled with tap water; the second tank was filled with water at a temperature equivalent to freshly milked milk. At the same time, pumps were activated that delivered the liquids into the flat-plate cooler where heat energy was exchanged between the two media. Two containers for receiving the run-out liquid were placed on the outputs from the cooler; here, temperature was measured with electronic thermometer and volume was measured with calibrated graduated cylinder. Flow rate was regulated both on the side of the cooling fluid and on the side of the cooled liquid by means of a throttle valve. The measurements of regulated flow-rates were repeated several times and the final values were calculated using arithmetic mean. To calculate the temperature coefficient and the amount of brought-in and let-out heat, the volume measured in litres was converted to weight unit. The measured values show that the volume of exchanged heat per weight unit increases with the decreasing flow-rate. With the increasing flow-rate on the throttled side, the flow-rate increases on the side without the throttle valve. This phenomenon is caused by pressure increase during throttling and by the consequent increase of the diameter of channels in the cooler at the expense of the opposite channels of the non-throttled part of the circuit. If the pressure is reduced, there is a pressure decrease on the external walls of opposite channels and the flow-rate increases again. The cooling channels are flexible depending on pressure. The pressures were not measured in laboratory measurement. This feature could be utilised in practice: a pressure regulator on one side could regulate the flow-rate on the other side.","[Nejtek, V; Fryc, J.; Konrad, Z.; Fryc, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agr Food & Environm Engn, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Nejtek, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agr Food & Environm Engn, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xnejtek@node.mendelu.cz,"Fryč, Jiří/K-9725-2018","Fryč, Jiří/0000-0002-3446-9670",,,,,5,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,837,841,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800147,0

Is this the key to combat all other emergency? There are other requirements to avoid poverty and to let this capital crow into increasing welfare by creating employment and converting individual ideas into commercial chances. Besides the availability of capital, it is important to create clear property rights of individuals and set the focus on a sustainable education system. Additionally industrialized countries should strengthen their CSR policy towards developing and emerging countries. But actually there is a big problem in the rich countries in the way of capital. To supply the economy with capital becomes more difficult as a result of the global finance crisis and the lasting Euro debt crisis. The capital markets fail more and more and the crisis in Europe could infect also other parts of the world. From necessity, since 2011 arose the CROWDINVESTING movement with its roots in the USA and there development in Western Europe and especially in Germany. By using the power of social networks and the wisdom of the CROWD of Internet user it is possible to finance enterprises by private placements of capital. For this purpose, each small amounts of money from the so called Crowdinvestors are accumulated via special online Crowdinvesting platforms to a considerable sum to finance enterprises by creating participations between these Crowdinvestors and each of the enterprises. Team of experts at the Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra is developing an ideal model of Crowdinvesting as a sustainable instrument of financing not only startups but also small and medium enterprises. A result of research work, it could be, that Crowdinvesting is also possible to use it as a kind of PSB2 (Private Social Business) in for example developing or emerging countries. Wealth is created through enterprise and entrepreneurship requires loans (Joseph A. Schumpeter). Globalization was enforced by ICT3 and Crowdinvesting is also possible by ICT. The Crowdinvesting movement is predicted for a dynamic movement in Europe. If Crowd Investing works sustainably, it can also be used internationally.","[Schenk, Rainer; Bielik, Peter; Horska, Elena] Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra 94901, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,,info@kanzlei-schenk.eu; peter.bielik@uniag.sk; elena.horska@uniag.sk,"Bielik, Peter/AAL-5561-2020; Horská, Elena/AAQ-6137-2020",,,,,,11,0,0,0,27,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,502,510,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600047,0

In this study, timberland ownership changes between 1997 and 2010 were reviewed, and their impact on publicly traded forest products firms was assessed. Changes in industrial timberland ownership were organized into four groups; 24 large timberland sales by public forest firms; six jumbo timberland sales; seven announcements related to timber REIT conversions: and four land acquisitions by timber REITs. Event analysis and the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model were employed to evaluate event-induced abnormal returns and volatility. The review revealed that most vertically integrated forest firms in the United States had divested their timberlands between 1997 and 2010. Four timber REITs have been formed since 1998, and they own 15.5 million acres of timberlands at present. Timberland sales by forest firms and acquisitions by REITs generated negative abnormal returns, while conversions to REITs produced positive impacts. In most cases, these events also increased asset volatility. These findings help us understand the adjustment of stock returns and volatility due to past ownership changes, and may shed light on similar changes by privately held forest firms in the future.

It is crucial that promotion of the city was made by specialists from this field. Interesting ideas and involvement of employees of Municipal Office of Rzeszow ensure implementing planned and intended actions.","[Szopinski, Wieslaw] State Sch Higher Vocat Educ, Tarnobrzeg, Poland",,,wieslaw.szopinski@pwsz.tarnobrzeg.pl,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-251-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,407,412,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC0II,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349058600058,0

No Child Left Behind's (NCLB) status and safe harbor measures have been criticized for being unfair and unreliable, respectively. In response to such criticism, in 2005 the federal government announced the Growth Model Pilot Program, which permits states to use projection models (a type of growth model) in their accountability systems. This article uses historical longitudinal data from a large school district to empirically show the inaccuracy of one state's projection model, to demonstrate how projection models are very similar to NCLB's original status measure, and to contrast projection models with value-added models. As policy makers debate the reauthorization of NCLB, this research can provide guidance on ways to improve the current measurement of school performance.","[Weiss, Michael J.] MDRC, New York, NY 10016 USA; [May, Henry] Univ Penn, Grad Sch Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Weiss, MJ (通讯作者)，MDRC, New York, NY 10016 USA.",michael.weiss@MDRC.org,,"May, Henry/0000-0002-5965-3933",,,,,33,11,16,0,17,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Ambitious objectives are required for 2020 future buildings: extremely low energy consumption, low carbon emission, etc. To reach these new goals, the existing design of buildings has to change. Buildings are complex systems occupied by humans interacting with their environment. Indeed, each building can be considered a unique set of elements in dynamic interaction, structured and goal-oriented. New drastic energy objectives increase the complexity of building systems. Levels of energy and environmental performance, never reached in the past, are required for future buildings. In this context, it appears that professional capabilities and existing practices are no longer adequate. The actors of the building sector have to face up to a growing complexity generated by new constraints. Usual theories and practices are under questionning. The aim of this paper is to provide an original and helpful approach to this new complexity of future buildings. This approach, based on concepts of complexity and transdisciplinarity, consists in a combination of structural, functional and transformation approaches, thus providing a tridimensional cognitive framework to plan future buildings in a dynamic way.

J,"Lee, YS",,,,"Lee, Yong-Shik",,,First WTO Case on Transitional Product-Safeguard Measure under Section 16 of the Protocol of China's Accession to the WTO: Affirming Discriminatory Safeguard Measure by the WTO?,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"On 5 September 2011, the WTO issued the Appellate Body report for the first WTO case on a transitional product-specific safeguard measure, United States - Measures Affecting Imports of Certain Passenger Vehicle and Light Truck Tyres from China (U.S. - Tyres). Transitional product-specific safeguard measures (TSMs) are controversial primarily on two grounds. First, unlike a general safeguard measure (GSM) which must be applied non-discriminatorily to all imports regardless of their source, a TSM is applicable only to the imports from a single country, China. Second, a TSM is applicable under more relaxed conditions than those stipulated for a GSM, subjecting imports from China to a more vulnerable condition against the protectionist pressure from competing domestic producers of the importing countries. The core principle of the WTO disciplines, including those for safeguard measures, is the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle which stipulates the requirement of non-discrimination among nations, and the inherently discriminatory nature of TSM undermines this core principle. This article examines the TSM provisions in comparison to the general safeguard provisions and discusses the implications of the first WTO case, U.S. - Tyres, for the TSM regime.",,,,wtogeneva@hotmail.com,"Lee, Yong-Shik/AAK-5926-2020",,,,,,30,5,5,0,11,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

As sites are experiencing different temperature regimes, the impact on productivity will vary. The spatial distribution of Norwegian salmon fanning depends on both institutional and physical conditions. At present, the general location of farms is restricted by the authorities, but in the case of large productivity differences, this regime may be liberalized. This study analyzes the impact of increased temperature on the spatial distribution of production and employment. We vary temperature and management regime in four scenarios and a 30 year time span. Total production is based on linear demand growth, serving as a restriction in the subsequent model. Productivity per county is determined in a temperature-driven model, and a separate model predicts the relocation of licenses between counties. An input output model captures the direct and indirect effects of aquaculture production. Our findings indicate substantially differing effects on the spatial distribution of production and hence value added and employment. In the baseline scenario, production growth is relatively equal among the northern, middle and southern parts of Norway. Increased temperature shifts production considerably north, both in the case of stable and liberalized management.","[Heen, Knut] Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fisheries Sci, Tromso, Norway; [Hermansen, Oystein] Norwegian Inst Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res, N-9291 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Nofima,"Hermansen, O (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res N, POB 6122, N-9291 Tromso, Norway.",oystein.hermansen@nofima.no,,,European Union [226248 - ATP],European Union(European Union (EU)),The authors thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments improving this paper.

Not all tourists, however, have or prefer the same experiences. In this study, we develop a theory on the nature of tourist experiences by proposing tourism as a way of distancing oneself from everyday reality, conceptualised in terms of out-there-ness. Experience is conceived of as conscious awareness, embedded in relatively stable mental structures, and manifested as a dynamic precondition for immediate responses to tourist practices. These preconditions are theoretically translated into different modes of experience, which are empirically tested. The results show that the theoretical modes of the experience of out-there-ness have considerable empirical support. We present these results in relation to practical applicability for policy-making, planning and design. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Elands, Birgit H.

J,"Karsenty, A; Ongolo, S",,,,"Karsenty, Alain; Ongolo, Symphorien",,,Can fragile states decide to reduce their deforestation? The inappropriate use of the theory of incentives with respect to the REDD mechanism,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,REDD; Fragile states; Failed states; Incentives; Principal-Agent model; Deforestation,,"The originality of the REDD proposal is its incentives-based mechanism designed to reward the governments of developing countries for their performance in reducing deforestation as measured against a baseline. This mechanism is founded on the hypothesis that developing countries 'pay' an opportunity cost to conserve their forests and would prefer other choices and convert their wooden lands to other uses. The basic idea is, therefore, to pay rents to these countries to compensate for the anticipated foregone revenues. The reference to the theory of incentives (in its principal-agent version) is implicit but clear. In this REDD-related framework, the Government is taken as any economic agent who behaves rationally i.e. taking decisions after comparing the relative prices associated to various alternatives, then deciding to take action and implementing effective measures to tackle deforestation and shift the nation-wide development path. Such an approach ignores the political economy of the state, especially when dealing with fragile or even failing states facing severe but chronicle institutional crises, which are often ruled by governments with private agendas fuelling corruption. Two assumptions underlying the REDD proposal are particularly critical: (i) the idea that the government of such a state is in a position to make a decision to shift its development pathway on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis that anticipates financial rewards, and (ii) the idea that, once such a decision has been made, the fragile state is capable, thanks to the financial rewards, to implement and enforce the appropriate policies and measures which could translate into deforestation reduction. The first sections of the article discuss the pertinence of applying such a REDO version of the theory of incentives to Governments, and particularly to Governments in fragile states, with respect to the historical patterns and the practical way those states work. The last sections discuss the possibility of alternative architecture for REDD, focusing on policies and measures targeting the drivers of deforestation, and investments for intensifying agriculture, reforming land tenure and enhancing the functioning of the judicial system. We will show why incentive mechanisms should be used at another scale, for the benefits of local economic agents (companies, rural households, communities, etc.), and how a scaling down is likely to alleviate some of the constraints faced by incentives when dealing at Government level.

The quality and reliability of this assessment was the central bone of contention between the parties in the Australia-Apples dispute. In consequence, it featured prominently in the Appellate Body's discussion. In commenting on the Appellate Body Report, we are concerned with the standard of review of Members' decisions that are taken in situations of factual uncertainty. We discuss the elements in a Member's risk assessment that, in our view, should be considered 'off limits' for review by Panels if such assessment was performed in the presence of uncertain scientific facts, and how high degrees of uncertainty affect a Panel's ability to assess alleged less-trade-restrictive alternatives. Relying on findings from the disciplines of economics, decision analysis, and risk management, we introduce a basic framework for decisionmaking in conditions of uncertainty. We submit that certain types of decisions taken by the risk assessor cannot be subject to external review, since they necessarily contain subjective trade-offs on the part of the risk assessor.

In the present study, the diversity of wild food species and socio-economical factors that support farmers' choice for the species used in these systems were assessed. A number of selected sites in each of the 3 climatic zones of Benin were surveyed. Data were collected through a field exploration and a semi-structured survey among 435 selected households throughout the country, using a questionnaire. The most culturally important species ranked by locals were determined for each climatic zone and the relations between the targeted species in traditional agroforestry systems and the reasons which support peasants' choices were described through a Principal Component Analysis. A total of 43 wild edible trees were found in the traditional agroforestry systems of Benin during the survey. Traditional agroforestry systems in the Guineo-Congolian zone turned out to be the most diversified with 29 species followed by the Sudanian zone with 22 species and Sudano-Guinean zone with 16 species. The most culturally important wild edible trees in traditional agroforestry systems in the Guineo-Congolian zone were different from those identified in Sudanian and Sudano-Guinean zones. Three main reasons that support peasants' ambition to conserve or to grow wild edible trees in their field were: their contribution to food, their use in traditional medicine and ceremonies and the farmers' perception of their availability in natural vegetation.

This subordination of human rights to other, market-related, priorities parallels global governance priorities in general. While some international organizations address the need for protection of migrant rights, their specific on-the-ground programs do not match the rhetoric. This study demonstrates this disconnection on the basis of an analysis of interviews with representatives of global governance institutions and international nongovernmental organizations conducted between 2007 and 2010 in the Latin American and Caribbean region and at the headquarters of relevant international organizations in Geneva. Furthermore, the study argues that because the discourse on migrant women's rights and their labor exploitation is framed predominantly in the context of trafficking, little headway is made in advancing migrant women's labor and social rights.","[Basok, Tanya] Univ Windsor, Dept Sociol, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Piper, Nicola] Univ Freiburg, Arnold Bergstraesser Inst, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany",University of Windsor; University of Freiburg,"Basok, T (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Sociol, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",basok@uwindsor.ca; nicola.piper@abi.uni-freiburg.de,,"Basok, Tanya/0000-0001-8361-7716; Piper, Nicola/0000-0003-3993-8699",,,,,94,25,28,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Horticultural research can support the sector by conducting market research and providing strategic management tools. However, these research products may lose their value when power relations within value chains or in the public domain change. These changes occurred in The Netherlands in the 1990s. The leading role of the Ministry of Agriculture declined and fierce campaigns by NGOs on food safety forced supermarkets to take the lead. This paper describes the methodology applied to reproduce and analyze the public debate on pesticides and crop protection in The Netherlands. The paper reveals the socio-economic and institutional changes that cleared the way for NGOs to campaign against the government and against supermarkets for MRL compliance. Supermarkets were afraid that NGO campaigns would emanate into consumer strikes and took over the supervision of compliance to MRL requirements from the government. They forced value chain partners and the growers of vegetables and fruit to establish a new certification system. The transition process described herein took place without any market research or application of strategic management tools. Although government services, supermarkets and grower organizations tried to maintain their existing relationships and practices, at the end of the day, they all had to accept a new 'market orientation'. Value chain partners continue to frustrate the adoption of science-based economic, marketing and managerial techniques developed by researchers. Horticultural producers have to meet the requirements of retailers otherwise they put their supply positions at risk. This paper recommends that researchers should include societal concerns and social factors in their efforts to develop consumer-driven value chains.","[Buurma, J.

In this world in a continuous changing, the state must recognize the importance of fulfilling the new needs and expectations of the citizens in opposition with the reality of reduced budgets. While the literature is not as robust as we would like to see, many articles are talking only about positive impact of eGovernment and less on difficulties or misconceptions, especially in financial crisis period.","[Georgescu, Mircea] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Business Informat Dept, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,mirceag@uaic.ro,"Georgescu, Mircea/ACU-9410-2022","Georgescu, Mircea/0000-0002-7022-3715",,,,,24,0,0,0,10,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,1472,1484,,,,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801031,0

Ecuadorian migration has increased steadily over the past fifteen years - as have remittances, the rate of family reunification in destination countries, and migrants' ownership of assets in both their countries of origin and destination. The current global crisis has affected these dynamics, particularly in Spain, which is one of the main destination countries for Ecuadorian migrants. A preliminary analysis of the impact of the crisis reveals an important decline in immigrant employment, but one that has not translated into a proportional decrease in remittances. Drawing on fieldwork in Spain and Ecuador, this study examines the strategies migrant families employed to cope with the financial crisis.","Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales FLACSO, Dept Sociol & Gender Studies, Quito, Ecuador",,"Herrera, G (通讯作者)，Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales FLACSO, Dept Sociol & Gender Studies, La Pradera E7-174 Diego de Almagro, Quito, Ecuador.",gherrera@flacso.org.ec,,,,,,,35,38,44,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The growth of GDP can have a positive effect on the spending of education. The impact of the economic growth has obvious role in promoting and relative long-term continuous effect. But the increasing of education investment spending has a weak impact on the growth of economic. The utilization rate of the education investment is low, and the unfair of education lead to a low quality of our human resources, which result that the driving effect of education spending on economic growth is still not fully played out. So, the government should strengthen its main body status and the leading role on the financial input in education.

Soil was sampled at the locations of protected area of water catchment Brezova nad Svitavou. Selected experimental area is included in vulnerable area (according to Nitrate direction). Samples of soil were sieved, homogenized and placed into 125 ml experimental pots. All pots were planted with model crop Lactuca sativa. For simulation of different level of nutrient availability, urea was applied at the rate of 175 kg N/ha, comercial phosphate was applied as a source of P - 35 kg/ha of P and ground celulose was used as a source of C. The treatments were: control, addition of N + C; N + P + C; C; N and N + P. At the end of experiment, basal respiration was measured to determine activity of soil microorganisms and substrate induced respiration was measured to determine soil microbial biomass. Leaching of N during experiment was measured using extraction of mineral N, adsorbed in ion exchange resins placed under experimental pots in flat plastic holders. Production of aboveground biomass of cultivated plants was also determined (expressed as g of dry matter). Significant differences were observed between the rates of basal respiration in soils amended with C and unamended ones. It indicates increased activity of microbial communities in treatments amended with celulose. Addition of celulose also increased the rate of substrate induced respiration, that indicates higher amount of microbial biomass in these treatments. Amount of aboveground biomass was without difference in control and treatment C+N+P. At the treatment with amendement of celulose, lowest growth of aboveground biomass of indicator plant was observed. It was probably caused by strong competition with microbes on nutrients. Also the treatment N+C was not suitable for plant growth and the plants died. Results suggest that high level of mineral N causes leaching of N from soil and they can have impact on cultivated plants. Addition of C may eliminate these effects of N application. However, at excessive level of C microbial community compete with plants on nutrients. When we add sufficient amount of nutrients, microbial activity increases and conditions remain suitable for plant growth.","[Kintl, A.; Plosek, L.; Hynst, J.; Tuma, I; Zahora, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kintl, A (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xkintl0@mendelu.cz,"Kintl, Antonín/AAJ-3773-2021; Záhora, Jaroslav/L-6534-2018; Kintl, Antonín/I-8171-2018","Kintl, Antonín/0000-0002-0031-083X;",,,,,10,0,0,1,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,422,430,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200052,0

Tax evasions of the groups of taxpayers with the same level of income and the same level of rationality are investigated. The tax authority assumed to get some statistical information, which can be considered as an indicator of the existing tax evasion. The information, mentioned above, is called a signal. A taxpayers strategy is to make a decision to evade or not to evade, i.e. to declare his income level less or equal to his true income. A tax authority's strategy is to choose the audit probability.

This research aims at identifying the constraints limiting the competitiveness of private enterprise clusters and offering some corresponding strategies so as to improve the competitiveness of China's private enterprise clusters.","[Liu, Yi] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Foreign Languages, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Huang, Qingyang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Publ Adm, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Foreign Languages, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",liuyi@mail.hust.edu.cn; hqy20000@126.com,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,0,AMER SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9845209-9-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,26,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEZ14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318819700004,0

However comparing with the standard of current assets impairment, the impairment standard for fixed assets is much more complicated. It is more subjective to judge its volume and amortization schedule. So there is more space for companies to manipulate the profit by using fixed assets impairment. Through investigating and analyzing the problems relevant to impairment of fixed assets, hopes to be helpful to improve China's accounting criterion on asset impairment. There are four chapters in this paper: The first chapter, through the meaning of impairment of fixed assets, domestic and international research review, the relation of fixed assets accumulated depreciation and impairment. The second chapter analyzes the accounting policy for impairment of fixed assets of China's current enterprise accounting system compared with the original provisions from the recognition, measurement, and other aspects. Chapter III is the analysis of the effects on the implementation of the fixed assets impairment in the listed companies in China recent years.

Empirical research so far uses patent and survey data for this purpose. In this context, innovation persistence is examined for a sample of 300 Greek firms. Innovation activities are measured through related patents and persistence is determined by the number of patents that each firm has developed during the period 1988-2010. The analysis focuses on the main firm features behind innovation persistence. Results show that innovation is persistent, as nearly half of firms patent more than once and for subsequent years during the whole period of analysis. The phenomenon of innovation persistence is more obvious among the heaviest firm innovators, which account for 30 firms in total. These 30 heavy persistent innovators are firms that are involved in different economic activities at 2-digit level of analysis, have a small size based on their total employment, are characterized by different export shares, develop relatively many technologies based on the technological content of their patents and these new technologies are not usually related to their main production line. However, the analysis also confirms that there are inter-sectoral differences, implying that technology-specific factors are important. The study and the assessment of firm-level innovation persistence have clear implications for both innovation policy and the understanding of long-term industry dynamics. Especially now, that Greece has started discussing on restructuring its economy, this paper could contribute to this discussion.","[Markatou, Maria] Natl Univ Athens, Technol Educ Inst Larissa, Larisa 41223, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,,markatou@prd.uth.gr,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,575,582,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549800054,0

In order to keep up with highly concentrated and fierce competitors, traditional horticulture retail stores must highlight their distinctive features such as high customer orientation. In times of quickly changing consumer needs, concentrating on customer orientation and high customer satisfaction may be the key to survival in a very competitive market. In Germany, little information on consumer satisfaction within small and medium-sized enterprises is available. This research project tries to fill this gap for traditional horticulture retail stores in Bavaria, Germany. The purchase behaviour of 4,212 customers in 41 retail stores was evaluated through a standardised questionnaire in 2009. There was a strong focus on global satisfaction and customer satisfaction with ex ante evaluated purchase criteria such as product assortment, buying atmosphere, pricing policy and customer-orientated interaction. As different aspects of the purchase criteria have a significant impact on customer satisfaction, customer's requirements when purchasing plants and other horticultural products can be identified via structural equation models. Satisfaction drivers such as a plant quality, customer centred behaviour and an attractive price-performance ratio were identified.","Univ Appl Sci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",,"Schöps, J (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66050-68-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2012,930.0,,,,,,175,182,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.930.23,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BDT45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314782400023,0

The aim of this study was to assess the dose-and time-dependent in vitro effects of resveratrol, a natural phenol and phytoalexin with potential antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties on bovine spermatozoa during three different time periods (Time 0 h, 12 h and 24 h). Semen samples were collected from 15 adult breeding bulls, and diluted in physiological saline solution containing 0.5% DMSO together with 0, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 200 mu M of resveratrol. Spermatozoa motility was determined using the Sperm Vision and CASA (Computer Assisted Semen Analyzer) system. Cell viability was measured using the metabolic activity MTT assay, the nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) test was used to assess the intracellular superoxide formation. Spermatozoa motility difference between the control and group A was the only one significant (P<0.001) at 0 h, however, significantly (P<0.001) increased motility parameters were observed in group D after 12 h and in groups C, D, E and F after 24 h when compared to the control. The MTT assay indicated that none of the resveratrol concentrations had a negative or cytotoxic effect on the spermatozoa mitochondrial activity and furthermore showed a significantly (P<0.001) improved cell viability in groups B, C, D, E and F at 24 h. The NBT test showed that the addition of 10 mu M resveratrol had an instant positive effect on the spermatozoa protection against free radical production. This protection remained present with a significant impact at 12 h (P<0.001) as well as 24 h (P<0.001). Furthermore, resveratrol concentrations from 50 to 5 mu M exhibited significant (P<0.05; P<0.001) protective effects on the spermatozoa free radical formation. The results indicate that the addition of resveratrol, especially in concentrations of 50 mu M to 5 mu m to the culture medium could be beneficial for the overall stimulation of spermatozoa activity and protection against possible in vitro oxidative stress development.","[Tvrda, E.; Knazicka, Z.; Lukacova, L.; Lukac, N.] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Anim Physiol, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak Agricultural Research Center,"Tvrdá, E (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Biotechnol & Food Sci, Dept Anim Physiol, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",evina.tvrda@gmail.com,"Lukac, Norbert/C-2034-2014; Lukac, Norbert/J-1427-2019; Tvrda, Eva/AAC-5711-2019","Lukac, Norbert/0000-0002-4565-2083; Tvrda, Eva/0000-0003-2895-1249",,,,,31,2,2,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1036,1046,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200121,0

I exploit industrial clustering and sectoral demand growth for identification. The effect on bilingualism was strongest in import-competing districts and among local linguistic minorities. Bilingualism was mainly the result of learning, rather than than migration or assimilation, and was not a byproduct of becoming literate.

Cultivating corn after corn requires greater nitrogen fertilizer and some of this nitrogen flows into waterways and causes environmental damage. We estimate the effect of crop prices on nitrogen losses for most fields in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana using crop data from satellite imagery. Spatial variation in these high-resolution estimates highlights the fact that the environmental effects of agriculture depend not only on what is grown, but also on where and in what sequence it is grown. Our results suggest that the change in corn and soybean prices due to a billion gallons of ethanol production expands the size of the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico by roughly 30 square miles on average, although there is considerable uncertainty in this estimate.

Data were collected for all patients waiting for transplant from 31 December 2000 until 31 December 2010 (n = 61). Patients waiting for transplant were used as the comparison group. We calculated the mean restricted survival time using the Kaplan-Meier estimation method. The time horizon was closed upon the death of the last surviving patient. Costs and consequences were discounted at 5 % per annum. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of transplant as compared to no transplant. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. We tested volume-outcome effects using a parametric survival regression. The cost of lung transplantation was 77,223a,not sign per QALY and 121,276a,not sign per life-year. Assuming a 50,000a,not sign/QALY willingness-to-pay, lung transplant would be cost-effective with a 37 % probability. Survival improved substantially from 5.15 years over the 2001-2010 period to 6.94 years for the 2008-2010 period. When restricting our analysis to the 2008-2010 period, the cost-effectiveness ratio decreased to a,not sign79,016 per life-year gained and a,not sign69,241 per QALY. Survival was significantly associated with the number of procedures performed. Although above commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds, the economic value of lung transplant holds promise in Portugal due to the large improvement in survival over the 2001-2010 period. The life-threatening character of the motivating conditions, the absence of alternative treatment, and equity concerns should be also accounted for when assessing the value for money of lung transplant.","[Mendonca, Luis] Hosp Forcas Armadas, Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendonca, Luis; Perelman, Julian] Univ Nova Lisboa, Escola Nacl Saude Publ, P-1600560 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Vanessa; Fragata, Jose] Ctr Hosp Lisboa Cent, Lisbon, Portugal; [Fragata, Jose] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias Med, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal","Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Central, EPE; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa","Perelman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Escola Nacl Saude Publ, Ave Padre Cruz, P-1600560 Lisbon, Portugal.",luis.manuel.mendonca@gmail.com; jperelman@ensp.unl.pt; vanessa.rodrigues@chlc.min-saude.pt; jigfragata@gmail.com,"; Perelman, Julian/B-4350-2013","Fragata, Jose/0000-0002-4493-8178; Perelman, Julian/0000-0001-6634-9000",,,,,16,6,6,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This strategy involves associating such risk to intolerable timber supply disruptions with a probability of occurrence (1-alpha) We increased the chance of planning success by controlling a buffer stock of timber, which varied as a function of the probability of failure (direct management of a buffer stock). We assessed the robustness of this protection strategy by considering three fire regimes (current and two greenhouse gas forcing scenarios). The maximum risk of failure was strongly affected by the age structure of the forest, While the median risk was more closely linked to the fire regime. The median rate of harvest success was more strongly affected by the planned level of supply.

China's total energy supply increased from 627.7 million tons of standard coal equivalent to 3.2 billion tons from 1978 to 2011, an average annual growth rate of 5 percent. The structure of China's energy supply is improving gradually, with natural gas accounting for 4.3 percent of the total energy production in 2011 compared to 2.9 percent in 1978. The proportion of hydroelectric, nuclear, and wind power increased from 3.1 percent in 1978 to 8.8 percent in 2011. China's energy efficiency continues to improve, with the amount of standard coal equivalent required to produce RMB 10,000 of gross domestic product decreasing from 15.68 tons in 1978 to 0.74 in 2011.

Following the US-led invasion and the international donor community's subsequent efforts to develop the country, this struggle has acquired a new lease of life. Current debates reproduce the now familiar divide between cultural values and universal rights that characterizes the wider feminist literature. While Afghan voices have been part of this debate, they tend to be drawn from more educated and politicized groups. This paper uses the narratives of a small group of Afghan women from poorer urban households to explore how they evaluate the changes that have taken place in Afghan society and where their views position them in the ongoing debates.","[Kabeer, Naila] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Gender Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Khan, Ayesha] Collect Social Res, Karachi, Pakistan",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kabeer, N (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Gender Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",N.Kabeer@lse.ac.uk; ayesha_ahsan30@yahoo.com,"Khan, Ayesha/JRW-9770-2023","Kabeer, Naila/0000-0001-7769-9540",,,,,23,14,18,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

We also analyze which factors lead to intergenerational persistence of human capital by accounting for childhood health and school performance, education and labor market outcomes. The results show a strong relationship between family SES during childhood and old age outcomes and a large cross-country heterogeneity. Education appears as the main channel for this gradient and explains most of the estimated cross-country heterogeneity.

Although Japanese consumers have almost no opportunity to purchase forest certification products now, except paper and paper-related products, Japan may be a promising market with significant scope for increasing the demands for the forest certification products. Each choice task of our discrete choice experiment contained alternative wall renovation scenarios with interior wood materials showing five attributes. In 2008, 150 respondents living in Sapporo, northern Japan, completed our questionnaire, which contained a series of the choice tasks. To understand heterogeneous preferences and identify consumer segments in a systematic way, a latent class model was applied. The results show that the mean price premium on Forest Stewardship Council certification of interior materials was 40.5% under a ceteris paribus condition. However, two identified consumer segments both placed greater value on other attributes of the interior materials: dimensional stability and/or area of production. The results indicate that for suppliers of forest products outside of Japan, the merit of forest certification and the demerit of foreign product will cancel each other out in Japan.

Foresight could potentially greatly benefit from resources that become available when the knowledge base increases through networks. This article seeks to investigate how innovation networks and foresight are related, to what extent networked foresight activities exist and how they are practiced. For the former the Cyclic Innovation Model (CIM) is utilized as analytical framework and applied to three cases. The foresight activities are analyzed in terms of type, scope and role. The cases are a collaboration between government agencies and a research organization and two inter-organizational networks of different size. 'Networked foresight' is clearly observable in all three cases. Indeed, a networked approach to foresight seems to strengthen the various roles of foresight. However, the rooting and openness of foresight activities in the three networks varies significantly. The advantages that 'networked foresight' entails could be exploited to a much higher degree for the networks themselves, e.g., the broad resource base and the large pool of people with diverse backgrounds that are available. Furthermore, effective instruments for the reintegration of knowledge into the networks' partner organizations are needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While comparisons of means indicate an advantage to attending a STEM school, more thorough analysis conditioning on a rich set of covariates, including previous grade test performance, reduces or eliminates this advantage. Females and males in STEMs do better than their counterparts in Non-STEMs, but the gender gap is also larger in these schools. We also find that the black-white and Hispanic-white gaps are smaller in STEM relative to Non-STEM schools across almost all outcomes, but the Asian-white gap, in contrast, is larger in STEMs relative to Non-STEMs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to estimate visitors' willingness to pay (WIT)) higher entry fees to access the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) in Nepal, determine variables influencing their WTP decisions, and explore strategies for diversifying ACA's finance mechanisms. Contingent valuation surveys were administered to a random sample of 401 visitors in 2012. About 62% of the visitors were willing to pay higher entry fees than the current US $25 fee. The logit regression results showed that the bid amount, educational attainment and use of a guide were statistically significant predictors of WTP decisions. The mean and median WTP amounts were US $116.7 and US $122, respectively. Ceteris paribus, increasing the entry fee to US $122 would yield about 20 million US dollars in surplus revenues in the next 5 years, which can be earmarked for establishing a conservation trust fund to diversify ACA's finance mechanisms.

Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that between 2005 and 2008, trade union membership declined from 22.4% to 18.9% of the workforce. Studies and statistics consistently show that union membership and density are lowest in Western Australia, despite trend reversals elsewhere. Using the Western Australian branches of two 'blue-collar' unions - the Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union, Western Australian Branch and the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union, covering a range of transport, metal working, printing and manufacturing trades - as examples, this article examines whether privatisation has contributed significantly to falling trade union density and membership in this state. These unions represented large public sector workforces. In order to test the hypothesis that privatisation has adversely affected union membership and density, the article examines three areas: changing policies in the Australian Labor Party, the breaking down of union culture and changes in trade training, and concludes that privatisation is a significant factor in the recent decline of these two unions.","[Oliver, Bobbie] Curtin Univ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Oliver, B (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Dept Social Sci & Int Studies, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",Bobbie.Oliver@curtin.edu.au,,"Oliver, Bobbie/0000-0002-1625-8319",,,,,55,2,3,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This study applies a generalized multinomial logit model to interpret the results of a discrete choice experiment administered to a representative sample of 1001 Poles. The questionnaire included three physical attributes: protecting the most ecologically valuable forest ecosystems, reducing litter in forests, and improving recreation infrastructure. The selection of these attributes was motivated by extensive qualitative research regarding to what indicators of biodiversity, nature protection and recreation possibilities people are most sensitive. The fourth attribute was monetary, that is, additional costs associated with the new programs that would have to be financed out of increased taxes. The results allowed for an estimation of implicit prices regarding the choice attributes and calculating welfare measures of specific forest management scenarios. The study revealed interesting connections between respondents' current forest recreation patterns and the importance they place on the various attributes of forests. The paper particularly focuses on respondents' unobserved and observed preference heterogeneity, as well as scale heterogeneity, and the study demonstrates how heterogeneity can improve the models and provide insight into how users and non-users of forests may benefit from introducing a particular policy.

The logic is that, by adhering to a strict methodology that is subject to legal review, trade remedies credibly signal that the government is only temporarily defecting from free trade. And yet, countries often turn, instead, to a measure that does not adhere to a strict methodology and is not subject to legal review: binding overhang, or the gap between a country's bound and applied tariffs. What explains a government's decision to use trade remedies or binding overhang? We argue that trade remedies are used where import surges are big enough that injury can be proven, but low enough that governments have incentive to prove it.

I make a particular claim for the rise of 'prototyping' as a cultural discourse today, in design, engineering and artistic circles but also among analogous experimental moments in social studies of science and critical theory. I focus in particular on the affordances of the prototype as material culture and sociological theory: prototyping as something that happens to social relationships when one approaches the craft and agency of objects in particular ways. Last, the essay examines the work that prototypes do as figures of suspension and expectation, where they can be seen to function as 'traps' for the emergence of compossibility.

Please note that all the companies belong to the main index of these Stock Exchanges (Category 1 - Bucharest Stock Exchange - and FTSE 100 - London Stock Exchange). We mention that all these companies where chosen completely randomly, not using in their selection criteria as stock exchange capitalization, but still taking into account the availability of information. In this study, we tested a lot of statements using true or false. To obtain the information, we accessed website of each company and annual reports for 2011 and Corporate Governance Regulations of companies in question. Following this study, we concluded that the role of the audit committee is crucial, although some aspects are more or less unevaluated by the companies from the sample on which the study was conducted. As a general conclusion, we can see that the companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange are not aware of the significant role of the audit committee in corporate governance, unlike foreign companies, which understand the significant role of this structure.

The sources of economic growth were decomposed for contributions from changes in demand, from changes in technology, and from the interaction between them. Additionally, the effects were measured broken down by category of the final demand for the products of each of the three major sectors: agriculture, industry, and service. The results demonstrate that the principal source of economic growth over the period was changed in the final demand, which accounted for 143% of net economic growth. However, the effects of technology and of the interaction between the two factors are shown to be negative, reducing economic growth in Brazil. Another important aspect was the evidence of deindustrialization in the country: in the period under analysis, it can be observed that the net growth of both the agricultural and services sectors was higher than the net growth of the industry.","[de Oliveira, Daniel Lelis] Univ Brasilia, Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Tarocco Filho, Jose] Univ Estadual Maringa, Econ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Sesso Filho, Umberto Antonio] Univ Sao Paulo, Appl Econ, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Sesso Filho, Umberto Antonio] Univ Estadual Londrina, Londrina, PR, Brazil; [Sesso Filho, Umberto Antonio] Reg Econ Labor Market & Automot Ind, Maringa, Parana, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade Estadual de Maringa; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Londrina,"da Silva, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Londrina, Reg Econ, Londrina, PR, Brazil.",elcio_c.silva@hotmail.com; dlelis@hotmail.com; jtarocco@hotmail.com; umasesso@uel.br,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,4,DENFAR TRANSNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,ONTARIO,"58 RIDEAU HEIGHTS DR, ONTARIO, OTTAWA NEPEAN K2E 7A6, CANADA",,,978-0-9868210-5-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,132,140,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353691000009,0

While the former channel caters to middle- to high-income consumers, the latter mainly services low-income consumers. Retail outlets govern the first chain, while fishers believe hawkers are the lead actors in the second chain based on the thinking that they have a monopoly on the selling of snoek in townships. The real reason most fishers do not practice forward integration, though, is the impracticality of extending value chain functions beyond catching. Three suggestions are put forward for improving the value chain position for fishers: making crew members rights holders in their own right; forward integration into retailing and delivery contracts with processors and fish shops; and/or direct supply contracts with supermarkets. All these options would require government policy intervention and financial and technical backing for fishers.","Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies PLAAS, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Hara, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies PLAAS, P Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",mhara@plaas.org.za,,,Ford Foundation (Pro-Poor Value Chain Governance in Southern Africa project) [1100-0534]; Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences (University of the Western Cape); National Research Foundation of South Africa,Ford Foundation (Pro-Poor Value Chain Governance in Southern Africa project); Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences (University of the Western Cape); National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"This research was made possible through funding from the Ford Foundation (Pro-Poor Value Chain Governance in Southern Africa project, grant number 1100-0534) and the Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences (University of the Western Cape) grant for supporting academic outputs and the National Research Foundation (incentive grant scheme) of South Africa.

I find that during the financial crisis of 2007-8, U.S. financial shocks were transmitted to emerging market economies (EMEs) via the international lending activities of U.S. banks. However, the results suggest that U.S. banks' lending activities alone cannot explain the transmission of the financial shocks to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. In addition, I find that the U.S. business cycle significantly affected U.S. bank loans to EMEs but that it did not significantly affect the banks' claims on developed countries. I also find that the business cycles in the EMEs were not the main drivers of U.S. banks' cross-border lending; in contrast, the macroeconomic conditions in the developed countries were important drivers of the cross-border lending by the banks.","Keimyung Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Taegu, South Korea",Keimyung University,"Jo, GJ (通讯作者)，Keimyung Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Taegu, South Korea.",gabjejo@kmu.ac.kr,,,,,,,18,13,15,1,10,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Here, an analysis is offered of the context in which these innovations are stimulated, focusing on their efforts to demonstrate that contemporary dance is a 'knowledge-producing' endeavour. I tie this to the demands of knowledge economies. I then offer an analysis of specific projects and the 'choreographic objects' that result from them utilising exchange theory drawn in part from Melanesian anthropology. The resulting analysis of things-in-the-making and things-in-circulation reveals how choreographic objects are shaped by dance practitioners' views of themselves, their interests, and their desire to control perceptions of their practice as well as by the need to find an appropriate mode in which to demonstrate the value of this practice through the transfer of knowledge. The move towards 'knowledge production' and towards recasting relationships with audiences are construed as experiments with the form of social relations through new forms of transaction. I come to represent the digital creations of dance companies as 'prototype' forms for relational engagement with audiences and the wider public.","[Leach, James] Univ Western Australia, CNRS, CREDO, Anthropl & Sociol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Leach, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, CNRS, CREDO, Anthropl & Sociol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",James.Leach@uwa.edu.au,"Leach, James/IQX-0628-2023","Leach, James/0000-0002-5410-3545","Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/G000840/1, AH/K003046/1] Funding Source: researchfish; AHRC [AH/G000840/1, AH/K003046/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),,,52,29,29,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

This research estimates a hedonic model of cod prices in the Northeast US from 2005-2011. While large fish typically receive premium prices, the largest cod receive prices that are approximately $0.20 per pound lower than fish in the next largest market category. A moderate premium for freshness is found: cod caught on trips that last four days receive $0.04 less per pound than fish that is caught on shorter trips. This discount rises to nearly $0.15 per pound for trips lasting 10 days or longer. A similar discount exists for fish that are stored for two or more days after landing. The premia estimated by the hedonic price model are quite different from the group mean premia, suggesting that bioeconomic models that incorporate price heterogeneity should consider more sophisticated price models.","NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Lee, MY (通讯作者)，NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 166 Water St,MB 19, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",Min-Yang.Lee@noaa.gov,,,,,,,60,47,49,0,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

In this scenario the question to be asked is then: how is it possible to elaborate a new collective imaginary of precarity and reclaim new rights? After a focus on the phenomenon of precarity in Italy, this contribution move to consider the activities of the network of San Precario, a cultural phenomenon that managed to develop new kinds of social claims based on bottom-up and horizontal practices.

In the present paper, for improvement or optimization of statistical decisions under parametric uncertainty, a new technique of invariant embedding of sample statistics in a performance index is proposed. This technique represents a simple and computationally attractive statistical method based on the constructive use of the invariance principle in mathematical statistics. Unlike the Bayesian approach, an invariant embedding technique is independent of the choice of priors. It allows one to eliminate unknown parameters from the problem and to find the best invariant decision rule, which has smaller risk than any of the well-known decision rules. In order to illustrate the application of the proposed technique for constructing optimal statistical decisions under parametric uncertainty, we discuss the following personnel management problem in tourism. A certain company provides interpreter-guides for tourists. Some of the interpreter-guides are permanent ones working on a monthly basis at a daily guaranteed salary. The problem is to determine how many permanent interpreter-guides should the company employ so that their overall costs will be minimal? We restrict attention to families of underlying distributions invariant under location and/or scale changes.

The customers' satisfaction is critical, therefore hotels have to implement new technologies that lead to understanding of customers' consumption needs and that contribute to fulfillment of current requirements in relation to the supply of services. Under the circumstances, we consider that information technology should represent an absolutely necessary resource in the work of hotels to increase performance, statement sustained by international research in the field. Thus, the present research shows the importance of implementing information technology for managers as well as the relation between the factors that define information technology in hotels in Mure county and economic performance through the tools of parametric and non-parametric statistics. The results show a part confirmation of research assumptions, therefore the hotel industry in Mure county should take into consideration improvement of information technology that serves the hotel industry. The conclusions of the study illustrate a significant importance for the managers of the hotels that require achieving customers' satisfaction and implicitly favourable economic results.

Adapting Hayek's theory of price to recent developments in the field of cultural sociology, it proposes the idea that an effective price system condenses information dispersed in society, and then enters into a performative process of symbolic communication that is perceived as 'authentic' by the consumers. After analyzing 'artificial' and 'authentic' current strategies aimed at producing digital markets for cultural goods, which are especially sensitive to the symbolic dimension of price, the article suggests the hypothesis that the digital market has been constructed as a zero- or quasi-zero-price economic space, and that it is the offline and material market of cultural products the one that collects the higher revenues derived from the 'authentic' generation of value taking place in the digital marketplace.","[Sanz, Esteve] Yale Univ, Sch Law, Informat Soc Program, 127 Wall St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Sanz, Esteve] European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Informat Soc Unit, E-41092 Seville, Spain",Yale University; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Sanz, E (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Law, Informat Soc Program, 127 Wall St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",esteve.sanz@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,48,5,5,3,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Given its central and dominant position in the multilateral trading system, it is interesting that GATT 1994 contains no express definition of the objects that it regulates - 'products' and 'goods'. While this omission may not have raised substantial legal difficulties in the past, rapid changes in technology and the rising use by governments of market instruments to manage resources and the environment have seen the creation of new and unorthodox items of international commerce. The atypical qualities of these items, such as their intangibility or their status as 'regulatory property', raise questions as to whether they fall within the scope of GATT 1994. By testing the legal boundaries of the terms 'products' and 'goods', this article seeks to develop a le,gal framework for assessing whether, and to what extent, new and unorthodox items of international commerce fall within its scope. It then applies this framework to two examples, carbon units and digital products, concluding that, far from being rigid or limited, GATT 1994 is sufficiently capable of evolving to cover many of these new and unorthodox items.","[Munro, James] Melbourne Law Sch, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Munro, James] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Munro, J (通讯作者)，Melbourne Law Sch, Carlton, Vic, Australia.",munroj@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,96,1,1,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In 2003, New York City made school breakfast free for all students regardless of income, while increasing the price of lunch for those ineligible for meal subsidies. Using a difference-indifference estimation strategy, we derive plausibly causal estimates of the policy's impact by exploiting within and between group variation in school meal pricing before and after the policy change. Our estimates suggest that the policy resulted in small increases in breakfast participation both for students who experienced a decrease in the price of breakfast and for free-lunch eligible students who experienced no price change. The latter suggests that universal provision may alter behavior through mechanisms other than price, highlighting the potential merits of universal provision over targeted services. We find limited evidence of policy impacts on academic outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This data set includes five measures of health outcomes and 24 health risk factors in the categories of health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. Second, to distinguish causality from correlation, we implement an emerging data-driven method to study the causal factors of health outcomes. Among all included potential health risk factors, we identify adult smoking, obesity, motor vehicle crash death rate, the percent of children in poverty, and violent crime rate to be major causal factors of premature mortality. Adult smoking, preventable hospital stays, college or higher education, employment, children in poverty, and adequacy of social support determine health-related quality of life. Finally, the Chlamydia rate, community safety, and liquor store density are three important factors causally related to low birth weight.

Drawing on interview data with 30 participants from research conducted in 2011-2012, this article examines young people's experiences of employment in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. Levels of unemployment and under-employment above the national average reflect two decades of globalised restructuring of the steel, coal and manufacturing industries which, together with agriculture, have historically been the region's economic base. The growth of service and knowledge industries has been accompanied by new, atypical' or insecure work patterns. The interview data indicate that young people's diverse experiences of transition and choice in leaving school, commencing training or further education, and entering the labour market are accompanied by a range of understandings of employment and precarious work. These experiences highlight the difficulties, divisions and contradictions in a changing regional labour market and suggest how the ideologies and practices of neo-liberalism shape and are embedded in regional labour markets and precarious work more generally.","[Burrows, Scott] Univ Wollongong, Sch Social Sci Media & Commun, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Burrows, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",sdb03@uowmail.edu.au,,,,,,,53,20,23,2,27,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

In this paper we show how collective waste disposal systems introduce essential changes in the design of optimal environmental policy. Absent collective disposal, an optimal environmental policy imposes relatively stringent regulations on polluters in regions where local environmental damage functions are high; however, under collective waste disposal, the optimal environmental policy level increases monotonically over distance from the disposal site, and this is true irrespective of the degree of spatial heterogeneity in local environmental damage functions. We characterize the optimal spatial pattern of environmental policy levels under collective waste disposal and identify optimal membership size for waste disposal networks comprised of homogeneous producers.

In keeping with research on other countries, we find a significant gender gap in favour of boys, but contrary to suggestions in the literature, our results provide no evidence that single-sex schooling reduces the gap.

Using two general population samples, we compared three lead-time TTO variants: 10 years of lead time in full health preceding 5 years of unhealthy time (standard); 5 years of lead time preceding 5 years of unhealthy time (experimental); and 10 years of lead time and 5 years of unhealthy time, presented with a visual aid to highlight the point where the lead time ends (experimental). Participants were randomized to receive one of the lead-time variants, as administered by a computer software program. Health-state values generated by TTO valuation tasks using a longer lead time were slightly lower than those generated by tasks using a shorter lead time. When lead time and unhealthy time were presented with visual aids highlighting the difference between the lead time and unhealthy time, respondents spent more time considering health states with a value close to 0.

We analyze under what circumstances small changes in key parameters (including the size of the community, and the rate of technological progress) trigger catastrophic transitions from relatively high levels of cooperation to widespread norm violation-causing the social-ecological system to collapse.

Evidence from the Milwaukee voucher program,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Vouchers; Sorting; Cream skimming,EDUCATIONAL VOUCHERS; PUBLIC-SCHOOLS; FINANCIAL-AID; COMPETITION; CHOICE; STRATIFICATION,"This paper analyzes the impact of voucher design on student sorting in the application and enrollment phases of parental choice. Much of the existing literature investigates the question of sorting where private schools can screen students. However, the publicly funded U.S. voucher programs require private schools to accept all students unless oversubscribed and to pick students randomly if oversubscribed. In the context of a theoretical model, this paper argues that this feature coupled with the absence of topping up of vouchers can preclude sorting by income in the application stage, although there is still sorting by ability. This design can avert sorting by ability in the enrollment stage, but revelation of new monetary costs can lead to sorting by income. Using a logit model and student level data from the Milwaukee voucher program for 1990-1994, this study finds robust evidence that this indeed has been the case in reality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Measures like these are often used interchangeably in cost-effectiveness studies. However, it is unclear whether they measure the same level of health in the same patients. The empirical performance of the two multi-attribute utility instruments is tested in terms of feasibility, utility score, linear relationship and agreement by using a novel Norwegian data set. The paper also includes an analysis of how the instruments rank individuals in terms of health status, and their discriminatory power are tested. The results show that EQ-5D and 15D should not be used interchangeably in economic evaluations. EQ-5D is likely to give a more favourable cost utility ratio than 15D. The utility scores generated from the two instruments differ significantly different from each other, even though they correlate well.

We use our model to analyze the effects of self-selection and endogeneity on OLS estimates of the return to migration experience in the Mexican labor market. Under plausible assumptions, OLS estimates provide a lower bound on the true average return to migration experience among return migrants. Using Mexican Migration Project (MMP) data, we find a return to migration experience of about 2.2 percent per year. Our estimates are robust to the inclusion of proxies for unobserved skill. A comparison with patterns in the 1995 Mexican Population and Dwelling Count suggests that our results are robust across data sets and are driven by a relationship between migration experience and wages, not hours worked. We also explore the plausibility of multiple mechanisms that could explain this relationship. We find the most evidence for the theory that individuals are acquiring occupation-specific work experience in the United States. The return to a year of occupation-specific migration experience is estimated to be as high as 8.7 percent for some occupations.","[Reinhold, Steffen] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Reinhold, Steffen] Munich Ctr Econ Aging MEA, Munich, Germany; [Thom, Kevin] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of Mannheim; New York University,"Thom, K (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",kevin.thom@nyu.edu,,,,,,,39,42,54,0,16,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

Whether and how one accounts for human adaptation directly affects estimates of the economic consequences of environmental change, estimates that are both critical in informing policy decisions and notoriously difficult to value. This paper introduces and applies an analytical framework for placing an economic value on adaptation. We explore the issue first in a stylized model that facilitates making concrete generalizations about the kinds of adaptations that generate high or low economic value. We then test the soundness of our insights by incorporating learning and adaptive decision-making into a structural dynamic forestry model where climate change is imposed exogenously and agents respond optimally. Using downscaled climate projections integrated with site- and species-specific timber productivity data, we estimate the economic value of adaptation to climate change within the California timber industry. We find on the intensive margin, changing the rotation intervals will yield a low value of adaptation, but on the extensive margin, replanting more suitable tree species can yield significant value.

We first examine the entire aquaculture industry by assessing its profitability, efficiency, and input cost structure over time and across economic farm sizes; we then proceed to analyze the farms at the individual subsector levels of crustacean, Chinese catfish, other foodfish, and ornamental farms. The results reveal a wide variation in performance across farms, even within the same subsectors.

The presence of significant economies of scales were detected in performance with full-time operations being found more profitable and efficient than part-time operations.

Facts and data can be presented to describe the economic growth problem facing nations, both rich and poor. Instructors can then use key elements of the Solow growth model and discuss the importance of technology to explain economic growth to students.

Within this context, this paper estimates the welfare implications of disability for older people in Ireland. We define and estimate models of the private costs borne by households with older persons who have a disability in Ireland, both in general and by severity of illness or condition. Our modelling framework is based on the standard of living approach to estimating the cost of disability. The model quantifies the extra costs of living associated with disability and is estimated by comparing the standard of living of households with and without disabled members at a given income, controlling for other sources of variation. The analysis suggests that the estimated economic cost of disability for older people in Ireland is significant and varies by severity of disability, as well as by household type. The results also suggest that the cost of disability increases in proportionate terms as the number of people in the household decreases. Our results are important when considering the effectiveness of policies that aim to address the economic problems associated with disability for older people, suggesting that current policy in Ireland does not go far enough. They indicate that older people face a double jeopardy through age and disability, which is not reflected in official poverty rates and support the case for the introduction of disability-adjusted poverty payments.","[Cullinan, John; O'Shea, Eamon] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Cullinan, John; Gannon, Brenda; O'Shea, Eamon] Natl Univ Ireland, Irish Ctr Social Gerontol, Galway, Ireland; [Gannon, Brenda] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University of Leeds,"Cullinan, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland.",john.cullinan@nuigalway.ie,"Gannon, Brenda/D-2011-2017","Gannon, Brenda/0000-0002-3672-4030",,,,,28,26,27,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

One-year teacher-driven classroom implementation is used, which is based on especially developed teaching material including health education, physical activity breaks and parent involvement. 354 children in the control and 365 children in the intervention group at baseline and follow-up were analysed. Effectiveness is measured as cm waist circumference (WC) and unit (0.01) waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) increase prevented in intervention vs. control group using an adjusted two-level model.

The literature to date has relied on parametric examples; based on these examples, a consensus has emerged that in this kind of game, the equilibrium coalition size is small, except possibly when the potential benefits of cooperation are also small. In this paper, we develop a non-parametric approach to the problem, and demonstrate that the conventional wisdom is not robust. In a general setting, we identify conditions under which the equilibrium coalition size can be large even when potential gains are large. Contrary to previously examined leading special cases, we show that reductions in marginal abatement costs in an international environmental game can increase equilibrium membership, and we provide a measure of the smallest reduction in costs needed to support a coalition of arbitrary size.

The results also indicate that cost efficiency is negatively related with revenue efficiency, both dynamically and across countries. Market concentration is related to greater revenue efficiency. In the absence of developed capital markets, competitive forces and strengthened regulation seem to be forcing cost-efficiency improvements.

The methodology of the study is content analysis of annual reports of a sample of 28 out of 70 (40%) companies for the period 2008-2012. The assets structure is measured by fixed assets turnover and current assets turnover while the financial performance is measured by return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The study attempts to answer the following question: What is the effect of fixed assets turnover and current assets turnover on financial performance in a sample of manufacturing companies in the Sultanate of Oman? The study examines two main hypotheses. The first one examines the effects of total assets turnover on ROA whereas the second one examines the effects of total assets turnover on ROE. These hypotheses were tested based on all companies and across some distinguished subsectors in the manufacturing sector. The overall result for the study is that the structure of assets doesn't have a strong impact on profitability in terms of ROE. This result means that if the structure of assets is changing then the ROA will not change. Another result of the study indicates that only the fixed assets have impact on ROE unlike ROA. On the other hand, there is not any impact for current assets on ROE and ROA. Another result of the study suggests that the effect of asset structure has an impact on ROE only in petro-chemical sector.","[Al-Ani, Mawih Kareem] Dhofar Univ, Accounting & Finance Dept, Salalah, Oman",Dhofar University,,Mawih@du.edu.om,"AL Ani, Mawih Kareem/M-1184-2015","AL Ani, Mawih Kareem/0000-0002-3288-175X",,,,,17,1,2,1,12,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-3-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,147,165,,,,,,19,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4MA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336000900014,0

The preliminary results showed that both parts of spectrums are sensitive to changes of crop parameters. The reflectance of crop stand under good nutritional condition increased clearly increased in the visible region and increased in the near-infrared region.

The majority of the citizens had to come up with a way to survive the unfavourable conditions experienced over the last decade in the form of what has now become known as the informal sector. The researchers critically examine and explore the possible options for extending pension coverage to the Zimbabwean informal sector workforce. The key focus of the study is on the urban informal sector, with particular attention to the two cities of Harare and Bulawayo where the sector is most dominant. According to the vast literature available, efforts in a number of countries worldwide to improve pension coverage rates have proven fruitful by reducing poverty levels significantly. The main thrust of the study is to identify variables that make the informal sector left out of the current structured pension system, their reasons for non-participation and hence the way forward to provide the all-important sector sources of old age income. Focused interviews were conducted with key stakeholders and questionnaires were administered to the sector' participants. Further, government documents from ILO, CSO and NSSA were used to achieve certain objectives of the study. Findings particularly reveal that it is difficult to reach the informal sector through traditional formal-sector pension approaches. The difficulty is mainly attributed to their low income, poor education background, preferences in the context of pensions and inability to meet the minimum eligibility criteria of the traditional system of pension provision. From the analysis of field data, the alternative to the traditional structured pension system is introduction of a new micro pension system based on the researchers' Four Plans Model constructed from preferences of the respondents in the field survey. Furthermore, in considering treatment of the informal sector, pension policy makers should not neglect traditional formal sector schemes. Even though the size of the informal sector has grown in Zimbabwe in recent years, long-term structural trends especially reductions in the share of the labour force in agriculture and urbanisation favour expansion of the formal sector. This paper contributes to the existing body of literature on pension funds and it provides mechanism by which policy makers can implement to improve the provision of pension funds in the informal sector. To our knowledge, we are the first to look at pension coverage in the Zimbabwean informal sector.","[Mazviona, Batsirai W.; Mahachi, Alois I.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Insurance & Actuarial Sci, Ascot, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",National University of Science & Technology - Zimbabwe,,winmoreb@gmail.com; aloismahachi@gmail.com,,"Mazviona, Batsirai/0000-0002-6681-6788",,,,,9,0,0,0,6,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,357,368,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600033,0

Subsequently, we analysed the crop coefficient of spring barley during one growing season since 7th May 2013 to 30th July 2013. We used the data obtained above 1-ha spring barley field in Bystrice nad Pernstejnem, Czech Republic. In particular, we investigated how Kc correlates to climatic conditions as rainfall and soil humidity and how it reflects Plant Area Index (PAI) during the year during different parts of growing season. The cumulative ET of spring barley was 228.6 mm per investigated period. For reference evapotranspiration (ETo) two different approaches were used. Typically, a reference grass cover 0.12 m high standard for Europe. On the other hand, in the USA it is common to use also alfalfa (0.50 m high). ETo of grass was 296.3 mm and ETo of alfalfa was 351.4 mm. Maximum Plant Area Index occurred in June and its value was 4.1. Mean Kc in May was 1.17 for reference grass and 1.03 for alfalfa. Similarly in June, Kc was equal to 1.16 (grass) and 1.03 (alfalfa). Finally in July, for reference grass Kc was 0.55 and 0.48 for alfalfa. The decline at the end of the growing season was caused by dry weather and ripe stage of spring barley.","[Poznikova, G.; Fischer, M.; Pohankova, E.; Zalud, Z.; Trnka, M.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Poznikova, G.; Fischer, M.; Pohankova, E.; Zalud, Z.; Trnka, M.] Global Change Res Ctr AS CR, Vvi, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Pozníková, G (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",g.poznikova@gmail.com,"Zalud, Zdenek/G-3203-2014; Trnka, Miroslav/F-9428-2014; Orság, Matěj/G-9765-2014; Pohanková, Eva/H-7238-2014; Fischer, Milan/GXZ-9833-2022; Poznikova, Gabriela/G-1897-2014; Fischer, Milan/H-3996-2014","Zalud, Zdenek/0000-0003-1882-9901; Trnka, Miroslav/0000-0003-4727-8379;",,,,,4,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,357,361,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800062,0

This has led to a decrease in environmental and landscape quality with fewer social benefits accruing from the rural land. The demand for environmental conservation and recreational areas has increased in recent years, especially in the urban context. In order to meet these needs the Venice City Council decided to establish an extensive woodland on the Venice hinterland. Due to the high costs of the project it was important to evaluate its benefits in monetary terms and whether a mixed landscape might produce a higher benefits flow than a dense woodland. The objectives of our study are to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for different surface allocations Of the future Wood of Mestre and to better understand the influence on WTP of the delay in the benefits due to the time needed for tree growth. Our first finding was that people prefer a mixed solution in terms of surface allocation: the wood-meadow mix (75% woodland, 25% meadow) is at the top of the sample preferences. Second, the WTP of the preferred afforestation programme is 51 year/family. The social benefits derived on a 10-year basis considering the presence of animals and lakes in the preferred scenario are 62,755/ha. The research highlighted how WTP has an inverse correlation with age. Nonetheless the WTP of older people is not negligible and this appears to support the hypothesis that the woodland will also have a bequest value. The WTP also tends to decline with the distance of the district where the interviewees live. Finally, CE proves to be a consistent and robust methodology for forest benefit evaluation that can provide both land management and quantitative information to policymakers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The practice by the aborigines was crude, with the use of a flame of fire to kill the bees and their honey while the habitats are totally destroyed. The product of this method leads to contamination, unhealthy honey and difficult to store due to fermentation. Modern beekeeping is still at low ebb in Nigeria. It is yet to be adopted by the government as a farming enterprise with modest investment that could be used to reduce poverty and unemployment among the youth. In the quest of supporting the government in her drive for youth empowerment, Fayolam Farms conducted training program on modern beekeeping to some selected youth in the Moro LGA Kwara State, Nigeria in the year 2007. Four years after the program, it was evaluated to find out the level of progress (increase in the number of hives, harvest, market accessibility, return on investment) attained and the challenges the trainees are facing in commercial modern beekeeping. The training featured modules on modern beekeeping, beekeeping equipments, sites and colony establishment, beekeeping management, harvesting, processing, uses, storage of honey, simple farm record keeping, and tips on marketing. Structured interview schedules were used to collect data from 116 respondents who participated in the training and who were still active in apiculture. The questionnaire solicits information on demographic characteristics, the number of hives attained, harvesting, marketing of honey, returns on investment and the challenges faced in beekeeping enterprise. The results showed high levels (93%) of adoption among the males relative to their female counterparts. The mean age of participants was 28.6 years, mostly (89. 65%) were married, forty-four percent had junior secondary education and were predominantly (79.31%) farmers. Hive acquisition increased progressively after the training from 5 to 40 hives while the total revenue generated on individual aggregate was 119, 275.00 with the share of male participants as high as 63.16%. At present, the productivity from the beekeepers was at a level which leaves room for improvement. The market for other honey bee products are yet to be tapped to increase revenue as concentration was still limited to marketing liquid honey alone. Production challenges faced by the trainees include destruction of hives by fire, pest and diseases, pilfering and absconding of bees. It is recommended that further training is needed for the beekeepers in other segments of beekeeping that will lead to better production and management of the bee farm.","[Yusuf, S. F.
