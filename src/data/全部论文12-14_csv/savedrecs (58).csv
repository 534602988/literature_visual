Traditional strategies to estimate education production functions do not allow for varying role or development of unobserved ability as a child ages. Such restrictions are highly inconsistent with a growing body of scientific evidence; moreover, in order to obtain unbiased parameter estimates of observed educational inputs, researchers must properly account for unobserved skills that may be correlated with other inputs to the production process. To illustrate our empirical strategy we use experimental data from Tennessee's Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio experiment, known as Project STAR. We find that unobserved ability is endogenously developed over time and its impact on cognitive achievement varies significantly between grades in all subject areas. Moreover, we present evidence that accounting for time-varying unobserved ability across individuals and a more general depreciating pattern of observed inputs are both important when estimating education production functions.

Methods We analysed data from the Health for All Database and the Global Burden of Disease report of the World Health Organization (WHO). Life expectancy at birth and disability-adjusted life years were analysed for 1990-2010. Age-standardised death rates (ASDR) and potential years of life lost (PYLL) were assessed for selected inflammatory diseases. Results Life expectancy at birth for male individuals improved in CEE by 4.8 years and in the EU-15 by 5.4 years. During the same period, life expectancy at birth for female individuals improved in CEE by 4.0 years and in the EU-15 by 4.2 years. The difference in life expectancy at birth between male and female individuals in the EU-15 decreased by 1.2 years and in CEE by 0.8 years. Comparisons of ASDR and PYLL among the EU-15 and CEE countries were difficult because of the potentially low validity of the available data. Conclusions The health status of the CEE population has improved since 1990. However, only a few countries have closed the gap with the EU-15 countries. Inflammatory conditions might represent a significant disease burden in CEE countries; however, a thorough analysis and comparison to the EU-15 is difficult because of a shortage of good-quality data.","[Boncz, Imre; Vajda, Reka; Agoston, Istvan; Endrei, Dora; Sebestyen, Andor] Univ Pecs, Inst Hlth Insurance, Fac Hlth Sci, H-7621 Pecs, Hungary; [Sebestyen, Andor] Natl Hlth Insurance Fund Adm OEP, South Transdanubian Reg Off, H-7645 Pecs, Hungary",University of Pecs,"Boncz, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pecs, Inst Hlth Insurance, Fac Hlth Sci, Maria U 5-7, H-7621 Pecs, Hungary.",imre.boncz@etk.pte.hu,"Ágoston, István/AAS-1564-2020; Boncz, Imre/A-8940-2013","Sebestyen, Andor/0000-0002-4078-5477; Boncz, Imre/0000-0003-3699-6236",,,,,14,30,30,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We measured subjective expectations regarding treatment effects of biologicals as well as future length and quality of life. Moreover, we compared expectations regarding treatment effects to actual treatment effects. We recruited a sample of Hungarian RA patients initiating treatment with biologicals. Expectations regarding treatment effects and future health were obtained through a written questionnaire from patients and physicians, including functional impairment (HAQ-DI), health status (EQ-5D) and disease activity (DAS28). After three months, actual treatment effects were obtained. Ninety-two RA patients (females N = 81, 88 %) with mean age of 51 (SD 12) and disease duration of 9 (SD 8) years with high average disease activity (DAS28:6.1) were included. Patients expected significant and large health improvement within three months with mean changes on the HAQ-DI of -0.8 and on the EQ-5D of +0.4. Rheumatologists' estimates were similar, and they expected significant decrease of 2.3 on the DAS28. Actual scores after three months were obtained for 77 patients. The measured scores were significantly lower than expected scores for the HAQ-DI and EQ-5D. Rheumatologists' expectations for the DAS28 score were not significantly different from measured scores. Patients' average expectations regarding quality of life scores for ages 60, 70, 80 and 90 were 0.44, 0.24, 0.06 and -0.02, respectively. Our results suggest that both RA patients and rheumatologists expect quick and significant health improvements from biological drugs and tend to overestimate actual short term treatment effects. Nonetheless, RA patients expect a sharp deterioration of future health.","[Pentek, Marta; Gulacsi, Laszlo; Brodszky, Valentin] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Pentek, Marta] Flor Ferenc Cty Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, H-2143 Kistarcsa, Hungary; [Rojkovich, Bernadette] Polyclin Hosp Bros St John God Budapest, Dept Rheumatol 2, H-1023 Budapest, Hungary; [van Exel, Job; Brouwer, Werner B.

This indicated that if certain criteria are met, it may be appropriate to recommend the use of such treatments even if they would not normally be considered cost-effective. However, NICE's public consultation revealed concerns that there is little scientific evidence to support such a policy. This study examines whether there is public support for giving higher priority to life-extending, end-of-life treatments than to other types of treatment. In face-to-face interviews, respondents answered six questions asking them to choose which of two hypothetical patients they would prefer to treat, assuming that the health service has enough funds to treat one but not both of them. The various scenarios were designed so as to control for age- and time-related preferences. Fifty members of the general public in England were interviewed in July 2011. We find some evidence of support for giving priority to the patient with shorter remaining life expectancy, but note that a nontrivial minority of respondents expressed the opposite preference. Substantial preference for quality-of-life improvement over life extension was observed. Very few respondents expressed indifference or unwillingness to choose between the patients. Whilst there cannot be described to be a single 'consensus' set of preferences, we conclude that there are ways in which the results suggest that the current NICE policy may be insufficient.","[Shah, Koonal K.] Off Hlth Econ, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Shah, Koonal K.; Tsuchiya, Aki; Wailoo, Allan J.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Shah, KK (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, 7th Floor Southside,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England.",kshah@ohe.org; a.tsuchiya@sheffield.ac.uk; a.j.wailoo@sheffield.ac.uk,"Tsuchiya, Aki/A-2167-2010; Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617",,,,,23,40,40,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Small-molecule generic and originator drug products are expected to be chemically identical. Their pharmaceutical similarity can be typically assessed by simple regulatory criteria such as the expectation that the 90 % confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means of some pharmacokinetic parameters be between 0.80 and 1.25. When such criteria are satisfied, the drug products are generally considered to exhibit therapeutic equivalence. They are then usually interchanged freely within individual patients. Biological drugs are complex proteins, for instance, because of their large size, intricate structure, sensitivity to environmental conditions, difficult manufacturing procedures, and the possibility of immunogenicity. Generic and brand-name biologic products can be expected to show only similarity but not identity in their various features and clinical effects. Consequently, the determination of biosimilarity is also a complicated process which involves assessment of the totality of the evidence for the close similarity of the two products. Moreover, even when biosimilarity has been established, it may not be assumed that the two biosimilar products can be automatically substituted by pharmacists. This generally requires additional, careful considerations. Without declaring interchangeability, a new product could be prescribed, i.e. it is prescribable. However, two products can be automatically substituted only if they are interchangeable. Interchangeability is a statistical term and it means that products can be used in any order in the same patient without considering the treatment history. The concepts of interchangeability and prescribability have been widely discussed in the past but only in relation to small molecule generics. In this paper we apply these concepts to biosimilars and we discuss: definitions of prescribability and interchangeability and their statistical implementation; the relation between bioequivalence and interchangeability for small-molecule drug products; regulatory requirements and expectations of biosimilar products in various jurisdictions; possible statistical approaches to establish the similarity and interchangeability of biologic drug products; definition of other technical terms such as switchability and automatic substitution. The paper will be concluded with a discussion of the anticipated future use of interchangeability of biological drug products.","[Tothfalusi, Laszlo] Semmelweis Univ, Dept Pharmacodynam, H-1445 Budapest, Hungary; [Endrenyi, Laszlo] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Chow, Shein-Chung] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27710 USA",Semmelweis University; University of Toronto; Duke University,"Tóthfalusi, L (通讯作者)，Semmelweis Univ, Dept Pharmacodynam, POB 370, H-1445 Budapest, Hungary.",tothfalusi.laszlo@pharma.semmelweis-univ.hu,,,,,,,24,31,34,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The main determinants of market income inequality are (in order of size of the effect) family structure (single mother households), union density, deindustrialization, unemployment, employment levels and education spending.

An analysis of regional spending differentials in Italy,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Government; Expenditure; Health; Regional inequalities,PRODUCTION FRONTIERS; PANEL-DATA; EXPENDITURES; QUALITY,"This work aims at identifying the determinants of health spending differentials among Italian regions and at highlighting potential margins for savings. The analysis exploits a data set for the 21 Italian regions and autonomous provinces starting in the early 1990s and ending in 2006. After controlling for standard healthcare demand indicators, remaining spending differentials are found to be significant, and they appear to be associated with differences in the degree of appropriateness of treatments, health sector supply structure and social capital indicators. In general, higher regional expenditure does not appear to be associated with better reported or perceived quality in health services. In the regions that display poorer performances, inefficiencies appear not to be uniformly distributed among expenditure items. Overall, results suggest that savings could be achieved without reducing the amount of services provided to citizens. This seems particularly important given the expected rise in spending associated with the forecasted demographic developments.","[Francese, Maura; Romanelli, Marzia] Res & Int Relat, I-00184 Rome, Italy",,"Francese, M (通讯作者)，Res & Int Relat, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",maura.francese@bancaditalia.it; marzia.romanelli@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,35,9,9,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We analyze the way interbank rates are transmitted to the bank retail rates, and we test the symmetry hypothesis. A disaggregated general-to-specific model is applied for estimating interest rate pass-through and examining whether retail rates respond symmetrically or asymmetrically to upward/downward interbank rate changes. Overall, our empirics show evidence of sluggish and incomplete pass-through from market rates to bank loan and deposit rates.

Key to differentiation of service sector, including educational institutions, as opposed to other sectors lies in two basic characteristics of services such as intangibility and inseparability of production and consumption. It is these characteristics that emphasize the importance of human potentials as a key competitive determinant. People, their knowledge and competencies are becoming bearers of differentiation of businesses and a key component for earning profits in the current market environment. The process of career management is one of written procedures that support the process of human resources management in the organization, and therefore it is one of quality documents that can influence the conversion of human potentials to human capital. The fact is that career management can be clearly identified and documented only in those organizations that have implemented a quality management system in accordance with the requirements of international standard ISO 9001. Perceived quality of service in higher education has a positive impact on student progress and development. Thus the aim of paper is to show that relationship between students and faculty have a significant impact on dimensions of quality, which implies satisfaction of students, and thereby their loyalty. Special emphasis is placed on examination of relationship between perceived quality of service of higher education institutions and student results.

The article uses two different conceptualisations of performativity to analyse what the model's segmentations do: Hacking's notion of making up people and MacKenzie's idea of performativity. Based on these two approaches, the article demonstrates that the segmentation model represents and performs the businesses as it makes up certain new ways to be a business and as the businesses can be seen as moving targets. Inspired by MacKenzie the argument is that the segmentation model embodies cleverness in that it simultaneously alters what it represents and then represents this altered reality to confirm the accuracy of its own model of the businesses' postures. Despite the cleverness of the model, it also has a blind spot. The model assumes a world wherein everything around it is in motion and can be shaped, however, it sees itself as stable. This assumption turns out to be problematic as the tax administration questions the model's ability to produce valid comparisons. The article presents a detailed analysis of the model's performativity, providing an example of a performativity study whose methodology differs from the methodological criteria set up by MacKenzie.","[Boll, Karen] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Boll, K (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Copenhagen, Denmark.",kbo.ioa@cbs.dk,"Boll, Karen/ABG-1655-2021","Boll, Karen/0000-0001-9497-4372",Danish Tax and Customs Administration,Danish Tax and Customs Administration,Research for this article was partly funded by the Danish Tax and Customs Administration.

The purposes of the present paper are to analyse the trends of the ASEAN's inward FDI between 1990 and present, by identifying the factors that have encouraged or discouraged these flows in the context of the two crises, and to estimate the possible future evolution of these investments.

Beyond knowledge of basic managerial principless, managers must possess informations related to financial aspect of functioning in public sector's institutions. Within this task, budgetary accounting and both areas of its realization have essential role. The existence of two areas in budgetary accounting realization requires universal approach to financial reporting and analysis for the needs of different users of financial statements' informations. External financial statements are focused to datas obliged through legal and professional regulative of budgetary accounting, but for their further analytic explanation is necessary to compose and work out auxiliary, internaly conceptualized statements. The statements of financial budgetary accounting provide synthetised informations and global approach to datas on business activities of educational institutions as budgetary users. On the other hand, the statements of managerial budgetary accounting offer a detailed picture and analytic developed survey of educational institution's business, allowing overview of all economic aspects which are not displayed in official financial statements. The bond between business decision-making and financial accounting is present in everyday economic life. Yet, the bond between managerial accounting and business decision-making is especially vivid, when management have to make adequate business decisions based on disposable datas and informations. Managerial accounting application in function of decision-making in educational institutions is narrowly related to applied basis of budgetary accounting. The best effects are provided through implementation of accrual basis of budgetary accounting. In this paper are gradualy described fundamental characteristics of budgetary accounting realization area and fundamental characteristics of managerial accounting. Special attention is dedicated to business decision-making and relationship between business decision-making elements and managerial accounting, whose ultimate goal is enlarged quality of financial statements in function of better decision-making in educational institutions.","[Ljiljana, Rakic; Radivoje, Stojkovic] Gymnasium Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj, Zlatne Grede 4, Novi Sad, Serbia",,"Ljiljana, R (通讯作者)，Gymnasium Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj, Zlatne Grede 4, Novi Sad, Serbia.",finansije@jjzmaj.edu.rs; direktor@jjzmaj.edu.rs,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,475,483,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000046,0

Design/methodology/approach - The paper has a three-part structure. First, the paper describes the published works. Second, it examines the topics dealt with in the literature. Third, the review identifies the limitations of the literature and outlines future lines of research for this field. Findings - Most papers that deal with ERM and entrepreneurship together are empirical. The underlying premise of enterprise risk management is that every entity exists to provide value for its stakeholders Enterprise risk management enables management to effectively deal with uncertainty and associated risk and opportunity, enhancing the capacity to build value.

Specifically, the survey adds to our understanding of the functioning of recycled paper markets, points towards some important policy lessons, and identifies gaps in the economic literature on recycled paper market behavior. The analysis builds on the scope, methodology and data used by 21 previous studies, which all estimate the own-price elasticities of recycled paper demand and/or supply. One key finding is that the own-price elasticity of recycled paper supply is positive but low (around 020-0.30). This helps explain the often high price volatility in recycled paper markets, and carries important implications for the impacts of, and the choice between, price- and quantity-based waste management policies. Finally, the analysis also suggests that future research should devote increased attention to different non-environmental market imperfections (e.g., market power, information asymmetries) that could discourage the uptake of recycled materials in the market place. A stronger research focus on recycled paper use in developing countries, not the least China, is also needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study modeled forest management strategies that balance economic gains and biodiversity conservation benefits in planted tropical forests. A forest-level model was developed that maximized the net present value (NPV) from selling timber and carbon sequestration while maintaining a given level of biodiversity (as per the population density of birds). The model was applied to Eucalyptus urophylla planted forests in Yen Bai Province, Vietnam. It was found that the inclusion of biodiversity conservation in the model induces a longer optimal rotation age compared to the period that maximizes the joint value from timber and carbon sequestration (from 8 to 10.9 years). The average NPV when considering timber values plus carbon sequestration was 13 million Vietnamese Dong (VND) ha(-1) (765 USD ha(-1)), and timber, carbon sequestration and biodiversity values were 11 million VND (676 USD) ha(-1). Given this differential, governments in such tropical countries may need to consider additional incentives to forest owners if they are to encourage maximizing biodiversity and its associated benefits. The results also have some implications for implementing the climate control measure of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation-plus (REDD+) in developing countries, i.e., payment for carbon sequestration and biodiversity benefits in planted forests.

Efficient used, this tool can bring a lot of benefits to the companies. But it is not enough for a brand to create large communities around it, it is also important to develop these communities and to create a close and continuous relationships with their members. The promotional techniques can be a proper tool for this and contests are a popular method to raise the interest among the consumers. Keeping in mind that without a good message, the consumers will not get involved, it is important to know what stimulates and attracts their interest to participate in contests. Thus we will observe on an AIDAT model how important is each of the stimulants transmitted by the companies in each phase of the communication process. This article presents an analysis of the AIDAT model based on a comparative review of three promotional contests held on the official Facebook pages of different companies.

The analysis is based on panel data estimations on a sample of 20 companies, observed during three years (2009-2011). Traditional explanatory variables are adopted in the study, including profitability, company size, tangibility of assets, liquidity and asset turnover. By employing the ordinary least squares method and the fixed effects model, simple and multiple linear regressions are obtained. These are further selected and interpreted in order to determine the influence of the independent variables upon the leverage of a company. The results show that profitability and liquidity ratios are negatively affecting the total debt ratio of Romanian companies. The tangibility of assets is also having a negative impact on leverage, strengthening the findings of previous empirical studies which claim that this indicator moves in opposite direction with the debt ratio of companies located in developing countries. On the other hand, the size of a company and its asset turnover have a positive correlation with leverage. The explanatory variable which has the highest impact on the capital structure choices is profitability. (C) 2014 The Authors.

However, forest resource co-management is currently in a practice and exploration stage. This research compares two contradicting research cases that have the same physical environment and management institutions to further understand co-management mechanisms and practical operations. By linking Ostrom's eight design principles with the actor-centered power theory, this research attempts to explain the success and failure of co-management from institutional arrangement and power theory research perspectives. Based on a series of research surveys, our research shows that the success or failure of forest resource co-management depends not only on the soundness of the co-management institution itself (from the power theory point of view) but also on whether the co-management institution can obtain support from local power actors. More specifically, the success or failure of forest resource co-management depends on whether co-management mechanisms can meet the interests of the local power actors, which are a key factor for deciding the co-management implementation success.

As a result, the information needs of land managers must now include social and cultural values. In addition, the public's interest in having greater participation in land management decisions and in generating scientific knowledge has never been greater. The generation of scientific knowledge which is expressed primarily through conventional means - such as peer-reviewed publications targeting academics and technology transfer (e.g., patents, licenses, agreements) primarily for government and industry - does not always satisfy the needs of resource managers and public. In recent decades, there has been rapid growth of methods to help bridge this gap by better connecting new knowledge and knowledge generation with public needs. The U.S. Forest Service is making science delivery as important goal as science creation, including structural institutional changes at the interface among researchers, resource managers, and the public, allocating an appropriate portion of project funding specifically for delivery. The Forest Service is considering increasing its use of citizen science and participatory research - which brings resource managers, decision makers, and the public into the research process to varying extents - as part of the agency's science delivery efforts. Here we explore citizen science and participatory research as possible vehicles to augment existing science delivery efforts from the perspective of a federal land management agency. We found that these mechanisms facilitate public involvement in fundamentally different ways. Depending on the type of research and desired use of research outcomes, either citizen science or participatory research could enhance the use of science in some natural resource management discussions, possibly leading to supportable solutions.

In addition, college-by-course fixed effects controlled for within- and between-course selection bias. Analyses yield robust negative estimates for online learning in terms of both course persistence and course grade, contradicting the notion that there is no significant difference between online and face-to-face student outcomes at least within the community college setting.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the regulatory policies on the efficiency of different-sized commercial banks in the Turkish banking sector during the period 2002-10. We implement a new approach in data envelopment analysis (DEA) that integrates lending quality and apply it to bank efficiency analysis. DEA is used to assess the long-term performance trend in the context of balance sheet and revenue approaches. Empirical results indicate that regulatory policies have a positive effect on the efficiency of banks. Large-and medium-size banks outperform medium-large and small banks. The notable finding is that the efficiency scores are much lower, and the global crisis more apparent, when nonperforming loans are integrated into the DEA Model.","[Ozkan-Gunay, E.

This article examines studies of firms innovative competencies within the comparative capitalisms (CC) literature. This research provides theoretically sophisticated assessments of firms innovative capabilities in different countries. It takes into consideration a range of institutional areas, such as corporate governance and labour market regimes. However, CC studies differ significantly along three key analytical dimensions. First, some studies focus more extensively on firms and firms objectives than others. Second, research examines institutions at the macro, meso and micro levels to varying degrees. Finally, studies adopt different assumptions on the variability and dynamism of a firms institutional setting; such variability can include the importance of foreign institutional resources to firms innovative capabilities. Future CC research should pay greater attention to theorizing firms innovation-related requirements and detailing their specific institutional settings, including their access to domestic and foreign institutional resources. Concepts and insights from the wider innovation and international business literatures can help achieve these objectives. By drawing on these related fields, CC studies of innovative capabilities will be able to assess in theoretically robust ways the challenges that internationalization and what this article calls institutional outsourcing pose for analysts and firms.","Manchester Business Sch, Ctr Comparat & Int Business Res, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Allen, MMC (通讯作者)，Manchester Business Sch, Ctr Comparat & Int Business Res, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",Matthew.allen@mbs.ac.uk,"Allen, Matthew M.

This burden is shared between national payers and hospitals that support additional bed days for patients diagnosed with CDI while in hospital or patients re-admitted from a previous hospitalisation. This study was performed to quantify additional hospital stay attributable to CDI in four countries, England, Germany, Spain, and The Netherlands, by analysing nationwide hospital-episode data. We focused upon patients at increased risk of CDI: with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, and aged 50 years or over. Multivariate regression and propensity score matching models were developed to investigate the impact of CDI on additional length of hospital stay, controlling for confounding factors such as underlying disease severity. Patients in England had the longest additional hospital stay attributable to CDI at 16.09 days, followed by Germany at 15.47 days, Spain at 13.56 days, and The Netherlands at 12.58 days, derived using regression analysis. Propensity score matching indicated a higher attributable length of stay of 32.42 days in England, 15.31 days in Spain, and 18.64 days in The Netherlands. Outputs from this study consistently demonstrate that in European countries, for patients whose hospitalisation is complicated by CDI, the infection causes a statistically significant increase in hospital length of stay. This has implications for optimising resource allocation and budget setting at both the national and hospital level to ensure that levels of CDI-complicated hospitalisations are minimised.","[Eckmann, Christian] Hosp Med Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Wasserman, Matthew; Latif, Faisal; Roberts, Graeme] Double Helix Consulting, London, England; [Beriot-Mathiot, Axelle] Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France",,"Latif, F (通讯作者)，Double Helix Consulting, London, England.",Christian.Eckmann@klinikum-peine.de; flatif@dhelixc.co.uk,,"Wasserman, Matthew/0000-0003-3300-2742",,,,,36,30,31,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Effective collaboration between people from different disciplines is necessary to maximize the potential benefits of interdisciplinarity for future research activity. This paper analyses an approach to fostering the skills required for successful cross-disciplinary collaboration from the perspective of an interdisciplinary group of early-career researchers. Our reflection on how specially designed encounters can help to shape future interdisciplinary research initiatives draws on the discussion of a four-day workshop, a post-event survey, and a review of other experiences. We conclude that interdisciplinary encounters are an effective means to support the development of future interdisciplinary researchers, with a major advantage of this approach being the opportunity for open communication. Depending on the organiser's aim, we distinguish between cultivation and development encounters. Among the multiple factors that produce successful interdisciplinary encounters, we found that selection of a theme, participants and location need to be tailored to the encounter's particular objectives. We recommend that funding bodies and other members of the research community should take note of the effectiveness of encounters to foster interdisciplinarity and generate space to develop more innovative and high-impact research that delivers solutions to the challenges facing humanity in the future.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of public policies on antibiotic use in Europe using a differences-in-differences approach. Comparable data on systemic antibiotics administered in 21 European countries are available for a 11-year period between 1997 and 2007. Data on national campaigns are drawn from the public health literature. We estimate an econometric model of antibiotic consumption with country fixed effects and control for the main socioeconomic and epidemiological factors. Lagged values and the instrumental variables approach are applied to address endogeneity aspects of the prevalence of infections and the adoption of national campaigns. We find evidence that public campaigns significantly reduce the use of antimicrobials in the community by 1.3-5.6 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants yearly. This represents an impact of roughly 6.5-28.3 % on the mean level of antibiotic use in Europe between 1997 and 2007. The effect is robust across different measurement methods. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of policy interventions targeting different social groups such as general practitioners or patients.","[Filippini, M.; Ortiz, L. G.

Future images in premodern Korea depended on social and political status. The ruling class had a Confucian utopia based on remote places and the golden age of ancient Chinese regimes. On the other hand, the oppressed, denied the Confucian ideal society, sought a classless society without oppression. In modern Korean society, five alternative images of the future can be identified: (a) becoming a developed country, (b) apocalyptic discourse, (c) national unification, (d) advanced information society, and (e) feminist visions. Unlike the future images from pre-modern Korea, those in Korea's modern era reject the ideal past, imaginary present, and radically different future. Instead, the images focus on a long-term, future-oriented vision and address the various dimensions of the feasible transformation of its current society. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The conflicts in Sweden are found to stem from contradictory concepts concerning property (notably, ownership and the right of public access) and ideological differences in terms of whether forest resources should be regulated by government or governance. While the precise circumstances of this case are somewhat unique to Sweden, differences of opinion concerning property rights and regulations are common and so our findings will be broadly applicable when defining and analyzing forest-related conflicts, especially those involving multiple-use situations.

This article looks at some of the most critical dimensions of business activity, showing, upon the basis of the current research in the field, how the intimate nature of family firms not only contributes to risk and uncertainty reduction, but also acts as a negative element, able to increase the level of turbulence and uncertainty both inside the organization and in its relationships with the external environment.","Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Colli, A (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.",andrea.colli@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,85,24,27,2,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The three Panel reports were hard to reconcile, and this feature in and of itself made the task of the AB quite onerous. Some progress has been made and some clarifications have been introduced, but overall the AB has yet to come to grips with a coherent approach regarding the understanding of the TBT Agreement. The main argument in this paper is that the AB, in designing its test for consistency with the TBT Agreement, did not do any different than it would have done had no TBT Agreement existed. It is, nevertheless, response to the question 'what has the TBT added to the pre-existing legislative arsenal' that should point to the elements that must be included in developing a test of consistency against which disputes coming under the aegis of the TBT Agreement should be discussed. The suggested approach consists of a two-tier test whereby Panels would first inquire into the innate characteristics of a measure coming under the aegis of the TBT Agreement, before asking the question whether it has also been applied in non-discriminatory manner.","EUI, Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Mavroidis, PC (通讯作者)，EUI, Florence, Italy.",petros.mavroidis@UNINE.CH,,,,,,,10,35,38,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2013,12.0,3,,,,,509,531,,10.1017/S1474745613000013,0.0,,,23,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,217BT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324332200003,0

A major focus in recent decades has been the quality of health economic research. In practice, the factors influencing a study design are not limited to the quest for quality. Moreover, the framework of the study is important. This research addresses three major questions related to these framework aspects. First, we want to know whether the design of health economic studies has changed over time. Second, we want to know how the subject of a study, whether it is a process or product innovation, influences the parameters of the study design. Third, one of the most important questions we will answer is whether and how the study's source of funding has an impact on the design of the research. To answer these questions, a total of 234 health economic studies were analyzed using a correspondence analysis and a logistic regression analysis. All three categories of framework factors have an influence on the aspects of the study design. Health economic studies have evolved over time, leading to the use of more advanced methods like complex sensitivity analyses. Additionally, the patient's point of view has increased in importance. The evaluation of product innovations has focused more on utility concepts. On the other hand, the source of funding may influence only a few aspects of the study design, such as the use of evaluation methods, the source of data, and the use of certain utility measures. The most important trends in health care, such as the emphasis on the patients' point of view, become increasingly established in health economic evaluations with the passage of time.

The standard unemployment rate is often criticized for omitting large numbers of people who are classified as employed or as not economically inactive, when in fact their situation amounts to unemployment. The author discusses the limitations of this standard definition for developing countries. After reviewing the methodological and statistical problems posed by the standard rate, he looks at the reality behind the words in contexts where the labour market is highly segmented. He shows that the standard unemployment rate underestimates excess labour supply and is a poor indicator of the Decent Work deficit, and considers its limitations in guiding economic policy.","Rosa Luxemburg Fdn, West African Off, Dakar, Senegal",,"Sylla, NS (通讯作者)，Rosa Luxemburg Fdn, West African Off, Dakar, Senegal.",ndongosylla@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,12,13,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

The European Commission (EC) has proposed regulatory options to respond to this problem, but all risk not being in conformity with World Trade Organization (WTO) law. Trade law challenges result from the underlying methodological uncertainty, and the attempt to address a systemic problem on the level of individual producers.

The main goal of this paper is to analyze the relationship between excess body weight and different dimensions of health-related quality of life for people 16 years and older and to identify the health dimensions most affected by excess weight. We have drawn data from the Catalonia Health Survey (2006). Our results reveal a relationship between excess weight and health-related quality of life. Even after controlling for socio-economic status and objective health variables, excess weight is shown to have a significant negative effect on health-related quality of life. Subjects responses revealed that the negative effect of excess weight was felt the strongest in the health-related quality of life dimensions of mobility and pain/discomfort. Our results indicate there are important differences among gender and age groups. Women and older people are more likely to suffer from the negative consequences of excess weight.","[Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales Toledo Anal, CIBER Salud Publ & Epidemiol CIBERESP, Toledo 45071, Spain; [Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales Toledo Anal, Red Temat Invest Cooperativa Envejecimiento & Fra, Toledo 45071, Spain; [Gil-Lacruz, Ana] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; University of Zaragoza,"Oliva-Moreno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales Toledo Anal, CIBER Salud Publ & Epidemiol CIBERESP, Cobertizo San Pedro Martir S-N, Toledo 45071, Spain.",juan.olivamoreno@uclm.es; anagil@unizar.es,"Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; Lacruz, Ana Isabel Gil/AAI-8302-2021","Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; Lacruz, Ana Isabel Gil/0000-0002-7994-923X",,,,,65,17,19,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

It appears that the most negative impact of stock options in the package is alleviated by inclusion of a rights issue.

We examine how introducing uncertainty to the natural law of resource reproduction affects strategic exploitation. We show that the commons problem is always present in our example and we identify cases in which increases in risk amplify or mitigate the commons problem. For a specific class of games which imply Markov-perfect strategies that are linear in the resource stock (our example belongs to this class), we provide general results on how payoff-function features affect the responsiveness of exploitation strategies to changes in riskiness. These broader characterizations of games which imply linear strategies (appearing in an Online Appendix) can be useful in future work, given the technical difficulties that may arise from the possible nonlinearity of Markov-perfect strategies in more general settings.

Furthermore, this work presents the first results from a long-term measurement of the concentration of major pollutants in surface water, which are located in the area of our interest (CHKO Jizera Mountains). Six specials probes were prepared and placed in this area. These probes contained AER (AER - Anion Exchange Resin, Type A520E - Macroporous Strong Base Anion Exchange Resin with total capacity 0.9 eq/l), which were placed into special pockets. Each probe contained one pocket. This pocket was monthly changed. After the exchange, the concentration of nitrates and phosphates was determined. For the quantification of nitrates and phosphates trapped by the resin, the AER was dried at room temperature. Captured nitrates and phosphates were extracted from resin using 100 ml of 1.7 M NaCl. Released nitrates were determined by distillation and titration method. Released phosphates were determined by spectrophotometric method (Hach Lange No. 8048 in accordance with USEPA). Based on the findings, we can conclude that the application of AER to plastic probes is suitable for a quick and inexpensive measurement of the concentration of nitrates and phosphates in surface water. Moreover, differences in concentration of nitrates and phosphates were measured between individual probes. Concentration of these pollutants was significantly higher in watercourses that flowed through the villages than in water courses that flowed across the open country.","[Foltynova, A.; Elbl, J.; Zakoutska, K.; Zahora, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Foltynová, A (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jakub.elbl@mendelu.cz,"Elbl, Jakub/I-5056-2018; Záhora, Jaroslav/L-6534-2018","Elbl, Jakub/0000-0001-6401-1516;",,,,,5,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,291,295,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800050,0

Yields of the dry matter increased along with increasing amounts of nutrients supplied and ranged from 3.8 t.ha(-1) (non-fertilized) to 9.1 t.ha(-1) (N180PK). With respect to the exploitation intensity, highest yields were attained under two-cut management (6.8 t.ha(-1) in extensive and 6.3 t.ha(-1) in low-intensive variant) compared to three- and four-cut variants (both 6.1 t.ha(-1)). Concerning qualitative parameters of forage, exploitation intensity affected significantly concentration of NEL, crude protein and fibre. The highest concentration of NEL was in 4-cut (5.44 MJ.kg(-1)), crude protein in 4-cut (155.7 g.kg(-1)) and fibre in 2-cut late (269.8 g.kg(-1)).

All countries show a negative linear relationship between tested indicators however not always statistically significant. Based on these results, the existence of correlation is evident between the crude rate of net migration and the unemployment rate in more than a half of the monitored countries. Calculated correlation indices show highly statistically significant results for typically immigrant's destination countries, e. g. Germany, United Kingdom and Belgium but we can find statistically significant results also in countries which are facing enormous economic problems during the last financial and economic crisis, esp. in Ireland and Spain. With an exemption of Belgium, the selected type of regression function doesn't play a role as it regards the statistical significance of correlation indices and the use of polynomials of higher degrees doesn't improve those results significantly.

The research based on molecular methods with the use of PCR deals with detection of the allelic composition of Glu-1 loci of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and presence or absence verification of secalin locus (Sec-1). For our research 8 wheat genotypes with blue aleurone and one genotype with white grain were used. At the respective loci these subunits and their combinations were identified: Glu-A1 (Ax1, Ax2*, AxNull), Glu-B1 (Bx7+By8*, Bx7*+By8, Bx7*+By20*, Bx7+By20*, Bx6+By20*), Glu-D1 (Dx5+Dy10). Subunits Ax1, Ax2* and allelic combination Dx5+Dy10 are considered as markers of good bread-making quality. The presence of allele Glu-D1d which is a marker of good bread-making grain quality was proved in genetic resources with blue aleurone UC66049, Skorpion (RU 440-6) and RU 440-5 and they are therefore considered as perspective.

From Islamic perspectives, ethics oversees all aspects of life. Islam places the highest importance on ethical values and principles in all aspects of human life. Ethical norms and moral codes evident from the verses of the Qur'an and Sunnah are numerous and comprehensive (Khan, 2009). Since the awareness and demand for investing in accordance to Islamic principle is increasing, the number of Shari'ah Compliant companies in Malaysia has increased tremendously over the years. Shari'ah Compliant companies are seen to incorporate Islamic ethical identity, thus the organization should depict the true Islamic Values of corporate strategy, structure, communication and culture embracing both tangible and intangible elements that make them distinctive. Thus this study is trying to assess the extent of Corporate Ethical Identity (CEI) that are being embraced by these Shari'ah compliant companies via company's annual report. The CEI checklist was developed and sent to experts (auditors and academia) to verify all the selected items. Initially, the checklist consists of 88 items, and after taking into consideration the experts' opinions (academia and practitioners), the final checklist with 83 items has been established. Content analysis was used in order to construct the CEI Index. The unit of analysis for this study is the annual report of 153 Shari'ah Compliant public listed companies on Main Board companies of Bursa Malaysia for the year ended 2009. The findings of the study show that the level of CEI of selected companies is lower with the average of below 25 per cent. Furthermore, this study adds to prior related studies on corporate identity that focused mainly on Islamic perspectives. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Increased erosion is caused primarily by changing in the value of the R factor and changing the calculation of the factor L and S. Also changed the allowable soil loss associated with soil depth. Original permissible soil loss 10 t*ha(-1)*year(-1) was preserved, but the new methodology recommended to protect valuable land use permissible soil loss as soils moderately deep (4 t*ha(-1)*year(-1)). Therefore, increase the representation of degree of erosion hazard 4. According to the results show that the new method is required to use effective erosion control measures to reduce erosion on erosion hazard level 1. Question remains whether it is not only artificial increase erosion and whether it is really active step to protect soil.","[Simeckova, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Simeckova, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",28303@node.mendelu.cz,"Šimečková, Jana/L-1396-2018","Šimečková, Jana/0000-0002-7493-7141",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,379,383,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800066,0

Hypothesis had been tested on experimental animals (Rattus norvegicus) that were fed with a standard feeding mixture, with the addition of 3 % fish oil (salmon oil). The expression of the gene Insig-1 in animals livers that had been fed with the feed with the additon of salmon oil was 730 % (P < 0.05) compared to the control. However, on the contrary to the hypothesis, the expression of the gene HMG-CoA-R was 165 % (P > 0.05) and the expression of the gene for LDL-R was 210 % (P > 0.05) compared to the control. Nevertheless, it was proved (P < 0.05) that the fish oil used for the diet of the experimental rats decreased the plasma cholesterol by 10 % (from the initial value 1.19 mmol.l(-1) to the finally value 1.07 mmol.l(-1)).

Yet very little is known about how family forest landowners view programs that enable them to sell carbon credits generated from the growth of their forest and the compensation that would be required to encourage a meaningful level of participation. To address this information gap, we conducted a study to identify and quantify family forest landowner interest in participating in a voluntary carbon market trading program in the Lake States, USA. A mail survey was administered to 2,200 randomly selected family forest owners in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. The questionnaire assessed landowner interest in participating in a hypothetical carbon credit trading program and sought information on landowner objectives and practices, perspectives on carbon credit programs and forest land characteristics. A total of 850 usable responses were received. A logistic regression model was developed to examine the factors affecting participation in a forest carbon offset project by family forest owners and estimate landowner participation probability. Results show that carbon program characteristics alongside landowner and parcel characteristics are associated with the decision to participate in a carbon credit program. Specifically, carbon credit payment amount, contract length, gender, value placed on other non-market forest amenities, need for additional income, attitude towards climate change, absentee status, land tenure and total acres owned were found to be significant determinants. Our findings indicate that carbon sequestration management may align with the ownership goals of many family forest owners in the Lake States. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A rhizome is defined here as a community of users that connect with no central point of origination. With appropriate technology, rhizomes will provide connectivity amongst users that will enable them to trade products, knowledge and media without the need for a hegemonic state. This paper advances two futures scenarios that discuss two possible reactions by future hegemonic states to the technology enabled rhizome. One scenario is dystopian, with control of the rhizome and the user as the primary goal. The second scenario is more utopian, discussing future hegemonic adaptation and acceptance of the rhizome as an integral part of society and policy construction.

The authors of this article discuss a simple intertemporal framework, based on modern open-economy macroeconomic models, that emphasizes the significance of valuation effects arising from changes in asset prices and exchange rates.

We consider four policies that could be combined with unilateral emissions pricing to counter effects on international competitiveness: a border charge on imports, a border rebate for exports, full border adjustment, and domestic output-based rebating. Each option faces different potential legal hurdles in international trade law: each also has different economic impacts. While all can support competitiveness, none is necessarily effective at reducing global emissions. Nor is it possible to rank order the options: effectiveness depends on the relative emissions rates, elasticities of substitution, and consumption volumes. We illustrate these results with simulations for the energy-intensive sectors of three different economies, the United States, Canada and Europe. Although most controversial, full border adjustment is usually most effective, but output-based rebating for key manufacturing sectors can achieve many of the gains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Some comments on the contribution of socialist models and Cuban agroecology,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CHALLENGES; GROWTH,"While degrowth is about reducing energy and material flows in the economy while sustaining basic human needs, capitalism fosters the opposite trend. How then is degrowth to be implemented on a large scale? In line with different critical intellectual traditions, we argue that degrowth is unlikely to occur within an economy based on capital accumulation and free market of assets. Our objective is then to preliminarily investigate the links between economic structures, democratic principles, and degrowth. We do this, firstly, by briefly exploring some of the main theoretical models of economic democracy in order to find out their potential for achieving sustainable degrowth. In our view, models of self-managed socialism have the best potential for this. Secondly, we intend to learn some empirical lessons from a countrywide experience: Cuban agroecology, today's largest real-life experience of agroecological degrowth. Our hypothesis is that the Cuban economy, which limits the private accumulation of capital and of productive assets, is in a better position for achieving forms of sustainable degrowth than capitalist economies, but that it would be even more so with more democracy. The Cuban agricultural system faces the challenge to free itself from the central planning tradition. This could be achieved by following the current process of giving increasing autonomy to small producers. Specifically, we argue that small-scale farmer cooperatives have the best potential for achieving the degrowth-oriented goals of agroecology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Deriu, M",,,,"Deriu, Marco",,,Democracies with a future: Degrowth and the democratic tradition,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The interrogation of a possible connection between degrowth and democracy inspires some questions of political epistemology. Is degrowth a socio-economic project which can be simply proposed as an issue and a goal in the democratic representative system, without discussing forms and processes of the political institutions themselves? Is the degrowth perspective fully compatible with the democratic theories and practices as we currently know them? The perspective of degrowth allows a radical enlightenment of the blind spots of really existing democracies but also of the democratic theory. From a factual point of view, we need to acknowledge the existence of an historical connection between economic and political freedoms, since the claim for the autonomy of business has historically been a way to guarantee freedoms and civil rights to citizens, against the tyranny of the central political and religious authorities. Nevertheless, in the current configuration of market societies, the centre of the real power has largely moved from the political and institutional sphere to the economic one. Today the re-foundation of a democratic freedom and of new civil rights should be affirmed against a more and more pervasive economic tyranny. On this basis, a democratic re-foundation in the perspective of degrowth - which includes ecological, social and anthropological challenges - might be imagined. The second part of this paper will be devoted to the formulation of hypotheses about which foundations might be imagined for a radical reform of the democratic theory and institutions, building on degrowth perspective. From the point of view of the political system, degrowth represents a new cleavage if confronted with the historical ones on which classical democracies have been structured. From the point of view of the political organization, degrowth clashes with the traditional competitive electoral models: so I will illustrate some perspectives for a possible reconstruction. From the point of view of a theoretical and institutional re-foundation of democratic regimes, degrowth calls for a philosophical acknowledgement of ecological and social limits, in terms of the institution of a new socio-environmental public sphere which can lead to new constituent processes and to the invention of new deliberative arenas, accordingly introducing different space and time criteria, if compared to the ones we are used to.

This paper contrasts GATT terminology with the definitions frequently found in the literature and describes the multilateral tools that were used in the past to identify NTBs. The latter includes an overview of inventories based on 'reverse' notifications and, more recently, the 'specific trade concerns' raised in WTO Committees.

It concludes that agricultural and non-agricultural products face very different NTBs, and observes that while disputes involving agricultural products are increasingly about 'behind-the-border' NTBs, those involving non-agricultural or mixed products are not.

The key conclusions to be drawn are that while a clear theoretical foundation exists for the hypothesis of 'standards as barriers' to trade, and the likely benefits of aid for trade programs, this is not the case for the hypothesis of 'barriers as a catalyst' for trade, pointing to the need for further research on the latter hypothesis.","Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Sheldon, I (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",sheldon.1@osu.edu,,,,,,,27,21,23,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2012,11.0,3,,,,,376,389,,10.1017/S1474745612000249,0.0,,,14,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,984TR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307215500003,0

This study analyzed for a sample of Belgian individual prescription data for 4 clusters of commonly used drugs (proton pump inhibitors, statins and two groups of antihypertensives [drugs acting on renin-angiotensin system and dihydropyridine derivatives]) whether the probability to receive the least expensive molecule within a cluster was linked to the socioeconomic status of the patient. Logistic regression models included individual demographic, working, chronic illness and financial status and small area education data for 906,543 prescriptions from 1,280 prescribing general practitioners and specialists. For the 4 clusters, results show that patients with lower socioeconomic status consistently use slightly more the least expensive drugs than other patients. Larger effects are observed for patients residing in a nursing home for the elderly, patients entitled to increased reimbursement of co-payments, unemployed, patients treated in a primary care center financed per capita (and not fee-for-service) and patients having a chronic illness. Also, patients residing in neighborhoods with low education status use more less expensive drugs. The findings of the study suggest that although equity considerations were not explicitly taken into account in the design of the reference price system, there is no real equity problem, as the costly drugs with supplement are not prescribed more often in patients from lower socioeconomic classes.","[Vrijens, France; Van de Voorde, Carine; Farfan-Portet, Maria-Isabel] Belgian Hlth Care Knowledge Ctr KCE, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Vander Stichele, Robert] Univ Ghent, Heymans Inst Pharmacol, Sch Med, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Farfan-Portet, MI (通讯作者)，Belgian Hlth Care Knowledge Ctr KCE, Blvd Jardin Bot 55, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",maria.farfan@kce.fgov.be,"Vander Stichele, Robert/K-7203-2015","Vander Stichele, Robert/0000-0001-9118-9651; Vrijens, France/0000-0002-8744-6499",,,,,17,14,14,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In the best classic liberalist tradition, it was the Chinese government that nurtured a sense of economic harmony. This paper shows that a mutually beneficial partnership has not emerged. Departing from a detailed six-digit commodity export dataset, it demonstrates that the division of labour has blurred. Furthermore, Europe's growing deficits on the current account balance were not offset by inflows on the financial account. All these are symptomatic for the twin distortions that have developed in China and Europe, twin distortions that now require difficult twin adjustments. However, while both sides preach the need for rebalancing, they tend to persist in unsustainable policies, which will still most likely lead to panic and protectionism. In that regard, the Sino-European relations reveal compellingly that politically induced imbalances cause havoc in international trade relations, even if there were no initial intentions to harm other countries' economic interests, and that the optimist narratives of harmony of economic interests cannot be trusted, as long as they are not matched by free markets.","Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels Inst Contemporary China Studies, Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Holslag, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels Inst Contemporary China Studies, Brussels, Belgium.",jholslag@vub.ac.be,,,,,,,27,5,5,0,9,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In specific circumstances, reforestation will improve water quality, to the extent that previously unusable water can be utilised. Such is the case with salinisation, a process that threatens up to 17 million hectares of Australian farmland, major fresh water resources, biodiversity and built infrastructure. This paper highlights the value of bundling payments for environmental services (PES) from watershed restoration, including water quality improvement and carbon sequestration coupled with wood production, and compares the net returns with the existing agricultural land-use, using as an example the 408000 ha Warren-Tone watershed (WT) in south-western Australia. The externalities of different land use systems are also taken into account. In this watershed 105000 ha of the land was cleared for agriculture, with 25 000 ha subsequently reforested. A hydrological model (LUCICAT) was used to define the relationships between reforestation/deforestation and water yield and quality, thus providing a basis for valuing the hydrological benefits of reforestation. Various land-use change scenarios were examined, with modelling indicating more than 70% reforestation is required to restore stream salinity to a potable threshold of 500 mg/L total dissolved salts (TDS). Options that involve traditional agricultural land-uses or perennial pastures will not deliver potable water. A hydrological-land-use-economic (HLE) model was constructed, allowing the costs and benefits of different land-uses to be examined at watershed and sub-watershed scales. Reforestation was unprofitable when only wood revenues were considered with a discount rate of 9.5%, but was profitable at lower discount rates or with a discount rate of 9.5% and carbon prices of at least $22 t CO2-e. For the latter, reforestation activities driven by the economic benefits from selling wood and carbon, generate an externality benefit in the form of improved water quality without the need for any additional payment to landholders. Payments for activities that lead to improvements in water quality could represent a new, additional source of income for landholders on the proviso that there is sufficient reforestation to reach the potable threshold. Alternatively, costs could be imposed on those whose land-use practices cause the release of salt into waterways. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Harper, R. J.; Cook, S.

The paper proposes a typology of social capital effects on behaviour relevant to health policy, including a dimension of interpersonal transactions in which strict adherence to a duty to others may be overcome by a measure of selfishness. The paper examines the concept of physician-induced demand through this lens, hypothesizing that regions with low social capital will have a higher intensity of health care resource utilization. A series of regressions employing indicators of intensity is presented to illustrate a likely link between social capital and utilization. The paper concludes that, while other effects of social capital may explain geographic variations, there appears to be enough circumstantial evidence of opportunistic behaviour by physicians to justify consideration of more rigorous physician payment policies in the US Medicare programme.","Penn State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Harrisburg, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Williams, J (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Harrisburg, PA USA.",jwilli28@hotmail.com,,,,,,,57,8,9,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The practice is influenced by a host of factors such as personal, social, economic, institutional, and physical. In this study, age of the respondent, primary occupation, annual per capita income, present area under cultivation, common practice of slash and burn agriculture in the locality, farmers' perceptions, and access to credit are found to have statistically significant impact on the adoption of slash and burn agriculture. The findings throw some light to combat slash and burn agriculture in the region. They suggest for proactive role of government departments. NGOs, self-help group, etc., to reduce slash and burn agriculture. Resource endowment is also an important concern and policy makers should emphasise on extending institutional support to the farmers to reduce such practices in the region. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The Declining Earnings Position of Cleaners in Australia,ECONOMIC AND LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cleaners; income disparity; networked economy; outsourcing; precarious work; privatisation and decentralisation; vulnerable; low-paid workers,WORK; HEALTH; LABOR,"Neoliberal policies of industrial relations decentralisation and privatisation have transformed the economic landscape of Australia in the last 20 years. The primary objective of these policies has been to enhance wealth and prosperity by improving productivity and flexibility of the workforce and competition and accountability in the market. Yet the evidence suggests that precarious workers are not benefiting from this increased prosperity, indeed they suffer by comparison with all other workers. Cleaners are a subset of precarious workers who have been hard hit by the dual impacts of labour market decentralisation and privatisation. This study finds quantitative evidence of an increasing gap in earnings between cleaners and other workers in Australia since the onset of workplace relations decentralisation and the proliferation of privatisation in the mid 1990s. We locate our argument in recent debates about the nature of variegated neoliberalism, the emergence of the networked economy, and the implications of these developments for the nature of work and employment.","[Holley, Sasha] Univ Sydney, Sch Work & Org Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Rainnie, Al] Curtin Univ Technol, Grad Sch Business, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",University of Sydney; Curtin University,"Holley, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Work & Org Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",sasha.holley@sydney.edu.au; al.rainnie@gsb.curtin.edu.au,,"Rainnie, Alistair/0000-0001-6071-4193",,,,,63,11,12,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Recently, after having set clear goals to join the European Union structures, Romania has been compelled to improve social and economic conditions. This process began. on the background of historical inter-regional disparities, mostly due to external factors. For this reason a new division was applied, one that exceeds the territorial-administrative allotment, in order to serve the more pragmatic interests regarding social life improvement. The last century points out a widening of disparities among regions. Given the current conditions the main goal is to reduce discrepancies as much as possible. In this regard regional economic development policies should be applied. There are several options regarding these policies, their application should be done taking into account the characteristics of each region.

Findings - The authors came to a conclusion that banks, which implement the procedure of environmental risk assessment, do it formally, and after the lending decision has been taken, no further monitoring is performed, thus exposing the image and reputation of the bank to the environmental risks. Therefore, it is even more important to determine lending criteria considering the issues of environmental risks and to implement further monitoring of risks until the termination of the lending agreement.

In this article, Ethical Analysis was applied in the assessment of the dynamics and possibilities of conflict resolution related to the expansion of pulpwood plantations in Brazil's Bahia State, particularly near Veracel Celulose. Ethical Analysis as a tool identifies the complex dynamics of contention through identifying bridges and rifts in the social, ecological and economic viewpoints of the main actors. The analysis was based on field research, interviews, and a review of existing literature. The results indicated that the conflict is marked by politics of power, and as long as this stage continues, the politics of cooperation and conflict resolution would be hard to achieve. The key actors have diverging interests, values and principles, and different ways of presenting their viewpoints. The current investment context is economically and institutionally peripheral and socially weak. Without a radical rethinking and emphasis on ethical and structural reworking of the investment model, the conflict will likely continue to deepen, aggravating investment risk for large-scale business and industrial forestry.

However, their popularity in Portugal is decreasing, mostly due to the growth of organized retailing and greater globalization. Previous studies of consumers' perspectives of fresh produce in local food markets have associated proximity with freshness, improved quality and reduced environmental impact. A similar study was undertaken to capture small food service operator's perspectives of traditional markets as food suppliers. Questionnaires were administered to 16 small food service operators in traditional food markets in the north of Portugal during February 2009. Half of the food service operators were from restaurants, with an average capacity of 20-40 customers located in an urban area. The vast majority (94%) of operators visited the market 4 to 6 times a week, while only 60% of consumers visited the market at least one time per week. The products most often purchased from traditional food markets by operators were fresh fruit (100%) and vegetables (94%) and by consumers (88 and 82% respectively), followed by pulses (94%), fish (62%) and flowers (62%) by food operator's, and fresh fish (37%) and flowers (38%) by consumers. Results indicated a high degree of satisfaction, suggesting that with an adequate communication strategy, more small food service operators could be attracted to these markets.","[Sampaio, J.] Univ Porto, Oporto, Portugal; [Cunha, L.

The author proposed the system of more efficient prevention and possible storage of biodegradable waste to landfills. The proposed system was based on her own analysis of the raw material composition of mixed municipal waste and on public inquiry investigation. The paper also outlined ongoing preparation of involvement the whole city into proposed pilot program. It is conducted an analysis of the composition of a representative sample of municipal waste that was brought from the city to the landfill. This analysis was done to determine raw material composition of municipal waste and to determine whether it is useful to propose a system of community composting at that city. Successful community composting depends primarily on the citizens. An anonymous questionnaire which examined their interest in waste separation was used for this reason. Answers from 50 respondents were received. The participation in biological waste separation system was considered by 18% of respondents, but only under the assumption that this activity would brought them a discount from charges for refuse waste. About 8% of respondents favoured for regular collection of bags with bio-waste. More than half (64%) would like to lent from city biocontainer. About 10% of respondents were undecided to sort bio-waste. This paper was written for Sternberk city. It should help them devise a development of community composting.

The semi-parametric density estimator has the very same asymptotic variance as the standard non-parametric method, while there is substantial room for reducing the bias if the chosen parametric initial function belongs to a wide neighborhood around the true density function. We derive an expression for the pdf of any order statistic of the return distribution utilizing the semi-parametric method. The mean of the estimated pdf is the VaR estimate, and the standard deviation of the estimated pdf can be used to construct a confidence interval around the estimate.

Human capital, political factors, country risk and infrastructure are the main factors, while firm experience and motivations are mediating this process.

A typology is developed identifying six specific types of narrative techniques used in policy argumentation: Framing, omission, fitting facts, means-to-aims, glorifying, and scapegoating. The typology is used for analysing how stakeholders involved in the Ghana-EU FLEGT VPA use narrative techniques to construct their policy arguments and the implications of this use. The paper shows that a focus on interviewed stakeholder's use of narrative techniques enables the identification of potential areas of tension and contradictions in the narratives upon which the Ghana-VPA is built. It is argued, that the identified use of narrative techniques is to be seen as a result of an implicit urge among stakeholders to ensure consistency in their arguments rather than strategic mis-appropriations. The implications of research findings for the practical feasibility of the Ghana-EU VPA and the general applicability of the suggested typology are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, different papers focus on small and different sets of variables according to their research agenda. Because many of these variables are measures of different aspects of development and are thus correlated, the results for one variable can be sensitive to the inclusion/exclusion of others. We tested for the robustness of potential predictors of population health using the extreme bounds analysis. Population health was measured by life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rate. We found that only about half a dozen variables are robust predictors for life expectancy and infant mortality rate.

We find that principals can distinguish between high and low performing teachers, but the overall correlation between principal ratings of teachers and teachers' value-added contribution to student achievement is modest. The variation across metrics occurs in part because they are capturing different traits.

We also find a significant rise in the impact of family backgrounds upon education from 1993 to 2003, i.e., a decrease in intergenerational education mobility, which primarily derives from higher impact of parental incomes.

Paradoxically, the global economic downturn offers opportunities to innovate on policies to regenerate areas experiencing deindustrialisation, with one emerging focus being the development of 'green skills' to facilitate the transition of these places to 'green economies'. In this article, we explore similar policy objectives (i.e. regeneration activity based (in part) on green economy transitions) across three deindustrialising/deindustrialised regions Appalachia (United States), Ruhr (Germany) and the Valleys (South Wales) - to provide an account of the ways in which different regions with similar industrial pasts diverge in their approach to moving towards greener futures. Our argument is that the emphasis in such transitions should be the creation of 'decent' jobs, with new economic activity and employment initiatives embracing a 'high road' (i.e. high skill/high pay/high quality) trajectory. Utilising a 'varieties of capitalism' analysis, we contend that an effective, socially inclusive and 'high road' transition is more likely to emerge within co-ordinated market economy contexts, for example, Germany, than within the liberal market economy contexts of, for example, the United States and United Kingdom. In identifying the critical success factors leading to 'high road' green economy, the implications for any such transition within the liberal market economy context of Australia are highlighted.","[Stroud, Dean; Blake, Joanne] Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Cardiff CF10 3XQ, S Glam, Wales; [Fairbrother, Peter] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Evans, Claire] Cardiff Univ, Sch Business, Cardiff CF10 3XQ, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Cardiff University,"Stroud, D (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Cardiff CF10 3XQ, S Glam, Wales.",StroudDA1@cf.ac.uk,"Fairbrother, Peter/R-7050-2019","Fairbrother, Peter/0000-0002-8169-4811; Stroud, Dean/0000-0002-9174-8967",,,,,49,13,13,3,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

However, the impact of criminal behavior of parents on educational outcomes of children is generally ignored, even though the entailed social costs may be substantial. This study examines the effect of parents' criminal involvement on the educational attainment of their children. To identify this effect, we combine a multinomial logit model with a Mahalanobis matching approach. The findings suggest that having criminally involved parents (1) increases the probability of finishing primary education as the highest education level attained (7-9 percentage points), and (2) decreases the probability of attaining higher education (2-6 percentage points). These results are robust to various specifications and are unlikely to be fully driven by differences in unobservables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This article explores utilitarian and human rights approaches to gender equality in selected policy initiatives on the land deals. While global policy literature manifests growing attention to women in agriculture, the review found the analysis of gender in early policy initiatives to be absent or weak. Utilitarian arguments were used to justify deals but rarely presented women's participation as a means of social progress or so-called smart economics. Human rights documents were more likely to be critical of the deals and to mention gender, though with little elaboration. While to some extent amended by the emphasis on gender equality in the 2012 Voluntary Guidelines on tenure governance, failures to mobilize the feminist potential in utilitarian and human rights approaches call for more proactive gender analysis and advocacy when addressing transnational land deals as gendered power struggles.","Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Wisborg, P (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",poul.wisborg@umb.no,,,,,,,98,9,12,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Evidence derived from research showed that there is now a broad agreement amongst commentators that skills training improve employees' commitment to the organisation. Training from a company's perspective adds to human capital and also a means of securing workplace commitment. The theoretical proposition therefore is that training will get employees more committed to the organisation. Organisational commitment when combined with job related behavioural commitment will lead to organisational performance. In order to achieve a high level of performance, organisations now require highly motivated and committed workers. This paper explored the relationship between training and employees' commitment to the organisation. The organisation on which the research was conducted is a Discount House in Lagos, South West Nigeria. The total of 150 completely filled questionnaires was utilised in this study.

The annual panel data used for the research are obtained from the West African Monetary Agency website: www.wami.imao.org. The panel variables are first tested for unit root and stationarity. The panel unit root test results show that all the variables are integrated of order one. The stationarity test confirms the result, as the variables are non-stationarity in level but stationarity after first difference. The Long-run cointegration equation is obtained using the pooled group mean estimator. Linear programming is then applied on the result of the long-run equation to obtain the optimal conditions for attainment of single currency project for West Africa. The result shows that the objective value of 0.0462 is obtained with inflation contributing more to the variation in the government external reserves.

By requiring that investments in research and development be expensed as incurred, the generally accepted accounting principles provide low-tech firms with a larger set of accounting choices with which to manipulate earnings than are provided to high-tech firms. Therefore, we find window dressing of earnings is more severe in low-tech firms than in high-tech firms. We also find that window dressing of revenues is more severe in high-tech firms than in low-tech firms. This result suggests that high-tech firms engage more in revenue management to compensate for the smaller set of accounting choices with which to manage earnings.","[Lin, Fengyi] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Business Management, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Zhao, Lijuan] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Coll Business & Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Guan, Liming] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, Sch Accountancy, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",National Taipei University of Technology; California State University System; California State University Los Angeles; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Lin, FY (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Business Management, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",linfengyi.tw@gmail.com; lzhao11@calstatela.edu; lguan@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,24,5,5,2,24,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This paper summarizes the results of research carried out to analyze the current CSR reporting situation in Estonia and provides an outlook on its future development in the country. The study also discusses important benefits and significant obstacles of CSR reporting based on a survey of selected Estonian companies and its key drivers on the national level. The paper argues that the concept of CSR accounting and reporting has found its place in Estonia. It is recognized and has been implemented by a number of Estonian companies, although the reporting practice does not have a very long history in the country. The research findings clearly indicate that the main principles of CSR concept are familiar to the surveyed Estonian companies, and have been integrated into their everyday business activities. CSR activities are usually reported either on companies' websites or as disclosures in financial reports. Standalone CSR reports are not very common, as many companies cannot clearly identify their benefits. Time constraints and the lack of qualified specialists are the main reasons for not issuing standalone CSR reports, in addition to the difficulty in measuring the impact of CSR activities. The paper also argues that despite the fact that Estonian companies have taken some successful steps towards integrating CSR reporting, this type of reporting should get more support and positive publicity from the state, mass media, various public and private institutions and organizations and the general public.","[Loorits, Anneli; Alver, Jaan] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Loorits, A (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.",looritsanneli@gmail.com; jaan.alver@ttu.ee,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,424,434,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000040,0

However, big debts increase the potential problems of business entity's insolvency. Various scientific research have analysed the hypothesis which state that on favourable conditions on credit markets the business entities most often increase their financial leverage. If it becomes more difficult to borrow, the borrowing rate should decrease. This article analyses debt level indicators of Lithuanian economic sectors during different economy cycles: economy peak, recession, trough, and recovery. Debt level in economic sectors is evaluated while calculating two relative indicators - debt ratio and financial leverage. The article compares trends of debt level in the companies with changes of main factors - fixed assets, asset tangibility, and profitability ratios. The results of the research indicate that during the first years of Lithuanian economy recession the financial leverage in the business entities remained stable and high.

Binary- and multinomial-choice survey instruments were administered via Knowledge Networks, using the latter to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for increments in three ecosystem services: wildlife habitat provision, storm surge protection, and fisheries productivity. Results indicate that confidence in government agencies, political leanings, and green lifestyle choices were significant explanatory factors. All three ecosystem services significantly affected project support, with increased fisheries productivity having the largest marginal effect, followed by improved storm surge protection and increased wildlife habitat. Mean household WTP, in the form of a one-time tax, is estimated to be $909 (confidence interval $732-$1,185), with resource users being willing to pay substantially more. This figure implies a mean aggregate willingness to pay of $105 billion (confidence interval $84-$136 billion) in excess of the State of Louisiana's estimated $50 billion cost for a statewide restoration program similar to the hypothetical restoration in this study.","[Petrolia, Daniel R.; Interis, Matthew G.; Hwang, Joonghyun] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Petrolia, DR (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Box 5187, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",petrolia@agecon.msstate.edu; interis@agecon.msstate.edu; Jhh240@msstate.edu,"Petrolia, Daniel/AAH-6670-2020","Petrolia, Daniel/0000-0003-2102-1612; Interis, Matthew/0000-0003-3779-5495","NOAA Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, U.S. Department of Commerce [NA06OAR4320264 06111039]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [W-3133, MIS-033140]","NOAA Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, U.S. Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","The authors express their gratitude to the journal's editor, Martin Smith, an associate editor, and three anonymous reviewers for suggestions that greatly improved the manuscript.

Derived from keen observation of aspirations of individuals and research, seven key motivational factors have been determined that drives a person towards their aspiration. The term drivers have been used to represent an unfulfilled desire that influences one's behavior towards fulfilling it. Different people have found to have different priorities of the drivers i.e. they are strongly oriented to some of the seven versus the rest.

However, intermittent energy sources currently account for very small amounts of total generation. Despite this fact, policymakers have begun implementing requirements that will dramatically increase the amount of bulk storage capacity. This paper examines the social benefits provided by bulk storage in the Texas electricity market, which has a large amount of renewable capacity relative to other states, but still quite limited renewable penetration. We focus on the impact of arbitraging electricity across time-a major service of bulk storage. Using current storage technologies, we demonstrate that electricity arbitrage will increase daily CO2 emissions by an average of 0.19 tons for each MWh stored. In addition, daily SO2 emissions will increase by an average of 1.89 pounds/MWh while NOx emissions will fall by an average of 0.15 pounds/MWh. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Some proposals offset that effect by returning revenue to low-income workers via reduced labor tax. We build analytical general equilibrium models with both high-skilled and low-skilled labor, and we solve for the change in real net wage of each group. Decomposition shows the separate effects of the tax rebate, higher product prices, and the changes in relative wage rates. We also include numerical examples. Even though the pollution tax injures both types of labor, in most cases we find that returning all of the revenue to low-skilled workers is still not enough to offset higher product prices. Changes in relative wage rates may further hurt low-skilled labor. Protecting low-income workers is possible in this model only if they are defined as those below a relatively low wage threshold, but we discuss many possible elaborations of this model that could affect those results.

This paper revisits that question with a novel dataset of over 11,000 sets of twins in the United States and information on colleges to which they apply, enroll, and potentially graduate. I show that a student's probability of bachelor's degree completion within four years increases by 5 percentage points by choosing an institution with a median SAT score 100 points higher than the alternative. Moreover, the estimated magnitude of impact is insensitive to several methodologies, including OLS, twin fixed effects, and controlling for the application portfolio. This suggests that in certain contexts, sources of bias perceived as barriers to obtaining causal estimates of the returns to college selectivity, such as unobserved family characteristics and student aspiration, may be of little concern.

We find that (i) both the choice of regime and the levels of domestic and global emissions only depend on the aggregate levels of organized stakes in all countries and not on their distribution among individual interest groups and (ii) an increase in lobbying influence by a particular lobby group may backfire by inducing a change towards the lobby group's less preferred regime.

The study employs a discourse-theoretical perspective to highlight the contingency of representations and the process of meaning-making. Articulations of futures are studied in relation to the argument that in climate change debates a sense of predestination, in the form of predictions inferred from climate models, prevails over ways of imagining futures that allow more room for human agency and social change. The prestige paper (HS) rated the summits high on its news agenda and covered climate treaty negotiations extensively while the tabloid (IS) provided more sporadic, often celebrity or scandal driven coverage. In both papers, futures were articulated in relation to the climate treaty which functioned as a nodal point in a binary dichotomy between a desired future articulated through emission reductions and an undesired future articulated through consequences of climate change. Beyond the immediate summit context other articulations of futures, relating to uncertainty (HS) and the probability of concrete climate change consequences (IS), emerged. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We contribute to the literature by providing results for the U.K. using a different research design and a different dataset. Specifically, we estimate the effect of schooling on health outcomes (obesity and physical health) and health-related behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption and exercise) for women through within-MZ twins estimates using the TwinsUK database. For physical health, alcohol consumption and exercise, the within-MZ twins estimates are uninformative about whether there is a causal effect. However, we find (1) that the significant association between schooling and smoking status is due to unobserved endowments that are correlated with schooling and smoking and (2) there is some indication that more schooling reduces the body mass index for women, even once these unobserved endowments have been controlled for.

The 2007 financial crisis triggered such a process in several Anglo-European countries and large fissures have been opening up in recent years between societal expectations and lived experiences. Historical precedents for this situation can be found, for example, in the waning of British imperialism during the twentieth century and the political restructuring of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during the 1990s. Indications of a transition from consumerism to post-consumerism are now becoming apparent in the United States and parts of Europe. Impelling this transformation are shifting demographics, technological changes, and new social values. These developments are being expressed in terms of stagnating wages, persistently high unemployment, widening income inequality, sluggish consumer demand, volatile financial markets, contracting middle-class security, and general public malaise. The case of Japan over the past two decades may offer useful insights to inform this nascent transition to a post-consumerist future and to help navigate some of its challenges.

I explore a new political mechanism of financialization, by drawing upon an ethnographic study of economic development in two Rust Belt cities and analyzing usage of tax increment financing (TIF), a practice that allows cities to securitize projected increases in property tax receipts and create bonds similar to structured asset-backed securities (e.g. mortgage-backed securities). Cities initially used TIF as a last-resort financing strategy, but the practice has transformed urban politics by creating opportunities for economic development professionals to exercise jurisdiction over municipal budgets. Further, TIF structures other roles that development professionals play by giving them incentives to use TIF in ways that are not aligned with the citys fiscal outlook and lock them into ever-higher rates of TIF spending. This analysis illustrates a recursive relationship between financialization and the state: public policies have transformed financial markets, but reliance on financial markets can also transform political institutions in ways that promote further financialization.","Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02906 USA",Brown University,"Pacewicz, J (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02906 USA.",pacewicz@brown.edu,,,,,,,37,95,124,0,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Using Three-Stage-Least-Squares methods for simultaneous equations, we find a two-way relationship between tuition fees and applications: higher application numbers encourage universities to charge higher fees in the future, but higher fees in turn curtail application numbers. We find evidence that higher GMAT scores of existing students increase applications, as do higher post MBA salaries. Meanwhile, university and programme professional accreditations do not impact on student application choices, nor do alumni ratings of programme quality. Published MBA programme rankings appear to have little impact on applications, and where an effect can be identified, it appears that a better ranking discourages applications. Only US News rankings have a significant effect on applicants to US MBA programmes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem is that agreement by central governments to adopt national fiscal rules, whether self-imposed or imposed by some supranational institution, leaves unaddressed how such rules and sanctions should be adopted by (or imposed on) sub-central and local governments. To date, the primary focus has been on whether the encouragement given over recent decades to fiscal decentralisation has worsened public debt levels and made national fiscal consolidation by central governments more difficult. This article argues that what is missing from this discussion is attention to the intergovernmental institutional arrangements and how they and their reform are potentially crucial to both national fiscal consolidation and ensuring retention of the benefits of fiscal decentralisation.","[Warren, Neil] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Warren, N (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Taxat & Business Law, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",n.warren@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,51,1,1,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Because industry support for US participation in such an agreement is essential, an empirical analysis of lobbying expenditures during Congress's last attempt to pass emission-restricting legislation is used to gauge industry support and opposition for such reform. The article qualifies its finding of no major spending asymmetry and explains the role of ideological and structural features of the US political system in impeding the passage of any such bill. Scepticism aside, it argues that a shift in US climate policy is coming due to: N the implementation of foreign carbon-restricting regimes; and (ii) the US exporters' response to these reforms. A microeconomic analysis demonstrates that US exporters will increasingly elect carbon-efficient technologies to minimize costs and adjust to a changing regulatory environment. This shift in the carbon intensity of production will cause these industries to form a majority coalition with pro-environment groups in fiv our of domestic and global emission-restricting reforms. Because these developments lead to the use of border measures designed to curb carbon leakage and address trade concerns, the article makes a few suggestions for reducing potential conflicts between the trade and climate change regimes.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Law, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Colares, JF (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Law, 11075 East Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",colares@case.edu,,,,,,,126,2,2,0,7,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Modeling outcomes indicate that traditional production is not financially viable, failing to generate a positive 10-year Internal Rate of Return (IRR). Such practices persist in the Mahakam Delta as capital costs have been depreciated against past financial returns, input costs are negligible, risks are minimal, opportunity costs are low and options to intensify production have been retained by producers. Returns from BMP-guided semi-intensive culture (20% IRR) are marginally higher compared to extensive culture but entail a 10-fold increase in operating costs and greater risks. Integrated mangrove-shrimp production gives a reasonable IRR (53%) but costs remain high, management demanding and risks uncertain. Risk adverse operators with short-term leases may favor traditional and extensive practices. Sustainable intensification, allied to social capital development and rehabilitation of mangrove ecosystem services and environmental flows, is needed to reconcile multiple demands.","[Bunting, Stuart W.] Univ Essex, Sch Biol Sci, Essex Sustainabil Inst, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Bosma, Roel H.; van Zwieten, Paul A.

We call it the induced ordered weighted averaging weighted averaging adequacy coefficient (IOWAWAAC) operator. The main advantage is that it is able to deal with complex attitudinal characters in the aggregation process. Thus, we are able to give a better representation of the problem considering the complex environment that affects the decisions. Moreover, it is able to provide a unified framework between the OWA and the weighted average. We generalize it by using generalized aggregation operators, obtaining the induced generalized OWAWAAC (IGOWAWAAC) operator. We study some of the main properties of this approach.

In contrast to existing studies, we are able to distinguish between general ability, measured with high school GPA, and major-specific ability, measured with grades achieved in major-specific courses. We show that students with higher general ability are more likely to enroll in Economics majors, while higher major specific ability (e.g. higher grade in Accounting) increases the likelihood of choosing that major (Accounting). We also find that both genders are more responsive to measured major-specific ability in majors that are traditionally more popular among them (e.g. Business Informatics for males). These results suggest that policy makers aiming to change the structure of the labor supply should attempt to change the major-specific abilities of students. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It then explores in more depth the specific congruence between action research practices and the principles of integral foresight and futures studies. An approach to understanding expertise in futures and foresight practice consistent with the integral perspective is explored.

For RTAs concluded under Article XXIV restrictive preferential rules of origin open doors to selective tariff liberalization in violation of GATT Article XXIV For RTAs concluded pursuant to the Enabling Clause, restrictive preferential rules of origin may result in 'undue difficulties' to non-parties in violation of the Enabling Clause. In order to address the inconsistencies with the WTO law, restrictive preferential rules of origin should converge to the WTO harmonized non-preferential rules of origin (NPROO), which would be deemed non-protectionist. However, in view of the slow progress of harmonizing NPROO in the WTO, we propose an alternative approach based on the evolutionary development of preferential rules of origin in the ASEAN's RTAs. As a second-best solution, we propose that all RTA rules of origin adopt a general rule applicable to all non-wholly obtained products: the 40% value-added rule or a change in tariff heading (CTH). In conjunction with the general rule, a limited number of product-specific rules of origin that are coequal to the general rule should be permitted so as to provide some room for flexibility for RTAs to accommodate divergent existing preferential rules of origin. The proposed general rule would further enhance the conformity of RTAs with the WTO system by harmonizing preferential rules of origin across RTAs and across different product lines.","Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, JB (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",jongbumkim@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In evaluating timber demand, the significant contributing factors like forest land cover, frequency of furniture manufacturing, price of timber substitute, population growth and railway density have been examined. Panel data over a longer period for a developing country like Bangladesh were not easily available. The data sources were very sporadic for the study - there was no common data pool. A panel dataset over a 17-year period was simulated and analyzed for the study. Increase of railway density and population growth rate have been identified as factors having highest leverage on pulling up the demand for country's timber resources. Although social forestry programs are playing a positive role in timber supply, it cannot keep pace with the increasing demand for timber for a vast population of over 150 million. Social forestry programs should be strengthened further, and concurrently, population growth rate needs to be checked to bridge the gap between demand and supply of timber in Bangladesh. The study is expected to provide important policy recommendations to meet timber demand in the country. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The analytical policy program model consists of a relevant issue, consistent policy objectives or goals, and the implementation and expected impact of a certain policy program. Through these four analytical program model features, this article attempts to identify the substantive and symbolic policy changes that occurred during the last two decades in Bangladesh's forest sector. Content analysis with a qualitative approach was adopted as a methodology. The analytical policy program model was able to identify 25 substantive and 11 symbolic policy changes in the forest policy sector in Bangladesh during the last two decades, thereby also demonstrating the capacity of the analytical policy program model to identify substantive policy change as opposed to symbolic changes.

They provide a means for local and regional initiatives aimed at averting, mitigating, or adapting to climate change and other trans-boundary problems to join together in a system that: permits sharing of experiences, diffuses policy innovation across national borders, and spans divergent disciplinary boundaries so as to better communicate science to local decision-makers. We consider the role currently played by networks and the possibility that, over time, their soft power characteristics - a reliance on value change and policy emulation - may eventually place them in a position to globally coordinate local and regional environmental policy innovations. If successful, their efforts might supplant the need for national action to address climate change, even if they do not replace the nation-state system whose environmental management efforts will continue to rely on hard power: the use, primarily, of economic incentives to induce policy change.

England's Professional Footballers' Association acted as a beacon to various attempts by Australian soccer players to form associations. Its legal victory in Eastham, in 1963, where it challenged the retain and transfer system, has had a resonance in Australia with the 1971 decision of the High Court in Tutty which struck down the New South Wales Rugby League's retain and transfer system. This and decisions by lower courts in other states aided Australian player associations in their dealings with their respective leagues. Information is provided on various failed beginnings prior to World War I, and subsequent successful attempts to establish player associations in Australia, the formation of confederations both domestic and international, details of the respective membership of associations, the average income of members and a measure of their ability to provide services for members.","Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Dabscheck, B (通讯作者)，Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

At this point, we can look back on the historical economic data on simvastatin to see what lesson regarding reimbursement we can learn. Historical data on the usage and sales of simvastatin in Sweden were combined with published epidemiological and clinical data to calculate the social value of simvastatin to the present day and to make projection until projected until 2018. The distribution of the social surplus was calculated by taking the costs born by society and the producer of the drug into consideration. The cost of simvastatin fell drastically following patent expiration, although the number of treated patients has continued to grow. Presently, the use of simvastatin is close to cost neutrality taking direct and indirect cost savings from reduced morbidity into account. However, the major part of the social surplus generated comes from the value of improved quality-adjusted survival. Of the social surplus generated, the producer appropriated 20-43% of the value during the on-patent period, a figure dropping to 1% following loss of exclusivity. The total producer surplus between 1987 and 2018 is 2-5% of the total social surplus. Only a small part of the surplus value generated was appropriated by the producer. A regulatory and reimbursement approach that favors early market access and coverage with evidence development as opposed to long-term trials as a pre-requisite for launch is more attractive from both a company and social perspective.","[Lindgren, Peter] Innovus, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindgren, Peter] Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Div Cardiovasc Epidemiol, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden; [Jonsson, Bengt] Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Hlth Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Karolinska Institutet; Stockholm School of Economics,"Lindgren, P (通讯作者)，Innovus, Stockholm, Sweden.",peter.lindgren@innovus.com,"Lindgren, Peter/AID-5379-2022","Lindgren, Peter/0000-0002-8238-8189",,,,,38,15,16,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We distinguish 'direct' from 'indirect' approaches. The direct approach collects observable data or proxy variables on trade cost components which are then typically used as regressors in a gravity equation of trade. Instead, the indirect approach infers the extent of trade impediments from trade flows. It compares actual trade flows to the trade flows predicted by a hypothetical frictionless benchmark scenario based on a micro-founded trade model, attributing the deviation of actual from predicted trade flows to trade frictions. We argue that economists and policy-makers can gain useful insights from both approaches.","[Chen, Natalie; Novy, Dennis] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, CESifo, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Novy, Dennis] Univ Warwick, Ctr Competit Adv Global Econ CAGE, CESifo, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick; University of Warwick,"Chen, N (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, CESifo, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",N.A.Chen@warwick.ac.uk; D.Novy@warwick.ac.uk,,,"ESRC [ES/H021248/1, ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1, ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,51,19,24,3,50,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2012,11.0,3,,,,,401,414,,10.1017/S1474745612000183,0.0,,,14,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,984TR,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307215500005,0
J,"Campbell, JM",,,,"Campbell, J. Michael",,,The effect of education in reducing bear attractants on cottage properties: Manitoba's Bear Smart program,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PLANNED BEHAVIOR; PERCEPTIONS,"Over the past decades there has been an increase in negative interactions between humans and bears. In response to these concerns a number of initiatives such as Bear Smart, Bear Aware and Bear Wise have evolved to help communities learn to deal with bears. All these programs share the goals of educating people about how to avoid attracting bears to their property or campsite, changing behaviors that serve to attract bears and what to do should a bear approach. This study examines the efficacy of the Bear Smart program in two cottage communities along the shores of Lake Winnipeg. Audits of bear attractants were conducted on cottage properties prior to and after the implementation of the Bear Smart awareness program. In addition, a population survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior was conducted in order to identify attitudes and intentions with respect to bear smart behavior. Results indicate that despite the educational programming conducted throughout the cottaging season and positive attitudes toward bear smart behavior, little had actually been done by cottagers to reduce their cottage properties' attractiveness to bears. The results of the property bear attractant audits showed minimal effect in terms of reduced attractants on cottage properties in either of the two communities. While on the surface this might suggest that the targeted multi channel educational programs were not effective in changing behavior, it is possible that the effect was masked by the normal seasonal increase in attractants as the cottage season progressed. In particular behaviors relating to the proper handling of food and garbage elicited very positive attitude scores. When considered in light of the evaluation of removing bird feeders (with and without food) where 16% and 24% respectively state removing feeders is quite to very unacceptable, the issue of communicating the role of bird feeders as an attraction is perhaps the most important message to convey successfully. The Theory of Planned Behavior allowed examination into the constituent components of these attitudes that were not positively evaluated by all cottagers and provides insight to direct future communication and awareness programs.

There exists a considerable divergence among the scholars regarding the need for harmonization of the 'principle of exhaustion' and parallel import laws. In this paper, we critically examine the need for harmonization of parallel import laws by analysing the economic considerations and consumer welfare aspects of different systems of exhaustion of rights. We also present the available sparse empirical evidence pertaining to the same. Prima facie the arguments for a minimum international legal standard of exhaustion doctrine in the TRIPS Agreement appear convincing. However, there is a lack of corroborative empirical evidence. Therefore, this may not be an appropriate time for the WTO to move ahead on this contentious issue, especially when it is standing at crossroads on several other major issues.","[Jagannathan, Srinath] Indian Inst Management, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Rai, RK (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Program Business Policy, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India.",rajnishrai@gmail.com; srinath.jayanti@gmail.com,,,,,,,68,1,2,0,14,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

J,"MacDonald, N",,,,"MacDonald, Neil",,,Futures and culture,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Are there, in scenario analyses, recurring narratives about the future that tend to converge on a small number of archetypes? If so, what are they, and what are their characteristics? This question was examined in a sample of 20 scenario sets constructed between 1990 and 2008, containing 64 stories, and representing five countries, and six different themes. Eight repeating archetypes were identified, and named as progress, catastrophe, reversion and transformation. Each of these main types exists in two variants: the causal variant is driven by forces of natural law, while the intent variant is driven by social intentions. The archetypes are present in scenarios produced by different methods. It therefore seems unlikely that they are an artefact of the method used. The question is considered as to whether the identified archetypes are hard-wired into our narrative imagination, or whether they are created by our culture. Evidence is analysed suggesting that there is a strong influence of culture. Most strikingly, analyzing the societies envisaged in the narratives reveals some anomalous rule breaking which strongly suggest; that cultural influence is at work. Only further cross-cultural work will reveal whether there are possible narratives that are hidden from us. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A major question is how such a charter school district would be organized to support its schools and who would perform the different functions required. It is argued that three economic guidelines need to be an important determinant of the solution to this question: the presence of economies of scale; transaction costs; and externalities.

This paper sets out to address this conundrum, by looking at the individual and macro-level determinants of individual life satisfaction in 10 CEE countries. The results highlight that macroeconomic and institutional differences are the key factors behind the lack of convergence in life satisfaction. On the macroeconomic side, Gross Domestic Product growth is still a source of increasing well-being, but the happiness bonus associated with it is becoming smaller. The different levels of individual happiness in CEE are therefore mostly determined by institutional factors such as corruption, government spending and decentralization.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] IMDEA Social Sci, Madrid, Spain; [Maslauskaite, Kristina] Coll Europe, European Econ Studies Dept, BE-8000 Brugge, Belgium",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk; kristina.maslauskaite@coleurope.eu,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,65,69,3,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

They invite wide-ranging discussion on issues such as the futures of urban design, public transport, environmental justice, and active citizenship and nonviolent movements of social change. Developing a peace, environmental and futures education perspective, involves a number of pedagogic shifts. The authors decided to take a group of postgraduate students from a wide range of countries and various disciplinary backgrounds on an urban walk in Sydney. This diverse group of students was enrolled in a cross-disciplinary course called Peace and the Environment. As one of several current curriculum offerings, this course is taught through the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney, Australia. As a learning activity, the urban walk component was designed to facilitate reflection on what might constitute peaceful environments, including alternative readings of the Australian landscape. With such experiential learning activities, the evidence suggests that students are more likely to be open to alternative readings or mappings of their everyday environments, as well as to hospitable rather than hostile, imagined future landscapes.

The present work proposes a method to measure the structural social capital, together with forest planning field surveys, in order to highlight the potential to support participative decision making processes.

This paper defines and describes three types of such megapatterns that will be of major influence in shaping global settlement and activity structures in the future, given a warming climate: (1) megapatterns driven by global warming; (2) megapatterns driven by improved technology and resources, and (3) megapatterns driven by important spatial positions. The megapatterns are ordered into a typology and their individual and collective impacts are described. The major findings of this paper are: because of global warming many of the central areas of the globe will experience heat, water and pollution problems that will induce people and activities to be moved to cooler, wetter areas. As high, cool terrains, as well as the virgin Sub-Polar Regions mostly located in Siberia, Northern Canada, Northern Scandinavia, Greenland, Alaska, Southern Argentina, and Southern Chile start to get warmer, it will become possible to relocate water-craving industries, like agriculture and resource extraction. This will not necessarily lead to a large population shift, since relatively few workers are needed for most such operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The general objective of this study is that, starting from theoretical approaches and international recommendations in terms of corporate governance, to determine the status of the implementation of principles regarding the transparency of the policy for the choice and remuneration of the members of the management bodies of the banking entities in Romania. Subsequent to the study on the implementation of the corporate governance principles in the banking entities in Romania, one could conclude that the credit institutions in Romania partially implemented the international recommendations in terms of corporate governance. Among the causes that led to the obtaining of a poor result at the national level, we mention: the reluctance of the leadership of entities regarding the dissemination of information.","[Doru, Adrian Bigioi] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,adrianb@realteam.ro,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2752,2761,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801149,0

Although it is highly acknowledged that IT can play a pivotal role in reducing business complexity and promoting business growth, majority of the batik microenterprises in Malaysia remains as non-adopters of IT. Previous studies recognized the slow rate of IT adoption amongst SMEs in Malaysia. Two factors of non-adoption of TT that were identified in the literature are the lack of IT knowledge and expertise and the characteristics of IT applications itself. The continuous work on IT therapy which started as an action research in microenterprise IT adoption shed some light on how to progress towards the development of a method that encourage IT adoption amongst microenterprise. However, the existing work merely treats IT therapy as a set of intervention in action research but did not formalize and develop the method. This study was attempted to model the IT therapy using the clinical approach to give it a formal definition. A case study was conducted on clinical therapy practice using personal interviews, observation and document reviews. As a result, the components of SOAPIE method were identified and mapped into the new IT therapy conceptual model. The scenario of batik microenterprise was used to give a contextual approach that helps visualize the TT therapy. The formalization and refinement of the IT therapy will be useful for devising intervention programs to assist microenterprise to adopt IT in their business operation.","[Hairuddin, Hanitahaiza; Kassim, Erne Suzila] Univ Teknol MARA, Ctr Informat Technol Studies, Fac Comp & Math Sci, Bandar Puncak Alam 42300, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,,nita_arif@salam.uitm.edu.my; norlaila@tmsk.uitm.edu.my; ernekassim@puncakalam.uitm.edu.my,"KASSIM, ERNE/ABB-2900-2021","KASSIM, ERNE/0000-0003-4443-9157; Rahma, Indah/0000-0002-6855-1146",,,,,49,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2770,2784,,,,,,15,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801151,0

Although this phenomenon has been observed many times and is generally accepted, there is very little information about the mechanisms of eutrofication on terrestrial orchids of temperate or Mediterranean climatic zone. In principle, two modes of action may occur: direct toxic effect of higher nutrient content on orchids or their mycorrhizal fungi, and/or indirect effect mediated by altered competition with surrounding vegetation. I tested the significance of direct effect in a three-year lasting pot greenhouse experiment using Mediterranean orchid Serapias lingua. Indirect effect of eutrofication was excluded by omitting any co-cultivated plant species, eutrofication was simulated by the series of nutrient solutions. The most concentrated basic solution containing 6 mM N-NO3-, 2.4 mM N-NH4+, 2 mM P, 8 mM K, 2.6 mM Ca a 2 mM Mg was gradually diluted with distilled water in 1:1 ratio, in order to prepare 2, 4, 8, and 16x diluted treatments. No data suggesting direct negative effect of eutrofication on orchids were obtained. After the first growing season, no effect of simulated eutrofication on the ratio of fresh mass of tubers in 2007 and 2006 (FM2007/FM2006) was observed. The highest value of this coefficient was 7.79, SD=2.68, n=115. Positive effect of higher nutrient availability on the FM2008/FM2007 was observed after the second growing season, during which the nutrient demand was higher due to higher count of greater plants planted in individual pots. For example, the mean FM2008/FM2007 value of S. lingua treated with 16x diluted solution was 1.21 (SD=0.31, n=23), while for plants treated with undiluted basic solution was the mean 2.20 (SD=0.58, n=23). These results strongly support the opinion that indirect, by competition mediated effect of eutrofication on adult, photosynthezising plants is responsible cause decline of orchid population and the published evidence was discussed with this respect.","[Vesela, B.; Balaz, M.] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Expt Biol, Brno 62500, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Veselá, B (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Expt Biol, Kamenice 753-5, Brno 62500, Czech Republic.",vesela.b@czechglobe.com,"BalÃ¡Å¾, Milan/KBA-3790-2024",,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,910,918,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200104,0

The increased workplace tension and job-loss was just a few consequences, which prior studies had documented, could stem from bad performance appraisals. Meanwhile, an equitable and transparent performance appraisal could be a learning tool, and turn it into an opportunity for professional growth. This study extended the literature of the effect of performance appraisal on productivity and employees by proposing a further linkage between the employees' perception on fair performance appraisal and organizational justice-considered practices (distributive justice, procedural justice, and interactional justice) to job satisfaction and work performance in Malaysia. Prior studies did not explore much this relation due to the geographical sample limitation and governance practice context, i.e. developed countries. Participants of this research were employees of large and well-established companies in Kuala Lumpur, which were considered to have well and transparent appraisal systems and a perfect recently context to find the effect of organizational justice conflict. Data collection procedure used questionnaire and was processed with factor analysis and regression to examine the simultaneous effects of few independent variables on a dependent variable. There are some interesting results. First, the interactional justice has more influence than other types of organizational justice in evaluating employee's performance, which is contrary with previous researches. This shows that, employees are more concerned on interaction during and after the evaluation process. The employees are keen on knowing how they have been evaluated and what the feedback of their superior is after the performance appraisal process. The empirical results provide strong support for the relationship between employee perception of organizational justice in performance appraisal system and work performance. It also supports a significant relationship between performance appraisal satisfaction and work performance. The important implication for organization in this study is a pivotal role of the employees' perceptions of the success or failure of a system. Therefore, it is very essential for the management to keep in view the perceptions of their employees, while designing or modifying the appraisal system.","[Warokka, Ari; Gallato, Cristina G.] Northern Univ Malaysia, Univ Utara Malaysia, OYA GSB, Sintok, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,,ari.warokka@uum.edu.my,"Warokka, Ari/M-1314-2019; Warokka, Ari Ari/P-5066-2016","Warokka, Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780; Warokka, Ari Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780",,,,,46,0,0,0,15,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2292,+,,,,,,5,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801108,0

By using the model derived from module two and three, the policy adjustable space can be easily calculated.","[Xie, Lan; Wang, Huiwen] Beijing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Beihang University,,xie_lan@buaa.edu.cn; wanghw@vip.sina.com,"Wang, Huiwen/JED-3206-2023; wang, hw/HZH-3227-2023",,,,,,5,2,2,0,2,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-61896-012-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,2877,2882,,,,,,6,Economics; Management; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BBY61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308816304121,0

This is the basic idea of the transparency exercise of regional trade agreements (RTAs) at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Information sharing on RTAs is critically important because monitoring is impossible without it. In order for us to see not only good but also evil RTAs, a light called 'notification requirement' should reach them. In reality, however, it is too optimistic to assume that the light reaches all RTAs. There seem to be many ghosts living in the dark; no information on ghosts can be shared and none can confirm they are really ghosts. This paper attempts to reveal those RTAs upon which the light of the transparency exercise has not reached. While many studies have pointed out that there are many non-notified RTAs as a reservation in conducting analysis of RTAs, this is the first scholarly attempt to identify the comprehensive picture of non-notified RTAs, with an emphasis on the Asia-Pacific. Because information on all RTAs notified to the WTO is included in the WTO RTA Database, gathering information on non-notified trade agreements is the key to understanding the universe of trade agreements.","[Hamanaka, Shintaro] ADB, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Manila, Philippines; [Hamanaka, Shintaro] WTO, Japanese Miss, Doha Round, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Hamanaka, S (通讯作者)，ADB, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Manila, Philippines.",,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,7,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The power of important actors to misuse the community forestry approach for their self-interests has been reported as a major obstacle to comprehensive success. Hence, this article aims at developing an analytical, theory-based and empirically applicable framework for assessing an actor's power using community forestry as an illustrative case. The actor-centred power approach (ACP) analysis aims to provide a scientific answer to the question of who are the politically most powerful actors in community forestry practices. In making use of suitable components of power theories it builds strongly upon the social relations of actors, organisational aspects and power sources, as described by Weber, Dahl, Etzioni and their adherents. Actor-centred power approach (ACP) is defined as a social relationship in which actor A alters the behaviour of actor B without recognising B's will. In our framework we distinguish between three core elements: coercion, (dis-)incentives and dominant information. These make up the basis for observable facts that involve not only physical actions but also threats by power elements and the very sources of said power elements. Theoretical considerations show that, despite the focus being on actors, by looking to their power sources a considerable part of structural power can be more tangible at least in part, like rules, discourse or ideologies. Furthermore, the paper shows how the actor-centred power approach distinguishes power from other influences on forest management and contributes to the identification of the group of powerful actors on an empirical basis. Due to the focus on actors and well-defined and observable elements of power, the actor-centred power approach (ACP) could serve not only as a basis for research but also as a tool for quick assessment of power networks, delivering valuable preliminary information for designing forest policy in practice.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of primary prevention programmes for Dutch children in a decision-analytic framework. Methods A decision-analytic tree model analysing healthcare costs and asthma cases prevented was developed to compare usual care (UC) with two UF and three MF programmes on the primary prevention of asthma amongst children. Programmes were evaluated through incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits. Decision and parameter uncertainty were subjected to value-of-information analyses. Results The current UC and one of three MF programmes dominated the other alternatives. The MF programme was more costly but also more effective than UC at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)8,209.20/additional asthma case prevented. The value of perfect information to reduce uncertainty was (sic)291.6M at its lowest. Most of the uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness threshold was attributable to the probability and cost estimates for low-risk children. Conclusion This study supports the feasibility of a structured programme that simultaneously addresses exposure to house dust mites, pet dander, environmental tobacco, and breast-feeding as a cost-effective alternative to UC in the primary prevention of asthma amongst children.","[Ramos, G.

The combination of a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) and memantine has been shown to significantly delay admission to nursing homes as compared to treatment with a ChEI alone. The objective of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to evaluate the economic impact of the concomitant use of memantine and ChEI compared to ChEI alone. Markov modelling was used in order to simulate transitions over time among three discrete health states (non-institutionalised, institutionalised and deceased). Transition probabilities were obtained from observational studies and French national statistics, utilities from a previous US survey and costs from French national statistics. The analysis was conducted from societal and healthcare system perspectives. Mean time to nursing home admission was 4.57 years for ChEIs alone and 5.54 years for combination therapy, corresponding to 0.98 additional years, corresponding to a gain in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of 0.25. From a healthcare system perspective, overall costs were (sic)98,609 for ChEIs alone and (sic)90,268 for combination therapy, representing cost savings of (sic)8,341. From a societal perspective, overall costs were (sic)122,039 and (sic)118,721, respectively, representing cost savings of (sic)3,318. Deterministic and probabilistic (Monte Carlo simulations) sensitivity analyses indicated that combination therapy would be the dominant strategy in most scenarios. In conclusion, combination therapy with memantine and a ChEI is a cost-saving alternative compared to ChEI alone as it is associated with lower cost and increased QALYs from both a societal and a healthcare perspective.","[Touchon, Jacques] Univ Montpellier, Fac Med, F-34059 Montpellier, France; [Lachaine, Jean; Beauchemin, Catherine] Univ Montreal, Fac Pharm, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Granghaud, Anna] Lundbeck SAS, Market Access Dept, F-92445 Issy Les Moulineaux, France; [Rive, Benoit; Bineau, Sebastien] Lundbeck SAS, Global Outcomes Res Div, F-92445 Issy Les Moulineaux, France",Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montreal; Lundbeck Corporation; Lundbeck Corporation - France; Lundbeck Corporation; Lundbeck Corporation - France,"Bineau, S (通讯作者)，Lundbeck SAS, Global Outcomes Res Div, 43-45 Quai President Roosevelt, F-92445 Issy Les Moulineaux, France.",sebi@lundbeck.com,,,,,,,39,21,24,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The efficiency of shrimp farms is measured using group-frontier and meta-frontier analysis on a sample of 292 farms. The results show that, on average, shrimp farms are inefficient; extensive farms are more efficient than intensive and semi-intensive farms; and, controlling for key socio-economic factors, upstream farms are more efficient than downstream farms, suggesting that pollution from upstream farms may influence shrimp farm efficiency. The results give some direction for improvement and some evidence to shrimp farmers and policymakers in the MRD to take the pollution problem seriously and find solutions for more sustainable development.","[Nguyen, Kiet T.] Cantho Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ, Can Tho, Vietnam; [Fisher, Timothy C.

As such, they provide important, but only partial, pictures of how we might eat more sustainably. The complex politics underlying food production and distribution as well as factors that shape the highly uneven practices of food consumption are often obscured. Equally, and in the face of ongoing conflicts that suggest otherwise, supply-side analyses frequently assume that technological advances will play a relatively uncontested role in food futures. Drawing on insights from a participatory backcasting process that adopted a practice orientation within an overarching transitions framework, this paper adds two related dimensions to the productivist paradigm in urban food futures research. First, it places eating practices at the heart of food futures debates and second, it provides a critical reflection on consumer-citizen perceptions of the role for technology, and in particular ICT, in shaping those eating practices. Ultimately, it is argued that technological advances in production alone are unlikely to generate the significant transformations required to construct more sustainable urban future food landscapes.

The eastern Congolese mining sector is undergoing a period of profound change. Industrial exploitation, while still nascent in the Kivu provinces, appears poised to expand with a number of transnational mining companies currently exploring vast concessions. At the same time, there is a range of new initiatives to regulate and formalise the artisanal mining sector, but early evidence shows that they have failed to have a positive impact. We identify a number of factors hindering the effective implementation of these initiatives, namely state capacity and political will, the complex dynamics and power relations in the current system of artisanal mining and trade, the importance of these activities for livelihoods and the lack of alternative livelihoods. We also provide suggestions for future interventions, including initiatives to promote a viable artisanal mining sector which contributes to broader local development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Relative to the pre-recession period, a unit decrease in state aid was associated with a relative increase in local funding. To further probe the school district role, we explore whether the property tax rate, which reflects decisions of districts facing budgetary needs, responded to state aid cuts. We find, relative to the pre-recession period, the post-recession period was characterized by a strong negative relationship between property tax rate and state aid per pupil.

But as policy regimes shift, links between stated objectives and the tools or mechanisms to achieve those objectives need to be forged. This case study of forestry on the island of Newfoundland provides an illustration of the gaps between EBM policy and practice, and insights into why EBM can be difficult to implement Though the case of Newfoundland is unusual because of its isolation, narrow set of economic options, and weak ENGO sector, its adherence to a traditional timber regime offers lessons for the ways that policies move from agenda setting to implementation. In this case, the role of cultural entrenchment a commitment to timber-based management and to a provincial model of economic support for large-scale industry created a negative feedback loop that undermined new policy objectives. But a window of opportunity has emerged as a result of pulp and paper industry decline, and so overcoming cultural entrenchment and building a new forest management regime centered on EBM is possible through clearly articulated policy mechanisms and the integration of new forms of expertise.

Accounting for state dependence corrects the possible overestimation of the impact of socioeconomic factors. We estimated the degree of the state dependence of RPA and LHS among middle-aged Japanese workers. The 5 years' longitudinal data used in this study were taken from the Longitudinal Survey of Middle and Elderly Persons. Individual heterogeneity was found for both RPA and LHS, and the dynamic random-effects probit model provided the best specification. A smoking habit, low educational attainment, longer work hours, and longer commuting time had negative effects on RPA participation. RPA had positive effects on LHS, taking into consideration the possibility of confounding with other lifestyle variables. The degree of state dependence of LHS was positive and significant. Increasing the intensity of RPA had positive effects on LHS and caused individuals with RPA to exhibit greater persistence of LHS compared to individuals without RPA. This result implies that policy interventions that promote RPA, such as smoking cessation, have lasting consequences.

Policy and economic implications are intensely debated given the number and economic importance of participants. This article aims to provide insights into the market access issues arising in such negotiations. Should TISA negotiations result in participants exchanging the best commitments they have so far undertaken in their preferential trade agreements (PTAs) a reasonable starting point, TISA market access commitments would go well beyond commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and services offers tabled in the Doha Round. While this would be in itself a significant outcome (especially in terms of predictability and stability), we also highlight, however, that the real economic benefits would be reduced by the fact that a number of participants have already exchanged significant concessions amongst themselves through bilateral PTAs. Further, and more importantly, exchanging 'best PTA.' commitments would not meet the participants' most important export interests. These have often remained unaddressed in many of the previous bilateral negotiations or involve countries not currently participating in TISA. Addressing better these export interests would require going beyond an exchange of 'best PTA' commitments among TISA participants with the more difficult policy and negotiating decisions that this implies - and/or seeking to expand the group of participants.

One of the major goals of this policy is to increase the participation of local users in decision-making and for them to gain benefits from the forests. However, a lack of meaningful participation amongst users in resource governance has resulted in a failure to include socially marginalised groups in community decision-making. The main objective of this research is to explore what incentives are most likely to enhance the effective participation of local users in the governance and management of common property resources. In this study of community forestry management regimes in Nepal, access to resources and benefits, and enforcement of legal property rights are identified as the key influential incentives that determine the effective participation of users in resource governance. This study proposes proportional allocation of the most productive part of a community forest to a sub-group (formed within a user group) of the poor and disadvantaged members, and the transference and enforcement of legal property rights to this sub-group over the allocated forest, in order to protect their access rights to resources and to secure their greater participation in resource governance.

The GGP uses a public payment scheme to propel the participation of rural households in order to make the program acceptable and sustainable. The modification of the GGP for its long-term effectiveness has raised interest from researchers. However, few researchers have realized the role that rural households play in adjusting the GGP. By building an econometric model, we found that the decision making of rural households is optimal when the sum of the marginal benefit from residual farmland and the marginal benefit from agricultural labor time equals the sum of the subsidies for retired farmland, benefits from the increased forest/grassland and the opportunity cost rate of the rural household engaged in agricultural labor divided by agricultural labor efficiency. The results derived by a Logit regression method indicate that the economic benefit and non-monetary values stimulate households' willingness to participate, and households' attitudes have significant effects on their willingness. Our attempt to comprehensively explore the influencing factors concerning households' attitudes, the environment benefits and benefits from the GGP proves to be promising as a reference for future studies and for decision making regarding GGP.

Patients undergoing knee replacements in 2009-2011 completed the EQ-5D and OKS before and after surgery. Responsiveness was compared using the standardized response mean (SRM). Stratified analyses based on change scores in the OKS were utilized to investigate how changes in the outcome measures related to each other. Patients were grouped based on the preoperative OKS to examine the relationship of change in the EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS with respect to initial health status. For the overall cohort (54,486 patients), mean change scores pre/post knee replacement were 0.30 for the EQ-5D index (SD 0.33; SRM = 0.90), 3.3 for the EQ-VAS (SD 21.0; SRM = 0.16), and 14.9 for the OKS (SD 9.9; SRM = 1.50). The OKS changed uniformly with the EQ-5D index, but less concordantly with the EQ-VAS in response to knee replacement surgery. Substantial functional improvement was needed before mean EQ-VAS change scores showed improvement. Patients with worse preoperative health status had greater improvement following surgery, but the improvement in the EQ-5D index did not necessarily translate into comparable improvement in self-perceived well-being measured by the EQ-VAS. On average, patients self-rated their health systematically lower using the EQ-VAS compared to the EQ-5D index and OKS following knee replacement. The EQ-VAS captured information about how patients feel about their health pre-/post-surgical intervention that contrasted with more functional measures of health. Additional qualitative research is needed to better understand these differences.","[Lin, Fang-Ju; Samp, Jennifer; Pickard, A.

Data were analysed for a cohort of participants from the general practice research database. Empirical estimates informed a Markov model that included five long-term conditions (diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, colorectal cancer and depression). Simulations compared an intervention promoting physical activity in healthy adults with standard care. The intervention effect on physical activity was from a meta-analysis of randomised trials. The annual cost of intervention, in the base case, was one family practice consultation per participant year. The primary outcome was net health benefit in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). A cohort of 262,704 healthy participants entered the model. Intervention was associated with an increase in life years lived free from physical disease. With 5 years intervention the increase was 52 (95 % interval -11 to 115) per 1,000 participants entering the model (probability increased 91.9 %); with 10 years intervention the increase was 102 (42-164) per 1,000 (probability 99.7 %). Net health benefits at a threshold of A 30,000 pound per QALY were 3.2 (-11.1 to 16.9) QALYs per 1,000 participants with 5 years intervention (probability cost-effective 64.7 %) and 5.0 (-9.5 to 19.3) with 10 years intervention (probability cost-effective 72.4 %). A universal strategy to promote physical activity in primary care has the potential to increase life years lived free from physical disease.

In other words, firms with better governance mechanisms and those considered value stocks will be less adversely affected by a political crisis; thus, their investors will suffer fewer negative effects.","[Huang, Hsu-Huei] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chan, Min-Lee] Providence Univ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Yang, Ann Shawing] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Int Management, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung; Providence University - Taiwan; National Cheng Kung University,"Huang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",hhhuang@nuk.edu.tw; chanml@pu.edu.tw; annsyang@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This study analyzes the impact of changing family structures on the income distribution among adult Costa Rican women between 1993 and 2009, using decomposition methods. There was a general increase in the share of family structures associated with lower incomes (singles with dependents) until 2001. After 2001, this trend reversed for women at the upper end of the income distribution, while it continued for women at the lower end. Correspondingly, this study finds a general negative effect of changing family structures on incomes of adult women until 2001, and an inequality-increasing effect after 2001. The change in trends might be due to a law coming into force in 2001 that mandated DNA tests for presumptive fathers unwilling to recognize their children.","[Kasy, Maximilian] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ramos-Chaves, Alvaro] Univ Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica",Harvard University; Universidad Costa Rica,"Kasy, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",maximiliankasy@fas.harvard.edu; ramos.alvaro@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,1,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In particular, environmental variables are represented by patients' characteristics and quality indicators are based on technical aspects. In order to deal with both aspects, different extensions of data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology are applied. Specifically, we use weight restrictions to ensure that the efficiency scores assigned to the evaluated units take quality data into account, and a four-stage model to identify which exogenous variables have impact on performance as well as to compute efficiency scores that incorporate this information explicitly. The results provide evidence in support of the importance of including information about both aspects in the analysis so that the efficiency measures obtained can be interpreted as an accurate reflection of performance.","[Cordero Ferrera, Jose Manuel; Crespo Cebada, Eva; Murillo Zamorano, Luis R.] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Ferrera, JMC (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Av Elvas S-N, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain.",jmcordero@unex.es,"FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/S-5567-2018; Murillo-Zamorano, Luis R./P-3201-2019; Murillo-Zamorano, Luis R./E-1171-2016","FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/0000-0001-8783-6748; Murillo-Zamorano, Luis R./0000-0002-0540-4296",,,,,52,35,39,0,74,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Little attention has been paid to the gendered implications of such deals in the literature, and most regulatory initiatives do not address gender adequately. To fill this gap, this contribution identifies implications of land deals for women and recommends measures to mitigate negative impacts. It reviews evidence from four case studies commissioned for the International Land Coalition (ILC) Global Study of Commercial Pressures on Land conducted in 2010. The evidence is analyzed within a framework that posits women's vulnerability to land deals as due to four dimensions of underlying discrimination. This study analyzes three of these dimensions in depth, arguing that women are likely to be affected differently by land deals and disproportionately more likely to be negatively affected than men.","[Daley, Elizabeth] Mokoro Ltd, Oxford OX4 1JE, England; [Pallas, Sabine] Secretariat Int Land Coalit ILC, I-00142 Rome, Lazio, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Linguistica Computazionale A.

Bioeconomic modelling is used so the interactions between biological and economic processes can be analyzed. Overall, it is found that cobia farming is moderately to highly profitable when compared to other aquaculture species in Vietnam. Culture practices and the level of intensity of cobia farming differ significantly across Vietnam. Initial stocking density, total number of fish stocked, number and size of cages, and quantity of feed used are all higher in southern Vietnam than the north. The higher level of intensification in the south leads to significantly higher total costs, productivity and profitability. The dominant cost source is feed, which is predominantly low-value fish. To capture the environmental and potential economic benefits of adopting pelleted diets, then negative farmer perceptions regarding relatively slow growth rates, and lack of availability compared with low-value fish need to be overcome.","[Petersen, Elizabeth H.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley 6009, Australia; [Petersen, Elizabeth H.] Adv Choice Econ Pty Ltd, Bateman, Australia; [Tran Dinh Luan; Dam Thi My Chinh; Tran Quoc Binh] Res Inst Aquaculture 1, Tu Son, Bac Ninh, Vietnam; [Vu Anh Tuan; Le Van Truc] Bac Lieu Expt Stn Aquaculture, Nha Mat Ward, Bac Lieu City, Bac Lieu Provin, Vietnam; [Glencross, Brett D.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Cleveland, Qld, Australia",University of Western Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Petersen, EH (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley 6009, Australia.",Liz.Petersen@tpg.com.au,,"Petersen, Elizabeth/0000-0002-1250-1692",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR),Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res),The authors would like to sincerely thank the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) for funding this project.,,26,14,15,0,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The Triple Helix approach is well known in HE and research, implying co-operation among education institutions, public administrations, and enterprises. According to the authors' research, this approach could be useful also in reforming VET systems to promote innovation and employability. The aim of the paper is to evaluate establishment of a model approach with Triple Helix idea for VET as a mechanism for public administrations at national and regional/community level to promote innovation and employability. The tasks are to determine effective ways of co-operation of educators, employers and public administration, and to evaluate the possible approaches. The study was carried out by a desk research and by an empirical study. As a result of the study, theoretical approaches were developed for applying the Triple Helix idea for VET policy making and implementation by public administrations. Conclusions were drawn that, although without a specific reference, elements of the Triple Helix approach already exist in the current EU and Latvian VET, and employment policies and their implementation. Awareness should be raised for public administrations on the potential benefits of a conscious (systemic) application of the Triple Helix approach in VET policy making. Different models should be developed, compared and piloted in local or regional settings to create recommendations for national policies.","[Buligina, Ilze; Sloka, Biruta; Dzelme, Juris; Tora, Ginta] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,Ilze.Buligina@inbox.lv,"Dzelme, Juris/ABG-4980-2021; Sloka, Biruta/K-5043-2017","Dzelme, Juris/0000-0002-7307-1163;",,,,,25,2,2,0,5,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-2-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,35,,,,,217,225,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347133500024,0

Also, the data series are characterized by volatility clustering, making the hedging even more necessary and valuable. We estimate the static OHR using two ordinary least squares methods (conventional and by incorporating the market expectations in the regression) and an error-correction model (ECM).

There were clear growth tendencies in farm income in the period (2004-2011) in all analysed countries. The largest increase was in the Czech Republic and Lithuania. The author has stated that income of farms is increasingly affected by subsidies, which act as stabilisers in terms of economic downturn. In the case of farms in the Czech Republic and Germany, the level of balance subsidies and taxes in most of the analysed years was higher than gained income. This indicates that the scale of the production, advanced processes of concentration, and capital-intensity (in Germany), are unable to spontaneously solve the income problems of farms based only on the market mechanism.","[Grzelak, Aleksander] PoznanUniv Econ, Dept Macroecon & Food Econ, Poznan, Poland",,,agrzelak@interia.pl,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,9,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9934-8466-2-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,35,,,,,256,264,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347133500028,0

What is more, managers do not have clear information which management structure they should choose to be able to normalize the situation in the hospitals as they are attacked by two extreme groups having different remedies for the hospitals' problems.","[Kaszyk, Bartlomiej] Natl Louis Univ, Chicago, IL 60603 USA; [Kaszyk, Bartlomiej] Natl Louis Univ Poland, Wyzsza Szkola Biznesu, PL-33300 Nowy Sacz, Poland",National Louis University,"Kaszyk, B (通讯作者)，Natl Louis Univ, Chicago, IL 60603 USA.",bkaszyk@wsb-nlu.edu.pl,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,WYZSZA SZKOLA BIZNESUNATL-LOUIS UNIV,NOWY SACZ,"ZIELONA 27, NOWY SACZ, 33-300, POLAND",2543-540X,2543-5388,978-83-62550-98-2,BUS NON-PROFIT ORGAN,,,2014,13.0,,,,,,195,208,,,,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE4CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371505700015,0

A corresponding model of the wood market of a Swiss canton, consisting of a coupled roundwood and wood fuel market, is presented. The model includes wood-producing agents, such as public foresters and private forest owners, roundwood-consuming agents, such as sawmills, different classes of wood fuel consumers, and in-between wood traders. Other important model elements include agent interaction and negotiation, execution and scheduling structures, and agent adaptation mechanisms. Two sets of scenarios demonstrate the model's power for scenario exploration. The first set of scenarios analyzes the effects of an excess and scarce supply of wood on both markets. The second set looks for the optimal number of roundwood agents in the market from the perspective of the various stakeholders involved. Taking a more in-depth view of important design decisions and their pros and cons, this study argues that ABM offers new opportunities for the explorative study of wood markets as a result of these markets' special characteristics.

In this context, factors such as institutional framework, regional/local leadership and quality of regional/local governance can play an important role in supporting the efforts of residents towards economic and social development and to mitigate the significant gap that separates the lagging regions to those developed. Good institutions, good governance and good leadership are considered by many authors as necessary conditions to support the development effort of a country or region. These three elements and the relationships between them fulfill the role of factors catalyzing entrepreneurial initiatives. This article aims to find an answer to several questions: To what extent regional development is influenced by the interrelations between institutions, leadership and quality of governance and how this influence manifests itself? The low level of development of Romania's regions can be attributed to the low quality of regional governance? Can we talk about real decentralization and quality of regional governance in Romania's case? What aspects of quality of governance at regional level are important for development? To find answers to these questions we used data and information on national and regional development in EU countries, the quality of institutions and governance, from different sources: official statistics EUROSTAT, European Commission reports, scientific studies, reports of international organizations on development indexes and governance indicators.

Wetlands are an important type of ecosystem, which are highly degradable and accordingly PES become relevant for the sustainable management of wetlands. In Tanzania deforestation in catchment forests has affected many wetlands so much that they cannot adequately contribute to quantity and quality supply of water throughout the year. This study uses consumption surveys and choice modelling to examine the values attached by communities in and around Kilombero Valley to the conservation of catchment trees as compared to the market price value of wood used for timber products in the wetlands. Results show that although conservation preference is generally positive among both rural and urban communities for the trees, the Willingness to Pay (WTP) for the rural dwellers is in proportion to approximately less than 1% of what they receive from the market. Again, the WTP for the rural communities is three times lower than that of the urban communities. These findings are important to policy makers and conservationists in making informed economic decisions on how PES schemes can be used to enhance sustainable management of wetlands.

In the present paper we argue that prestart-up planning supports the entrepreneur with identification of necessary resources and infrastructure that help him achieve the business vision and goals. As such, the paper strives to develop a more meaningful content for the notion of social capital, by acknowledging the social capital structure and components in the acceptation of the most popular scholars in the research field. It also examines the social capital dimensions and sources of generation in the pre-entry stage of the entrepreneurial process, by reviewing the current state of art built around different researches conducted in the specialized literature. To support the entrepreneurial behaviour of creating social capital, the article is concluded with a discussion of the role of social capital in the pre-start up planning, as component of the pre-entry knowledge possessed by the entrepreneurs, such that the social capital becomes not only an enabler for achieving the breakeven point, but a driver for success and profitability. If the current state or art looks at the pre-entry knowledge as prerequisite for the wealth of an organization, this paper articulates the importance of social capital, as key component and contributor to the company's success.","[Paunescu, Carmen; Badea, Mihaela Raluca] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paunescu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Romana Sq 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",carmen.paunescu@fabiz.ase.ro,"Badea, Mihaela/ABA-4479-2020; Paunescu, Carmen/ABD-1883-2020",,,,,,31,5,5,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-5671,,,PROC ECON FINANC,,,2014,15.0,,,,,,560,568,,10.1016/S2212-5671(14)00510-3,0.0,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EB,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357094000070,0

A spatial-dynamic bioeconomic simulation embeds three biological impacts on shrimp: mortality, growth, and aggregation on hypoxic edges. Hypoxia creates feedbacks in the bioeconomic system, altering catch and effort patterns. System changes propagate over space to affect areas that do not experience hypoxia. Areas that might otherwise be considered controls in a natural experiments framework are contaminated by the ecological disturbance through spatial sorting. Aggregate predictions from simulations are similar to empirical fishery data. Average shrimp size and total landings are negatively correlated, as are hypoxic severity and landings. Shrimp size and hypoxic severity are only weakly negatively correlated. Growth overfishing, which varies with recruitment success and ecological disturbances, is a key mediating effect.","[Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27701 USA; [Asche, Frank; Oglend, Atle] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Bennear, Lori S.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27701 USA; [Bennear, Lori S.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27701 USA",Duke University; Universitetet i Stavanger; Duke University; Duke University,"Smith, MD (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27701 USA.",marsmith@duke.edu; frank.asche@uis.no; lori.bennear@duke.edu; atle.oglend@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020; Smith, Martin/D-9168-2016","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728; Smith, Martin/0000-0002-4714-463X; Bennear, Lori/0000-0003-2541-5459",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA09NOS4780235]; Research Council of Norway,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"Financial support for this research was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Grant #NA09NOS4780235 and by the Research Council of Norway.

Studies of financialization interrogate how an increasingly autonomous realm of global finance has altered the underlying logics of the industrial economy and the inner workings of democratic society. This paper evaluates the insights of more than a decade of scholarship on financialization. Three approaches will be discussed: the emergence of a new regime of accumulation, the ascendency of the shareholder value orientation and the financialization of everyday life. It is argued that a deeper understanding of financialization will lead to a better understanding of organized interests, the politics of the welfare state, and processes of institutional change.","Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Adv Labour Studies AIAS, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"van der Zwan, N (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Adv Labour Studies AIAS, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",n.a.j.vanderzwan@uva.nl,,,,,,,139,748,753,26,372,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The new values creation process has its revenues and expenditures. Any optimal organization strives to increase revenues through cost management. The expenditure which arises from work related injuries comprises 4 percent of world GDP. Thus, it is necessary to create an environment which will decrease the number of work related injuries by combining values of the organizational culture and by appropriate attitude towards human resources. Organizational culture groups all business operations into a whole, whereas human resources enable a more effective usage of material and non-material resources. By surveying the available literature, we can notice that there is a relatively small number of papers which deal with the role of human resources in the process of defining the organizational culture which will have an effect on the increase of the organizational competencies. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the national and international literature with the aim of defining the role of human capital which will, due to the appropriate organizational culture, contribute to lowering the number of work related injuries and consequently to lowering the costs and increasing organizational competencies. The initial hypothesis is the view that human capital, through appropriate organizational culture, contributes to decreasing the number and the severity of work related injuries, thus lowering the costs and increasing the organizational competencies. In this paper we will try to indicate the need for educating those who deal with human resources and the need for their better understanding of the role and importance of organizational culture in the process of decreasing the number and severity of work related injuries and that is the scientific contribution of this paper.","[Zivkovic, Snezana] Fac Occupat Safety Nis, Nish, Serbia; [Todorovic, Milisa] Tim Protekt Doo, Stara Pazova, Serbia",,"Zivkovic, S (通讯作者)，Fac Occupat Safety Nis, Nish, Serbia.",snezana.zivkovic@znrfak.ni.ac.rs; milisa.todorovic@gmail.com,"Živković, Snežana/L-8019-2016","Živković, Snežana/0000-0002-7931-9334",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,506,516,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000050,0

Using micro health data from India, we highlight sex-selective prenatal investments as a new channel via which parents practice discriminatory behavior. We find that mothers visit antenatal clinics and receive tetanus shots more frequently when pregnant with a boy. Preferential prenatal treatment of males is greater in regions known to have strong son preference and among women whose previous children are female. We address other mechanisms such as selective recall, medical complications that might cause male fetuses to receive greater prenatal care in general, son preference-based fertility stopping rules and biases due to sex-selective abortions. Our calculations suggest that sex-selective prenatal care in maternal tetanus vaccination explains between 2.6-7.2 percent of excess female neonatal mortality in India.","[Bharadwaj, Prashant] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Lakdawala, Leah K.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Michigan State University,"Bharadwaj, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",prbharadwaj@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,43,57,74,0,74,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

However, with few long-term REDD + pilot projects implemented with smallholders, this paper attempts to anticipate potential synergies and constraints of such initiatives from smallholders' point of view by developing a framework to examine the capacities of two rural communities in Cameroon as a case study. Smallholder experiences with REDD + pilots and their predecessors such as integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs), Payments for Environmental Services (PES) and the Clean Development Mechanism's Afforestation/Reforestation Projects (CDM AR), are outlined in order to highlight local-level REDD + project requirements. This paper assesses the capacity for smallholders in the South and Centre Provinces of Cameroon to respond to these requirements through data collected from individual and small-group key informant interviews. The two case study communities possess similar but different livelihood capitals regarding proximities to market, forest cover, livelihood strategies and access to extension services. For both villages smallholder capacity for future REDD + project adoption was found to require reinforcement to guarantee local feasibility of REDD + projects. Possibilities to encourage already in use agroforestry systems under a REDD + scheme are discussed. From these results, we outline recommendations, areas of concern and key targets for capacity building for future REDD + initiatives with smallholders in rural Africa. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It adopts a culturally informed geographical political economy approach that explores why institutions most seriously affected by the 2007-2009 crisis were located in peripheral locations. The banking crisis is viewed as an episodic round of spatial centralisation in the City of London, reinforcing a previous round of concentration of banking institutions in the late 19th century, and the article analyses the wider implications of this process of concentration for peripheral regions increasingly integrated into a financial sector dominated by the capital.

Furthermore, we include four-quarter lagged gross domestic product (GDP) in the model to assure that yield spread is a good predictor of recessions, even when controlling for GDP changes.

The method expands the set of partially-observed Markov decision process (POMDP) problems that can be solved with standard dynamic programming tools by addressing dimensionality problems in the decision maker's belief state. Density projection is suitable for uncertainty over both physical states (e.g. resource stock) and process structure (e.g. biophysical parameters). We apply the method to an adaptive management problem under structural uncertainty in which a fishery manager's harvest policy affects both the stock of fish and the belief state about the process governing reproduction. We solve for the optimal endogenous learning policy the active adaptive management approach and compare it to passive learning and non-learning strategies. We demonstrate how learning improves efficiency but typically follows a period of costly short-run investment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Nominative linkage techniques have been used to correct the underregistration of women's activity in the Enumerator Books with information from the Labor Census from each village.

Women's high level of participation - 68.6 percent for the entire province - varies considerably, depending on local economic conditions. Job opportunities for women and socioeconomic characteristics of households act as first-order explanatory factors. Women in proto-industrial economies, like Bizkaia's, which combined the extraction, transport, and marketing of iron with agriculture and fishing, show greater participation. Demand for women's labor was linked to jobs without recognized qualifications. The association of women's participation with demographic variables is not manifest in the historical data. The results show that supply factors do not explain the variance in women's activity.","Univ Pais Vasco Hist Contemporanea, Leioa 48940, Spain",,"Pérez-Fuentes, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pais Vasco Hist Contemporanea, Barrio Sarriena S-N, Leioa 48940, Spain.",pilar.perezfuentes@ehu.es,,,,,,,39,16,17,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The DDA has clearly created a strong footing for the delivery of the WTO's trade capacity building programmes. The evidence suggests that the beneficiaries are now much better equipped to address the challenges of the Multilateral Trading System (MTS), to take active part in the negotiations, define their strategic objectives and defend their economic and trade interests.

In recent years, considerable investments have been made to correct this, but we lack evidence about the extent to which these investments were accompanied by changes in the characteristics of the workforce. Using nationally representative data, we find that the historical characterization of the ECCE workforce continues to apply. However, we also find that the average educational attainment, compensation, and stability of ECCE workers increased substantially from 1990 to 2010. Surprisingly, the shift in the composition of the ECCE workforce toward more regulated settings and away from home-based settings is not the primary driver of these changes. Contrary to our expectations, gains within the home-based workforce are the primary drivers, though the education and wages of home-based workers remain substantially lower than among formal-care workers.","[Bassok, Daphna] Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Fitzpatrick, Maria] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Loeb, Susanna; Paglayan, Agustina S.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Educ Policy Anal, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Virginia; Cornell University; Stanford University,"Bassok, D (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",dbassok@virginia.edu; mdf98@cornell.edu; sloeb@stanford.edu; paglayan@stanford.edu,"Fitzpatrick, Maria Donovan/A-7099-2012","Fitzpatrick, Maria/0000-0001-5341-1629; Loeb, Susanna/0000-0003-1854-8843",,,,,36,20,32,0,21,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Until very recently, the approaches used in these studies have remained relatively unchanged. However, the global forest sector has been faced with major structural changes and its operating environment has become ever more complex and interlinked with other sectors. The aim of this article is to review the forest sector outlook approaches in face of these changes, and to analyze how well they have been able to capture and project the changes. Moreover, we raise the question of whether they seem informative enough for the purposes of today's decision makers and other stakeholders. The results indicate that the existing outlook studies have not been able to sufficiently capture the structural changes in global paper markets, and it may be that they have difficulties in considering the possible structural changes in other markets as well. In order to assess the changes occurring in the operating environment more systematically, and to better meet the needs of policy-makers and stakeholders, there are potential advantages in complementing the current modeling approach dominant in the forest sector with other methods from the field of foresight.

For young people seeking careers in creative occupations, the expectation of insecure employment conditions has become normalised. This may be the combined effect of intergenerational changes in the youth labour market generally, and the nature of employment in creative industries at all career stages. The article draws from 80 life history interviews conducted in Western Sydney, Australia, a region with high concentrations of unemployment and low socio-economic status. Their perspectives problematise the common assumption that young creative workers seek to resist insecure patterns of work or long for the stable jobs of the past. Partly, they have accepted the injunction for vocational restlessness' in their industries. Both in their day jobs' and in their attempts to get into their chosen part of the creative industry, they feel that not staying in one position too long can be both liberating and adaptive. Union campaigns highlighting the perils of insecurity are unlikely to resonate with them.","[Morgan, George] Univ Western Sydney, Inst Culture & Soc, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Wood, Julian] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Nelligan, Pariece] Univ Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia",Western Sydney University; University of Sydney; Western Sydney University,"Morgan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Inst Culture & Soc, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",george.morgan@uws.edu.au,,,,,,,53,52,61,2,37,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

We compare a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade scheme for the policy bloc, in either case accompanied by an efficient offset mechanism for reducing emissions in the fringe. The policy bloc is shown to prefer a tax over a cap, since only a tax reduces the fuel export price and by more when the policy bloc is larger. Offsets are also more favorable to the policy bloc under a tax than under a cap. The optimal offset price under a carbon tax is below the tax rate, while under a cap and free quota trading the offset price must equal the quota price. The domestic carbon and offset prices are both higher under a tax than under a cap when the policy bloc is small. When the policy bloc is larger, the offset price can be higher under a cap. Fringe countries gain by mitigation in the policy bloc, more under a carbon tax since the fuel import price is lower. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This demand-driven initiative alongside the importance of European markets for timber exports have prompted Cameroon to sign a Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Voluntary Partnership Agreement (FLEGT/VPA) with the European Union. This paper reviews the impacts of this policy. Firstly, the institutional arrangement for timber production is presented with special focus on various legal forms of forest exploitation. Secondly, the estimated costs for the required development and control of various types of forest management are presented. Finally the impacts of the FLEGT/VPA on forest governance, forest management, timber trade and socio-economic and development issues is explored. The positive impact of the agreement will be especially felt by industrial forest concession holders that harvest timber products for exports to international markets, but it will hardly be the case of community forests. However, the implementation of the agreement will engender huge financial costs for forest managers and national governments. Also, the livelihoods of small-scale loggers (who are the main suppliers of national markets) may be adversely affected by the procurement policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For the Chinese banking sector, we discover that the portfolio risk of foreign financial institution will decrease after acquiring equity stakes when its asset increases, the debt ratio decreases, and the required risk-weighted asset increases. Overall, these foreign financial institutions have well-diversified currency portfolios and enjoy better asset quality and surplus earnings; therefore, they will likely increase their optimal acquisition equity stake ratio if the Chinese banks in which they invest have with good quality assets and are focused on local business.","[Chang, Hui-Lung; Liao, Szu-Lang] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Money & Banking, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Wu, Sou-Shan] Secur & Futures Inst, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Chang, HL (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Money & Banking, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",95352504@nccu.edu.tw; chair@sfi.org.tw; liaosl@nccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Furthermore, coordinated movements in price and quantity can distinguish this increase in demand from changes in supply induced by the treatment's income effects.

There are negative effects of younger siblings' school attendance on girls' school entry, and positive effects of older brothers' literacy only when they have left school. This is consistent with an impeding role of credit constraints. The long-run effects of educated siblings once they have left school are positive.

This paper uses both a single-equation and a simultaneous equations approach to investigate empirically the interactive relationship between technological innovation and the growth of health expenditure in the context of the pharmaceutical market in Taiwan. Based on observing 182 therapeutic groups between 1997 and 2006, we find evidence to support the argument that technological innovation and health expenditure are determined simultaneously as technological innovation, and that the growth of health expenditure are endogenous rather than exogenous. Specifically, we find that therapeutic groups associated with higher pharmaceutical expenditure are likely to attract more new products to the market. Meanwhile, therapeutic groups with more new products are associated with higher pharmaceutical expenditures. An important implication of the paper is that cost containment policies will affect not only the growth of health expenditure, but also the progress of technological innovation in the health sector.","[Hsieh, Chee-Ruey] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Liu, Ya-Ming] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 402, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Cheng Kung University; National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University,"Liu, YM (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",crh@econ.sinica.edu.tw; ymliu@mail.ncku.edu.tw; changchialin@nchu.edu.tw,"Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X",,,,,23,4,4,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Post-intervention predicted and reported utilities were compared, and the effect of disease severity on the observed differences was examined. A cohort of 120 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients (60.0% female, mean age 59.0) embarking on therapy with biological agents completed the Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ) and the EQ-5D at baseline, and at 3, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. OLS regression produced a mapping equation to estimate post-intervention EQ-5D utilities from baseline MHAQ data. Predicted and reported utilities were compared with t test, and the prediction error was modeled, using fixed effects, in terms of covariates such as age, gender, time, disease duration, treatment, RF, DAS28 score, predicted and reported EQ-5D. The OLS model (RMSE = 0.207, R (2) = 45.2%) consistently underestimated future utilities, with a mean prediction error of 6.5%. Mean absolute differences between reported and predicted EQ-5D utilities at 3, 6 and 12 months exceeded the typically reported MID of the EQ-5D (0.03). According to the fixed-effects model, time, lower predicted EQ-5D and higher DAS28 scores had a significant impact on prediction errors, which appeared increasingly negative for lower reported EQ-5D scores, i.e., predicted utilities tended to be lower than reported ones in more severe health states. This study builds upon existing research having demonstrated the potential usefulness of mapping disease-specific instruments onto utility measures. The specific issue of longitudinal validity is addressed, as mapping models derived from baseline patients need to be validated on post-therapy samples. The underestimation of post-treatment utilities in the present study, at least in more severe patients, warrants further research before it is prudent to conduct cost-utility analyses in the context of RA by means of the MHAQ alone.","[Kontodimopoulos, Nick; Bozios, Panagiotis; Yfantopoulos, John; Niakas, Dimitris] Hellen Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, Patras 26222, Greece; [Bozios, Panagiotis] Gen Hosp Asklipieio Voulas, Rheumatol Clin, Athens, Greece; [Yfantopoulos, John] Univ Athens, Athens 11528, Greece",Hellenic Open University; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Kontodimopoulos, N (通讯作者)，Hellen Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, Bouboulinas 57, Patras 26222, Greece.",nkontodi@otenet.gr,"Yfantopoulos, John/ABA-7730-2020","Yfantopoulos, John/0000-0003-0424-6887; Kontodimopoulos, Nick/0000-0003-4590-6634; Niakas, Dimitris/0000-0003-0528-755X",,,,,47,9,11,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Recognising this threat, an international standard for the treatment of WPM (ISPM 15) is being implemented by many countries. In addition, the United States has considered application of similar requirements to WPM used in domestic and bilateral trade with Canada. We use a domestic margin-inclusive version of the Global Trade Analysis model to estimate the economic and trade impacts of ISPM 15, along with alternatives of varying stringency. We also estimate the economic impacts of one of the benefits of ISPM 15; averted United States forest owner timber losses. ISPM 15 is likely to have a small, negative effect on exports and economic welfare for most countries. However, there is significant regional and sectoral variation, depending on the product mix traded. If ISPM 15 requirements are extended to United States domestic trade, the impacts on the United States are stronger. Inclusion of averted United States timber losses partly, but not completely, offset welfare and trade impacts of the ISPM 15 treatment. These results must be tempered with the additional benefits of ISPM 15 in terms of potential averted household and environmental damages. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The two versions of DSGE models are estimated on Tunisia data with Bayesian methods. Also, we compare the welfare properties of various monetary policies. In particular, the Ramsey allocation has been computed, giving a natural benchmark for welfare comparisons. Our results show that the DSGE model with nominal and real rigidities generate significant and persistent real effects in response to monetary policy shocks. In addition, the monetary authority absorbs shocks and protects the economy of technological shocks. Therefore, our estimates show that, despite the apparent similarities of the two versions of models (Calvo and the Sticky Information), their responses to shocks and fit to data are quite different. Consequently, monetary and economic authorities cannot afford to rely on a single reference model of the economy but need a large number of alternative modeling tools available when they take their decision of optimal monetary policy, since by definition each model is itself a simplification that does not take into account all relevant aspects of reality.","[Drissi, Ramzi; Gaaloul, Sofiene] Carthage Univ, Carthage, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"Drissi, R (通讯作者)，Carthage Univ, Carthage, Tunisia.",rdrissi@esg.fr; sofi-gaaloul@yahoo.fr,"DRISSI, Ramzi/GRY-6655-2022","DRISSI, Ramzi/0000-0002-8710-4499",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-3-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,125,146,,,,,,22,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4MA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336000900013,0

We provide survey-based empirical evidence supporting hypotheses I and III, but find no evidence for hypothesis II.

People more and more must address the problems associated with the degradation of soil properties due to man. Increasingly, organic soil amendments, such as compost are being examined for their potential use in soil restoration and for preventing soil erosion. In the Czech Republic, compost is the most used to improve soil structure and increase the content of soil organic matter. Land reclamation/restoration is one of the ways to evaluate industrially produced compost because Czech farmers are not willing to use compost as organic fertilizer. The most common use of reclamation substrates in the Czech Republic is for the rehabilitation of landfills and contaminated sites. This paper deals with the influence of reclamation substrates (RS) with different proportions of compost and sand on selected chemical soil properties. Chemical properties vary proportionally with addition of compost and sand to the control variant (topsoil). On the other hand, in the preparation of reclamation substrates should be taken into account possible phytotoxic effect on the cultivated plant. The phytotoxicity effect of reclamation substrate will be evaluated in the following measurements.","[Kubna, D.; Plosek, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kubná, D (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",lukas.plosek@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,327,330,,,,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800056,0

Students' perceptions of importance of subject-specific and generic competencies and experiences, preferred area of work, and willingness to do a Master's degree were asked through a questionnaire in the respective national language. Quantitative analyses included comparisons across universities and study years, as well as influence of gender, grades, and satisfaction. Great similarities across the countries regarding the students' views on subject-specific competencies and experiences, as well as on the preferred areas of work were found. The students highly valued field experiences as well as areas such as environmental protection. Upon graduation a majority wished to work in the management of public forests, followed by industries in the case of Brazil and Finland and research in the case of China. Changes across the study years, such as the increasing importance given to oral and writing skills by students of later years, were observed.

Out of a total of 224 registered timber firms in Ghana, eight have initiated FSC certification. Customer demands, prospects of consolidating or increasing market shares, and a perceived need to invest in resource productivity are the main stated reasons for initiated certification uptake. Respondents from non-certified firms point out high compliance costs as a key reason not to certify. Owners and managers from these firms, however, hold little specific knowledge about certification requirements and costs. This calls for careful interpretation of statements on compliance costs as a factor discouraging certification uptake. Weak State-led governance, which creates an unpredictable business environment, constitutes another impeding factor for certification uptake in Ghana. This stresses the complimentary role of State-led governance in underpinning the functionality of certification. Norms such as resistance towards western imperialism, regulatory interference, and not regarding forest resource maintenance as the responsibility of the timber firms, are in the study found to constitute an additional and important factor affecting decisions not to engage in certification. The paper suggests that further attention be given to this aspect of certification uptake dynamics. Finally, the paper discusses the possibilities for synergies between FLEGT VPA legality verification and FSC certification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Results show that higher household wealth is associated with lower child labor and higher schooling.

Fin damage can be reduced during freshwater production by the use of feeding systems that deliver food in accordance with the fish's current appetite, rather than at fixed times. The bio-economic implications of feeding fish to appetite using demand feeding technology were modelled with the BENEFISH decision analysis tool. Using figures for Scottish smolt production, results from the model show that implementing demand feeders generates welfare benefits, but at a clear economic cost.","[Stewart, Lyndsey A.

Departing from previous analyses, we consider a framework where the regulator has multiple, rather than a single, measures of ambient pollution in a setting where many firms are subject to a self-reported emissions tax that is not perfectly enforceable. Under a budget-driven mission, we show that a regulator can fruitfully utilize the added information from multiple ambient monitoring receptors to induce improved environmental compliance through the creation of strategic interactions among firms. Additionally, our results provide new evidence on the relative efficiency of budget- vs. target-driven environmental enforcement missions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The uneven behavior of trading noise across investors and time of day makes it a specific, rather than general, transaction cost, contrary to Stoll's (2000) finding.

Yet the topic is widely neglected. This is particularly surprising given the 2007-2008 credit crunch, which created in 2009 the first global recession since the 1930s. Ownership played a crucial role, from the drive for 'shareholder value', through to the mortgages for home ownership used to create new financial instruments. The resulting bad debts were taken on by governments seeking to prevent a collapse of the global and national monetary systems. This transformed the banking crisis into a sovereign debt crisis. Whether a new era of global economic prosperity can be found depends on whether the importance of ownership is recognised, with policies for diversifying ownership forms to create systemic resilience.","[Michie, Jonathan] Univ Oxford, Dept Continuing Educ, Oxford OX2 6PN, England; [Michie, Jonathan] Univ Oxford, Kellogg Coll, Oxford OX2 6PN, England; [Lobao, Linda] Ohio State Univ, Dept Rural Sociol Sociol & Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Michie, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Continuing Educ, Oxford OX2 6PN, England.",jonathan.michie@kellogg.ox.ac.uk; lobao.1@osu.edu,"Michie, Jonathan/IRZ-7890-2023",,,,,,55,7,8,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

We show that early announcement of a carbon tax gives rise to a green-paradox, in that it increases emissions in the interim period (between announcement and actual implementation), irrespective of the scarcity of fossil fuels. The paradoxical outcome is driven by consumption-saving tradeoffs facing households who seek to smooth consumption over time and holds both when the announced implementation date is taken as a credible threat and when households are skeptical about the (political) will or capability of the government to implement the policy as announced.

Since the date at which renewables are phased in is brought forward and more generally future emissions of CO2 will decrease, the effect on global warming is unclear. Green welfare falls if the backstop is relatively expensive and full exhaustion of fossil fuels is optimal, but may increase if the backstop is sufficiently cheap relative to the cost of extracting the last drop of fossil fuels plus marginal global warming damages as then it is attractive to leave more fossil fuels unexploited and thus limit CO2 emissions. We establish these results by analyzing depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels followed by a switch to a clean renewable backstop, paying attention to timing of the switch and the amount of fossil fuels remaining unexploited. We also discuss the potential for limit pricing when the non-renewable resource is owned by a monopolist. Finally, we show that if backstops are already used and more backstops become economically viable as the price of fossil fuels rises, a lower cost of the backstop will either postpone fossil fuel exhaustion or leave more fossil fuel in situ, thus boosting green welfare. However, if a market economy does not internalize global warming externalities and renewables have not kicked in yet, full exhaustion of fossil fuel will occur in finite time and a backstop subsidy always curbs green welfare.

The final aim of this review was to understand the possibilities of the economic evaluations performed up to date as a tool to contribute to decision making in this area. We have reviewed a set of articles found in several databases until March 2010. Literature searches were made in the following databases: PubMed; Euronheed; Centre for Reviews and Dissemination of the University of York-Health Technology Assessment, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, NHS Economic Evaluation Database; and Scopus. The algorithm was (screening or diagnosis) and genetic and (cost or economic) and (country EU27). We included studies if they met the following criteria: (1) a genetic technology was analysed; (2) human DNA must be tested for; (3) the analysis was a real economic evaluation or a cost study, and (4) the articles had to be related to any EU Member State. We initially found 3,559 papers on genetic testing but only 92 articles of economic analysis referred to a wide range of genetic diseases matched the inclusion criteria. The most studied diseases were as follows: cystic fibrosis (12), breast and ovarian cancer (8), hereditary hemochromatosis (6), Down's syndrome (7), colorectal cancer (5), familial hypercholesterolaemia (5), prostate cancer (4), and thrombophilia (4). Genetic tests were mostly used for screening purposes, and cost-effectiveness analysis is the most common type of economic study. The analysed gene technologies are deemed to be efficient for some specific population groups and screening algorithms according to the values of their cost-effectiveness ratios that were below the commonly accepted threshold of 30,000a,not sign. Economic evaluation of genetic technologies matters but the number of published studies is still rather low as to be widely used for most of the decisions in different jurisdictions across the EU. Further, the decision bodies across EU27 are fragmented and the responsibilities are located at different levels of the decision process for what it is difficult to find out whether a given decision on genetic tests was somehow supported by the economic evaluation results.","[Antonanzas, Fernando; Rodriguez-Ibeas, R.; Hutter, M.

EP may help make forest management financially attractive and thereby reduce forest conversion to other uses but many factors deter landholders from EP, including a lack of reliable information about its costs and benefits. A financial appraisal of an eastern Amazon EP case study is presented with 7 alternate scenarios: high and low financial costs, low timber yield, carbon sequestration payments, higher timber prices, free seedlings, and reduced discount rates. A sensitivity analysis of carbon payment amounts, timber prices, and discount rates is explored. The net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit cost ratio (BCR) are reported for each scenario. Results showed that start-up costs must be kept low, and site maintenance must not only be sustained but also kept minimal to prevent costs from exceeding financial benefits of EP. Scenarios with the best NPV and BCR were those with carbon sequestration sales, higher timber prices, and a low discount rate. Carbon sequestration and high timber sale prices resulted in the best IRRs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the link between preferential trade liberalization and tariffs imposed against non-member countries for the case of CAFTA-DR. Using product data at the 6-digit HS level, we find that products with larger reductions in preferential tariffs experienced larger increases (or smaller decreases) in most-favored nation tariffs applied against non-members. However, we also uncover some interesting dynamics regarding the relationship between preferential liberalization and tariffs imposed against non-members. When we split the sample period into two sub-periods, we find an initial negative relationship between changes in preferential and most-favored nation tariffs during the first half of the sample period, followed by a positive relationship during the second half, although the evidence on the latter is not as strong. The results thus provide the first evidence of an initial stumbling block effect of preferential trade liberalization on unilateral liberalization, as well as (weaker) evidence of a subsequent building block effect.","Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA",Brandeis University,"Tovar, P (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",tovar@brandeis.edu,"Tovar, Patricia/AAH-9020-2019","Tovar, Patricia/0000-0002-2014-0081",,,,,26,12,12,1,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2012,11.0,4,,,,,591,619,,10.1017/S1474745612000250,0.0,,,29,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,027WR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310385300002,0

Irish forest policy has undergone a number of developments in recent years with a current emphasis on sustainable forest management, which requires accounting for a wider suite of forest benefits and incorporating public preferences into forest management. This study employed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to investigate public preferences and values for management approaches to an extensive afforestation programme. Each afforestation alternative was labelled with a locational description to add to the realism of the study and to investigate their effect on preferences for forest management. In addition, a respondent's ability to identify tree types was tested and included in the analysis. The Irish public holds strong, positive views for afforestation and forest management, in particular for recreational access, which is influenced by forest location.

Forests provide important ecosystem services that supply societal needs, such as timber, but this provision is not free of conflicts derived from the intensive management of forests. A GIS based approach using data from national forest inventories allows us to identify the provision of timber services and to conduct its valuation. The analysis includes a sample of 37,761 plots for 38 commercial tree species in the Spanish Mediterranean region, where we identify sustainable and non-sustainable forests in terms of harvesting intensities and value both the flow of benefits and their net present value. From the analysis we conclude that non-sustainable forests are providing higher economic returns than sustainable forests for most abundant tree species. However, when analysing long term trends, results show that sustainable forests yield higher economic benefits.

Futures scientists were involved in predicting the future of these technologies during the Internet bubble. In this paper, we use a meta-analysis approach to examine how well futures studies have been able to describe future reality. We limit our studies to futures research in the ICT and Internet domain that were published between 1995 and 2000. Because the number of relevant studies can hardly be called impressive, we selected a number of available futures studies that were conducted by official government bodies and individual companies, based on various approaches, ranging from technology forecasts [1] to highly creative visions [2], and from predictions [2] to essays [4]. These studies were carried out by Dutch as well as by international organizations. Based on a framework we developed for the analysis of business models, we wanted to see whether technological drivers, regulatory/policy issues and market development as well as competitive behavior, on the input side, and the way value for customers and providers is provided, on the output side, were discussed. Our analysis made it clear that, looking back with what we know now about business models, futures studies and recently developed tools like road mapping, developments in futures studies have made tremendous progress since the Internet Bubble. However, here is still room for more rigor when it comes to methodology and reporting. More recently, there has been a promising integration of scenario analysis and business model approaches that opens new avenues for futures studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

For such a declaration to be made, Spanish law demands that a technically comprehensive specific natural resources plan (SNRP) be legally approved. The SNRP is a normative document with prevalence over the national, regional and local laws affecting the area. This prominent legal position guarantees the achievement of the nature conservation objectives. Since SNRP restricts human uses of the area, the SNRP is of great importance to local inhabitants and stakeholders. Their agreement is socially necessary if a rapid and trouble-free declaration of PNA status is to be made. The most useful tool for seeking such agreement is a public information program (PIP). It must be well designed and developed to be successful. The main objectives of a PIP can be summarized with the following words or concepts. justice: the PIP make come true the right of citizens to participate; adequacy: the PIP will improve the obtained planning; and effectiveness: the PIP is an effective instrument to achieve acquiescence of the affected population. To achieve the above objectives is necessary to design and develop the activities of PIP based on the following criteria. Consider local resident motivations and give personalized information. Promote participation and discussion regarding the purpose of the PNA. Establish transparency and representation. Implement planning, continuity, monitoring and control. A model for a PIP is proposed. This model is based on the experience gathered in the declaration of the Alto Tajo Natural Park in central Spain. It is useful for other proposed PNA. The main practical considerations for a PIP design the different activities undertaken, as well as the most important factors in PIP success are also described and discussed. The attempts to establish the Alto Tajo area with PNA status failed on three occasions (1974, 1981 and 1989) due mainly to the opposition of local residents and stakeholders. Following a PIP carried out between 1996 and 2000, local residents and stakeholders saw the declaration of the PNA in a very favourable light; and, finally, the Alto Tajo Natural Park was declared in 2000.

A head-to-head comparison of the FE and VCR methods used the same charter students to test the FE control (e.g., the charter student's own traditional public school experience) and the VCR for equivalence. The comparison produced highly similar estimates: charter coefficients were identical in sign and significance and of the same general magnitudes. In an analysis of the sampling fractions included in each method using all available tested charter students. the VCR method was found to produce more generalizable results.

The value was derived from a face-to-face survey of 578 users of Whakarewarewa forest in Rotorua. The recreational benefit, estimated by the travel cost method, was NZ$34 per visit for walkers and NZ$48 per visit for mountain bikers. Aggregating these estimated values by the number of forest visits in 2009 suggests that the economic value of recreation in this planted forest was approximately NZ$8 million in that year. Visitors' preferences for alternative features of the planted forest were analysed using a latent class model to account for preference heterogeneity. This analysis indicates that forest users would gain a higher recreational satisfaction from an increase in diversity of forest features. Forest user characteristics that positively influence satisfaction from an increase in diversity were analysed using an ordinary least squares regression model. Important user characteristics include being a New Zealand born European, a local resident of Rotorua, and elderly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Differences in the distributions of our explanatory variables explained 61.0% of the total turnover gap. The higher proportions of uncertified and inexperienced teachers in the charter sector, along with the lower rate of union membership, were the strongest contributors to the turnover gap.

We find that 1995 and older model year vehicles have a lower marginal abatement cost than newer vehicles across all emissions levels. Since older vehicles are also significantly more polluting, an optimal allocation of emissions-related repair funds should target these vehicles. Total emissions reductions could be improved by an estimated 20% if the program has to shift from the actual flat $500 voucher to the first-best vehicle-specific voucher scheme. A two-tier voucher based on vehicle model year would yield a 15% decrease in emissions over the flat voucher, achieving three fourths of the remaining potential abatement. We also use our estimated abatement cost schedule to provide a measure of the foregone emissions reductions for this fleet due to the current structure of the California Smog Check program.

This statement reflects doubts by a developed state about the efficiency of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) in general and investment arbitration in particular. It also raises the question whether other countries will follow particular strategies to suit their discrete needs. One ramification is that resource wealthy states will make tactical decisions, such as entering into BITs only with capital exporting countries, as South Africa has declared. Another is whether developed states will avoid concluding BITs with developing countries whose domestic court systems are unknown or mistrusted. Yet another issue is how a policy statement, such as enunciated by Australia, will impact on its ability to attract foreign investment while protecting its national interests and also its investors abroad.

The pharmacoeconomic evaluation was performed through a probabilistic, patient-level simulation Markov model. Routine COPD care (RC) was compared with the inclusion of tiotropium bromide on it. The analysis was conducted over a lifetime horizon, with 1 year cycles and a 3.5% annual discount rate. Patients were characterized by gender, age, height, smoking status, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). FEV1 time trend was modeled according to the annual decline recorded in UPLIFTA (R).

Within this economic assessment, all environmental benefits including non-market benefits should be included to ensure an efficient and sustainable allocation of the resource. This is also in line with the approach taken in the EU Water Framework Directive. In this contingent valuation study, we estimate the non-market environmental benefits arising from the use of reclaimed waste water for irrigation in the Segura River Basin in south-eastern Spain. Our results support the hypothesis that the reuse of reclaimed waste water provides benefits to society beyond those reflected by the market. The inclusion of these non-market benefits and their comparison with the implementation costs will provide for better informed water management.","[Alcon, F.; de Miguel, M.

For a long time previously innovative companies primarily had lost their interest in the off-patent drugs and had focused their attention entirely on promotion of new innovative drugs (new chemical entities-NCE) which only had just been approved for manufacturing and selling. However over recent years the number of newly introduced innovative drugs has been decreasing, which in turn has led to growing market competition. Currently a different approach may be observed as innovator pharmaceutical companies strive to maintain a strong competitive market position even following expiration of the drug's patent. However, they try to avoid strengthening their market edge based solely on price. Such an approach would inevitably lead to significant loss in sales and a fall in product margins. It is for that reason that some innovator companies decide to enter the market with a one or more 'generic' versions of their original drugs, ie. to implement a brand portfolio strategy on a single chemical entity market. This paper examines the results of such strategies adopted in the Rx (prescription medicines) markets including analysis of reasons for failure and success. As it stems from research completed, the brand portfolio strategy is very popular in some developed pharmaceutical markets and very often brings significant financial benefits to innovator companies. In case of the strongly regulated Rx pharmaceutical market in Poland, very different results have been observed-this kind of strategy displays weaker popularity and relatively seldom brings intended effects to the patent holders.","[Barlozewski, Krystian] Warsaw Sch Econ, Coll Management & Finance, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Barlozewski, K (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Coll Management & Finance, Warsaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,WYZSZA SZKOLA BIZNESUNATL-LOUIS UNIV,NOWY SACZ,"ZIELONA 27, NOWY SACZ, 33-300, POLAND",2543-540X,2543-5388,978-83-88421-80-8,BUS NON-PROFIT ORGAN,,,2012,11.0,,,,,,250,265,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE4CO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371504700018,0

Results indicate that demand for catfish, crawfish, clams, and salmon products is elastic, suggesting that consumers are sensitive to price changes. In contrast, demand for shrimp and tilapia, mostly imported products, is price inelastic. US consumers would tolerate an increase in tilapia price compared to other seafood categories, especially catfish. Tilapia and salmon are found to have the most negative effects on purchases of other seafood products. Catfish is a strong substitute for tilapia; while tilapia is not a strong one for catfish. Promotions play significant roles in seafood purchases, especially among import-dominant products like shrimp, tilapia, and salmon. Future research should first be conducted at the metropolitan level, highlighting market specificity implied by consumers' demographics; secondly, it should be done at disaggregated levels for each seafood category, product form, and product size.","[Chidmi, Benaissa] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Lubbock, TX 79424 USA; [Hanson, Terry] Auburn Univ, Dept Fisheries & Allied Aquacultures, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Giap Nguyen] Tan Tao Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Duc Hoa, Long An, Vietnam; [Giap Nguyen] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Chidmi, B (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mail Stop 42132, Lubbock, TX 79424 USA.",benaissa.chidmi@ttu.edu; hansontr@auburn.edu; giap.nguyen@ttu.edu.vn,"Chidmi, Ben/HJA-8174-2022",,,,,,26,32,39,1,31,"MRE FOUNDATION, INC",KINGSTON,"PO BOX 1828, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA",0738-1360,,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

High nanotextile porosity with pore sizes of tens of nanometers, is a prerequisite for using nanotextiles in filtration, because size of the bacteria is greater than size of the nanopors and the bacteria are simply captured in nanotextile network. During the experiment has been tried out two new types of non-woven material nanotextiles, which were supposed to be high efficiency. Microbional contamination was simulated using the bacterium Escherichia coli. Contaminated water was filtered under presure. After filtration was performed microbional analysis of the filtrate and filtration material. The measured results were compared to the original, known contamination of the filtered sample. During the experiment was confirmed the assumption of relatively high efficiency of certain nanotextiles and their suitability for filtration of wastewater.","[Dosek, M.; Lev, J.; Cerny, M.; Kalhotka, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Engn & Automobile Transport, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Dosek, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Engn & Automobile Transport, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xdosek1@node.mendelu.cz; michalc@mendelu.cz,"Kalhotka, Libor/I-8496-2018",,,,,,6,1,1,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1048,1054,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200122,0

Tracking within-person choices over ten dictator exercises in which individuals choose one of three allocations of money between themselves and two other participants, this study precisely maps social preference types and identifies consistency of preferences within groups of roughly two-thirds of participants. Contrary to previous studies that identify a dominant social preference, this study's rigorous identification system reveals that other-regarding individuals are heterogeneous and almost evenly split between inequity aversion and social surplus maximization. But, even among individuals raised in a culture that stresses equal opportunity, there are gender differences. Women are substantially more likely than men to be inequity averters and less likely to be social surplus maximizers. However, a large majority of participants, both men and women, choose allocations consistent with compassion for the least well off.","[Kamas, Linda] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Preston, Anne] Haverford Coll, Dept Econ, Haverford, PA 19041 USA",Santa Clara University; Haverford College,"Kamas, L (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",lkamas@scu.edu; apreston@haverford.edu,,,,,,,27,14,16,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Each of these views reveals various approaches to rural development, however it is important to take both parties into account, when applying theoretical knowledge into practice.","[Malikova, L.; Spisiak, P.] Comenius Univ, Dept Human Geog & Demogeog, Fac Nat Sci, Mlynska Dolina 84215, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Máliková, L (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Dept Human Geog & Demogeog, Fac Nat Sci, Mlynska Dolina 84215, Slovakia.",malikova@fns.uniba.sk,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,653,661,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200076,0

This paper extends their work by arguing that the key difference was the defeat of American labour by the new giant American corporations of the twentieth century, a defeat that was itself a product of structural limits to democracy and a weak legacy of corporatist regulation. The triumph over labour gave American corporate executives a free hand in managing their workforces, but victory also brought full responsibility for enhancing efficiency and winning public acceptance. By the 1920s, executives responded by claiming to manage according to principles of social responsibilities. While explicit CSR lost relevance during the crises of Depression and World War II, it has reasserted itself since then, especially since the rise of neo-liberalism.","Calif State Univ Sacramento, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA",California State University System; California State University Sacramento,"Marens, R (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Sacramento, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",marensr@csus.edu,,,,,,,103,43,50,3,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This article submits that the preparatory work of the National Treatment rule provides significant interpretative guidance on the issues. In relation to Article III: 2, 2nd sentence and Article III: 4, the WTO jurisprudence has achieved consistency with the interpretative guidance. However, by expanding the reach of Article III: 2, 1st sentence to origin-neutral fiscal measures whereas rejecting the relevance of regulatory purposes to the determination of whether such measures are in violation of that sentence, the WTO judges have failed to respect the functions of Article III: 1 and Article III: 2, 1st sentence as contemplated by the draftsmen. To remedy this failure, this article proposes that the WTO adjudicators should either approve formal purpose inquiries under Article III: 2, 1st sentence, or, alternatively, confine the application of that sentence to origin-specific measures only.","[Zhou, Weihuan] Sydney Law Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Zhou, WH (通讯作者)，Sydney Law Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",wzho6843@uni.sydney.edu.au,"Zhou, Weihuan/HDM-5765-2022",,,,,,66,7,8,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2012,11.0,1,,,,,81,118,,10.1017/S1474745611000449,0.0,,,38,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,886WU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299885400004,0

Furthermore, we explain the connection between the terms red herring hypothesis, i.e., that time to death and not age per se drives the health care expenditures, and steepening. We also present the mechanisms that may induce steepening, as presented in the literature. When testing steepening, we apply data from all inpatient stays in somatic hospitals in Norway in the period 1998-2009, i.e., the data has no self-selection and covers the entire population of Norway (5 million). Our analysis does not reject steepening, with the exception of the 0-year-olds. The results also hold when controlling for mortality-related expenditures. Furthermore, we observe an increase in expenditures for the 0-year-olds. Finally, we find increasing mortality-related expenditures over time.

It illustrates how the industry is adopting a new competitive strategy via services that are added to the total offering, and how it is simultaneously developing a deeper understanding of the service relationship as value co-creation. The work identifies seven trends in this context and analyses their impacts and discontinuities. Three trends are linked primarily to the business environment: a dispersing customer base, changes in media use habits, and erosion of product business. Four trends describe the behaviour of companies: the shifts from products to value-adding brands, from R&D to innovation, from autonomy to partnering and sharing in an ecosystem, and the changing resource and capability needs. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, studying media as service has been rare in scholarly literature. Second, applying the service perspective to the trend analysis in the media sector is topical due to the increasing competition and unpredictability of the business environment. (C) 2014 The Authors.

J,"Bae, I",,,,"Bae, Ilhan",,,Shaping futures in Sino-character: What's in a name of East Asian futures studies?,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,East Asia; Futures; Language; Sino-characters,LANGUAGE,"This paper highlights how the Sino-character system, because it lacks a plural form, hinders promulgating and popularizing the concept of plural and diverse futures in Korea, Greater China, and Japan. Difficulties are revealed when East Asian futurists emphasize the plural concept of 'future + s', because the linguistic conventions of Sino-character languages and cultures do not clearly express plurality. The singular-form wording for 'future + s' excused by East Asian futurists tends to unintentionally stick a knowledge divide between public and futurists. It also shapes a more uniform, less diverse image of the future. This paper suggests that those engaged in East Asian futures studies adopts a standardized and more intuitively understandable Sino-character term for 'future + s' to enable futurists to effectively publicize and popularize the more plural, diverse and alternative values of futures studies. It also suggests related guidelines for creating and establishing a more popular term for 'future + s'.

We theorize about how such corporate short-termism emerges, at least partly, from systemic, self-reinforcing processes across various communities of actors including investors, the media and managers themselves. In doing so, we refute the common notion that corporate short-termism is caused by an inherent preference of investors or other actors to focus on STEs. Consequently, the systemic perspective offered by this article questions some conventional assumptions about the roots of corporate short-termism and emphasizes the influence of coordination mechanisms and behavioural biases in giving rise to self-reinforcing loops.","[Aspara, Jaakko] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Pajunen, Kalle] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Tikkanen, Henrikki] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Business Sch, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tainio, Risto] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University; University of Jyvaskyla; Stockholm University; Aalto University,"Aspara, J (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Business, POB 21230, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland.",jaakko.aspara@aalto.fi,"Pajunen, Kalle/AAG-6769-2019; Tikkanen, Henrikki/AFU-1075-2022; Aspara, Jaakko/G-2205-2013","Aspara, Jaakko/0000-0001-7982-5053; Tikkanen, Henrikki/0000-0002-6802-1524; Pajunen, Kalle/0000-0002-3913-7894",,,,,112,26,29,6,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Over the past decade, hundreds of thousands of the region's youth have pursued work in the ASM economy in various capacities, decisions which have brought much-needed stability in a landscape devoid of formal sector job opportunities. Host governments and donors, however, have often condemned these moves, failing to fully appreciate why youth have pursued work in ASM in the first place and the impact it has had on their livelihoods. Whilst by no means the solution to the youth unemployment problem in sub-Saharan Africa, heightened emphasis on formalizing and supporting ASM could certainly buy policymakers and donors some valuable time - at least in the short term - to sufficiently 're-think' their ineffective approaches to tackling the crisis.

Government officials often blame this informality on miners' unwillingness to comply with legal requirements. However, the lack of government capacity to adequately enforce such legislation, and the question of whether or not that legislation is actually feasible, is rarely considered to be a relevant factor determining the level of informality of artisanal mining operations. Drawing on field research in Liberia, this paper argues that many artisanal miners are in fact operating at various stages of legality, through payment of informal taxes, and following informal agreements made with local government officials. This kind of informal taxation can be seen as a locally grounded formalization, benefiting both cash-strapped artisanal miners who are unable to pay the full fees required by the Mining Code, and underpaid government officials who are presented with an opportunity to supplement their incomes. While illegal in absolute terms, these practices raise important questions regarding the feasibility and legitimacy of the current Mining Code, and the ways in which this crucial economic activity should be regulated in the future.

The extent to which the conventional rules for provision of state-variable public goods (a dynamic analog of the Samuelson rules) ought to be modified is shown to clearly depend on the strength of the relative concerns of both kinds, but also on the preference elicitation format.

Participants called for new institutional arrangements requiring collaboration and leadership from various levels of government, community groups and individual community members. We adopt Tainter's model of social complexification as an analytical framework for considering the implications of the research findings. From the perspective of this model, we argue that the proposed arrangements would involve, along with the envisioned benefits, increasing complexity and commensurate costs, with important consequences for the forms that water sensitive cities might take. Considerations relating to the costs of complexity take on particular importance in futures for which reduced material affluence appears increasingly possible. The costs of complexity under such conditions may be more readily ameliorated via pathways that entail increased local responsibility for meeting water needs, such as decentralised rainwater harvesting. We argue that increased participation in water-related governance and responsibility for related infrastructure will follow more readily from measures to foster local enthusiasm than from mandated approaches that themselves require increased complexity.

This article argues that a trade policy that is global in perspective and the lowering of trade costs are critical for Ukraine, and that efforts should centre on addressing specific policy areas that negatively eject trade with both customs unions. Ukraine could propose the creation of a number of 'supply chain councils' organized around the major export sectors for Ukraine, the ECU countries as well as the EU. The councils would have a mandate to identify the most important sources of supply chain inefficiencies as well as actions to resolve them. Such an approach would help to rebuild trust between Ukraine and Russia after the cessation of hostilities and help to assure Russia that the DCFTA is not an anti-Russian agreement.","[Hoekman, Bernard] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Hoekman, Bernard] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Jensen, Jesper; Tarr, David] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",European University Institute; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); The World Bank,"Hoekman, B (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.",,,,,,,,22,4,4,0,15,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between job loss and changes in body weight following the Icelandic economic collapse of 2008. The analysis relies on a health and lifestyle survey Heilsa og liA degrees an, carried out by The Public Health Institute of Iceland in the years 2007 and 2009. The sample is a stratified random sample of 9,807 Icelanders between the ages of 18 and 79, with a net response rate of 42.1 % for individuals responding in both waves. A linear regression model was used when estimating the relationship between job loss following the economic collapse and changes in body weight. Family income and mental health were explored as mediators. Point estimates indicated that both men and women gain less weight in the event of a job loss relative to those who retained their employment. The coefficients of job loss were only statistically significant for females, but not in the male population. The results from all three models were inconsistent with results from other studies where job loss has been found to increase body weight. However, body weight has been shown to be procyclical, and the fact that the data used were gathered during a severe economic downturn might separate these results from earlier findings.","[Jonsdottir, Sif; Asgeirsdottir, Tinna Laufey] Univ Icleand, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",,"Asgeirsdóttir, TL (通讯作者)，Univ Icleand, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",ta@hi.is,"Ásgeirsdóttir, Tinna Laufey/ISA-3677-2023",,,,,,48,13,13,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Safeguards to protect local people's rights and interests have been formulated in response concerns over the potential negative impact on communities of forest preservation. To fulfil safeguards, many sub-Saharan African countries are looking to community-based natural resource management (CBNRM). Current critiques of CBNRM projects outline the importance of project design and policy context in shaping whether or not communities actually stand to benefit. This paper explores these aspects in a case study of Joint Forest Management (JFM) in Zambia, and examines the role of Zambia's REDO preparedness programme in shaping them. The case study was evaluated using stakeholder and policy document analyses, informed by interviews, and tied into the broader forest governance network. The findings highlight the way in which the politics and policies of forest governance in Zambia shape the on-the-ground JFM project and influence community benefits. In the case studied, even with careful local-level project design, JFM would be hindered in its delivery of REDD safeguards. Therefore, for REDD to deliver community safeguards, it must be considered as a broader process of political and governance change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Most empirical studies of climate damages have examined temperature anomalies up to 3 degrees C, while some recent theoretical studies emphasize the risks of climate catastrophes, which depend on climate sensitivity and on marginal damages at higher temperature anomalies. We use a new IAM to estimate the VOI for each parameter over a range of assumed levels of study precision based on prior probability distributions calibrated using results from previous studies. We measure the VOI as the maximum fixed fraction of consumption that a social planner would be willing to pay to conduct a new study before setting a carbon tax.

Tap water quality is a household concern. The objective status quo of water provision varies between households and not between individuals within households, while charges are levied on households not individuals. Individual preferences differ from collective preferences. In households where there are two adults, we examine the preferences of each separately and then as a couple in collective decisions. We show the level of influence each has in developing the collective decision process. We use discrete choice experiments to model preference heterogeneity across three experiments on women, men and on both. We propose a random utility model which decomposes the error structure in the utility of alternatives so as to identify the individual influence in collective decisions. This approach to choice data analysis is new to environmental economics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In investigating the interrelation between the financial market and the real economy, it makes a comparative inquiry into two key assertions regarding economic crisis within Marxism: the tendency for the rate of profit to fall and overaccumulation of capital. Accepting the claim that economic crisis is inherent to capitalism, this article probes the role of countervailing tendencies in battling the tendency for the rate of profit to fall. While crisis is an outcome of both the extensive growth of fictitious profits and the tendency for the rate of profit to fall, the latter is identified as the fundamental reason for the current crisis. Labour market reforms that were implemented following the emergence of the economic crisis represent the resurgence of countervailing tendencies and are the most explicit evidence that the fundamental reason for the crisis resides in the real economy.","[Duman, Ozgun Sarimehmet] Ipek Univ, Dept Polit Sci, TR-06550 Ankara, Turkey",Ipek University,"Duman, ÖS (通讯作者)，Ipek Univ, Turan Gunes Bulvari,648 Cadde, TR-06550 Ankara, Turkey.",oduman@ipek.edu.tr,"Sarimehmet Duman, Ozgun/H-7534-2014","Sarimehmet Duman, Ozgun/0000-0001-9882-2544",,,,,35,10,10,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Currently, payers face major financial consequences when actual utilization is higher than the allocated budget. We suggest a risk-sharing model between the two stakeholders; if the actual number of patients exceeds the manufacturer's prediction, the manufacturer will reimburse the payers by a rebate rate of alpha from the deficit. In case of under-utilization, payers will refund the government at a rate of gamma from the surplus budget. Our study objective was to identify the optimal early estimations of both 'players' prior to and after implementation of the risk-sharing scheme. Using a game-theoretic approach, in which both players' statements are considered simultaneously, we examined the impact of risk-sharing within a given range of rebate proportions, on players' early budget estimations. When increasing manufacturer's rebate alpha to be over 50 %, then manufacturers will announce a larger number, and health plans will announce a lower number of patients than they would without risk sharing, thus substantially decreasing the gap between their estimates. Increasing gamma changes players' estimates only slightly. In reaction to applying a substantial risk-sharing rebate alpha on the manufacturer, both players are expected to adjust their budget estimates toward an optimal equilibrium. Increasing alpha is a better vehicle for reaching the desired equilibrium rather than increasing gamma, as the manufacturer's rebate alpha substantially influences both players, whereas gamma has little effect on the players behavior.","[Gavious, Arieh] Ono Acad Coll, Fac Business Adm, Kiryat Ono, Israel; [Gavious, Arieh; Segev, Ella] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Greenberg, Dan; Hammerman, Ariel] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Hammerman, Ariel] Clalit Hlth Serv Headquarters, Chief Phys Off, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hammerman, Ariel] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Clalit Health Services; Ben Gurion University,"Hammerman, A (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Beer Sheva, Israel.",arielham@gmail.com,"Gavious, Arieh/B-4616-2008; Hammerman, Ariel/AAG-4399-2020","Hammerman, Ariel/0000-0002-4396-5246; Greenberg, Dan/0000-0002-6759-3985; Segev, Ella/0000-0003-4445-2562",,,,,9,11,13,5,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This is due mainly to the different levels of economic development, defective industrial structures, and poor marketization in EurAsEC member states.

Growth strategies are concerned with increasing the size and viability of the business over time with the final aim of building and sustaining their competitive market position. This paper points out that in order to increase personal compensations; managers sometimes evaluate firms' growth not considering its profitableness. Managers can perform unrelated takeovers in order to increase their own compensations. Mentioned managerial reasons for diversification are based on the existence of certain imperfections in corporate governance, namely the mechanisms by which stockholders control corporations and their managers. If stockholders could assess those takeovers that would increase profits, and those that wouldn't, and focus management only on those takeovers that increase stockholder value, the possibility of acquisitions managed by managers would disappear (Besanko et. al., 2007: 175). Hambrick and Finkelstein (1987) introduced and elaborated the concept of managerial discretion. In prior studies it has been suggested that greater managerial discretion enables managers to shape firms more significantly, and moreover increases the influence of managerial characteristics on organizational outcomes (Finkelstein & Hambrick). Managerial discretion refers to the ability of executives to affect key organizational outcomes (Hambrick & Finkelstein, 1987). From the perspective of agency theory, high managerial discretion allows managers to work for personal benefits rather than for those of shareholders. While contingency theory points out that executive in diversified firms ask for more compensation than that in non-diversified firms as their more complicated environment, executives adopt some strategies such as mergers and acquisitions (M& A) and diversification in order to increase their compensation. Therefore, this paper, based on prior literature, gives the explanation to the relationship between perceived managerial discretion and TMT motives for firms' growth.","[Darabos, Maja] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Darabos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",mdarabos@efzg.hr,"Darabos Longin, Maja/H-9209-2018","Darabos Longin, Maja/0000-0002-2100-118X",,,,,35,0,0,0,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,390,398,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000036,0

Tobacco control policies are of critical importance to low-income countries with high smoking rates such as Vietnam where smoking prevalence is greater than 55 % in young men between the ages of 25 and 45. Using a survey of teens and young adults, I conducted duration analyses to explore the impact of tobacco price on smoking onset. The results suggest that tobacco prices in Vietnam have a statistically significant and fairly substantial effect on the onset of smoking. Increases in average tobacco prices, measured by an index of tobacco prices and by the prices of two popular brands, are found to delay smoking onset. Of particular interest is the finding that Vietnamese youth are more sensitive to changes in prices of a popular international brand that has had favourable tax treatment since the late 1990s.","[Guindon, G.

The average investment in fixed assets and average sales revenue per urban and rural enterprise is compared in the analysis. The results show that while the number of economically active enterprises increased in more rapid pace in Estonian rural areas, it is highly problematic that their average annual investment and sales revenue remains considerably lower than that in their urban counterparts. For Estonian rural enterprises, both those indicators grew slower during the economic boom years of 2005 to 2007 and decreased more rapidly in the decline years of 2008 and 2009; thus, widening the gap with the urban enterprises.

Using data from the European Patents Office (1978-2010) and a classification of eight technological fields of environmental technology, the paper concludes that the contribution to environmental technology by multinationals is quite significant, but still concentrated in the triad countries. Outside the triad, innovation in environmental technology is quite low and still led by transnational corporations. Emergent countries like Brazil, China, or South Africa are more likely to be captured than to be capturers of technological competences inside the triad. This observation can be explained by a scarcity of domestic multinationals, a low intensity of R&D by domestic agents, and a low level of outward internationalization of R&D.","[Urraca-Ruiz, Ana] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Duran-Romero, Gemma] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Estruct Econ & Econ Desarrollo, Madrid 28049, Spain",Universidade Federal Fluminense; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Urraca-Ruiz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Econ, Rua Tiradentes 17, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",anaruiz@economia.uff.br; gemma.duran@uam.es,"Urraca-Ruiz, Ana/GLS-0059-2022; ROMERO, GEMMA DURÁN/L-2599-2013","ROMERO, GEMMA DURÁN/0000-0001-7762-133X",,,,,51,0,0,0,6,DENFAR TRANSNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,ONTARIO,"58 RIDEAU HEIGHTS DR, ONTARIO, OTTAWA NEPEAN K2E 7A6, CANADA",,,978-0-9868210-5-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,97,115,,,,,,19,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353691000007,0

To the best of our knowledge, such a specific test does not yet exist. There are four versions of the test, which consider the relationship between incremental downstream costs and effects in the case of a single or several endpoints. We apply two versions of the validation test to published cost-effectiveness analyses of physical activity programs and demonstrate internal validity of the model in one study and lack of internal validity of the model in the other study.","[Gandjour, Afschin] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Gafni, Amiram] McMaster Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Policy Anal, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Gafni, Amiram] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; McMaster University; McMaster University,"Gandjour, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",a.gandjour@fs.de,"Gandjour, Afschin/I-8963-2019",,,,,,22,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In this way, market based instruments for ecosystem services have increasingly been implemented within nation States. In this paper we analyze the role of environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in spreading market based instruments for ecosystem services. We put forward the hypothesis that: when a State cannot adequately defend its political and economic sovereignty to produce its own public policies, then the environmental NGOs are strong policy entrepreneurs, that are able to diffuse standards and policy instruments. When a State is more politically and economically capable, the role of environmental NGOs as policy entrepreneurs is more limited. To test this hypothesis, we analyze the diffusion of market based instruments for ecosystem services in three contrasted countries regarding State and NGOs' respective strength: Costa Rica, Madagascar and France. A comparison and analysis of the dissemination of the market based instruments for ecosystem services in different countries therefore seems highlk relevant for analyzing such transfers of international standards and policy instruments.

Frequent shortcomings or outright lack of performance assessments of environmental interventions in general and PES projects in particular have resulted in recommendations for optimal PES designs. Conditionality-paying service providers only if services or proxy inputs are delivered-and targeting-allocating payments based on service gains, provision costs or both-are central to such recommendations. We argue that a) true economic optimality is an unattainable PES objective and improving PES cost-effectiveness is a more realistic aspiration, and that b) current PES programs actually prevent cost-effectiveness analyses because they lack appropriate ecosystem service definitions and thus output measurements. We review the effects of conditionality on service flows and provide a framework for identifying the cost-effective level of conditionality stringency. We identify key analytical methods, data and analysis tools required to improve the cost-effectiveness of PES-or any ecosystem service-projects. Needed analytical concepts, metrics, and monitoring and modeling approaches often are sufficiently available for PES design to begin incorporating them. What is missing is their coherent application. Improving spatial-analytical and monitoring capacities should allow gradual implementation of modifications needed to improve PES cost-effectiveness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Publicly funded organizations, such as departmental research institutes, have been established in many countries to provide science-based policy advice. To assess the activities of two public research institutes, namely, Serbia's Institute of Lowland Forestry and Environment (ILFE) and the Croatian Forest Research Institute (CFI), we use the new theory-based analytical model of departmental research developed by Bocher and Krott (2010). This model describes scientific policy advice as the connection between Research (R), Integration (I), and Utilization (U) the RIU-model. Primary and secondary evidence refer to 148 ILFE and CFI projects conducted from 2005 to 2010. Our critical analysis of empirical data, which were collected through semi-structured face-to-face interviews and project documentation, shows the following: (i) it is possible to analyze all activities of the two research institutes with the RIU-model of departmental research and present the results using production lines; (ii) activities of ILFE and CFI can be presented by the same types of production lines revealing their similar profile; (iii) all three spheres of the RIU-model can be found in the successful ILFE and CFI projects, only the Integration sphere is found in all projects; and (iv) the RIU-model is able to describe comprehensive activities of both research institutes, which opens the possibility to improve current evaluation procedures by taking into account both practical and scientific activities and outputs.

In this paper, forest policy making in the light of climate change is analyzed in two German Laender, Bavaria and North Rhine Westphalia, drawing on the Multiple Streams Framework. Empirically, document analysis and expert interviews substantiate this analysis. The formation of climate change related forest policy occurred differently in both Laender. In Bavaria, several factors triggered a successful integration of climate change adaptation measures related to forests into one program, the Bavarian Climate Programme 2020. These factors were, for instance, an early problematization of climate change by forest science, a 'condensation' of the problem into particular areas of high need for action, the possibility to rely on already available (in parts, implemented), well-proven, and applicable forest policy measures, and the coordinated and entrepreneurial activities of the forest sector as a whole. In North Rhine Westphalia, the political framework conditions for a formation of climate change related forest policy were less favorable, and, hence, no broader forest policy on the issue occurred. Recent political changes, however, may allow for new prospects. We conclude that the extent to which the issue of climate change is integrated into forest policy depends on the overall framing of climate policy and the opportunities for the forest sector to substantiate the necessity of such a link. The preparedness and activities of the latter are then needed in order to utilize possible policy windows and to receive resources for forest climate policy measures. Forest science plays an important role by influencing the agenda, indicating challenges and providing scientific criteria to determine and rationalize specific measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the same properties that theoretically provide tacit-heavy production regions with an advantage against new, low-wage producers are a disadvantage to firms trying to capitalize on non-local technology and the opportunities of disaggregated production. This article examines the tacit-rich textile and clothing industries in Italy, and argues that firms concentrations of tacit knowledge did, for some time, lead to retention of market share and jobs. Globalization strategies, including direct ownership of facilities abroad and vertical integration at home, aimed to maintain flexibility in the production chain by compensating for the difficulty of sharing tacit knowledge across borders, and by containing tacit knowledge in contracting home districts. However, instead of reinforcing traditional strengths of the Italian system, these new strategies may pose a challenge to tacit-intense production and innovation.","Franklin & Marshall Coll, Patricia E Harris Ctr Business Govt & Publ Policy, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA",Franklin & Marshall College,"McCaffrey, SJ (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll, Patricia E Harris Ctr Business Govt & Publ Policy, Room 114,POB 3003, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",sarajane.mccaffrey@fandm.edu,,,,,,,56,12,13,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Despite this heated debate, there exists little credible empirical evidence of the effect of a U.S. public school's decision to offer single-sex classrooms on the educational outcomes of students. This study seeks to fill this hole. Using administrative records for third through eighth graders in North Carolina public schools, the paper finds evidence that the offering of single-sex mathematics courses is associated with lower performance on end-of-grade math exams, and finds no evidence that the offering of single-sex reading scores increases performance on reading exams. Robustness checks are conducted. While the mathematics results are robust to the checks, the reading results fail an important check, and the baseline reading results should be interpreted with this in mind. Evidence of significant heterogeneity in the effect across schools is also presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents the findings of a comprehensive event study focusing on sixty credit booms across emerging markets. The build-up of credit booms across emerging markets seems to be characterized by loose monetary policy stances, with domestic policy rates below trend during the prepeak phase of credit booms. While credit booms are associated with episodes of large capital inflows, international interest rates (a proxy for global liquidity) are virtually flat during these periods. Therefore, although external factors such as global liquidity conditions matter, and possibly increasingly so over time, domestic factors (especially monetary policy) also appear to be tightly associated with real credit growth across emerging markets.","[Elekdag, Selim; Wu, Yiqun] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Wu, YQ (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",elekdag@imf.org; ywu2@imf.org,"wu, yi/JEP-1581-2023","Elekdag, Selim/0000-0002-1234-4463",,,,,26,24,27,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Either way, oil markets are bound to incur drastic shrinking. Concern over peak oil supply will crumble when the irrevocable peak oil demand is created. Replacing oil in the world's energy economies requires redirected market forces, notably in the form of steadily increasing oil end-use prices. Yet, thus far, crude oil prices have obeyed the market fundamentals of expanding-contracting demand and oligopolistic supply. A hockey stick supply curve supports high sales prices, providing large rents to submarginal sources. Cutting oil demand and maintaining high prices implies reducing the supply hockey stick's length by curtailing some oil producers. In such a scenario, the alliances, goals, and tactics of oil geopolitics are set to change. We identify a distribution over friendly and hostile oil suppliers, with others drifting in between the two sides. Conflicts and warfare are less aimed at conquering oil fields for exploitation than at paralyzing production capabilities of opponents or of unreliable transient sources. Covert warfare and instigation of internal conflicts are likely tactics to exhaust hostile opponents. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We use data from the DRG statistics aggregated at the county level in combination with numerous other data sources (e.g. INKAR Database, accounting data from the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KBV), Federal Medical Registry, Germany Hospital Directory, population structure per county) to establish the proportion of the observed regional differences that can be explained at county and state levels. Overall we are able to account for 73 % of the variation at state level in terms of observable factors. By far the most important reason for the regional variation in the utilisation of in-patient services is differences in medical needs.

In response to these changes, three key shifts in social policy have been observed since World War II: a shift in economic policy from protectionism to market-based approaches, a shift in natural resource management encompassing a recognition of scarcity and degradation and the need to better manage natural resources (such as land and water) and, in the face of rural decline, a shift in policy moving away from government as provider to a position promoting the economic self-sufficiency of communities.","[Hogan, Anthony; Young, Michelle] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Inst Rural & Reg Australia, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Hogan, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Natl Inst Rural & Reg Australia, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",anthony.hogan@anu.edu.au; michelle.young@anu.edu.au,"Young, Michelle/HLX-2551-2023","Hogan, Anthony/0000-0002-8557-9589",,,,,42,18,19,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Monitoring the compliance of WTO members with their obligations is an important part of that transparency, and timeliness in the notification of compliance is crucial. In the case of domestic support to agriculture, the notifications of compliance with obligations has been slow and opaque. But another database exists that could both illuminate the extent to which policy instruments are correctly notified and provide a convenient way to ensure timely 'pre-notifications' in the event that delays occur in the future. This note shows how the OECD database can be used, for example, to shed light on the extent to which payments to producers that require production as a matter of eligibility are presently notified to the WTO as having no effect on production. We also demonstrate the feasibility of using OECD data to construct 'pre-notifications' by calculating the (as yet un-notified) domestic support notifications for the EU for the years 2009/10 and 2010/11.","[Josling, Tim] Stanford Univ, FSI, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mittenzwei, Klaus] NILF, Oslo, Norway",Stanford University,"Josling, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, FSI, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",josling@stanford.edu,,,,,,,18,8,8,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2013,12.0,3,,,,,533,547,,10.1017/S1474745612000535,0.0,,,15,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,217BT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324332200004,0

In this paper, we explore the role of science fiction in creating prototypes of imagined and better futures evident in these narratives even when they are distinct from the futures they predict. We explore the contributions and warnings of utopian and dystopian stories to the development and the specific realisation of future business visions. By drawing on Mannermaa's framework, a selection of science fiction writings, and the description of sources for innovations, we are able to examine the impact of prototyping on business management. Within this paper we describe scenarios as the mechanisms that test strategic direction while the prototype offers a mechanism for the analysis of business vision. We explore the synergy that exists between creative fiction authors and futurologists, discussing the predictive elements and the source of inspirations for innovators. We argue that while business futurologists appear to offer pedestrian predictions and future models, the most impact is achieved with views of the future that are presented as prototypical stories; stories that plant a seed that germinates and comes to fruition in a more distant future.

This determination, unique during the period of central wage fixation, was made as the country fell into deep depression in 1930-1931. Arguments that a reduction in purchasing power would exacerbate the depression did not prevail over expert economic advice that wage reduction would lessen the structural consequences of reduced rural export income. The Court determined that the loss of real national income had to be accommodated without a wider package of measures such as exchange rate depreciation or expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. The impressive endeavours of the Court to understand and respond to a difficult economic reality represented a significant elevation of the status of wages policy in macroeconomic management - one that was to last for 60 years.","[Hancock, Keith] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Hancock, Keith] Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of Adelaide; Flinders University South Australia,"Hancock, K (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Natl Inst Labour Studies, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",keith.hancock@flinders.edu.au,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Analysis of interviews with the managers of various units in the chain of custody showed that, as we move from the buyer to the production units, the building-up of trust by managers is becoming increasingly technical. Thus, end consumers include the intangible value of the product in their understanding of trust regarding Russian wood. The lower the unit is in the chain of custody and the closer it is situated to the logging sites, the more restricted is the construction of trust by managers, undergoing minimization and, ultimately, reduction in the bid to ensure a normal business or purely technical approach. The differences observed in the constructions of trust in various units of the chain can be explained in light of two factors: firstly, the challenges faced by each individual unit, and secondly, the value system of-the managers at every level.

Cross-price elasticities of unhealthy and healthy foods estimated by a demand system provide a consistent framework to evaluate substitution effects, when a close association is assumed between unhealthy (healthy) foods and more (less) energy-dense foods. We used a dataset constructed from a series of cross-sections of the Italian Household Budget Survey (1997-2005) to obtain the variables of the demand system, which accounts for regional price variability. The relative increase in healthy food prices was found to produce nontrivial elasticities of substitution towards higher relative consumption of unhealthy foods, with effects on weight outcomes. In addition, these changes were unevenly distributed among individuals and were particularly significant for those who were poorer and had less education.","[Pieroni, L.] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Lanari, D.] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Social Econ Actuarial & Demog Studies, Rome, Italy; [Salmasi, L.] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37100 Verona, Italy",University of Perugia; Sapienza University Rome; University of Verona,"Pieroni, L (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",lpieroni@unipg.it,"Habe, Neusa K/D-6316-2011","Salmasi, Luca/0000-0001-6674-9215; Pieroni, Luca/0000-0003-1841-4351",,,,,52,9,9,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The reason for this is that, the geographical entity now known as a nation state was a conglomeration of over 400 autonomous ethnic groups peacefully co-existing before her colonial occupation which led to the amalgamation of the various autonomous groups. The amalgamation was the 1914 unholy marriage conducted by the nation's colonial masters without considering the interest of the units presently in the polity. This marriage continued through independence and after without any effort by the units to agree on their mode of interactions. In addition, the intervention of military in the nation's politics further worsen the interaction between the central and the units, when the central government became powerful than the units through her unitary style of operation, and therefore making the units to leave at the mercy of the central government. This however led to forceful pursuit of self-determination and resource control among the oil-bearing units of the federation that are the least developed region in the federation. This development resulted into formation of ethnic militias by the aggrieved youths in the region to take their destiny in their own hands. Since the inception of Fourth Republic that ushered in democratic system of government that allows for self-expression on May 29, 1999, the nation has been witnessing a major wave of ethnic violent conflicts. The nation's federalism is such that its various institutions are not alert to their responsibilities; hence the country is gradually heading toward the status of a failed state. The focus of the study is the Nigeria Niger Delta region which is currently the nerve center of the nation's economy with oil production that places the nation as the highest producer of oil in the continent, and seventh in the world. It is interesting to note here that oil is not the only natural resource in Nigeria, but owing to lack of long term projection, the leadership attention has always been on the oil since its discovery in commercial quantity in 1958. This study examines the origin of oil in Niger Delta; interrogates impart of oil exploration on the oil-bearing communities; investigate the formula for sharing the nation's resources; the study also probes the causes of the unabated violent conflict championed by ethnic militia in the region. Finally, the study suggests that the only way forward to the Niger Delta crisis is the immediate introduction and implementation of a federal system of government with all its features that will allow all the federating units to have meaningful input in issues that affects them as a people within the Nigerian nation through a genuine constitutional review.","[Abegunde, Ola] North West Univ, Dept Polit Peace Studies & Int Relat, Mahikeng, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,,ola_dunjoye@yahoo.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,6,14,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600001,0

The gap arises because people either overstate hypothetical values or understate real commitments or a combination of both. Herein we examine whether the traditional real-world institution of the solemn oath can improve preference elicitation. Applying the social psychology theory on the oath as a truth-telling-commitment device, we ask our bidders to swear on their honour to give honest answers prior to participating in an incentive-compatible second-price auction. The oath is an ancillary mechanism to commit bidders to bid sincerely in a second-price auction. Results from our induced valuation testbed treatments suggest that the oath-only auctions outperform all our other auctions (real and hypothetical). In our homegrown valuation treatments eliciting preferences for dolphin protection, the oath-only design induced people to treat as binding both their experimental budget constraint (i.e., lower values on the high end of the value distribution) and participation constraint (Le., positive values in place of the zero bids used to opt-out of auction). Based on companion treatments, we show the oath works through an increase in the willingness to tell the truth, due to a strengthening of the intrinsic motivation to do so. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It is a consequence of Hungarian property law. Fragmentation in the Czech Republic is not as high because pursuant to Austrian law. High fragmentation of land ownership is reflected in the amount of shares of a single owner in common property on the one hand and the way these shares are distributed on the other. Fragmentation in Slovakia is so high that the land cannot be used separately; the shapes and sizes of the plots are also inconvenient for practical usage. The average number of plots per owner in Slovakia is 20.59. The average number of co-owners per plot is 11.11 and the average number of ownerships is 97.95 million. Statistics related to the Czech Republic reveal that there is an average of 1.59 co-owners per plot and the number of ownerships is 10.15 million. In both countries, the situations have been dealt with by means of land consolidation (LC). Nowadays, it is considered the optimal and the only way of restoring the Cadastre of real estates in farming landscapes. LC not only supports ownership consolidation but it also helps to create a multifunctional system of landscape features with environmental, flood-control and erosion-control functions which also enables access to the separate plots. In the Czech Republic, LC has been (or is still being) implemented on 26% of the total acreage of the Agricultural Land Fund (ALF) and on 12% of Slovak territory. Field roads built in the CR are 1951 km longer and the extent of erosion-control and ecologic measure is 1916 ha higher. This paper addresses land consolidations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the past and today, explaining the differences in their historical development, comparing the different starting conditions for LC and the current state of planning and implementation in both countries.

Then the obtained results were compared with the needs of farmed animal species and the solutions which would improve the quality of grassland were proposed. The observations took place on the farms on the northern outskirts of Brno. On the Farm 1 the dairy cows of Czech fleckvieh were bred. On the Farm 2 the warm-blooded horses were bred. The assessment of the forage species composition was carried out during the year 2012. The evaluation of grassland quality was established on the basis of species composition. Vegetation plots were used to find out the plant species representation and to assess the percentage coverage for different plant species. For evaluation of grassland quality was used the methodology developed by NOVAK J. (2004), which divides the plants into groups according to their palatability, production ability, nutrient content and digestibility. The grassland on the Farm 1 belonged to the category of highly valuable to valuable. The grassland quality reached the maximal value in June (83.6) and minimal in October (69.3). On the Farm 2 there was valuable grassland. This was due to a high proportion of the most valuable species (eg. Arrhenatherum elatius, Medicago sativa). The grassland quality reached the maximal value in May (70.6) and then gradually decreased to 64.5. According to their plant species composition both grasslands can be ranked as valuable grasslands and they have a potential to provide quality forage for farmed animals. The quality of grasslands was stable during the growing season and decreased in autumn. This was caused by inconsistent management of grazing areas and selectivity of animals during grazing. To improve the quality of grasslands regular mowing of ungrazed patches and nitrogen fertilization can be recommended.","[Klusonova, I; Skladanka, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Klusonova, I (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xklusono@node.mendelu.cz,"Skladanka, Jiri/I-6115-2018",,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,221,225,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800038,0

SWFs have gained great attention because of various concerns: their large size, lack of transparency, and, in principle, the potentially politicized nature of sovereign fund investments. Indeed SWFs disproportionately favor financial companies and during the crisis have become dominant players, providing significant capital to large banks in Europe and the US. Many arguments have been put forth regarding the potential positive and negative effects of SWF investments on global financial markets and on targeted companies. This paper, based on a hand collected database, aims to shed a light on the impact on financial performance (stock prices) and on economic performance (various ratios and growth rates) of SWF investments in banks. We compare the performance of SWF-backed banks with a sample of non- SWF-backed in three time periods (2004-2006, 2007-2008 and 2009-2011) in order to verify the different hypotheses explaining superior or lower performance.

The invention of internet and following IT technologies has been the foundation for the evolution of supply chain management. The aim of this study is to review major technologies that emerged to facilitate supply chain management. Among some of the significant technologies that retailers around the globe use for their business processes are Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Warehouse Management System (WMS), Transportation Management System (TMS) and Automatic Identification and Data Collection (AIDC). Some customer based technologies in use are Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI), Point of Sale (POS) and Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR), etc. The recent developments in RFID technologies have opened doors for major applications in the field of SCM.

QDs are small semiconductor nanoparticles (1 - 20 nm), which can be used in the imaging instead of the organic labels. The CdTe QDs were synthesised by microwave synthesis in an aqueous solution. As the source of telluride, Na2TeO3 was used, and as reduction agent, sodium borohydride was applied. Quantum dots were stabilized by mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA). According to reaction conditions (temperature: 50 130 degrees C), size of prepared quantum dots can be tuned. Synthesised QDs had got very good fluorescence properties and were used for the cell labelling. The QDs penetrated into the cells and stained plant cells, as well as human foreskin fibroblasts. But the changes in the cells shapes were observed, the reason could be the toxic effect of QDs, which should be more investigated. For the usage of QDs in medicine, it is necessary to know their behaviour in the tissue. We investigated the behaviour of QDs in the chicken breast muscle tissue. After the direct injection of QDs into the muscle tissue, sufficient spreading of QDs in the tissue was observed and a significant linear increase of the fluorescence intensity of QDs with applied volume was determined. To detect the limiting depth for the signal detection, the tubes filled with different QDs was inserted into the different depths of the tissue. The intensity of the fluorescence of QDs depended on the size of QDs, therefore red QDs was possible to detect the most deeply (10 mm). Using the different emission filters, it is possible to distinguish between the different QDs. It enables the use QDs in the simultaneously labelling of different structures in the cells or the organisms.","[Smerkova, K.; Blazkova, I; Chudobova, D.; Vaculovicova, M.; Kopel, P.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Vaculovicova, M.; Kopel, P.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Brno University of Technology,"Smerková, K (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xsmerkov@node.mendelu.cz,"Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Kopel, Pavel/E-5711-2012; Smerkova, Kristyna/F-3892-2012; Blazkova, Iva/J-6430-2012; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Hegerova, Dagmar/J-7030-2012; Vaculovicova, Marketa/E-5583-2016","Kopel, Pavel/0000-0003-4216-9544; Smerkova, Kristyna/0000-0002-1667-7660; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Hegerova, Dagmar/0000-0003-0826-234X; Vaculovicova, Marketa/0000-0002-6771-1304",,,,,8,0,0,0,9,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,934,939,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800165,0

The majority of the existing commentaries generally argue that China seemed to take a reluctant and passive attitude towards WTO disputes in the first five years of. its WTO membership and then changed to an active and aggressive one in the last five years. This paper reflects on why China has taken a more active approach and argues that China's recent activism is not only a purely voluntary action as a result of the rising legalism in China but also a reluctant choice or response. As China lacks other legally available and practical means and before turning directly to unilateralism, it chose the WTO venue as the last resort. This was largely due to the insurmountable difficulty that it had encountered in its past bilateral efforts to amicably resolve critical trade issues and because of the grave political pressure on China's imbalanced position under the WTO dispute settlement system. This paper also argues that China still seems far from the moment when it can be satisfied with its litigation performance on the international level and that China needs to continuously enhance its legal competence in a comprehensive way to better utilize the WTO dispute settlement system.","[Huang, Cui] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Haidian, Peoples R China; [Ji, Wenhua] Minist Commerce, Legal Dept, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Ji, WH (通讯作者)，Minist Commerce, Legal Dept, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jiwenhua@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,13,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The results I present suggest that first graders are not harmed by being in a combination class or by their schools offering combination classes.

Each unit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) and can be traded. In this paper we evaluate the potential impact of the ETS on forest management decisions including whether to establish new forest, choice of species and silviculture, and forest rotation length. Criteria used in the analysis are financial return (LEV or NPV) and carbon price risk (cost or percentage of units to be surrendered after harvest). Results show that carbon trading has the potential to increase forest profitability and influence the choice of silviculture. Forest rotation length increases with expected carbon price. However there is considerable risk arising from carbon prices. We develop strategies that hedge against carbon price risk at both the stand level and the forest estate level. The former include growing a valuable crop and trading only a portion of units received. The latter includes managing forest structure via age-class composition. We evaluate trade-offs between financial return and risk in order to identify the opportunity cost of strategies that are robust against future carbon prices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This two-sector economy faces a dilemma between economic growth and deforestation. The rural sector can substitute reproducible capital for agricultural land whereas the manufacturing sector only requires capital. The model shows that the REDD mechanism has a non-monotonic effect on steady state welfares. For low transfer schemes, the agricultural output increases with the transfer even though less land is under cultivation. For high transfer schemes, the increase in the transfer may not offset the decrease in the agricultural output. The open-loop symmetric Nash equilibrium in a dynamic deforestation game predicts that redistributing the transfer among a finite number of producers is less efficient in reducing deforestation than in the social optimum.

In this paper, we use data from the 2004 German Socio-Economic Panel and Bayesian analysis to analyze to what degree violations of the strict validity assumption affect the estimation results. We show that, in case of moderate direct effects of the instrument on the dependent variable, the results do not deviate much from the benchmark case of no such effect (perfect validity of the instrument's exclusion restriction). In many cases, the size of the bias is smaller than the width of the 95% posterior interval for the effect of education on income. Thus, a violation of the strict validity assumption does not necessarily lead to results which are strongly different from those of the strict validity case. This finding provides confidence in the use of family background variables as instruments in income regressions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study compares the cost effectiveness of a secondary prevention intervention for a combined patient population relative to three selected subgroups: patients aged over 70 years; patients with a diagnosis other than angina only (that is, patients with a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty); and patients with diabetes. The results for the general population have been published elsewhere, but ongoing budget constraints require consideration of the appropriateness of targeting resources to patient subgroups. We adopt a probabilistic model to combine within trial and beyond trial impacts of treatment to estimate the lifetime health care costs and quality-adjusted life years of two primary care-based secondary prevention strategies: SPHERE Intervention-tailored practice and patient care plans and Control-standardised usual care. In all cases, the intervention was associated with mean cost savings and mean QALYs gains, when compared to the control, though statistical significance was never achieved. However, the probability of the intervention being cost effective was higher than 85% in all analyses across a range of potential cost-effectiveness threshold values. There is no compelling statistical evidence to support the targeting of specific subgroups across the general population. However, if affordability constraints are binding, the results do allow a tentative ranking of priorities based on the probabilistic subgroup analysis.","[Gillespie, Paddy; O'Shea, Eamon] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Gillespie, Paddy; O'Shea, Eamon] Natl Univ Ireland, Irish Ctr Social Gerontol, Galway, Ireland; [Murphy, Andrew W.; Byrne, Mary C.] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Gen Practice, Galway, Ireland; [Smith, Susan M.] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Dept Gen Practice, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Byrne, Mary C.] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Psychol, Galway, Ireland; [Cupples, Margaret E.] Queens Univ Belfast, Dept Gen Practice, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Queens University Belfast,"Gillespie, P (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland.",paddy.gillespie@nuigalway.ie,"Smith, Susan M/D-1872-2012; Gillespie, Paddy/C-6642-2015","Smith, Susan M/0000-0001-6027-2727; Cupples, Margaret/0000-0002-4248-9700; Murphy, Andrew/0000-0001-5549-8246; Byrne, Molly/0000-0001-8900-4320; Gillespie, Paddy/0000-0001-6297-9478",,,,,31,7,7,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In the paper, we first offer a definition of economic democracy as a a system of checks and balances on economic power and support for the right of citizens to actively participate in the economy regardless of social status, race, gender, etc. Based on our definition, we suggest six possible faces of economic democracy and look at their implications for the vision of a sustainable, equitable and non-growing society, as discussed within the degrowth movement: (1) Regulation of market mechanisms and corporate activities. Regulation is one of the most obvious paths to curbing economic power, hence we highlight the issue of deregulation vis a vis possible degrowth policies. A revision of the free-market paradigm is suggested. (2) Support for social enterprises. We discuss different forms of democratic governance within enterprises and suggest that cooperative approaches, common in social enterprises, are better suited to a degrowth economy. (3) Democratic money creation processes, including pluralist community currencies, are suggested to counter economic power caused by the practice of fractional banking. (4) Reclaiming the commons (especially in their original sense as communal land stewardship systems) both conceptually and physically is seen by us as an important aspect of enhancing economic democracy. (5) Redistribution of income and capital assets is discussed as another approach to achieving economic democracy. (6) Finally, inspired by Vandana Shiva, we suggest that a broader view of economic democracy would involve a diversity of production scales and modes, including small-scale, subsistence and self-employment.

These three factors are highly correlated, and can affect residents' willingness or unwillingness to manage forests in their areas. The primary objective was to determine whether local participation in managing national protected areas was significantly influenced by their perceptions and attitudes. Questionnaire surveys were carried out with 405 households living in four villages in the southern periphery of Phou Khao Khouay National Protected Area, central Lao PDR. Results showed that most respondents held favourable perceptions and attitudes towards the National Protected Area. By employing structural equation modelling, it was also found that there were strong positive connections between their positive perceptions, attitudes and participation. These factors need to be taken into consideration to enhance local participation in national protected area management and to achieve sustainable biodiversity conservation in Lao PDR. Moreover, multivariate analysis indicated that residents in villages that run ecotourism projects and those with higher incomes had stronger positive perceptions, attitudes and participation towards the national protected area. In order for local residents to effectively manage the national protected area, their participation needs to be fostered and encouraged through developing local income streams, such as ecotourism.

Local people have experienced differing degrees of participation in land use decisions. We examine two conservation projects from the Northern Forest state of Maine. This paper presents the policy processes from these projects and an assessment of their impact on conflict and support for the project. One project was a top-down approach, and the second was a grassroots, private effort by local citizens to conserve forestland. We gathered data via person interviews, mail surveys, and analysis of legislative testimony. Our findings indicate that early local involvement leads to less conflict and greater acceptance of the project. Important aspects of effective public involvement include shared learning and two-way dialogue. In addition, we found that regardless of the process employed, respondents were generally satisfied with the outcomes of the processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Modeling land-cover as a function of land-use aids in understanding pertinent land-cover dynamics. This can enable forecasting of ramifications of current conversion processes on land designated for agriculture or development. National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) grid data published by USDA for years 1997-2002 were used as preliminary inputs. Two prevalent transition probabilities were derived: probability of a pixel changing (a) from forested to non-forested, P-fnf and (b) from non-forested to forested, P-nff. These probabilities were determined for the years (i) 1999-2000, (ii) 2000-2001, (iii) 1999-2001, and (iv) 1999-2009 using decade stratification. The maximal transition probability ranges for forest to non-forest transition were higher for 1999-2000 and 1999-2001 transiting periods compared to 2000-2001. The maximal transition probability ranges for non-forest to forest transition were lower for 1999-2000 transiting period compared to 2000-2001, and 1999-2001 transiting periods.

In the case where seepage may occur the resource is nonexclusive, giving rise to a spatial externality whereby pumping by one user affects others nearby. Theoretically, these externalities are potentially important causes of welfare loss. Using a unique spatial data set of groundwater users in western Kansas, we are able to empirically measure the physical and behavioral effects of groundwater pumping by neighbors. To address the simultaneity of neighbors' pumping, we use the neighbors' permitted water allocation as an instrument for their pumping. We estimate that 2.5% of the total groundwater extracted each year in western Kansas is over-extraction due to the effects of spatial externalities. Individuals who own multiple wells internalize their own externality by trading off pumping at one well for pumping at another. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Lin, C. -Y.

The IV results indicate that a one-year increase in spacing increases test scores for older siblings by about 0.17 standard deviations. These results are larger than the OLS estimates, suggesting that failing to account for the endogeneity of spacing may understate its benefits.

The model provides incentives to institution administrators to eliminate wasteful spending and increase positive outcomes while maintaining educational quality and research productivity. The institutions in our study spent $96.74 billion, and states would reimburse $88.02 billion. Thus efficiency-based funding would reduce state government expenditures on these institutions by $8.72 billion, or approximately 9.0 percent. Efficiency-based funding is politically viable, as demonstrated by North Carolina's successful use of this approach in pupil transportation operations since 1994. The model will be of interest to state legislators, state education officials, and others who are concerned with funding formulas for institutions of higher education.","[Sexton, Thomas R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Coll Business, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Comunale, Christie L.] Long Isl Univ, Sch Profess Accountancy, Brookville, NY 11548 USA; [Gara, Stephen C.] Drake Univ, Sch Accounting, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Long Island University Post; Drake University,"Sexton, TR (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Coll Business, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",thomas.sexton@stonybrook.edu; christie.comunale@liu.edu; stephen.gara@drake.edu,,,,,,,29,7,8,0,35,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Ultimately, this comparison aims at drawing conclusions for the present debate on the currently negotiated REDDplus mechanism which can be considered as a major effort to upscale payments for environmental services. Both discourses show some remarkable similarities - despite their diverging spatial foci, cultural backgrounds, and eras of origin. Similarities include the utilitarian concepts of nature used, the functions or services considered, and the ongoing challenge of valuing and monetizing them. However, there are also fundamental differences in regard to property rights and assumptions on the harmony of forest functions, respectively apparent and potential trade-offs between different ecosystem services for which the current discourse promotes market-based governance approaches as the mean of choice to balance competing interests of stakeholders. In terms of current policy debates as on REDDplus, the focus on one particular ecosystem service - here the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions - shows significant analogies to the historic forest functions discourse in which timber production was seen as the main function that inherently ensures the delivery of all other functions. With regard to the considerable risks resulting for biodiversity and other ecosystem services from such a mono-functional focus we argue that any market-based approach to REDDplus should be accompanied by comprehensive international and national regulatory policies and foster the implementation of effective safeguards.

The central research question was how to develop a manageable product structure, i.e., a limited set of hospital products, with acceptable cost homogeneity. For this purpose, a data warehouse with approximately 1.5 million patient records from 27 hospitals was build up over a period of 3 years. The data associated with each patient consist of a large number of a priori independent parameters describing the resource utilization in different stages of the treatment process, e. g., activities in the operating theatre, the lab and the radiology department. Because of the complexity of the database, it was necessary to apply advanced data analysis techniques. The full analyses process that starts from the database and ends up with a product definition consists of four basic analyses steps. Each of these steps has revealed interesting insights. This paper describes each step in some detail and presents the major results of each step. The result consists of 687 product groups for 24 medical specialties used for billing purposes.","[Westerdijk, Machiel; Zuurbier, Joost; Ludwig, Martijn; Prins, Sarah] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Zuurbier, J (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",jzuurbier@rsm.nl,,,,,,,20,17,17,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

To investigate sibling interaction, I estimate best response functions for individual physical and financial contributions as a function of siblings' contributions. After addressing the endogeneity of siblings' contributions and selection into migration. I find evidence that siblings' financial contributions function as strategic complements while time contributions operate as strategic substitutes.

The nature of lifelong learning focuses on what is possible in the future as opposed to what has happened in the past. A lack of analysis of the teaching process from the student's perspective may widen the distance between the teaching process and learning. It may also prevent us from understanding how teaching relates to the development of lifelong learning and, as a result, a sustainable future. A qualitative, phenomenological method was employed to provide insight into the dynamics of what students learn and how they, as subjects, experience a teaching process that supports their lifelong learning development. Three themes concerning what teachers do emerged from the analysis of interviewees' descriptions: teachers are self-based, teachers are embodying the work, and teachers are promoting affective engagement. Our results suggest that in becoming lifelong learners students wish to find meaning and live their lives authentically as participants and not as spectators. The results of our study have implications for higher education and its pedagogical practice for cultivating lifelong learners with a continuous commitment to constructing self-based, authentic futures.

A model was constructed using decision analytical techniques. The model was developed to estimate the health economic impact of prebiotic preventive disease management of atopic dermatitis. Data sources used include published literature, clinical trials and official price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The comparator was no supplementation with prebiotics. The primary perspective for conducting the economic evaluation was based on the situation in The Netherlands in 2009. The results show that the use of prebiotics infant formula (IMMUNOFORTISA (R)) leads to an additional cost of a,not sign 51 and an increase in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) of 0.108, when compared with no prebiotics. Consequently, the use of infant formula with a specific mixture of prebiotics results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a,not signA 472. The sensitivity analyses show that the ICER remains in all analyses far below the threshold of a,not sign 20,000/QALY. This study shows that the favourable health benefit of the use of a specific mixture of prebiotics results in positive short- and long-term health economic benefits. In addition, this study demonstrates that the use of infant formula with a specific mixture of prebiotics is a highly cost-effective way of preventing atopic dermatitis in The Netherlands.","[Nuijten, M.

Z-score model is one of the most frequently used model for early financial failure warning and considers various financial ratios selected as prediction variables. The purpose of this paper is to use multivariant discriminant analysis (MDA) to substantiate a score function effective in bankruptcy risk prediction of enterprises on Romanian economy example. In order to discriminate between bankrupt and non-bankrupt in the scoring model we used relevant financial ratios related to activity, liquidity, leverage and profitability. The weighting coefficients established between independent variables and the objective function-score, are determined by using statistical tools. In this context, the article aims to build a scoring function in order to identify bankrupt companies, using a sample of companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange.

It will argue that the case of emissions permits gives rise to two key challenges. First, it highlights the need for a resolution on the issue of the characterization of intangible goods under the SCM Agreement, and the importance this has for the calculation of benefit and hence the correct application of SCM disciplines. Secondly, when applied to emissions permits, the SCM Agreement produces a result that heavily favours the complaining Member at the expense of 'distributive justice'. This is compounded by the current lack of directly applicable exceptions for subsidies directed at legitimate public policy goals.

It argues that CSR is not a countervailing force that follows neo-liberal market exposure. Instead of re-embedding global liberalism, CSR complements liberalization and substitutes for institutionalized social solidarity. Evidence from the UK, one of the world's leading jurisdictions for responsible business, supports these claims. In Britain during the past 30 years, neo-liberalism and CSR have co-evolved. CSR has been a quid pro quo for lighter regulation; it has compensated for some of the social dislocations that result from unfettering markets, thereby legitimating business during the 'unleashing' of capitalism, and it appeals to moral sensibilities, justifying and legitimating business leaders in a way that instrumental rationality alone cannot.

From a theoretical point of view, these developments call for adjusting the internal organization of farms and the adoption of modern control instruments or management tools. To learn more about what control instruments are used by farmers today, what control gaps they experience and what are the barriers and driving forces in adopting new control instruments, we conducted an empirical analysis.

We tested the various vegetation and chlorophyll indices derived from spectral reflectance measurements and thermal imaging method for the assessment of leaf temperature differences between dry and wet treatments. It was found that both approaches are able to detect responses to drought stress. However, it is clear that the responses of individual parameters on the effect of drought stress have different meaning. For this reason it will be necessary to carry out additional measurements in which the response of individual spectral reflectance and leaf temperature parameters will be correlated to direct indicators of plant response to drought stress such as leaf water potential and stomatal conductance.","[Rajsnerova, P.; Klem, K.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Forest Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Rajsnerova, P.; Klem, K.] CzechGlobe Global Change Res Ctr AS CR, Vvi, Brmo 60300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Rajsnerová, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Forest Ecol, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",rajsnerova.p@czechglobe.cz,"Klem, Karel/G-9726-2014",,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,162,167,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200018,0

The research has drawn on specialist literature in the field of knowledge management, human resources management, sociology and psychology. The primary material was obtained by the author's own questionnaire survey in early 2012 of teachers and managers in the education sectors. The research is based on the working hypothesis that most teachers do not receive adequate or appropriate stimulation from school managers, and that is partly the reason why they are unwilling to share their accrued knowledge, with the result that the teaching is less effective.

We test six scenarios including three long-term projects with red pine, Norway spruce and hybrid poplar plantations and three shorter term hybrid poplar scenarios that produce temporary carbon emission offsets. We convert the break-even costs of sequestering carbon to a permanent carbon offset equivalent and analyze the possible geographical implications of the choices across eastern, southern and central Ontario, Canada. The most financially viable scenarios show a relatively large part of central Ontario with attractive choices at a 4% discount rate but a much smaller area at an 8% rate. The assumption about the future price evolution of temporary carbon offsets is one of the biggest factors that influence the attractiveness of these choices. At the 4% discount rate and the assumption of rising prices of permanent carbon offsets, the scenarios that store carbon for long periods appear to be the least-costly option. Hybrid poplar appears as the best choice in southern Ontario and a mix of conifer species and hybrid poplar in the central and northern parts. When future prices of temporary carbon offsets are assumed to decline, temporary hybrid poplar projects appear to be more attractive in the southern and eastern parts of the province. The variety of alternative scenario choices also depends on the discount rate and future price expectations for temporary carbon offsets. For a relatively narrow deviation of the carbon offset price (+/-$0.6 t(-1) CO2), only 4% to 9.2% of the total 5.8 million ha area would have one or more potentially viable alternative scenarios at the 4% discount rate and almost zero alternatives at the 8% rate. Higher discount rates lead to fewer attractive choices, suggesting that landowners would be left with very few options when trying to maximize net returns from plantations.

Therefore, all kinds of commodity prices depend on two factors. The first is the product itself which contains all kinds of value. The second factor is the value form which performed by monetary. Technical life-cycle has profound impact on the relationship between price and value. Based on the analysis of these two theories, the overall trend of price and value is same. In this paper, we assumed that T is constant in the short term. And it can vary in long-term. In the short term, while in the conditions that T is constant, the technology development stage is divided into three stages. And under the development of intermediate technology proficiency, price equals value. With the highest proficiency in technology development, the price lowers than the value. Under the initial technology proficiency, price higher than the value. Technology develops from the initial stage to the highest. Proficiency is in the cycle course. Therefore, in the short term, price fluctuations around the value.

We find that a dollar increase in the population-weighted utility rebate raises the share of ENERGY STAR qualified clothes washers by 0.4%, but does not affect dishwasher and refrigerator shares. Using information on energy saved by an ENERGY STAR appliance and assuming a redemption rate of 40%, the cost per tonne of carbon saved is about $140 for the clothes washers rebate program. The corresponding cost of a megawatt hour saved, about $28, is lower than the estimated cost of building and operating an additional power plant and the average on-peak spot price. We conclude that the ENERGY STAR clothes washers rebate program is, on average, a cost-effective way for utilities to reduce electricity demand. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This study highlights some of the unique features of water-based credit trading markets that may explain the lack of success, and uses laboratory experiments to isolate their effects. In particular, we compare two forms of a baseline- and-credit institution, a Pigouvian tax/subsidy regulation, and - characteristic of air quality programs - a textbook cap-and-trade regulation. Across these institutions we examine the effects of abatement technology adoption. We find that a baseline-and-credit program, when it requires firms to make upfront investments to generate tradable credits, is less efficient than cap-and-trade and taxi subsidy institutions. Furthermore, we find that when efficient trading requires costly technology adoption, institutions that involve inter-firm trading, including cap-and-trade, are less efficient than the tax/subsidy.

Starting from decision-support experiences gained in two decision-support methodologies using bottom-up energy models (TIMES-TUMATIM and SEPIA-LEAP), and inspired by Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum (EMF), six intermediaries, who are responsible for communicating the results of models to decision makers, were asked to pass judgment on both models. Firstly, the relevant policy questions the decision makers want answered were revealed in the course of the Forum process. Secondly, the extent to which the existing models can provide meaningful answers to these questions was explored. In the end, it was established that neither of the two existing models is well suited to representing uncertainties or finding robust strategies under deep uncertainty. As models depicting a radical system change over the next 50-100 years must necessarily deal with deep uncertainties, new research methodologies are needed to improve adaptive policy making.

Special attention is given to a comparison between key EU policy frameworks, namely the polluter-oriented registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH) and the environment-oriented Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), based on in-depth analysis of key policy-related documents and interviews with scientists and policy actors. The results outline that in spite of a substantial amount of rhetoric in EU sources about recommending wide and ambitious public involvement, current participation and deliberation practices are rather undeveloped in the studied EU policy frameworks. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the introduction of more radical approaches to knowledge co-production and participation (like PNS) would require epistemological, institutional and constitutional changes that are not feasible in the foreseeable future, at least not in respect to chemicals management. This study generates empirical data with regard to the management of chemicals in the European marine environment, specifically data on participation, the role of science, and uncertainty treatment at the science-policy interface. These data provide empirical information that can be used by environmental managers involved in the development of EU marine policy. At the same time, the results can be used theoretically to reflect on and problematise the current state of wider public participation in EU environmental policies and PNS development in particular cases.

By then, these regions also displayed much wider wage inequality and thus contributed more to overall urban wage inequality than non-coastal regions. While privatization was the main driver of skill premia in 1995-2002, China's (regionally uneven) integration into the global economy became the dominant influence in 2002-07. Reducing skill premia and inequality, the authors argue, calls for reform of the Hukou registration system which impedes skilled labour mobility and possibly also growth.","[Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Ctr Int Governance Innovat, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Whalley, John] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Xing, Chunbing] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Western University (University of Western Ontario); National Bureau of Economic Research; Beijing Normal University,"Xing, CB (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",jwhalley@uwo.ca; xingchunbing@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,9,10,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

The staggered introduction of these set-aside programs is used to estimate their impacts on the self-employment and employment rates of African American men. Black business ownership rates increased significantly after program initiation, with the black-white gap falling 3 percentage points. The evidence that the racial gap in employment also fell is less clear as it depends on assumptions about the continuation of preexisting trends. The black gains were concentrated in industries heavily affected by set-asides, and they mostly benefited the better educated.","[Chatterji, Aaron K.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Chay, Kenneth Y.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Fairlie, Robert W.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",Duke University; Brown University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Chatterji, AK (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",ronnie@duke.edu,,,,,,,49,11,21,0,23,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

Binding price caps in collusive markets will have different effects over the multimarket contact mechanism depending on the severity of the cap. Setting a price cap close to the unregulated case will increase the size of the redistribution of market power whereas stronger regulation will even reduce prices in unregulated markets. Therefore, price regulations aiming at capping prices in a specific market will also affect markets that are not subject to specific mandatory price regulations. We find evidence of the theory predictions using information for nine OECD countries for pharmaceutical markets. Unregulated US markets are shown to respond to the redistribution effect; Canadian markets, known to be subject to soft price regulations, with respect to the former, are shown to be consistent with a stronger redistribution effect. EU markets and Japan are either consistent with the effect of a medium regulation or strong regulation. In this last case multimarket contact cannot explain prices, and these are expected to be lower compared to the unregulated benchmark.","[Coronado, Javier; Jimenez-Martin, Sergi] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Jimenez-Martin, Sergi] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Jimenez-Martin, Sergi] FEDEA, Madrid, Spain; [Marin, Pedro L.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Marin, Pedro L.] CEPR, London, England",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Jiménez-Martín, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",francisco.coronado@upf.edu; sergi.jimenez@upf.edu; marin@eco.uc3m.es,"Jimenez-Martin, Sergi/D-6744-2013","Jimenez-Martin, Sergi/0000-0002-7393-9612",,,,,20,0,2,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The mining project was unlike any Australians had previously undertaken, and its construction created complexities which Australian managers and industrial relations systems had not previously encountered. The complexity of employment relations on this project was increased by the political environment of colonial rule and the responses of Australian workers and unions. This article looks at the development of the first industrial agreement during the mine's construction phase and places it in the context of the creation of a sustainable bargaining structure, which succeeded in mitigating industrial conflict for two decades before the outbreak of a wider armed conflict.","[Hess, Michael] Univ New S Wales, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Maidment, Ewan] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia Pacific, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Australian National University,"Hess, M (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",m.hess@adfa.edu.au,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

I focus on the relative importance of individual (e.g. age, education, etc.) and institutional (e.g. public screening programmes) factors in explaining these differences. I use individual level data from the first three waves (2004-2006-2009) of the SHARE as well as regional and country level data on institutional factors. The analytical approach is based on multilevel statistical models, which allow me to analyse the contribution of individual and institutional factors in explaining the variation in breast cancer screening across European countries. I find that the standard deviation in screening rates across countries increases slightly from 19.5 to 20.8 per cent after controlling for individual factors. Observed individual factors such as age, education, health status, etc., do not significantly contribute to the explanation of cross-country differences. In contrast, after controlling for observed institutional factors such as the availability of an organised screening programme, the standard deviation drops from 20.86 to 12.92 per cent. These factors can statistically explain about 40 per cent of the between-country differences in screening rates. Moreover, I found that these institutional factors seem to prevent a woman from considering a mammogram not necessary. This analysis provides important insights about patient's attitudes and understanding of benefits of breast cancer prevention and highlights the importance of the availability of an organised screening programme for screening differences across European countries.","[Wuebker, Ansgar] Univ Witten Herdecke, Dept Econ Inst Econ & Hlth Syst Management, D-58448 Witten, Germany",Witten Herdecke University,"Wübker, A (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Chair Competit Theory & Policy, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",ansgar.wuebker@uni-wh.de,,,,,,,50,25,25,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The panel ruled that the measures did not violate China's market access commitments because there were no explicit limitations on the entry of foreign suppliers, but that the measures were inconsistent with China's national treatment commitments in that they modified the conditions of competition in favour of domestic suppliers.

We analyze 647 sample companies listed in the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 2005 to 2009 using the coefficient of variance of institutional holding proportion as the measure for ownership stability. The empirical results show that increasing stability of institutional holdings is related to better firm performance. The low-risk and younger firms with higher CEO incentive compensation, larger insider holdings, and higher growth usually have better performance. Furthermore, when the long-term institutional shareholdings, particularly of foreign institutions, are higher, the firm performance is better.","[Hsu, Ming-Feng] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Wang, Kehluh] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Grad Inst Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Chiayi University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Hsu, MF (通讯作者)，Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan.",mfhsu@mail.ncyu.edu.tw; lkwang@mail.nctu.edu.tw,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,,,,,39,10,10,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Using nationally representative data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, I analyze the effect of working on grades and credit completion for undergraduate students in the United States. Strategies to identify the causal relationship between working and academic performance include student-level fixed effects to control for permanent, unobserved characteristics that may affect both work and study intensity, and system GMM models to account for potentially endogenous relationships between working and academic performance that vary over time. I examine the consequences of working for heterogeneous subgroups, with a particular focus on differences between full-time and part-time students. I find no evidence that students' grades are harmed by marginal work hours, but that full-time students complete fewer credits per term when increasing work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A significant weakness in the emerging literature is the lack of a gender perspective on implications for agrarian livelihoods. This article explores the gendered aspects of land transactions on livelihood prospects in the Northern Region of Ghana. Drawing on qualitative research from two commercial agriculture projects, the article examines how pre-existing gender inequalities in agrarian production systems, as well as gender biases in project design, are implicated in post-project livelihood activities. The article concludes that a good business model of a land deal, even one that includes local communities in production and profit sharing, is not sufficient to protect women's livelihood prospects if projects ignore pre-existing gender inequalities and biases, which limit access to opportunities.","[Tsikata, Dzodzi] Univ Ghana, ISSER, POB LG 25, Legon Boundary, Accra, Ghana; [Yaro, Joseph Awetori] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog, Legon Boundary, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana; University of Ghana,"Tsikata, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, ISSER, POB LG 25, Legon Boundary, Accra, Ghana.",dzodzit@yahoo.co.uk; yarojoe@yahoo.com,,"Yaro, Joseph Awetori/0000-0002-2701-3253",,,,,23,94,102,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Many continuous improvement management systems/techniques also involve getting the primary through to tertiary work groups to think of better and innovative methods of working or developing new techniques and technologies. How you get this to work at country or european level could only by a multi layered approach. Encouragement of small r & big D using SME(<= 5 employees - more than 60% of the companies in EU) tax credits as most countries already do is a prerequisite however restrictive tax law constraints allowing payments only to universities and research associations are counter productive. SME are commercial enterprises with ultimate objective of being profitable. R&D, which precedes any innovation, usually requires investment and a guarantee on returns. Thus, a typical SME, especially nowadays, would suffer from lack of spare cash and wouldn't be willing to borrow, for any financial liabilities are detrimental. The guarantee on returns is perceived as a gamble, and thereby introduced uncertainty can be unacceptable for a small certainty and stability seeking company.

The 2002 Norwalk Agreement was reinforced after the publication, in 2006, of a new memorandum document, The Roadmap for Convergence, in which the two regulatory bodies stated their short-term and long-term objectives for the convergence process. One of the long-term convergence objectives regarding the consolidated financial statements, materialized in joint projects - Business Combinations and Consolidations - can be considered completed after the issuance of the new versions of IFRS 3 in 2008 and of IAS 27, IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 in 2011. But are we there yet? Given that the accounting convergence process had become, for some time now, one of the most debated and challenging issues for practitioners, regulators and researchers, we show the same special interest in the research undertaken. The main purpose of this paper is to establish the level of convergence between the two most representative sets of accounting standards applicable to entities in the private sector. Unlike previous studies carried out on this topic, which measure the general accounting harmonization for private sector, our study focuses on a specific issue, namely the formal accounting harmonization between IFRS and US GAAP regulations regarding consolidated financial statements. The research methodology used for achieving our objective was based on some statistical tools, such as correlation and/or association coefficients. The result reveals that IFRS have substantially converged with US GAAP, at least in the area of consolidated financial reporting, but there still exist some differences between the two referentials.

In our opinion, the potential of Practice - as curricular activity, but also as work and learning experience - to enhance student entrepreneurship learning is under-evaluated and under-exploited. The research activity performed in order to find if practice stages encourage students in Economics to practice entrepreneurship took place in two directions: quantitative - consisting in the research based on the survey of the most significant aspects concerning the influence of practice stages to strengthen entrepreneurial skills of students in Economics and encouraging them to practice entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial profile of the potentially enterprising students - member of the PRACTeam project's target groups, and qualitative -consisting in the research based on an open structured interview of some aspects concerning the entrepreneurial profile applied to some successful students who were awarded in the project, who were employed as result of internship stages and who became entrepreneurs. Starting from the results of the quantitative and qualitative research performed in the PRACTeam project, the paper concludes with arguments and recommendations for emerging challenges in university curricula and pedagogical approaches in order to support both youth employment and youth entrepreneurship and to encourage potential entrepreneurship of students in Economics in Romania.

The results also show a positive reaction to the price index. Furthermore, an important result was achieved from the decomposition analysis of the variance, which shows that the interest rate differential reflects the perception of risk by foreign investors.

Its impact is evident in all areas, such as political, economic and socio-cultural ones. This impact is measured by an indicator which economists call the size of the public sector. As government's influence is so significant a question naturally arises: Should the impact of the government be big or small? There are many arguments in favor and against this issue and it is difficult to come to a consensus on the extent of government's intervention in the economy. That is why the purpose of this paper is to present a picture of this intervention in the economic life of our country by connecting this indicator with the budget deficit. First, we will elaborate the progress of the size of the public sector in Albania and its measurement by various indicators. Secondly, we will compare the size of the public sector in Albanian with the sizes of the public sector of other countries in the region.

We control for a wide range of individual, household, and community factors, using both standard regression techniques and instrumental variable estimation to address potential endogeneity. Specifically, we find in our baseline ordinary least squares specification that poor health is associated with a decrease in the probability of working of about 13 %. Controlling for community-level unobserved variables slightly increases the magnitude of this effect, to about 14 %. Controlling for endogeneity with the instrumental variable approach further supports this finding, with the magnitude of the effect ranging from 12 to 35 %. Taken together, our findings confirm the cost that the still considerable adult health burden in the FSU is imposing on its population, not only in terms of the disease burden itself, but also in terms of individuals' labour market participation, as well as potentially in terms of increased poverty risk. Other things being equal, this would increase the expected return on investment to be had from interventions aimed at improving health in this region.","[Goryakin, Yevgeniy; Suhrcke, Marc] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Rocco, Lorenzo] Univ Padua, Dept Econ, Padua, Italy; [Roberts, Bayard; McKee, Martin] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, European Ctr Hlth Soc Transit, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1H 9SH, England",University of East Anglia; University of Padua; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Goryakin, Y (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",ygoryakin@yahoo.com,"Goryakin, Yevgeniy/E-4658-2015; Suhrcke, Marc/AAE-9024-2019; McKee, Martin/E-6673-2018; McKee, Marc D/E-2187-2011","Goryakin, Yevgeniy/0000-0002-3063-6099; McKee, Martin/0000-0002-0121-9683; McKee, Marc D/0000-0001-8349-965X; Suhrcke, Marc/0000-0001-7263-8626; Roberts, Bayard/0000-0003-4482-5859; Rocco, Lorenzo/0000-0002-4034-3724",,,,,43,8,9,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Diverse factual and psychological reasons have been found to interact for Small and midcap Enterprises from different nations. This paper intends to fill gaps in knowledge on German SME internationalization and explore the cause and effect chain of SME characteristics, SME internationalization modalities and internationalization success in more detail. To what extent do SME characteristics (e.g. firm age, branch, size, leadership) determine internationalization preparation, strategy and possible impediments to internationalization? To what extent do parameters of internationalization preparation, strategy and possible impediments to internationalization determine the degree of SME internationalization success and performance? To what extent does the degree of SME internationalization determine SMEs' competitive performance? To answer these research questions the paper conducts a systematic review of previous studies on SME internationalization strategies, impediments and success and derives categories to assess the cause and effect relationships of SME internationalization systematically. These considerations result in a causal research model, which will be argued and detailed as to its indicators in the course of the paper. Model hypotheses to be tested by multiple regression modelling are derived from previous empirical research in the course of the paper. To test this model the study relies on an empirical survey among 167 German SMEs.

Although cost-utility models are used to examine treatments for metastatic cancer, limited information is available on utilities of SREs. The purpose of this study was to estimate the disutility of four SREs: spinal cord compression, pathological fracture, radiation to bone, and surgery performed to stabilize a bone. General population participants from the UK and Canada completed time trade-off (TTO) interviews to assess the utility of health states drafted based on literature review, clinician interviews, and patient interviews. Respondents first rated a health state describing cancer with bone metastases. Then, the SREs were added to this health state. Interviews were completed with 187 participants (50.8 % male, 80.2 % white). Cancer with bone metastases without an SRE had a mean utility of 0.47 (SD = 0.43) on a standard utility scale (1 = full health, 0 = death). Of the SREs, spinal cord compression was associated with the greatest disutility (i.e., the utility decrease): -0.32 with paralysis and -0.22 without paralysis. Surgery had a disutility of -0.07. Leg, arm, and rib fractures had disutilities of -0.06, -0.04, and -0.03. Two weeks of daily radiation treatment had a disutility of -0.06, while two radiation appointments had the smallest impact on utility (-0.02). All SREs were associated with statistically significant utility decreases, suggesting a perceived impact on quality of life beyond the impact of cancer with bone metastases. The resulting disutilities may be used in cost-utility models examining treatments to prevent SREs secondary to bone metastases.","[Matza, Louis S.; Currie, Brooke; Palsgrove, Andrew; Davies, Evan] United BioSource Corp, Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Chung, Karen; Braun, Ada] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Van Brunt, Kate] United BioSource Corp, Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD USA; [Brazier, John E.] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Body, Jean-Jacques] ULB, Brugmann Univ Hosp, Brussels, Belgium",United Biosource Corporation; Amgen; United Biosource Corporation; University of Sheffield; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Matza, LS (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, Outcomes Res, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",louis.matza@unitedbiosource.com,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Davies, Evan/GWU-9310-2022; Body, Jean-Jacques/G-9785-2015","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",,,,,51,21,22,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Understanding how customers perceive and evaluate offline and online services is important for companies in order to deliver superior services. Many studies on this topic are emerging from both academic and practitioner sources, but there are still some challenges confronted when studying perceived service quality on Internet. This paper addresses some possible solutions for challenges and uses flow theory as a background for a new conceptual model of PeSQ. Finally, limits of the study are discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Most initiatives to implement organizational changes did not achieve desired outcomes; they were late, unclearly and poor communicated, not focused on target or exceeded planned budget. Organizational changes interweave, overlap and blend. Although organizational changes are driven by various forces and motives, and managed by different managers and departments, aforementioned obstacles are mostly influenced by different reasons of individual resistance to change. The aim of this paper was to examine how managers can deal with employees' resistance to change. The working hypothesis was that changes can be successfully implemented if management is familiar with the most typical reasons of employees' resistance. The primary online survey was conducted, just before the accession of Croatia to the European Union. The sample of fifty (N=50) Croatian managers from 25 industries took part in it. The findings of this research indicated that the power of habit for routine way of work, techniques and procedures, among others, is the most important reason of individual resistance to changes in Croatian enterprises. We concluded that prerequisites for successful change implementation are good preparation for implementation, high level of consent of all employees to accept change, and change managers' high level of professionalism and competence.","[Perkov, Davor; Perkov, Matej] Libertas Business Sch, Zagreb, Croatia; [Katavic, Ivica] VERN Univ Appl Sci, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Perkov, D (通讯作者)，Libertas Business Sch, Zagreb, Croatia.",dperkov@vps-libertas.hr; ivica.katavic@vern.hr; matejperkov@vps-libertas.hr,"Katavic, Ivica/HGU-3249-2022",,,,,,12,1,2,1,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,464,474,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000045,0

In the early years of industrialisation, culture was used by the authoritarian regime as a form of ideological support. Strict controls were exercised over cultural production and presentation. Controls were later relaxed as the regime used entertainment and sport as popular distractions. However, the increase in television ownership, the growth of domestic electronics and home appliance industries, and rising incomes (especially among the middle class) provided the material base for the growth of cultural industries following democratisation in the 1990s. Cultural industries became key drivers of economic growth, innovation and employment, and were strongly promoted and supported by government in the style of the developmental state. The result was burgeoning production and international trade across a wide spectrum of cultural industries - film, television drama, animation, video games and music. As a reflection of the increasing integration of Korea into world markets, the government also had to ensure compliance with international trade regulations and clamp down on piracy. Today, the Korean Wave of popular culture has reached consumers in all parts of the world and makes a significant contribution to Korean gross domestic product and exports.","[Kwon, Seung-Ho; Kim, Joseph] Univ New S Wales, Korea Res Inst, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Kwon, SH (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Korea Res Inst, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",s.kwon@unsw.edu.au,,"Kim, Joseph/0000-0002-5521-8213",,,,,43,6,8,1,63,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

We examined the ability of current classification variables to explain LOS variation between DRG-like Diagnosis Treatment Combination (DBC)s for ten episodes of care in the Netherlands, including breast cancer, stroke and inguinal hernia repair. Additionally, we assessed the predictive ability of some other classification variables. For each episode of care, the relevant DBC codes of all hospitalizations in 2008 were identified and all available determinants that may serve as classification variables were acquired from the national database. Ordinary least squares regression was used to examine the predictive ability of these classification variables. The current classification variables are not sufficiently distinct to classify patients into mutually exclusive groups of patients. ICU admissions and hospital type may serve as valuable classification variables. Additionally, episode-specific variables may improve the Dutch grouping algorithm. Although it may not be feasible in the short term, grouping algorithms would benefit greatly from the introduction of classification variables tailored to the needs of specific episodes of care. A first step would be to focus on 'general' classification variables meaningful for specific episodes of care.","[Tan, Siok Swan; Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona; van Ineveld, B. Martin; Redekop, W.

This paper provides a nontechnical introduction and practical guide to a relatively low cost method that relies on remote sensing data to support ex post analysis of forest conservation policies. It describes the defining features of this approach, explains the broad empirical challenges to using it and the main strategies for meeting these challenges, catalogs the literature, discusses the requisite data, provides some practical guidance on modeling choices, and describes in detail two recent studies, (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, it remains unclear how associated high sunk establishment costs, long-term commitment, highly uncertain net returns, and policy induced incentives could drive farmer's decision to afforest agricultural land. A real option model is used to theoretically frame the decision to switch from agriculture to energy forestry. Optimal investment timing is modeled and the functioning of government subsidies offered to speed up the switch to energy forestry is analyzed. The empirical analysis examines the establishment of new short-rotation coppice willow stands in Central East Sweden. It is shown that in the presence of volatile agricultural profits and high establishment costs, subsidies are needed to accelerate investment. We then examine the case of the municipality of Enkoping and show that the combination of governmental subsidies for energy forestry with compensation for sewage sludge treatment provides an effective stimulus to investment in new willow stands which also has environmental benefits.

It shows - what is generally said but rarely empirically examined - that scientists and policy makers each deal with uncertainties in their own way and have a different perception of uncertainty; where the analyst wants to reduce uncertainty by generating more information and by improving the knowledge base, the policy maker wants to reduce his chances for making political mistakes. Connecting to the ongoing discussion on uncertainty classifications in futures studies, we discuss the characteristics of scenario studies and the way uncertainty is embedded in several scenario studies on climate change in the Netherlands, as well as in the policy process. Both the users and the producers of scenario studies are analyzed in how they deal with uncertainty. Supported by the empirical evidence we will show that not only miscommunication happens in the entire policy making process because policy makers have their own reality and way of dealing with uncertainty, but also show how scientists themselves struggle with uncertainty, sometimes taking the role of policy advocates wanting to influence decision-making. In the discussion, we show that the basis of this miscommunication lays in these different perceptions of uncertainty. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Policy Efficiency, and WTO Compatibility",JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SUSTAINABILITY,"Both the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and Article 7a of its Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) seek to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport fuels. The RED mandates a 10% share of renewable energy in transport fuels by 2020, whilst the FQD requires a 6% reduction in GHG emissions (from a 2010 base) by the same date. In practice, it will mainly be biofuels that economic operators will use to meet these requirements, but the different approaches can lead to either the RED, or the FQD, acting as the binding constraint. A common set of environmental sustainability criteria apply to biofuels under both the RED and the FQD. In particular, biofuels have to demonstrate a 35% (later increasing to 50/60%) saving in life-cycle GHG emissions. This could be problematic in the World Trade Organization (WTO), as a non-compliant biofuel with a 34% emissions saving would probably be judged to be 'like' a compliant biofuel. A more economically rational way to reduce GHG emissions, and one that might attract greater public support, would be for the RED to reward emission reductions along the lines of the FQD. Moreover, this modification would probably make the provisions more acceptable in the WTO, as there would be a clearer link between policy measures and the objective of reductions in GHG emissions; and the combination of the revised RED and the FQD would lessen the commercial incentive to import biofuels with modest GHG emission savings, and thus reduce the risk of trade tension.","[Swinbank, Alan] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England; [Daugbjerg, Carsten] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Daugbjerg, Carsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Reading; Australian National University; University of Copenhagen,"Swinbank, A (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",A.Swinbank@reading.ac.uk; cda@foi.ku.dk,"Daugbjerg, Carsten/E-5035-2015","Daugbjerg, Carsten/0000-0003-3869-6034",Danish Council for Strategic Research,Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)),Funding from the Danish Council for Strategic Research is gratefully acknowledged.,,26,11,11,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The high cost of preschool is often regarded as a major barrier to attendance. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of a one-year voucher/CCT intervention on preschool attendance and school readiness. To do so, we conducted a randomized controlled trial among 150 young children in a poor, rural county in China. Our analysis shows that the intervention, consisting of a tuition waiver and a cash transfer conditional on attendance, raised attendance by 20 percentage points (or by 35%). However, the intervention did not have measurable impact on children's school readiness. We believe that poor quality of preschool education in rural China (in terms of both teaching and facilities) contributes to our findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Results are robust to the inclusion of education, financial knowledge, and economic determinants of mortgage choice. Results are consistent with past findings of women being more risk averse than men in financial behaviors.

To debate a still quite abstract technology, participants functionally need a frame that determines which arguments are legitimate and which issues are relevant. Often, such frames are based on previous debates over other novel technologies. Three technologies currently provide frames for discussing SB: (green) biotechnology, nanotechnology and information technology. In the biotechnology debate, risk has long been emphasised over economic benefits. More recently, nanotechnology has been referred to mostly in terms of benefits, while risks tended to be an issue for scientific discourses. This has frequently been related to the many outreach activities around nanotechnology. Information technology, finally, has retained the image of being 'cool' and useful on a personal level. The technology itself is taken for granted and only the consequences of particular applications have been up for discussion. Upstream engagement exercises in SB will have to consider the comparator chosen more diligently, because it might influence the debate on SB 'out there' in the long run. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of state ownership and the introduction of foreign minority shareholders (IFMS) on these two types of efficiency measures are also studied. Under both sets of efficiency estimations, the empirical results consistently show that state ownership has no significant effect on the allocative efficiency of Chinese commercial banks, and no significant negative influence on the technical efficiency of these banks. IFMS helps Chinese commercial banks to eliminate the constraints from some ossified institutions and optimize input combinations.

On average, about 20% of the annual GDP per capita increase is due to the endowment of petroleum resources such as oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate.

In this policy brief, we investigate an under-researched feature of NCLB accountability-the use of safe harbor to meet proficiency rate objectives. We use school-level data on California schools between 2005 and 2011 to investigate the prevalence of safe harbor over time. We find dramatic increases in recent years, primarily for the objectives for historically disadvantaged groups. Furthermore, we find no evidence that schools using safe harbor meaningfully outperform schools failing Adequate Yearly Progress in the short or long run, casting doubt on the utility of the measure.

She deploys her own language, Xhosa, belonging to the Nguni group of languages, to name the theoretical framework: Eziko: Sipheka Sisophula. The cultural process eziko sipheka sisophula or gathering around the hearth (iziko) to cook (sipheka) and dish out (sisophula), rooted in the deep structure (worldview) of Nguni culture, symbolically and metaphorically captures, inter alia, the rhythmic nature and ontogenetic concept of the indigenous African self, relational African knowingness and intergenerational spiritual knowing characteristic of African ecological contexts. Rooted in African deep thought, Goduka's framework delinks theoretical construction and research from the hegemonic, oppressive, Eurocentric tradition thus affecting an epistemic/paradigmatic revolution which leads to intellectual freedom, emancipation, harmony and healing in African communities. Constructed on and deriving from the pillars of the dynamic relational African indigenous worldview-ontology, epistemology, axiology, cosmology, logic, teleology, and ideology-Goduka's eziko theoretical framework is a reflection of African indigeneity.

A discrete dynamic model was constructed to account for measures affecting both nitrogen and phosphorus and heterogeneous and coupled marine basins within the sea. Theoretical results revealed that positive decay rates of nutrient pools in the marine basins reduce abatement costs by delaying abatement over time. The results also showed that simultaneous management of both nutrients reduces overall abatement costs as compared with separate management. An empirical application to the intergovernmental agreement on nutrient pool targets in the Baltic Sea was made by combining results from an oceanographic model with an economic model of abatement costs. The results indicate that modest changes in decay rates make a significant impact on abatement costs and that simultaneous implementation of targets for both nutrients can reduce total cost by approximately 15% compared with separate treatment. A robust result is the finding that one country, Poland, faces much higher abatement costs than the other eight riparian countries because of its relatively large discharges into a marine basin with a stringent phosphorus target and slow response to load changes.","[Gren, Ing-Marie; Jansson, Torbjorn] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Savchuk, Oleg P.] Univ Stockholm, Balt Nest Inst, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Stockholm University,"Gren, IM (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",ing-marie.gren@ekon.slu.se; oleg@mbox.su.se; torbjorn.jansson@ekon.slu.se,"Savchuk, Oleg/N-3414-2019","Savchuk, Oleg/0000-0002-3873-4662; Jansson, Torbjorn/0000-0002-1005-5676",,,,,50,19,19,1,33,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Inflation targeting is the prevailing monetary policy in developed economies. In the inflation targeting regime, the objectives of monetary policy are hierarchized with price stability objective being of the highest importance. Central bankers operate monetary policy by manipulating interest rate to direct the economy toward desirable targets. When conducting monetary policy, central bankers often claim to use sophisticated models and justify their decisions on interest rate by the output of these models. Since the underlying economic processes are not fully known to us, complicated mathematically defined models cannot provide satisfactory results, we never know based on which rule the interest rate is set. The approach we propose can give the answer to this question as it can solve a complex problem without using a mathematical model and seems to be a suitable tool for monetary conduct. As a result, fuzzy control approach converts well-accepted qualitative rules of type IF ... THEN ... in monetary economics into an exact control strategy which is the size of interest rate to be set. We also verify the approach we propose on the 2W repo rate of the Czech Central Bank for a period from 2000 to 2011.","[Kodera, Jan; Quang Van Tran] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,kodera@vse.cz; tran@vse.cz,"Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022",,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-251-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,168,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC0II,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349058600025,0

In an increasingly globalized world, the (dis) equilibrium of such balance could have a significant impact on macroeconomic stability. Deficits or surpluses of different accounts from the balance of payments could have an impact on the exchange rate and the interest rate. The economic theory developed several approaches regarding the equilibrium of the balance of payments and specific public policies are used in this respect (tariff and non-tariff barriers, stimulus for exporting companies, subsidies, promoting activities for FDIs, improvement of country image etc.). One of the most sensitive problems in this matter of balance of payments' equilibrium is the manipulation of exchange rate (a depreciated currency is submitted to increase exports). This paper will present the two most important approaches in this field: elasticity approach and absorption approach and will provide a critical perspective on both theories. The assumptions of these approaches will be tested on the case of emerging markets (from Eastern and Southern Europe, Eastern and Southern Asia and Latin America) using panel regression methodology. The results will be very conclusive for the effectiveness of such using of depreciation or appreciation of local currency as a tool for temporarily improving the international position of emerging countries.","[Paun, Cristian; Musetescu, Radu; Munteanu, Costea] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paun, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cpaun@ase.ro,"Paun, Cristian/I-5609-2016","Paun, Cristian/0000-0002-5057-3750",Research Project CNCSIS TE [38 / 03.08.2010],Research Project CNCSIS TE(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)),"This paper is supported by Research Project CNCSIS TE nr. 38 / 03.08.2010 entitled Contagion Effect of Financial Crises in Case of Eastern European Countries: A version of this paper was presented to the 20th Annual International Conference Marketing and Business Strategies for Central & Eastern Europe organized by Vienna University of Economics and Business and DePaul University Chicago, 6 - 8 December 2013.

The method was elaborated at the Mendel University in Brno. It was used for example for evaluation of ecological damage on forest functions of the National Park High Tatras forests (Slovakia) caused by wind calamity or for evaluation of ecological damage on forest functions caused by illegal harvesting in the Czech Republic. It was also used for a definition of areas and zonation of recreational forests of big cities (model example Prague) or as a part of EIA. The method is based on ecosystem principles; the basic premise claims that forest functions are human independent production of forest ecosystem. Determining criterions of forest functions are basic measured parameters of forest ecosystems - climatic, hydrologic, geologic, pedologic and biotic. Forest functions are evaluated by so called Real potentials (in forest ecosystem optimal status) and Real effects (in forest actual status). Social demands of forests (e. g. recreational forests, nature protection etc.) are expressed by Factor of topical forest interest. Economical extension of the method comes from legally stated average price of wood primarily. The method was accepted by the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of CR and is also used as an approved methodology of the Czech Inspection of Environment.

The author examines the impact of the economic crisis on employment, earnings, inequality and poverty in the EU, focusing on Denmark, Germany, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom during the period 200810. After reviewing the literature, he analyses recent trends, finding that during this stage of the crisis real wages reacted countercyclically in most countries, thus diverging from the pattern observed in previous recessions. He finds considerable cross-national variation in the severity and direction of changes in terms of inequality and poverty rates. However, he argues that inequality may widen because of the potential regressive effects of the announced austerity programmes.","[De Beer, Paul] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Adv Labour Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [De Beer, Paul] Sci Bur Dutch Trade Union Movement, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"De Beer, P (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Adv Labour Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.t.debeer@uva.nl,,,,,,,25,27,30,2,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

However, we know little about how the labor market produces such a distribution. Using data from two regions in Peru, we investigate whether there is a national teacher market or smaller regional markets. We estimate discrete-choice multinomial models to identify variables (including teacher characteristics, institutional features and geographical factors) associated with the location of teachers in the first jobs of their careers. Results indicate that teacher markets are regional in scope. Being born in a certain province (sub-area of a region) substantially increases the probability of having a first teaching position in that same province. We also find evidence that the geographic mobility of teachers is quite limited. Results suggest that policies to strengthen teacher educational systems and reduce inequities should focus on the regional level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The ability of the Canadian forest sector to successfully adapt to climate change, i.e. its adaptive capacity, was assessed through a series of group discussions and interviews with a variety of forestry stakeholders across Canada. The assessment was oriented to the following determinants of adaptive capacity: 1) The range of available technological options for adaptation that would be considered in response to a perceived climate-related stress; 2) The availability of resources; 3) The structure and functionality of critical institutions to understand the allocation of decision-making authority, institutional flexibility, and the decision criteria that would be employed; 4) Human and social capital, including the distribution of educational achievement, differential access to personal security and robust property rights: 5) The system's (and individuals') access to risk-spreading processes (both formal and informal); 6) Decision-makers' ability to manage information, the processes by which these decision-makers determine which information is credible, and the credibility of the decision-makers themselves. Forest managers were generally optimistic about their ability to identify and implement adaptation options at the forest management unit level. However, institutional barriers were seen to be a major impediment; managers identified tenure reform and a more flexible regulatory environment as essential for the innovation that will be required by climate change. Other factors limiting adaptive capacity include lack of financial resources and low levels of investment in the forest sector, lack of specialized science capacity in climate change impacts and the long-term nature of planning required by long-lived forest species. Several non-governmental institutions may support increased adaptive capacity including forest certification systems, Criteria and Indicators of Sustainable Forest Management, Canada's model forest program and others. However, these institutions will need to be modified in order to support forest managers in planning for climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explains the strategies of national employer associations towards labour market regulations geared to protect national wage standards in the context of labour mobility. First, this article shows that employers in non-tradable sectors confronted with strong trade unions support the regulation of wage standards in order to prevent foreign competitors from using lower wages as a competitive advantage. Second, the strategies of national employer associations (as protagonists, consenters or antagonists) are explained by sectoral power relationships within employer associations, trade union power resources and the risk of unilateral public intervention. A comparative case study analysis of regulation processes in Austria, Switzerland and Ireland shows that employer associations dominated by firms in non-tradable sectors are protagonists of wage regulation, while employer associations dominated by firms in tradable sectors consent to negotiate with trade unions about wage regulation in order to ensure labour acquiescence, or contain unilateral public intervention.","Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Afonso, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany.",afonso@mpifg.de,,"Afonso, Alexandre/0000-0002-3545-5035",,,,,57,36,37,0,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Patients treated for appendectomy in US veterans health administration (VHA) hospitals in 2005 were included into our study. Direct medical cost and postoperative complications during hospitalization were used as outcomes. Propensity score matching was employed to adjust for baseline imbalances between treatment groups. It was adjusted for the severity of appendicitis, comorbidities according to Charlson Comorbidity Index, and demographic variables. 1:1 optimal matching with replacement was performed. Based on the matched samples, we estimated generalized linear mixed regression models for costs (gamma model) and postoperative complications (logit model). Besides patients' covariates, predictors of hospital resource use and quality of care at the hospital level were considered as explanatory variables. The total study population comprised of 1,128 patients (370 LA, 758 OA) from 95 VHA hospitals. Type of appendectomy had a significant influence on total costs (P = 0.005), with predicted costs for LA being 17.1% lower in comparison to OA (OA: 10,851 US$ [95%CI: 9,707 US$; 12,131 US$] vs. LA: 8,995 US$ [95%CI: 8,073 US$; 10,022 US$]). Differences in the predicted overall postoperative complication were not significant between LA and OA (P = 0.6311). Severity of appendicitis had a significant impact on costs and postoperative complications. Predicted costs for LA were 1,856 US$ lower than for OA while the postoperative complication rate did not differ significantly. Thus, LA is the treatment of choice from a provider's perspective.","[Haas, Laura; Stargardt, Tom; Schreyoegg, Jonas] Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Stargardt, Tom; Schreyoegg, Jonas] Univ Munich, Dept Hlth Serv Management, Munich, Germany; [Schreyoegg, Jonas] Stanford Univ, Ctr Primary Care & Outcomes Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Munich; Stanford University,"Haas, L (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",Laura.Haas@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Schreyögg, Jonas/AAY-6182-2021","Schreyögg, Jonas/0000-0001-8030-2161",,,,,68,11,14,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Relevant international law treaties have declared sustainable development's mutual supportiveness with trade liberalization, and also emphasized the need to balance its 'pillars': economic development, often equated with trade liberalization, with environmental conservation and social welfare. While 'mutual supportiveness' suggests that sustainable development's environmental and social goals are a side effect of trade liberalization, 'balancing' involves weighing these different goals, and prompts the difficult question of which are most important, and who is empowered to decide. This paper traces these two broad theoretical conceptions through WTO legal texts, negotiations and dispute settlement, arguing that they have important pragmatic implications. In particular, to create mutual supportiveness WTO Director-General, Pascal Lamy, has stated the need for adequate domestic policies, suggesting that the WTO should support these. Yet, if they have negative trade impacts, pure 'sustainable development' policies may be difficult to balance against the WTO obligation to liberalize trade.","Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Lydgate, EB (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, London, England.",emily.lydgate@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,18,19,1,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2012,11.0,4,,,,,621,639,,10.1017/S1474745612000341,0.0,,,19,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,027WR,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310385300003,0

It describes efforts to support such capacity-building in the UK through a series of Interdisciplinary Masterclasses which used workshop-based elicitation techniques to develop smallscale studies in order to synthesise experiential knowledge and foster mutual learning. This has enabled us to build important bridges between research and practice, thereby supporting and developing the interdisciplinary careers of early- and mid-career researchers, as well as research managers and leaders. This paper describes an approach to interdisciplinary capacity-building derived from actual practice. Based on learning from these activities, we offer some suggestions for improved supervision and mentoring of interdisciplinary graduate students and young postdoctoral researchers. If we are to develop effective, future interdisciplinary capacity, we advocate that supervisors/mentors need to focus, not just on the research, but on the particular forms of professional support and mentoring required by inexperienced interdisciplinary researchers in terms of career guidance, the development of publications strategies and network building.

This new demand for health care gives rise to the need to identify those factors which influence the user's decision to contact the health services and those which determine the quantity of services consumed. The aim of this study is to identify which variables affect these two stages of the use of such services in the Girona Health Region (RSG), where immigrant population represents 21.96% of the total population. Specification of a Hurdle model with a count response variable related to primary health care service visits in the RSG for 2006. The study data is based on a sample of users (immigrants and natives) taken from the population assigned to primary health care services in eight Basic Health Areas (ABS) of the RSG. Contacting primary health care services is associated with variables that ought to affect use of health care such as chronic illness and taking prescribed medication as well as being aged between 46 and 55. Using primary health care services once makes users more likely to make further visits. The number of visits is related not only with variables that ought affect use of health care but also with variables that ought not to affect use of health care such as working without a contract, living in rented accommodation, or being unemployed. Additionally, if we consider the birthplace of the user, we observe the same pattern, with different directions and intensities, depending on the origin of the patient. For example, a higher likelihood of first contact is shown in Eastern Europeans, South Americans, and North Africans that suffer from cholesterol. A higher attendance is observed in natives and Eastern Europeans that take prescribed medication as well as natives, Eastern Europeans, and North Africans living in rented accommodation. On the other hand, working without a contract supposes a higher attendance in natives but a lower attendance in Eastern Europeans and sub-Saharan Africans. We do not detect any socioeconomic barriers associated with making a first contact with primary health services for the users analyzed. However, we do note evidence of horizontal inequity in terms of attending health services, related to variables that ought to affect use of health care as well as socioeconomic factors (variables that ought not to affect use of health care).

So far, studies of the impact of pay on the aptitude distribution of teachers have provided mixed evidence on the extent to which altering teacher salaries represents a feasible solution to the teacher quality problem. One possible reason is that these studies have been unable to separate labor supply effects from labor demand effects. To address this. I model the relationship between current salaries and the academic aptitude of future teachers (those entering teacher education courses). Using a unique dataset of test scores for every individual admitted into an Australian university between 1989 and 2003, I explore how interstate variation in average pay or pay dispersion affects the decision to enter teacher education courses. A1 percent rise in the salary of a starting teacher boosts the average aptitude of students entering teacher education courses by 0.6 percentile ranks, with the effect being strongest for those at the median. This result is robust to instrumenting for teacher pay using uniform salary schedules for public schools. I also find some evidence that more pay dispersion in the non-teaching sector lowers the aptitude of potential teachers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The safe technology bears no failure risk, but leads to patient-specific disutility since it cannot completely solve the health problems. By contrast, the risky technology (for instance a surgery) may entirely cure patients, but fail with some probability depending on the hospital's care level. Tight malpractice liability increases care levels if the risky technology is chosen at all, but also leads to excessively high incentives for avoiding the liability exposure by adopting the safe technology. We refer to this distortion toward the safe technology as negative defensive medicine. Taking the problem of negative defensive medicine seriously, the second best optimal liability needs to balance between the over-incentive for the safe technology in case of tough liability and the incentive to adopt little care for the risky technology in case of weak liability. In a model with errors in court, we find that gross negligence where hospitals are held liable only for very low care levels outperforms standard negligence, even though standard negligence would implement the first best efficient care level.","Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Feess, E (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",e.feess@frankfurt-school.de,,,,,,,42,19,20,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We show that this remains true even when examining suitable counterfactuals that hold observables constant between whites and blacks.

This study employs a rich and unique data set of ratings from six international agencies to investigate the causes of split sovereign ratings in emerging countries. Three reasons are identified in explaining the relatively high frequency of disagreement across agencies on emerging sovereign ratings. First, rating agencies use different economic factors and different weights on those factors. Second, rating agencies disagree to a greater extent about more opaque issuers. Third, for smaller rating agencies, issuers in their home region tend to be more favored. The findings should be of interest to a wide range of participants in global credit markets.","[Alsakka, Rasha; ap Gwilym, Owain] Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Alsakka, R (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales.",r.alsakka@bangor.ac.uk; owain.apgwilym@bangor.ac.uk,,,,,,,20,8,11,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The construct of this paper is based on comprehensive review of recent literatures on internal R&D and operation performance moderated by Intellectual property rights (patent). Detailed discussions follow to give implications in policy making especially government or related authorities in promoting and enforcing intellectual property rights. Intellectual property rights policy especially regarding patents should be part of company's business strategy. Implementing IPR will safeguard company's new inventions, products or processes in the long run. Company may gain benefits in creating new business opportunity during various patenting stages. Effective practice of internal R&D will give advantage to the company in three different aspects namely ability to develop and grow critical human resources, dynamic involvement in the corporate R&D program and ability to connect information wise. Therefore, implementation of intellectual property rights will encourage better performance of the company in the future. It was reported that the average R&D intensity for non-S&P 500 companies rose from 2.3% in the 1980's to 7.0% in the 2000's. This shows that relatively how importance R&D investment that should be made by company for their sustainability.

This article adds to the literature by combining information on students' math skills and their motivation. The authors are thus able to present a rich picture of why students succeed in their study of economics and to confirm previous findings that deficient math preparation bodes ill for first-year study success in economics. However, the authors also find that within the population of math-deficient students, motivation matters. Applying factor analysis to a survey of students at Erasmus School of Economics, the authors identify four motivational factors; among these, intrinsic motivation is most strongly related to first-year study success. The authors also show that intrinsic motivation may help to overcome inadequate preparatory math education.","[Arnold, Ivo J.

The monitoring was performed in five regions of the Czech Republic: Zlinsky, Jihomoravsky, Olomoucky, Moravskoslezsky and the region Vysocina. The soil samples were collected from two layers of arable land and grassland. The upper layer of arable land was from 0 to 25 cm, lower layer from 35 to 60 cm. The upper layer of grassland was from 0 to 10 cm, lower layer from 11 to 25 cm. The soil samples were lyophilized and extracted with acetone: hexan (1: 1). Then, the samples were purified by sulphuric acid. The levels of DBP and DEHP were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. The concentrations of DBP ranged from 0.1 to 1.1 mg.kg(-1) of original weight in the upper horizon and from 0.07 to 0.87 mg.kg(-1) of original weight in the lower horizon. The concentrations of DEHP ranged from 0.1 to 1.31 mg.kg(-1) of original weight in the upper horizon and from 0.12 to 0.6 mg.kg(-1) of original weight in the lower horizon. The concentrations of phthalic acid esters did not significantly differ from themselves in soil samples in this study. These results indicate the uniform load of soils of esters of pthalic acid in Czech Republic.","[Dankova, R.; Jarosova, A.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Food Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Polakova, S.] Cent Inst Supervising & Testing Agr, Brno 65606, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Danková, R (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Food Technol, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xdankov5@node.mendelu.cz,"Langová, Radka/L-2099-2018; Langová, Radka/AAQ-1276-2020; Jarosova, Alzbeta/L-3488-2018","Langová, Radka/0000-0002-4324-502X; Jarosova, Alzbeta/0000-0002-9809-3529",,,,,21,3,3,0,8,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,736,747,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200084,0

The data reveal an industrious population in which two-thirds to three-quarters of women in farm families engaged in market-oriented work. The data suggest that women were pushed rather than pulled into the rural labor force, and that poverty was the primary factor driving rural women's participation.

Leaders of businesses do not recognize the problem mentioned above very well, which results in small and micro businesses ignoring patent management and its effective application. Lack of prevention and control ability over patent risks is responsible for the shortage of crisis consciousness and the ability to meet an emergency during the course of dealing with international and intellectual property rights competition.

Interventions are being made that: promote individual participation in plans through auto-enrolment techniques; increase the rate at which individuals make tax-favoured payments into plans through contribution escalator schemes; and cater for the decision-making and risk management deficiencies of individuals by providing default option funds with in-built 'life-style' and 'targetdate' investment strategies. After Deleuze and Foucault, we argue that this 'behavioural revolution' is a rearticulation of the heterogeneous elements which, in relation, produce the dispositif (apparatus) of DC plans as a distributed form of agency that places the retirement investor at its centre. Behavioural economics is shown to continue the inherently incomplete remaking of retirement investors within DC plans, necessarily precarious financial subjects who face the highly uncertain prospect that returns on investment after fees will be sufficient to meet their expectations of security in old age.","[Langley, Paul] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Sci Labs, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Leaver, Adam] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, PMO Div, 6-04 Harold Hankins Bldg, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",Durham University; University of Manchester,"Langley, P (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Sci Labs, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",paul.langley@durham.ac.uk,,"Langley, Paul/0000-0002-1924-7711; Leaver, Adam/0000-0001-6199-6057",,,,,61,34,37,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

We compare the status quo fishing policy to an optimal policy under two different salinity conditions, which have a link to climate change. The fishery of these species is not at the most profitable level. If the fishing mortalities are lower, economic return will be greater in the long run. A lower fishing mortality for cod, which allows time for individuals to grow and achieve a higher economic value and reproduction potential, would result in the recovery of the cod stock. Under a high salinity level, which leads to better conditions for cod recruitment, the cod stock has a better chance to recover even without a decrease in fishing mortality. Therefore, fishery management is even more important under conditions of low salinity, which are likely to prevail in the future due to changing climate.","[Nieminen, Emmi; Lindroos, Marko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Heikinheimo, Outi] Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, FI-00791 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Nieminen, E (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",emmi.e.nieminen@helsinki.fi; marko.lindroos@helsinki.fi; outi.heikinheimo@rktl.fi,"Lindroos, Marko/B-7966-2015","Lindroos, Marko/0000-0002-9351-6115","Nordforsk Top-Level Research Initiative (TFI), NordForsk [36800]","Nordforsk Top-Level Research Initiative (TFI), NordForsk","This study is part of the Nordic Centre of Excellence project Nordic Centre for Research on Marine Ecosystems and Resources under Climate Change (NorMER) supported financially by the Nordforsk Top-Level Research Initiative (TFI), NordForsk Project number 36800.",,47,18,19,0,22,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

We are interested in understanding programs or courses in entrepreneurship in relation to a number of personal and contextual variables. On a theoretical level, it is based on psychosocial models such as the intent theory of planned behavior, based on the studies of Ajzen (1991), and the model of the entrepreneurial event of Shapero Entrepreneurship (Shapero & Sokol, 1982). According to these models, just considering starting a business brings about strong positive feelings, without thought for the reality of this as a desirable and feasible action. Model validation is based on a quantitative study, conducted on 120 students in third grade LMD, following the path of entrepreneurship. The choice of this sample is due to the fact that these students are just a few months away from entering the world of work. Our analysis shows that perceived desirability and feasibility are two prerequisites for the formation of entrepreneurial intentions. Indeed, the existence of an idea or project, and information retrieval, are the factors that contribute most outcomes of predictions on entrepreneurial intention. Our research will build an instrument that facilitates the analysis of the profiles for the recruitment of students wishing to take the entrepreneurial path.","[Salhi, Bassem; Boujelbene, Younes] Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax,,bassem.salhi@yahoo.fr; boujelbene.younes@yahoo.fr,,"Salhi, Bassem/0000-0003-2766-2541",,,,,21,1,1,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2020,2035,,,,,,16,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801083,0

To solve the inefficiency of resources allocation like this kind of policy, we must reorganize the strategy space, and perfect the policy implements' supervise mechanism.","[Wu, Miao; Wu, Wei] HUST, Sch Publ Adm, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,,wum7565@sohu.com; 84567359@qq.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-61896-012-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,734,738,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BBY61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308816301011,0

It finds the practice based approach being an innovative, theoretically sound concept, which is able to produce valuable and thick empirical results. The approach is also found offering a plethora of possibilities to link up to analytical policy research. Yet, the approach will require further elaboration, especially on questions regarding the role of definitions, its contribution towards explaining social phenomena, and concerning the use of normative orientations in some of the empirical cases. The future challenges of the approach lie in either moulding a niche for further developing it independent from other schools, or in influencing mainstream approaches through theoretical innovations or surprising empirical results.

We address the problem that societal systems remain recalcitrant despite the development of powerful approaches for dealing with both of these qualities. The root of this problem we identify to be that the combination between complexity and complicatedness is emergent; i.e. fundamentally and irreducibly different from either quality in isolation. This means that neither class of such approaches can be expected to work well on their own. But it also means that the obvious strategy of combining theory for complexity and complicatedness may be much more challenging than envisioned. In short, systems where complexity and complicatedness is mixed ought to be treated as a distinct class of systems. Noting a connection to what has long been called wicked problems we hereby outline such a class of systems that we call wicked systems. We introduce a simple model and heuristic and discuss some implications for theorizing and modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the virtues of each of these models, there is a need to develop a more integrated approach to the epidemiology and economics of disease that better represents and captures existing feedback mechanisms that can influence the success of disease control interventions and their cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we motivate the use of system dynamics (SD) modeling in the context of sea lice control in Norwegian farmed salmon. Separate models of sea lice and salmon growth were designed and integrated to capture the feedbacks between them. Different simulation scenarios highlight the benefits of the approach. Model results indicated that changing the timing and type of treatment vis-a-vis current practices can markedly reduce sea lice infection pressures; such simulated practices are also more cost effective. Our approach further highlights how delays and feedbacks present in these systems influence the success of any disease control protocol, and demonstrates the utility that SD models can play in aquatic health.","[Hamza, Kanar; Rich, Karl M.] Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, Dept Int Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Wheat, I.

Since the 1990s, Latin American countries have enacted significant social policy reforms that have supplemented contributory insurance policies with new or expanded non-contributory programmes, financed by general tax revenues. We present a political explanation for this phenomenon, arguing that the process of deindustrialization, and especially the increased labour insecurity that it entails, has changed the mix of social insurance policies favoured by different individuals in the income and employment distributions. A long-term increase in economic insecurity has increased the relative demand for tax-financed, rather than contribution-financed, social insurance. Elected officials, especially those in the recent 'rise of the Left' in Latin America, have proved eager to meet these demands. We find strong evidence for this argument using both cross-national data on non-contributory pension policy adoption and individual-level data on policy preferences.","[Carnes, Matthew E.] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Mares, Isabela] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Georgetown University; Columbia University,"Carnes, ME (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",mec247@georgetown.edu,"Carnes, Matthew/U-3103-2019; Carnes, Matthew/HLH-1106-2023",,,,,,69,47,53,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This article examines this challenge in an area where the EU has a particularly long tradition of establishing common policies: agriculture. By comparing in particular the international agricultural negotiations that have taken place in the framework of the Uruguay and the Doha Development Rounds (up until Cancun), it argues that internal coherence is actually not a sufficient condition for EU influence in these negotiations. On the contrary, by building on different strands of literature - International Relations, EU studies and trade policy - it shows that the EU's ability to influence outcomes has been increasingly affected by external developments. More specifically, the article draws on three crucial external processes in this regard: First, emerging powers have gained substantial commercial weight. Second, key countries, especially Brazil, have played an increasingly active role in the negotiations. Third, these countries have strengthened their positions through successful coalition-building. Consequently, if European policy-makers want to increase the EU's influence in agricultural trade negotiations, they have to more consciously adapt its negotiation approaches to the changing external negotiation environment.","[Garcia-Duran, Patricia; Millet, Montserrat] Univ Barcelona, Int Law & Econ Dept, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Duran, Patricia; Millet, Montserrat] Univ Barcelona, Publ Int Law & Int Relat Res Grp ADIPIRI, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Kienzle, Benjamin] Kings Coll London, Joint Serv Command & Staff Coll, Def Studies Dept, Shrivenham SN6 8TS, Wilts, England",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; University of London; King's College London,"Garcia-Duran, P (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Int Law & Econ Dept, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",patriciagarciaduran@ub.edu; ben.kienzle@kcl.ac.uk; millet@ub.edu,"Garcia-Duran, Patricia/P-9113-2019","Garcia-Duran, Patricia/0000-0002-4038-4892; Kienzle, Benjamin/0000-0002-6185-4814",,,,,71,5,5,1,20,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

To eliminate state-specific and school-type-specific shocks, I estimate a triple-differences model using three PISA waves. The results indicate that the reform reduced the performance of 15-year-old students both in low- and middle-track schools. Further evidence suggests that the share of very low-performing students increased in low-track schools. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It finds that the overnight drop in the ask price is smaller than the overnight drop in the bid price. In addition, the study finds that average price drops are smaller than the dividend amount for all dividend sizes. I also find no evidence of a sawtooth-shaped relationship between the dividend amount and the ex-day price drop. These results are generally consistent with the lack of an automated limit order adjustment mechanism.","Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Econ & Polit Sci, Muscat, Oman",Sultan Qaboos University,"Al-Yahyaee, KH (通讯作者)，Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Econ & Polit Sci, Muscat, Oman.",yahyai@squ.edu.om,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,10,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Beyond the summary of usage over time, we ask whether nontraditional revenues like fees accentuate or mitigate the impact of downturns. More generally, we examine the extent to which school districts have responded to fiscal pressures by turning to nontax revenues. We also document the extent to which the use of nontax revenues varies across districts according to student poverty status. We show that alternative revenues continue to be a small source of local revenues and have increased quite little since the early 1990s. There was at most a minimal shift to nontax revenues in downturns, though there is evidence of greater use of these revenues among school districts facing more permanent fiscal pressures like tax limits. Differential access to fee revenues and other alternative revenues during downturns may slightly accentuate inequities in K-12 education spending.","[Downes, Tom] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Killeen, Kieran M.] Univ Vermont, Dept Leadership & Dev Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",Tufts University; University of Vermont,"Killeen, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Dept Leadership & Dev Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",thomas.downes@tufts.edu; Kieran.Killeen@uvm.edu,"Downes, Thomas/S-1873-2019",,,,,,45,4,4,0,13,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.
