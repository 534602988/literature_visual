Many COPD models developed to date have followed a Markov structure, in which patients or populations can move between defined health states over successive time periods or cycles. In COPD, health states are typically based on disease severity defined solely by lung function, as described by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. These current modelling methods may restrict the ability to reflect the disease progression/clinical pathway or clinical practice. Objectives Given these limitations in previous COPD models, the authors aimed to develop a more flexible model that could improve on the description of the clinical disease pathway. The overall objective of this model was to inform the development of policies, guidelines or cost-effectiveness analyses. A second objective was to validate the model in relation to existing epidemiology studies of COPD. Methods A patient simulation model was developed in Microsoft Excel(TM). The predictability of the model was tested by populating it with data from natural history of disease studies as well as with clinical trial data. Each patient moves through the model with demographic characteristics randomly generated from a set distribution. These characteristics determine the risk of clinical events occurring in the model. Results The validation with these studies found the model to have generally good predictive ability, yielding in this way a good degree of external validity. Conclusions The micro-simulation model is a flexible approach for modelling COPD that allows consideration of complex COPD treatment pathways. The model was found to be generally robust in terms of predicting clinical outcomes of published studies when tested against other studies. It has significant potential as a tool for supporting future COPD treatment positioning decisions as well as to inform the development of policies, guidelines or cost-effectiveness analyses.","[Asukai, Yumi; Fonseca, Tiago; Mungapen, Laura] IMS Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, London N1 9JY, England; [Baldwin, Michael] Novartis Horsham Res Ctr, Horsham, W Sussex, England; [Gray, Alastair] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth, Oxford, England; [Price, David] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Acad Primary Care, Aberdeen, Scotland",Novartis; University of Oxford; University of Aberdeen,"Asukai, Y (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 210 Pentonville Rd, London N1 9JY, England.",yasukai@uk.imshealth.com,"Price, David/H-2837-2019","Price, David/0000-0002-9728-9992",Novartis Pharma AG; AstraZeneca; Boehringer Ingelheim; Chiesi; GlaxoSmithKline; Merck; Novartis; Pfizer; UK NHS; Aerocrine; Mundipharma; Nycomed; Teva; Cipla; Sandoz; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0509-10206] Funding Source: researchfish,Novartis Pharma AG; AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); Boehringer Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim); Chiesi(Chiesi Pharmaceuticals Inc); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Merck(Merck & Company); Novartis(Novartis); Pfizer(Pfizer); UK NHS; Aerocrine; Mundipharma; Nycomed; Teva(Teva Pharmaceutical Industries); Cipla; Sandoz(Novartis); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This study and manuscript was funded by Novartis Pharma AG.

Furthermore, rising costs in oncology cause a growing concern about reimbursement for innovations in this sector. The promise of pharmacogenomic profiling and related stratified therapies in mCRC is to improve treatment efficacy and potentially save costs. Among other examples, the commonly used epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab are only effective in patients with kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) wild-type cancers. Hence, the adaptation of predictive biomarker testing might be a valid strategy for healthcare systems worldwide. Objective This study aims to review the clinical and economic evidence supporting pharmacogenomic profiling prior to the administration of pharmaceutical treatment in mCRC. Moreover, key drivers and areas of uncertainty in cost-effectiveness evaluations are analysed. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies evaluating the cost effectiveness of predictive biomarkers and the result dependent usage of pharmaceutical agents in mCRC. Results The application of predictive biomarkers to detect KRAS mutations prior to the administration of EGFR antibodies saved treatment costs and was cost effective in all identified evaluations. However, because of the lack of data regarding cost-effectiveness analyses for predictive biomarker testing, e.g. for first-line treatment, definitive conclusions cannot be stated. Key drivers and areas of uncertainty in current cost-effectiveness analyses are, among others, the consideration of predictive biomarker costs, the characteristics of single predictive biomarkers and the availability of clinical data for the respective pharmaceutical intervention. Especially the cost effectiveness of uridine diphosphate-glucttronyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) mutation analysis prior to irinotecan-based chemotherapy remains unclear. Conclusion Pharmacogenomic profiling has the potential to improve the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatment in mCRC. Hence, quantification of the economic impact of stratified medicine as well as cost-effectiveness analyses of pharmacogenomic profiling are becoming more important. Nevertheless, the methods applied in cost-effectiveness evaluations for the usage of predictive biomarkers for patient selection as well as the level of evidence required to determine clinical effectiveness are areas for further research. However, mCRC is one of the first indications in which stratified therapies are used in clinical practice. Thus, clinical and economic experiences could be helpful when adopting pharmacogenomic profiling into clinical practice for other indications.","[Frank, Martin] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Mittendorf, Thomas] Herescon GmbH, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Frank, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",mf@ivbl.uni-hannover.de,,,Merck Serono,Merck Serono(Merck & Company),No sources of funding were used to conduct this study or prepare the manuscript.

In particular, Markov, regime-switching, jump-diffusion models are used to describe stochastic movements of short-term interest rate and force of mortality. These models capture jumps in short rate and mortality rate and the impacts of economic and environmental fundamentals on their movements over time. Using the concept of stochastic flows, we derive an exponential affine form of the longevity bond price in the proposed joint stochastic interest rate and mortality models. In particular, a representation for the exponential affine form of the longevity bond price is obtained in terms of fundamental matrix solutions of linear, matrix-valued, ordinary differential equations.

Such models are also applicable to other positive variables such as waiting time in a queue, daily/hourly rainfall, and demand for electricity. This paper develops a new method for testing the lack-of-fit of a given parametric multiplicative error model having a Markov structure. The test statistic is of Kolmogorov-Smirnov type based on a particular martingale transformation of a marked empirical process. The test is asymptotically distribution free, is consistent against a large class of fixed alternatives, and has nontrivial asymptotic power against a class of nonparametric local alternatives converging to the null hypothesis at the rate of O(n(-1/2)). In a simulation study, the test performed better overall than the general purpose Ljung-Box Q-test, a Lagrange multiplier type test, and a generalized moment test. We illustrate the testing procedure by considering two data examples.","[Perera, Indeewara] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Koul, Hira L.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Monash University; Michigan State University,"Perera, I (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, POB 197, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",indeewara.perera@monash.edu,,"Perera, Bethmage Sandun Indeewara/0000-0002-7703-8168",NSF DMS [0704130]; Australian Research Council [DP0665710]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [0704130] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Australian Research Council [DP0665710] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,NSF DMS(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank two anonymous referees and the co-editor Oliver Linton for their constructive comments and suggestions that led to substantial improvements in this paper.

While previous literature has discovered several significant economic, demographic, and institutional variables, little attention has been devoted to cultural dimensions. We find that non-life insurance consumption is adversely impacted in countries where a large fraction of the population has Islamic beliefs. Also highly significant are three of the cultural scores developed by Hofstede in a celebrated study: Power Distance, Individualism, and Uncertainty Avoidance. An important finding is that culture impacts non-life insurance more in affluent countries, with an adjusted R-square coefficient increasing by 11.7%, than in developing countries where the R-square coefficient increase due to cultural impacts is only 1.2%. These results have implications for multinational insurers seeking to enter a new market.

This forward looking measure is model-independent and based on observed option data. It is baptized the Herd Behavior Index (HIX). The degree of co-movement in a stock market can be determined by comparing the observed market situation with the extreme (theoretical) situation under which the whole system is driven by a single factor. The HIX is then defined as the ratio of an option-based estimate of the risk-neutral variance of the market index and an option-based estimate of the corresponding variance in case of the extreme single factor market situation. The HIX can be determined for any market index provided an appropriate series of vanilla options is traded on this index as well as on its components. As an illustration, we determine historical values of the 30-days HIX for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, covering the period January 2003 to October 2009. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The returns of assets and amount of the cash flow all depend on the states of a stochastic market which are assumed to follow a discrete-time Markov chain.

A common strategy simplifies the task by limiting the analysis to just one option per date. We first discuss its drawbacks on the basis of model interpretation, estimation results and pricing exercises. We then turn the attention to a more flexible approach, that successfully exploits the wealth of information contained in large heterogeneous panels of options, and we apply it to actual S&P 500 index and index call options data. Our approach breaks the stochastic singularity between contemporaneous option prices by assuming that every observation is affected by measurement error, essentially recasting the problem as a non-linear filtering one. The resulting likelihood function is evaluated using a Monte Carlo Importance Sampling (MC-IS) strategy, combined with a Particle Filter algorithm. The results provide useful intuitions on the directions that should be followed to extend the model, in particular by allowing jumps or regime switching in the volatility process.","[Ferriani, Fabrizio; Pastorello, Sergio] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Ferriani, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",fabrizio.ferriani@unibo.it; sergio.pastorello@unibo.it,,,,,,,39,11,13,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1368-4221,,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

The comparators were enoxaparin and fondaparinux, as identified in the scope issued by NICE. The School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. Clinical-effectiveness evidence for DBG versus enoxaparin was derived from two randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trials, one for THR and the other for TKR. Clinical-effectiveness evidence for DBG versus fondaparinux was taken from a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) and from one study. The results presented show that DBG at the licensed dose of 220 mg and 150 mg once daily was noninferior to enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) in terms of the primary efficacy outcome of total VTE and all-cause mortality. In the MTC, fondaparinux was found to be more effective than DBG; the level of statistical significance was not reported. The manufacturer's cost-effectiveness model estimated that at a dose of 220 mg once a day, DBG dominated enoxaparin in both THR and TKR. At a dose of 150 mg daily, DBG dominated enoxaparin in THR, while enoxaparin dominated DBG in TKR. At a dose of 220 mg daily, DBG was less cost effective than fondaparinux in THR. The cost per QALY gained for fondaparinux versus DBG was 11 pound 111 (year 2008 values). At a dose of 150 mg daily, DBG was less cost effective than fondaparinux in THR. The cost per QALY gained for fondaparinux versus DBG was 6857 pound (year 2008 values). In TKR, both DBG doses were dominated by fondaparinux. There was some evidence that DBG was more cost effective than enoxaparin; however, these results were based on only one trial each in THR and TKR. Fondaparinux appeared to be more cost effective than DBG; however, this was based on indirect comparisons. NICE concluded that although there was uncertainty in the evidence base, DBG was very likely to be of equivalent clinical and cost effectiveness to enoxaparin or fondaparinux in the prevention of VTE. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) acknowledged that oral administration of DBG, without the need for monitoring, would reduce administration costs and that it may support adherence to treatment. Therefore, the AC concluded that DBG should be recommended as an option in the circumstances in which enoxaparin (or fondaparinux as an alternative) may be offered.","[Holmes, Michael; Carroll, Christopher; Papaioannou, Diana] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Holmes, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.w.holmes@shef.ac.uk,"Carroll, Chris/HHC-1512-2022",,National Institute for Health Research [07/90/01 STA],National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (project number 07/90/01 STA) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

The fact that VaR is not coherent has motivated the industry to explore alternative risk measures such as expected shortfall. The first objective of this paper is to propose statistical methods for estimating multiple-period expected shortfall under GARCH models. In addition to the expected shortfall, we investigate a new tool called median shortfall to measure risk. The second objective of this paper is to develop backtesting methods for assessing the performance of expected shortfall and median shortfall estimators from statistical and financial perspectives. By applying our expected shortfall estimators and other existing approaches to seven international markets, we demonstrate the superiority of our methods with respect to statistical and practical evaluations. Our expected shortfall estimators likely provide an unbiased reference for setting the minimum capital required for safeguarding against expected loss.","[So, Mike K.

We assume the put option prices do not admit arbitrage and deduce no-arbitrage bounds on the weighted variance swap along with super- and sub-replicating strategies that enforce them. We find that market quotes for variance swaps are surprisingly close to the model-free lower bounds we determine. We solve the problem by transforming it into an analogous question for a European option with a convex payoff. The lower bound becomes a problem in semi-infinite linear programming which we solve in detail. The upper bound is explicit. We work in a model-independent and probability-free setup. In particular, we use and extend Follmer's pathwise stochastic calculus. Appropriate notions of arbitrage and admissibility are introduced. This allows us to establish the usual hedging relation between the variance swap and the log contract and similar connections for weighted variance swaps. Our results take the form of a FTAP: we show that the absence of (weak) arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of a classical model which reproduces the observed prices via risk-neutral expectations of discounted payoffs.","[Davis, Mark; Raval, Vimal] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Obloj, Jan] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford OX1 3LB, England",Imperial College London; University of Oxford,"Oblój, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford OX1 3LB, England.",obloj@maths.ox.ac.uk,"Obloj, Jan K/A-4750-2013","Obloj, Jan K/0000-0002-5686-5498",Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance; EPSRC under a Doctoral Training Award,Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance; EPSRC under a Doctoral Training Award(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),Jan Obloj gratefully acknowledges support from the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance.

Broadly adopting the methodology of an earlier systematic review of health-related DCEs, which covered the period 2001-2008, we report whether earlier trends continued during 2009-2012. This paper systematically reviews health-related DCEs published between 2009 and 2012, using the same database as the earlier published review (PubMed) to obtain citations, and the same range of search terms. A total of 179 health-related DCEs for 2009-2012 met the inclusion criteria for the review. We found a continuing trend towards conducting DCEs across a broader range of countries. However, the trend towards including fewer attributes was reversed, whilst the trend towards interview-based DCEs reversed because of increased computer administration. The trend towards using more flexible econometric models, including mixed logit and latent class, has also continued. Reporting of monetary values has fallen compared with earlier periods, but the proportion of studies estimating trade-offs between health outcomes and experience factors, or valuing outcomes in terms of utility scores, has increased, although use of odds ratios and probabilities has declined. The reassuring trend towards the use of more flexible and appropriate DCE designs and econometric methods has been reinforced by the increased use of qualitative methods to inform DCE processes and results. However, qualitative research methods are being used less often to inform attribute selection, which may make DCEs more susceptible to omitted variable bias if the decision framework is not known prior to the research project. The use of DCEs in healthcare continues to grow dramatically, as does the scope of applications across an expanding range of countries. There is increasing evidence that more sophisticated approaches to DCE design and analytical techniques are improving the quality of final outputs. That said, recent evidence that the use of qualitative methods to inform attribute selection has declined is of concern.","[Clark, Michael D.] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Determann, Domino; de Bekker-Grob, Esther W.] Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, Dept Publ Hlth, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Determann, Domino] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Ctr Prevent & Hlth Serv Res, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Petrou, Stavros] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Moro, Domenico] Birmingham City Univ, Birmingham City Business Sch, Dept Business & Mkt, Birmingham B42 2SU, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; University of Warwick; Birmingham City University,"Clark, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",dce_consulting@hotmail.co.uk,"Morton, Rachael L/AAB-7420-2020; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021","Morton, Rachael L/0000-0001-7834-0572; Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050",,,,,229,502,535,18,182,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2014,32.0,9,,,,,883,902,,10.1007/s40273-014-0170-x,0.0,,,20,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0LB,25005924.0,Green Submitted,Y,N,2024-03-09,WOS:000344626500007,0

Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin, such as enoxaparin, is standard of care in these patients. Recently, three direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban), have been approved for this indication, but their cost effectiveness is still unclear as it has usually been extrapolated from surrogate venographic outcomes in clinical trials. To conduct a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the DOACs versus subcutaneous (SC) enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE after THR or TKR surgery. A decision-tree model was developed using TreeAge Pro 2011 to compare the cost utility and cost effectiveness of the DOACs with SC enoxaparin, with separate models for THR and TKR over a 3-month postoperative time horizon from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. The probabilities of events (symptomatic VTE, clinically relevant bleedings, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and deaths) were derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis. We used local cost estimates (a,not sign2013) and utility values were obtained from the literature. We reported costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and symptomatic VTE events. We conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate parameter uncertainty. The average costs per 1,000 patients treated with enoxaparin were higher than costs incurred by dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban in THR (a,not sign435,208 vs. a,not sign283,574, a,not sign257,900 and a,not sign212,472, respectively) and TKR (a,not sign336,550 vs. a,not sign219,856, a,not sign251,734 and a,not sign201,946, respectively), with cost savings ranging from a,not sign151,634 to a,not sign222,766 in THR, and from a,not sign84,816 to a,not sign134,604 in TKR. Cost differences were largely driven by differences in costs associated with drug administration. The average QALYs per 1,000 patients treated were very similar for enoxaparin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban in THR (199.34, 198.83, 199.08 and 199.68, respectively) and TKR (198.95, 199.41, 198.75 and 199.97, respectively). Rivaroxaban (in TKR and THR) and apixaban (in THR) avoided additional symptomatic VTE events compared with enoxaparin. Sensitivity analyses generally supported the robustness of the analysis to changes in model parameters. Our model suggests, based on its underlying assumptions and data, that the DOACs are cost-saving alternatives to SC enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE after THR or TKR, in the Spanish healthcare setting.","[Gomez-Outes, Antonio] Spanish Agcy Med & Med Devices AEMPS, Dept Med Human Use, Div Pharmacol & Clin Evaluat, Madrid 28022, Spain; [Avendano-Sola, Cristina] Hosp Puerta de Hierro, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Madrid, Spain; [Isabel Terleira-Fernandez, Ana; Vargas-Castrillon, Emilio] Hosp Clin San Carlos, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Madrid, Spain; [Isabel Terleira-Fernandez, Ana; Vargas-Castrillon, Emilio] Univ Complutense, Dept Pharmacol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Hospital Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda; Hospital Clinico San Carlos; Complutense University of Madrid,"Gómez-Outes, A (通讯作者)，Spanish Agcy Med & Med Devices AEMPS, Dept Med Human Use, Div Pharmacol & Clin Evaluat, Parque Empresarial Las Mercedes,Edificio 8, Madrid 28022, Spain.",agomezo@aemps.es,"Avendaño, Carlos/R-5413-2019; Vargas-Castrillón, Emilio/AAZ-7621-2021","Vargas-Castrillón, Emilio/0000-0003-4828-6004; Gomez-Outes, Antonio/0000-0002-8393-9691; Avendano Sola, Cristina/0000-0001-5437-7215",Bayer; Pfizer,Bayer(Bayer AG); Pfizer(Pfizer),"Drs.

With funders such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee explicitly considering cost-effectiveness analyses within the process of producing guidance, it is imperative that economic models are as robust as possible. This article details issues that need to be considered specifically related to health technology assessments of interventions for osteoporosis, and highlights limitations within the current evidence base. A likely direction of impact on cost effectiveness of addressing the key issues has been included alongside a tentative categorization of the level of these impacts. It is likely that cost-effectiveness ratios presented in previous models that did not address the identified issues were favourable to interventions.","[Stevenson, Matt D.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Selby, Peter L.] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Greater Manches, England",University of Sheffield; University of Manchester,"Stevenson, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.d.stevenson@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Selby, Peter/0000-0001-9465-9268; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research; Amgen,National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Amgen(Amgen),"Professor Stevenson has received grants from the National Institute for Health Research to undertake health technology assessments within the disease area of osteoporosis.

We set up a simple multisector model of heterogeneous firms selling to multiple markets to motivate a theoretically founded decomposition of firms' annual sales growth rate into different components. We find that the firm-specific component contributes substantially to aggregate sales volatility, mattering about as much as the components capturing shocks that are common across firms within a sector or country. We then decompose the firm-specific component to provide evidence on two mechanisms that generate aggregate fluctuations from microeconomic shocks highlighted in the recent literature: (i) when the firm size distribution is fat-tailed, idiosyncratic shocks to large firms directly contribute to aggregate fluctuations, and (ii) aggregate fluctuations can arise from idiosyncratic shocks due to input-output linkages across the economy. Firm linkages are approximately three times as important as the direct effect of firm shocks in driving aggregate fluctuations.","[di Giovanni, Julian] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [di Giovanni, Julian] CREI, Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [di Giovanni, Julian; Levchenko, Andrei A.; Mejean, Isabelle] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Levchenko, Andrei A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Levchenko, Andrei A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mejean, Isabelle] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"di Giovanni, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",julian.digiovanni@upf.edu; alev@umich.edu; isabelle.mejean@polytechnique.edu,"Di Giovanni, Julian/D-1154-2014","Di Giovanni, Julian/0000-0002-6864-6401; Levchenko, Andrei A/0000-0001-9087-7911",Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship [622959]; French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program [ANR-11-IDEX-0003-02/Labex ECODEC ANR-11-LABEX-0047],Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship(European Union (EU)); French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We would like to thank a co-editor, two anonymous referees, George Akerlof, Gilles Duranton, Jonathan Eaton, Chris House, Ayhan Kose, Kory Kroft, Julien Martin, Akito Matsumoto, Ryan Monarch, Peter Morrow, Sophie Osotimehin, Tiago Ribeiro, Matthew Shapiro, Rishi Sharma, and seminar participants at various institutions for helpful suggestions.

Bargaining with dealers determines a bond's endogenous liquidity, which depends on both the firm fundamental and the time-to-maturity of the bond. Corporate default decisions interact with the endogenous secondary market liquidity via the rollover channel. A default-liquidity loop arises: Assuming a relative illiquid secondary bond market in default, earlier endogenous default worsens a bond's secondary market liquidity, which amplifies equity holders' rollover losses, which in turn leads to earlier endogenous default. Besides characterizing in closed form the full interdependence between liquidity and default for credit spreads, our calibrated model can jointly match empirically observed credit spreads and liquidity measures of bonds across different rating classes.","[He, Zhiguo] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [He, Zhiguo; Milbradt, Konstantin] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Milbradt, Konstantin] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University,"He, ZG (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",zhiguo.he@chicagobooth.edu; milbradt@northwestern.edu,,,Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business,Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business,"For helpful comments, we thank Kerry Back (Rice), Nittai Bergman (MIT), Bruce Carlin (UCLA), Hui Chen (MIT), Peter Feldhutter (LBS), Richard Green (CMU), Nicolae Garleanu (UC Berkeley), Barney Hartman-Glaser (Duke), Burton Hollifield (CMU), Gustavo Manso (UC Berkeley), Holger Mueller (NYU), the editor, three anonymous referees, and seminar participants of the MIT Sloan lunchtime workshop, NYU lunchtime workshop, Columbia GSB lunchtime workshop, Chicago Booth Finance lunch, NBER Microstructure meeting, ASU winter conference, Duke-UNC asset pricing conference, Texas Finance Festival, UNC, Boston University, University of Colorado at Boulder, INSEAD, Imperial College London, UCLA Anderson, WFA 2012, SED 2012, NBER SI Asset Pricing meeting, Gerzensee ESSFM 2012, Northwestern Kellogg, Copenhagen Business School, Tilburg University, Erasmus University, University of Amsterdam, Utah Winter Finance Conference 2013, and London Business School.

Rather than work with the usual equations that characterize the price exclusively, we derive and use boundary evolution equations that characterize the evolution of the optimal exercise boundary. Using these boundary evolution equations we show how one can construct very efficient computational methods for pricing American options that avoid common sources of error. First, we detail a methodology for standard static grids and then describe an improvement that defines a grid that evolves dynamically while solving the problem. When integral representations are available, as in the Black-Scholes setting, we also describe a modified integral method that leverages on the representation to solve the boundary evolution equations. Finally we compare runtime and accuracy to other popular numerical methods. The ideas and methodology presented herein can easily be extended to other optimal stopping problems.","[Mitchell, Daniel; Muthuraman, Kumar] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Goodman, Jonathan] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; New York University,"Mitchell, D (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",daniel.mitchell@phd.mccombs.utexas.edu,"Mitchell, Dann M/U-6509-2018; Muthuraman, Kumar/AAQ-8499-2020",,,,,,46,4,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

These messages allow for more equilibrium outcomes than without any messages (pure-strategy equilibrium) or with statistically independent ones (mixed-strategy equilibrium). In an incomplete information game, the messages may also reflect the types of the players, either because they are affected by extraneous factors that also affect the types (correlated equilibrium) or because the players themselves report their types to the mechanism (communication equilibrium). Mechanisms may be further differentiated by the connections between the messages that the players receive and their own and the other players' types, by whether the messages are statistically dependent or independent, and by whether they are random or deterministic. Consequently, whereas for complete information games there are only three classes of equilibrium outcomes, with incomplete information the corresponding number is 14 or 15 for correlated equilibria and even larger-15, 16 or 17-for communication equilibria. For both solution concepts, the implication relations between the different kinds of equilibria form a two-dimensional lattice, which is considerably more intricate than the single-dimensional one of the complete information case.","Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Milchtaich, I (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.",igal.milchtaich@biu.ac.il,,"Milchtaich, Igal/0000-0002-7228-3295",,,,,19,3,4,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Depending on the application at hand, further decomposition of extrinsic or intrinsic variance (or both) may be useful. The paper shows how to produce simulation-consistent estimates of all of these components, and the method demands little additional effort or computing time beyond that already invested in the posterior simulator.

Lucas (1976) questioned this assumption in the structural models and their ability to forecast the effect of policy. Lucas claimed that any shock will likely affect also the correlation amongst all variables in the multivariate model, as well as the parameters dimension and even their sign. This critique is valid for the reduced model form for which time-varying parameter models, whose parameters change over time, have been developed. For example Sessions and Chatterjee (1989), Le Sage and Magura (1992) and Stock and Watson (2004) used dynamic weights in mixing forecasting models. In particular, Carter and Kohn (1994) modelled the parameters of a time-varying VAR (tv-VAR) as random walks and Primiceri (2005) applied it to inflation forecasting. An estimator that uses only local information such as nonparametric local polynomial estimators is feasible to consistently estimate locally stationary processes (defined as in Dahlhaus (1997)). We extend the estimator in Cai (2007) to the multivariate framework of the tv-VAR and compare it with the Bayesian approach for different type of processes. In addition, we proposed the exponential moving average estimator of the covariance matrix. Using Primiceri's application as a benchmark, we compare the impulse response function estimates of these three models.","[Casas, Isabel] Univ Southern Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark; [Grassi, Stefano] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Casas, Isabel; Grassi, Stefano] CREATES, London, England",University of Southern Denmark; University of Kent; CREATES,"Casas, I (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.",,"Casas, Isabel/ABD-4411-2021",,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,866,867,,,,,,2,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600098,0

The model is calibrated using realistic assumptions. The sensitivity of results is assessed. The results show that value-maximizing life insurers should target higher solvency levels than the Solvency II regulatory one-year 99.5% probability under assumptions of reasonable levels of policyholder's aversion to insolvency risk.

A Monte Carlo simulation is conducted which shows that the test has good size and power. Further, we examine the multi-scale jump dynamics in US equity markets. The main findings are as follows. First, the jump dynamics of equities are sensitive to data sampling frequency with significant underestimation of jump intensities at lower frequencies. Second, although arrival densities of positive jumps and negative jumps are symmetric across different time scales, the magnitude of jumps is distributed asymmetrically at high frequencies. Third, only 20% of jumps occur in the trading session from 9: 30 AM to 4: 00 PM, suggesting that illiquidity during after-hours trading is a strong determinant of jumps.","[Xue, Yi] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Dept Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gencay, Ramazan; Fagan, Stephen] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Gencay, Ramazan] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy",University of International Business & Economics; Simon Fraser University,"Gençay, R (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",rgencay@sfu.ca,"Gencay, Ramazan/A-1905-2008","Xue, Yi/0000-0001-9418-6704",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71101031]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Program for Innovative Research Team in UIBE,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Program for Innovative Research Team in UIBE,"Yi Xue gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), project No. 71101031.

The estimators are simple trimmed versions of the popular log-periodogram regression estimator that employ certain sample-size-dependent and, in some cases, data-dependent trimmings that discard low-frequency components. We also show that a previously developed trimmed local Whittle estimator is robust to the same forms of data contamination. Regardless of whether the underlying long-or short-memory process is contaminated by level shifts or deterministic trends, the estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal with the same limiting variance as their standard untrimmed counterparts. Simulations show that the trimmed estimators perform their intended purpose quite well, substantially decreasing both finite-sample bias and root mean-squared error in the presence of these contaminating components. Furthermore, we assess the trade-offs involved with their use when such components are not present but the underlying process exhibits strong short-memory dynamics or is contaminated by noise. To balance the potential finite-sample biases involved in estimating the memory parameter, we recommend a particular adaptive version of the trimmed log-periodogram estimator that performs well in a wide variety of circumstances. We apply the estimators to stock market volatility data to find that various time series typically thought to be long-memory processes actually appear to be short-or very weak long-memory processes contaminated by level shifts or deterministic trends.","[McCloskey, Adam] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Perron, Pierre] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Brown University; Boston University,"McCloskey, A (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B,64 Waterman St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",adam_mccloskey@brown.edu,,,,,,,40,29,31,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The trees are then combined using swap evaluation techniques to derive a closed-form solution for the CDS spread including counterparty risk. This is our first contribution. Our second contribution is testing the impact of five different reference asset-counterparty dependence concepts on the CDS price. We find that different dependence approaches lead to significanly different CDS spreads. The basic version of the model can be calibrated to market CDS spreads.

The capital structure of a CFO is similar to traditional Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), meaning that investors are offered different rated notes and equity interests. CFOs are structured as arbitrage market value CDOs. The fund of funds manager actively manages the fund to maximize total returns while limiting price volatility within the guidelines of the structure. The aim of this paper is to provide a useful framework to evaluate Collateralized Funds of Hedge Fund Obligations, that is pricing the equity and the debt tranches of a CFO. The basic idea is to evaluate each CFO liability as an option written on the underlying pool of hedge funds. The value of every tranche depends on the evolution of the collateral portfolio during the life of the contract. Care is taken to distinguish between the fund of hedge funds and its underlying hedge funds, each of which is itself a portfolio of various securities, debt instruments and financial contracts. The proposed model incorporates skewness, excess kurtosis and is able to capture more complex dependence structures among hedge fund log-returns than the mere correlation matrix. With this model it is possible to describe the impact of an equivalent change of probability measure not only on the marginal processes but also on the underlying dependence structure among hedge funds.","[Tassinari, Gian Luca; Corradi, Corrado] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Matemat, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Tassinari, GL (通讯作者)，Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Matemat, Piazza Porta San Donato 5, Bologna, Italy.",gianluca.tassinari2@unibo.it,,,,,,,19,3,3,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The market modes are divided into a finite number of regimes. All the key parameters change according to the value of different market modes. The insurer chooses to purchase proportional reinsurance to reduce the underlying risk. In addition to reinsurance, we suppose that the insurer is allowed to invest its surplus in a financial market consisting of a risk-free asset (bond or bank account) and a risky asset whose price process is modeled by a geometric Brownian motion. We investigate the feasibility of the problem, obtain an analytic expression for the optimal strategy, delineate the efficient frontier and demonstrate our results with numerical examples.

We show that minimizing shortfall generally improves performance over minimizing variance, especially during down-markets, over the period 1985-2010. The outperformance of shortfall is due to intuitive tilts towards protective factors like Value, and away from aggressive factors like Growth and Momentum.

Several analytic solutions to this problem have been suggested, including the calculation of adjusted critical values for these nonstandard distributions and the transformation of the empirical process such that statistics based on the transformed process are asymptotically distribution-free. The approximation methods proposed by Durbin (1985, Journal of Applied Probability 22(1), 99-122) can be applied to conduct inference for tests based on supremum-norm statistics. The resulting tests have quite accurate size, a fact that has gone unrecognized in the econometrics literature. Some justification for this accuracy lies in the similar features that Durbin's approximation methods share with the theory of extrema for Gaussian random fields and for Gauss-Markov processes. These adjustment techniques are also related to the transformation methodology proposed by Khmaladze (1981, Theory of Probability and Its Applications 26(2), 240-257) through the score function of the parametric model. Simulation experiments suggest that in small samples, Durbin-style adjustments result in tests that have higher power than tests based on transformed processes, and in some cases they have higher power than parametric bootstrap procedures.","[Parker, Thomas] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Parker, T (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Hagey Hall Humanities, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",tmparker@uwaterloo.ca,"Parker, Thomas M/J-4891-2017",,,,,,46,3,4,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Hence they face a complex optimization problem in which their return, based on the bid-ask spread they quote and the frequency at which they indeed provide liquidity, is challenged by the price risk they bear due to their inventory. In this paper, we consider a stochastic control problem similar to the one introduced by Ho and Stoll (J Fin Econ 9(1):47-73, 1981) and formalized mathematically by Avellaneda and Stoikov (Quant Fin 8(3):217-224, 2008). The market is modeled using a reference price St following a Brownian motion with standard deviation s, arrival rates of buy or sell liquidity-consuming orders depend on the distance to the reference price St and a market maker maximizes the expected utility of its P&L over a finite time horizon. We show that the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to the stochastic optimal control problem can be transformed into a system of linear ordinary differential equations and we solve the market making problem under inventory constraints.

We use the model to address a number of important questions in labor economics, including the source of the experience profile of wages, the response of job changes to outside wage offers, and the effects of seniority on job changes. We also study the dynamic response of wage rates, hours, and earnings to various shocks, and measure the relative contributions of the shocks to the variance of earnings in a given year and over a lifetime. We find that human capital accounts for most of the growth of earnings over a career, although job seniority and job mobility also play significant roles. Unemployment shocks have a large impact on earnings in the short run, as well as a substantial long-term effect that operates through the wage rate. Shocks associated with job changes and unemployment make a large contribution to the variance of career earnings and operate mostly through the job-specific error components of wages and hours.","[Altonji, Joseph G.; Smith, Anthony A., Jr.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Altonji, Joseph G.; Smith, Anthony A., Jr.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Vidangos, Ivan] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Altonji, JG (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, POB 208264, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",joseph.altonji@yale.edu; tony.smith@yale.edu; ivan.vidangos@frb.gov,,"Vidangos, Ivan/0000-0002-5667-2661","Cowles Foundation; Economic Growth Center, Yale University; NSF [SES-0112533]","Cowles Foundation; Economic Growth Center, Yale University; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We are grateful to Richard Blundell, Mary Daly, Rasmus Lentz, Costas Meghir, Paul Oyer, Luigi Pistaferri, and three anonymous referees for helpful discussions and suggestions, and to Lena Yemelyanov for excellent research assistance.

The price is determined with the real-world pricing formula and under the assumption that the employment-unemployment progress of an insured person follows an F-doubly stochastic Markov chain. The stochastic intensity processes are estimated for the German labor market, using Cox's proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates on a sample of integrated labor market biographies. The estimation procedure is based on a counting process framework with stochastic compensators, which we show to be naturally connected to the class of F-doubly stochastic Markov chains.

We investigate the probability distributions of the execution time, the number of trades, and the total trading volume of trade packages, and analyse the possible scaling relations between them. Quantitative differences are observed between institutional and individual investors. The trading profile of trade packages is investigated to reveal the preference for large trades with respect to trading volume and transaction time of the day, and the different profiles of the two types of investors imply that institutions may be more informed than individuals. We further analyse the price impact of both the entire trade packages and the individual transactions within trade packages. We find that the price impact of trade packages is non-negligible over the period of the execution time and it may have a power-law relation with the total trading volume. The price impact of the transactions within trade packages displays a U-shaped profile with respect to the time of the day, and also shows a power-law dependence on the trading volume. The trading volumes of the transactions within trade packages made by institutions have a stronger impact on current returns, but the following price reversals persist over a relatively shorter horizon in comparison with those of individuals.","[Zhou, Wei-Xing] E China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Sch Sci, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; E China Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Econophys, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China",East China University of Science & Technology; East China University of Science & Technology,"Zhou, WX (通讯作者)，E China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Sch Sci, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",wxzhou@ecust.edu.cn,"Zhou, Wei-Xing/B-1250-2008; 王, 鹏程/JOZ-2597-2023","Zhou, Wei-Xing/0000-0002-8952-8228;","National Natural Science Foundation [10905023, 11075054, 71131007]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [Z6090130, Y6110687]; Humanities and Social Sciences Fund; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [09YJCZH042]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Humanities and Social Sciences Fund; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","We are grateful to Zhi-Qiang Jiang for preprocessing the data analysed in this work.

Linear filters based on different building assumptions are transformed into kernel functions via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. For each estimator, we identify a density function or second order kernel, from which a hierarchy of higher order estimators is derived. These are shown to give excellent representations for the currently applied symmetric filters. In particular, we derive equivalent kernels of smoothing splines in Sobolev and polynomial spaces. The asymmetric weights are obtained by adapting the kernel functions to the length of the various filters, and a theoretical and empirical comparison is made with the classical estimators used in real time analysis. The former are shown to be superior in terms of signal passing, noise suppression and speed of convergence to the symmetric filter.","[Dagum, Estela Bee; Bianconcini, Silvia] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Dagum, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",estellebee@dagum.us,,"BIANCONCINI, SILVIA/0000-0003-4810-5197",,,,,36,6,6,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Numerous reports in the literature conclude that IMD outbreaks are associated with substantial costs to society and significant burden on communities due to the cost associated with the prevention of secondary cases. Objective To systematically review the literature on the costs and public health burden associated with IMD outbreaks. Methods Studies were primarily identified through searching MEDLINE and EMBASE. Reports were included if they provided cost data related to the containment of an IMD outbreak after 1990 and were written in English, French, or Spanish. Costs were converted to 2010 United States dollars. Outbreaks were categorized by low-income countries (LIC) and high-income countries (HIC) based on gross domestic product per capita. Outbreak containment strategies were classified as small (e.g., targeting members of the school/institution where the outbreak occurred) or large (e.g., targeting everyone in the community). Results Sixteen articles reporting data on 93 IMD outbreaks fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included. The majority of outbreaks occurred in HIC. Five studies reported the use of small containment strategies including targeted vaccination and chemoprophylaxis, all occurring in HIC. The average cost per small containment strategy was $299,641 and the average cost per IMD case was $41,857. Eight studies reported large containment strategies involving widespread vaccination targeting a specific age group or community. For HIC, the average cost per large containment strategy was $579,851 and the average cost per IMD case was $55,755. In LIC, the average cost per large containment strategy was $3,407,590 and the average cost per IMD case was $2,222. Conclusion IMD outbreaks were associated with substantial costs. We found that although there were numerous reports on IMD outbreaks, data on containment costs were very limited. More research in this area is warranted.","[Anonychuk, Andrea; Vyse, Andrew; Demarteau, Nadia] GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines, Wavre, Belgium; [Anonychuk, Andrea] Abbott Labs, Div Diagnost, Abbott Pk, IL 60064 USA; [Anonychuk, Andrea] Abbott Labs, Div Diagnost, Mississauga, ON L5N 3R3, Canada; [Woo, Gloria] Univ Toronto, Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment Collaborat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tricco, Andrea C.] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada",GlaxoSmithKline; Abbott Laboratories; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute; Saint Michaels Hospital Toronto,"Anonychuk, A (通讯作者)，Abbott Labs, Div Diagnost, 7115 Millcreek Dr, Mississauga, ON L5N 3R3, Canada.",andrea.anonychuk@gmail.com,"Tricco, Andrea C/B-9920-2011","Tricco, Andrea C/0000-0002-4114-8971",GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA; Canadian Institutes for Health Research/Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network New Investigator Award in Knowledge Synthesis; GlaxoSmithKline group of companies,GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA(GlaxoSmithKline); Canadian Institutes for Health Research/Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network New Investigator Award in Knowledge Synthesis(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); GlaxoSmithKline group of companies(GlaxoSmithKline),"GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA funded this review and was involved in all stages of research conduct, including the development and publication of this manuscript.

Defining a person's treatment response to be a function of the entire vector of treatments received by the population, I study identification when non-parametric shape restrictions and distributional assumptions are placed on response functions. An early key result is that the traditional assumption of individualistic treatment response is a polar case within the broad class of constant treatment response (CTR) assumptions, the other pole being unrestricted interactions. Important non-polar cases are interactions within reference groups and anonymous interactions. I first study identification under Assumption CTR alone. I then strengthen this Assumption to semi-monotone response. I next discuss derivation of these assumptions from models of endogenous interactions. Finally, I combine Assumption CTR with statistical independence of potential outcomes from realized effective treatments. The findings both extend and delimit the classical analysis of randomized experiments.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",cfmanski@northwestern.edu,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,National Science Foundation [SES-0911181],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was supported in part by National Science Foundation grant SES-0911181.

Whereas chickenpox infections are normally mild but common among children, HZ infections are common among elderly people and can give rise to post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), a severe and painful complication. Objectives This review aimed to summarize the literature available on the cost effectiveness of HZ vaccination and to summarize key issues for decision makers to consider when deciding on the reimbursement of HZ vaccination. Methods We conducted a literature search of the databases PubMed and EMBASE using End Note X4 from Thomson Reuters. The following combinations of keywords were used: 'herpes zoster vaccine' AND 'cost(-)effectiveness' or AND 'economic evaluation', 'herpes zoster vaccination' AND 'cost(-)effectiveness' or AND 'economic evaluation', 'varicella zoster vaccine' AND 'cost(-)effectiveness' or AND 'economic evaluation', and 'varicella zoster vaccination' AND 'cost(-)effectiveness' or AND 'economic evaluation'. Results A total of 11 studies were identified and included. Cost-effectiveness analyses of varicella zoster vaccination were excluded. The quality of the included studies ranged from 'moderate' to 'moderate to good' according to the British Medical Journal guidelines of Drummond and Jefferson and the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) score of Ofman et al. Most studies evaluated the cost effectiveness of universal HZ vaccination in adults aged 50 years or 60 years and older. Data sources and model assumptions regarding epidemiology, utility estimates and costs varied between studies. All studies calculated costs per QALY, which allows comparing costs of interventions in different diseases. The costs per QALY gained and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) differed between studies depending on the age at vaccination, duration of vaccine efficacy, cost of vaccine course and economic perspective. All but one of the studies concluded that most vaccination scenarios are cost effective and the vaccination of specific subgroups such as the older age group is most cost effective. Conclusions Model input parameters such as age at vaccination, vaccine costs, HZ incidence, PHN length and duration of vaccine efficacy had a great impact on the estimated cost effectiveness of HZ vaccination. To compare the results of different cost-effectiveness studies of HZ vaccination, uniform methods should be used and the most important input parameters used for the different models should be critically assessed.","[Szucs, Thomas D.; Pfeil, Alena M.] Univ Basel, ECPM, Inst Pharmaceut Med, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Szucs, TD (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, ECPM, Inst Pharmaceut Med, Klingelbergstr 61, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",thomas.szucs@unibas.ch,,"Szucs, Thomas/0000-0003-0195-3316",Sanofi Pasteur MSD,Sanofi Pasteur MSD,The authors thank Xavier Bresse and Florence Baron-Papillon for the critical review of the manuscript and for providing constructive comments.

Aside from the traditional expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, a nonlinear least squares method is suggested and a generalized method of moments estimation is developed for the model. A two-stage least squares estimation with imputation is proposed as well. We analytically compare these estimation methods and find that generalized nonlinear least squares, best generalized two-stage least squares with imputation and best method of moments estimators have identical asymptotic variances. These methods are less efficient than maximum likelihood estimation implemented with the EM algorithm. When unknown heteroscedasticity exists, however, EM estimation produces inconsistent estimates. Under this situation, these methods outperform EM. We provide finite sample evidence through Monte Carlo experiments.","[Wang, Wei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Lee, Lung-Fei] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43202 USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Wang, W (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China.",wangwei79@sjtu.edu.cn; lee.1777@osu.edu,,,,,,,24,35,38,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Intermediaries optimally trade off the costs of intermediation against fees that depend on the gain they can offer to investors for moving their capital to the market with the higher mean return.

We give conditions on the parameters such that the process X-t is fractional of order d and cofractional of order d-b; that is, there exist vectors beta for which beta'X-t is fractional of order d-b and no other fractionality order is possible. For b=1, the model nests the I(d-1) vector autoregressive model. We define the statistical model by 0 <= bd, but conduct inference when the true values satisfy 0 <= d(0)- b(0) <= 1/2 and b(0) not equal 1/2, for which beta(0)'X-t is (asymptotically) a stationary process. Our main technical contribution is the proof of consistency of the maximum likelihood estimators. To this end, we prove weak convergence of the conditional likelihood as a continuous stochastic process in the parameters when errors are independent and identically distributed with suitable moment conditions and initial values are bounded. Because the limit is deterministic, this implies uniform convergence in probability of the conditional likelihood function. If the true value b0 > 1/2, we prove that the limit distribution of is mixed Gaussian, while for the remaining parameters it is Gaussian. The limit distribution of the likelihood ratio test for cointegration rank is a functional of fractional Brownian motion of type II. If b(0) < 1/2, all limit distributions are Gaussian or chi-squared. We derive similar results for the model with d = b, allowing for a constant term.","[Johansen, Soren] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Johansen, Soren; Nielsen, Morten Orregaard] CREATES, Warwick, England; [Nielsen, Morten Orregaard] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Copenhagen; CREATES; Queens University - Canada,"Johansen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",Soren.Johansen@econ.ku.dk; mon@econ.queensu.ca,,"Nielsen, Morten Orregaard/0000-0002-1337-9844; Johansen, Soren/0000-0002-9285-8236",Danish Social Sciences Research Council [275-05-0220]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [410-2009-0183]; Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (CREATES); Danish National Research Foundation,Danish Social Sciences Research Council; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (CREATES); Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"We are very grateful to Jim Stock and five referees for many useful and constructive comments that were above and beyond the call of duty and led to significant improvements to the paper.

J,"Doblas-Madrid, A",,,,"Doblas-Madrid, Antonio",,,A Robust Model of Bubbles With Multidimensional Uncertainty,ECONOMETRICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bubbles; coordination; noisy prices,EXPECTATIONS; KNOWLEDGE,"Observers often interpret boombust episodes in asset markets as speculative frenzies where asymmetrically informed investors buy overvalued assets hoping to sell to a greater fool before the crash. Despite its intuitive appeal, however, this notion of speculative bubbles has proven difficult to reconcile with economic theory. Existing models have been criticized on the basis that they assume irrationality, that prices are somewhat unresponsive to sales, or that they depend on fragile, knife-edge restrictions. To address these issues, I construct a rational version of Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003), where agents invest growing endowments into an asset, fueling appreciation and eventual overvaluation. Riding bubbles is optimal as long as the growth rate of the bubble and the probability of selling before the crash are high enough. This probability increases with the amount of noise in the economy, as random short-term fluctuations make it difficult for agents to infer information from prices.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Doblas-Madrid, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",doblasma@msu.edu,,,,,,,22,33,44,2,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2012,80.0,5,,,,,1845,1893,,10.3982/ECTA7887,0.0,,,49,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,011RG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309181900002,0

For simplicity, we assume that there is only one investment opportunity available for the insurer, a risky stock. Using techniques of stochastic linear-quadratic (LQ) control, the optimal mean-variance investment strategy with and without the VaR constraint is derived explicitly in closed forms, based on the solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Furthermore, a numerical example is proposed to show how the addition of the VaR constraint affects the optimal strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Estimation is carried out via the inference for the margins in conjunction with filtering/smoothing algorithms. We use block bootstrapping to estimate the covariance matrix of our estimators. Monte Carlo simulations compare the performance of regime switching and no switching models, supporting the regime-switching specification.

We show that JIV estimators are asymptotically normal and that standard errors are consistent provided that root K-n/r(n) -> 0 as n -> infinity, where K-n and r(n) denote, respectively, the number of instruments and the concentration parameter. This is in contrast to the asymptotic behavior of such classical instrumental variables estimators as limited information maximum likelihood, bias-corrected two-stage least squares, and two-stage least squares, all of which are inconsistent in the presence of heteroskedasticity, unless K-n/r(n) -> 0.

We propose a test for the signs of state-dependent interaction effects that does not require parametric specifications of players' payoffs, the distributions of their private signals, or the equilibrium selection mechanism. The test relies on the commonly invoked assumption that players' private signals are independent conditional on observed states. The procedure is valid in (but does not rely on) the presence of multiple equilibria in the data-generating process (DGP). As a by-product, we propose a formal test for multiple equilibria in the DGP. We also implement the test using data on radio programming of commercial breaks in the United States, and infer stations' incentives to synchronize their commercial breaks.

Methods: A literature search was conducted using Pub Med, MEDLINE, EconLit, PsycInfo and Google Scholar to identify published work on pharmacoeconomies studies based in India. Articles were included if they were original studies that evaluated pharmaceuticals, were based in India and were conducted between 1990 and 2010. Two reviewers independently reviewed the articles using a subjective 10-point quality scale in addition to the 100-point Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) questionnaire. Results: Twenty-nine articles published between 1998 and May 2010 were included in the review. The included articles were published in 23 different journals. Each article was written by an average of five authors. The mean subjective quality score of the 29 articles was 7.8 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.3) and the mean QHES scores for the complete pharmacoeconomic studies (n =24) was 86 (SD = 6). The majority of authors resided in India (62%) at the time of publication and had a medical background (90%). The quality score was significantly (p <= 0.05) related to the country of residence of the primary author (non-India = higher) and the study design (randomized controlled trials = higher). Conclusion: Although the overall quality scores were comparable to (e.g. Nigeria) or higher than (e.g. Zimbabwe) similar studies in other developing countries, key features such as an explicit study perspective and the use of sensitivity analyses were missing in about 40% of the articles. The need for economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals is imperative, especially in developing countries such as India as this helps decision makers allocate scarce resources in a justifiable manner.","[Desai, Pooja R.; Chandwani, Hitesh S.; Rascati, Karen L.] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Pharm, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Rascati, KL (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Coll Pharm, 2409 Univ Ave,STOP A1930, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",krascati@mail.utexas.edu,,,,,,,46,16,16,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,9,,,,,749,762,,10.2165/11590140-000000000-00000,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,002GL,22720697.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308520000001,0

This is so because more independent directors-regarded as better monitors of managerial activities-will be elected. In the model, a manager maximizes his expected utility by solving the trade-off between reputation and consumption of private benefits. The board can be of high-type (independent, only cares about reputation) or low-type (non-independent, faces a trade-off similar to the manager's). When the board can signal its type at a relatively small cost, giving shareholders direct access to proxy is better than delegating the nomination of outside directors to managers: in the first alternative, only high-type boards will be kept, whereas in the second, low-type boards will predominate.","Univ Minho, Sch Econ & Management, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Loureiro, G (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Sch Econ & Management, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",gilberto@eeg.uminho.pt,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019; Loureiro, Gilberto/A-3931-2010","Loureiro, Gilberto/0000-0002-2831-5034",,,,,30,1,1,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This study was designed to estimate US healthcare utilization and costs in those experiencing FN by location of care, tumour type and mortality. Methods: Cancer patients who received chemotherapy between 2001 and 2006 were identified from the Health Core Integrated Research Database, a longitudinal claims database with enrolment, medical, prescription and mortality information covering 12 health plans and more than 20 million US patients. Patients who experienced FN were prospectively matched using propensity score methods within each tumour type of interest (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancer) to those not experiencing FN. Health resource utilization was compared per patient per month for unique prescriptions and visits (inpatient and outpatient) over the length of follow-up. Healthcare total paid costs adjusted to 2009 US dollars per patient per month were examined by FN group (FN vs non-FN, FN died vs FN survived), by source of care (physician office visit, outpatient services, hospitalization and prescriptions) and by tumour type. The number of unique FN-related encounters (inpatient and outpatient) and the number of patients experiencing at least one FN-related encounter were examined. The costs per encounter were tabulated. FN encounters differ from FN episodes in that a single FN episode may include multiple FN encounters (i.e. a patient is seen multiple times [encounters] for treatment of a single FN event [episode]). Results: A total of 5990 patients each were successfully matched between the FN and non-FN (control) groups. Health resource utilization was generally higher in those with FN than in controls. FN patients incurred greater costs (mean +/- SD: $US9628 +/- 12 517 per patient-month) than non-FN patients ($US8478 +/- 12 978). Chemotherapy comprised the majority of costs for both FN (33.5%) and non-FN (40.6%) patients. The largest cost difference by categorical source of care was for hospitalization (p < 0.001). FN patients who died had the highest mean total costs compared with FN surviving patients ($US21 214 +/- 25 596 per patient-month vs $US8227 +/- 8850, respectively). Follow-up time for those surviving was, on average, 6.6 months longer. Hospitalization accounted for 53.1% of costs in those experiencing mortality with FN, while chemotherapy accounted for the majority of costs (37.1%) in surviving FN patients. A total of 6574 patients with at least one FN encounter experienced a total of 55 726 unique FN-related encounters, 90% of which were outpatient in nature. The majority of FN-related encounters (79%) occurred durina the first chemotherapy course. The average costs for FN encounters were highest for inpatient encounters, $US22 086 +/- 43 407, compared with $US985 +/- 1677 for outpatient encounters. Conclusions: The occurrence of FN in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy results in greater healthcare resource utilization and costs, with FN patients who die accounting for the greatest healthcare costs. Most FN patients experience at least one outpatient FN encounter, and the total cost of treatment for FN continues to be high.","[Michels, Shannon L.; Reynolds, Matthew W.] United BioSource Corp, Lexington, MA USA; [Barron, Rich L.] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Tomic, Karen Smoyer; Yu, Jingbo] HealthCore, Wilmington, DE USA; [Lyman, Gary H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Comprehens Canc Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA",United Biosource Corporation; Amgen; Duke University,"Michels, SL (通讯作者)，Competit Hlth Analyt, 325 W Main St,WFP6W, Louisville, KY 40202 USA.",smichels@humana.com,"Lyman, Gary/K-5227-2019; Yu, Jingbo/AAA-3862-2020","Lyman, Gary/0000-0002-0823-8086; Yu, Jingbo/0000-0002-7296-3493",Amgen Inc; United BioSource Corporation; Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center at Duke University from Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc(Amgen); United BioSource Corporation; Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center at Duke University from Amgen Inc.,"The work reported here was funded by and performed for Amgen Inc. by the United BioSource Corporation.

An almost sure consistent bootstrap procedure is provided for obtaining critical values. Possible applications include testing for semiparametric specifications as well as building confidence regions for certain functionals on the identified set.

The current work addresses this issue by noting that, when time is to be explicitly modelled, we need to represent phenomena occurring in continuous time. Models evaluated in continuous time may not have closed-form solutions, and in this case, two approximations can be used: simulation models in continuous time and discretized models at the aggregate level. Stylized examples were set up where both approximations could be implemented. These aimed to illustrate determinants of the use of the two approximations: cycle length and precision, the use of continuity corrections in discretized models and the discretization of rates into probabilities. The examples were also used to explore the impact of the approximations not only in terms of absolute survival but also cost effectiveness and incremental comparisons. Discretized models better approximate continuous time results if lower cycle lengths are used. Continuous time simulation models are inherently stochastic, and the precision of the results is determined by the simulation sample size. The use of continuity corrections in discretized models allows the use of greater cycle lengths, producing no significant bias from the discretization. How the process is discretized (the conversion of rates into probabilities) is key. Results show that appropriate discretization coupled with the use of a continuity correction produces results unbiased for higher cycle lengths. Alternative methods of discretization are less efficient, i.e. lower cycle lengths are needed to obtain unbiased results. The developed work showed the importance of acknowledging bias in estimating cost effectiveness. When the alternative approximations can be applied, we argue that it is preferable to implement a cohort discretized model rather than a simulation model in continuous time. In practice, however, it may not be possible to represent the decision problem by any conventionally defined discretized model, in which case other model designs need to be applied, e.g. a simulation model.","[Soares, Marta O.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Canto e Castro, Luisa] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Dept Stat & Operat Res, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal",University of York - UK; Universidade de Lisboa,"Soares, MO (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",marta.soares@york.ac.uk,"Soares, Marta/HJH-3434-2023; Castro, Luisa/JFT-1499-2023","Canto e Castro, Luisa/0000-0001-7890-8746; Soares, Marta Ferreira Oliveira/0000-0003-1579-8513",,,,,48,17,17,0,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,12,,,,,1101,1117,,10.2165/11599380-000000000-00000,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,050GO,23116289.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312041400001,0

No cost-effectiveness analyses have been undertaken in this population using the cost-per-QALY metric. Objective: This study describes health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL) outcomes in children with ASDs and compares the sensitivity of two generic preference-based instruments relative to ASD-related conditions and symptoms. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional with prospectively collected outcome data that were correlated with retrospectively assessed clinical information. Subjects were recruited from two sites of the Autism Treatment Network (ATN) in the US: a developmental centre in Little Rock, Arkansas, and an outpatient psychiatric clinic at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. Children that met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for an ASD by a multidisciplinary team evaluation were asked to participate in a clinical registry. Families of children with an ASD that agreed to be contacted about participation in future research studies as part of the ATN formed the sampling frame for the study. Families were included if the child with the ASD was between 4 and 17 years of age and the family caregiver spoke English. Eligible families were contacted by mail to see if they would be interested in participating in the study with 150 completing surveys. HR-QOL outcomes were described using the Health Utilities Index (HUI) 3 and the Quality of Well-Being Self-Administered (QWB-SA) scale obtained by proxy via the family caregiver. Results: Children were diagnosed as having autistic disorder (76%), pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified [PDD-NOS] (15%), and Asperger's disorder (9%). Average HUI3 and QWB-SA scores were 0.68 (SD 0.21, range 0.07-1) and 0.59 (SD 0.16, range 0.18-1), respectively. The HUI3 score was significantly correlated with clinical variables including adaptive behaviour (rho = 0.52; p < 0.001) and cognitive functioning (rho = 0.36; p < 0.001). The QWB-SA score had weak correlation with adaptive behaviour (rho = 0.25; p < 0.001) and cognitive functioning (rho = 0.17; p < 0.005). Change scores for the HUI3 were larger than the QWB-SA for all clinical measures. Scores for the HUI3 increased 0.21 points (95% CI 0.14, 0.29) across the first to the third quartile of the cognitive functioning measure compared with 0.05 (95% CI -0.01, 0.11) for the QWB-SA. Adjusted R-2 values also were higher for the HUI3 compared with the QWB-SA across all clinical measures. Conclusions: The HUI3 was more sensitive to clinical measures used to characterize children with autism compared with the QWB-SA score. The findings provide a benchmark to compare scores obtained by alternative methods and instruments. Researchers should consider incorporating the HUI3 in clinical trials and other longitudinal research studies to build the evidence base for describing the cost effectiveness of services provided to this important population.","[Tilford, J.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based upon the manufacturer's submission to NICE. The evidence was derived mainly from a double-blind, phase III, placebo-controlled trial of rituximab in patients with new or relapsed 'severe' AAV, which compared a rituximab treatment regimen with an oral cyclophosphamide treatment regimen. Intravenous cyclophosphamide is also commonly used but was not included in the pivotal trial. The evidence showed that rituximab is noninferior to oral cyclophosphamide in terms of induction of remission in adults with AAV and de novo disease, and is superior to oral cyclophosphamide in terms of remission in adults who have relapsed once on cyclophosphamide. The ERG concluded that the results of the manufacturer's economic evaluation could not be considered robust, because of errors and because the full range of relevant treatment sequences were not modelled. The ERG amended the manufacturer's model and demonstrated that rituximab was likely to represent a cost-effective addition to the treatment sequence if given after cyclophosphamide treatment.","[Latimer, Nicholas R.; Carroll, Christopher; Wong, Ruth; Tappenden, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Venning, Michael C.] Manchester Royal Infirm, Manchester Inst Nephrol & Transplantat, Renal Unit, Manchester M13 9WL, Lancs, England; [Luqmani, Raashid] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Oxford, England; [Luqmani, Raashid] Nuffield Orthopaed Ctr, Rheumatol Serv, Oxford OX3 7HE, England",University of Sheffield; University of Manchester; University of Oxford; Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre,"Latimer, NR (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",n.latimer@sheffield.ac.uk,"Carroll, Chris/HHC-1512-2022","Luqmani, Raashid/0000-0002-4446-5841; Latimer, Nicholas/0000-0001-5304-5585",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [12/37/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project no. 12/37/01).

(2008), and Eling (2012) identify the skew-normal and skew-student as promising models for describing actuarial loss data. In this paper, we change the focus from the liability to the asset side and ask whether these distributions are also useful for analyzing the investment returns of insurance companies. To answer this question, we fit various parametric distributions to capital market data which has been used to describe the investment set of insurance companies. Our results show that the skew-student is an especially promising distribution for modeling asset returns such as those of stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and hedge funds. Combining the results of Vernic (2006), Bolance et al. (2008), Eling (2012), and this paper, it appears that the skew-student is a promising actuarial tool since it describes both sides of the insurer's balance sheet reasonably well.

These results are extended to coalition production economies where each coalition can have a different production set. In fact, we establish the coincidence of the fuzzy core, the set of Edgeworth equilibria, and the set of competitive equilibria in a coalition production economy under some standard assumptions.

This creates a misalignment of risk and income - the fee income is low when the option value is high, and vice versa. In turn, this may create adverse incentives for policyholders, for example, encouraging surrenders when the options are far out-of-the-money. In this paper, we explore a new fee structure for variable annuities, where the fee rate supporting the cost of guarantees depends on the moneyness of those guarantees. We derive formulas for calculating the fee rates assuming fees are paid only when the guarantees are in-the-money, or are close to being in-the-money, and we illustrate with some numerical examples. We investigate the effect of this new fee structure on the surrender decision.","[Bernard, Carole; Hardy, Mary; Mackay, Anne] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Mackay, A (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",c3bernar@uwaterloo.ca; mrhardy@uwaterloo.ca; a3mackay@uwaterloo.ca,"Bernard, Carole/K-4006-2015","Bernard, Carole/0000-0002-3996-9260; Hardy, Mary/0000-0002-3199-4728",NSERC; Society of Actuaries Centers of Actuarial Excellence Research Grant; FQRNT; Society of Actuaries,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Society of Actuaries Centers of Actuarial Excellence Research Grant; FQRNT(FQRNT); Society of Actuaries,"All authors acknowledge support from NSERC and from the Society of Actuaries Centers of Actuarial Excellence Research Grant.

Moreover, the copula theory can be utilized to construct a flexible joint distribution that allows for skewness in the distribution of asset returns as well as asymmetry in the dependence structure between asset returns. Therefore, this paper proposes three classes of copula-based GARCH models to describe the time-varying dependence structure of stock-bond returns, and then examines the economic value of copula-based GARCH models in the asset allocation strategy. We compare their out-of-sample performance with other models, including the passive, the constant conditional correlation (CCC) GARCH and the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) GARCH models. From the empirical results, we find that a dynamic strategy based on the GJR-GARCH model with Student-t copula yields larger economic gains than passive and other dynamic strategies. Moreover, a less risk-averse investor will pay higher performance fees to switch from a passive strategy to a dynamic strategy based on copula-based GARCH models.","[Wu, Chih-Chiang; Lin, Zih-Ying] Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management, Discipline Finance, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan",Yuan Ze University,"Wu, CC (通讯作者)，Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management, Discipline Finance, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.",chihchiang@saturn.yzu.edu.tw,,,"National Science Council, Taiwan","National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","Chih-Chiang Wu acknowledges financial support from the National Science Council, Taiwan.",,34,18,22,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

A totally positive game has a nonempty core. In this paper we introduce constrained core solutions for totally positive games with ordered players which assign to every such a game a subset of the core. These solutions are based on the distribution of dividends taking into account the hierarchical ordering of the players. The Harsanyi constrained core of a totally positive game with ordered players is a subset of the core of the game and contains the Shapley value. For special orderings it coincides with the core or the Shapley value. The selectope constrained core is defined for acyclic orderings and yields a subset of the Harsanyi constrained core.

As a result of this representation, along with a short-time asymptotic expansion of the claim's price process, we develop an efficient novel method for pricing claims whose payoffs may depend on the full path of the underlying Markov chain. The proposed approach is applied to price not only simple European claims such as defaultable bonds, but also a new type of path-dependent claims that we term self-decomposable, as well as the important class of vulnerable call and put options on a stock. We provide a detailed error analysis and illustrate the accuracy and computational complexity of our method on several market traded instruments, such as defaultable bond prices, barrier options, and vulnerable call options. Using again our Poisson series representation, we show differentiability in time of the predefault price function of European vulnerable claims, which enables us to rigorously deduce Feynman-Ka č representations for the predefault pricing function and new semimartingale representations for the price process of the vulnerable claim under both risk-neutral and objective probability measures.","[Capponi, Agostino] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Figueroa-Lopez, Jose E.; Nisen, Jeffrey] Purdue Univ, Dept Stat, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Capponi, A (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",capponi@purdue.edu,,,US National Science Foundation [DMS-0906919]; Purdue Research Foundation,US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Purdue Research Foundation,"J.E.

Such recursions are frequently derived by exploiting relations between generating functions. For example, the top-order zonal polynomials that occur in much distribution theory under normality can be recursively related to other (easily computed) symmetric functions (power-sum and elementary symmetric functions; Ruben, 1962, Annals of Mathematical Statistics 33, 542-570; Hillier, Kan, and Wang, 2009, Econometric Theory 25, 211-242). Typically, in a recursion of this type the kth object of interest, d(k), say, is expressed in terms of all lower order d(j)'s. In Hillier et al. (2009) we pointed out that, in the case of top-order zonal polynomials and other invariant polynomials of multiple matrix argument, a fixed length recursion can be deduced. We refer to this as a short recursion. The present paper shows that the main results in Hillier et al. (2009) can be generalized and that short recursions can be obtained for a much larger class of objects/generating functions. As applications, we show that short recursions can be obtained for various problems involving quadratic forms in noncentral normal vectors, including moments, product moments, and expectations of ratios of powers of quadratic forms. For this class of problems, we also show that the length of the recursion can be further reduced by an application of a generalization of Horner's method (cf. Brown, 1986, SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing 7, 689-695), producing a super-short recursion that is significantly more efficient than even the short recursion.","[Hillier, Grant] CeMMAP, London, ON, Canada; [Hillier, Grant] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England; [Kan, Raymond] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Wang, Xiaolu] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA",University of Southampton; University of Toronto; Iowa State University,"Kan, R (通讯作者)，105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",kan@chass.utoronto.ca,"WANG, Xiaolu/C-9563-2015","Hillier, Grant/0000-0003-3261-5766",National Bank Financial of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,National Bank Financial of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We are grateful to Robert Brown, Peter Phillips, and three anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

As of December 2009, a policy change means that heart stents are covered by public health insurance, whereas previously they were not. This policy change provides us an opportunity to study how a change in insurance benefit affected the quantity and quality of hospital services. The new policy introduced incentives for both patients and providers: it encourages patient demand for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) services and stent use (moral hazard effect), and discourages hospital supply due to the financial pressures of the global cap (provider gaming effect). If the provider's gaming effect dominates the moral hazard effect, actual utilisation and costs might go down, and vice versa. Our hypothesis is that patients in the higher reimbursement groups will have fewer PCIs and lower inpatient costs. We aimed to examine the impact of health insurance benefit design on PCI and stent use, and on inpatient costs and out-of-pocket expenses for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Shanghai. We included 720 patients with AMI (467 before the benefit change and 253 after) from a large teaching tertiary hospital in Shanghai. Data were collected via review of hospital medical charts, and from the hospital billing database. Patient information collected included demographic characteristics, medical history and procedure information. All patients were categorised into four groups according to their actual reimbursement ratio: high (90-100 %), moderate (80-90 %), low (0-80 %) and none (self-paid patients). Multiple regression and difference-in-difference (DID) models were used to investigate the impacts of the health insurance benefit design on PCI and stent use, and on total hospital costs and patients' out-of-pocket expenses. After the change in insurance benefit policy, compared with the self-paid group, PCI rates for the moderate and low reimbursement groups increased by 22.2 and 20.3 %, respectively, and decreased by 48.7 % for the high reimbursement group. The change in insurance benefit policy had no impact on the number of stents used. The high reimbursement group had the lowest hospital costs, and the low reimbursement group had the highest hospital costs, regardless of benefit policy change. The general linear regression results showed that the high reimbursement group had higher total hospital costs than the self-paid group, but were the lowest among all reimbursement groups after the benefit policy change (DIDh = 1,202.21, P = 0.0096). There were no significant changes in the other two groups, and there were no differences in the out-of-pocket costs across any of the insured groups. Our results suggest that the benefit policy change did not impact life-saving procedures or reduce patients' burden of disease among AMI patients. The effect of 'provider gaming' was the strongest for the high reimbursement group as a result of the global budget cap pressure. The current FFS with a global budget cap is of low efficiency for cost containment and equity improvement. Payment method reforms with alignment of financial incentives to improve provider behaviour in practicing evidence-based medicine are needed in China.","[Yuan, Suwei; Li, Na; Zhang, Yunting; Tao, Jingjing; Ma, Jin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Ruijin Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yunting] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Shanghai Childrens Med Ctr, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, New Orleans, LA USA; [Quan, Hude] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Lu, Mingshan] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Tulane University; University of Calgary; University of Calgary,"Ma, J (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 227 South Chong Qing Rd, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.",majin_sph@sjtu.edu.cn,"Wang, Peiyun/JVE-1196-2024; zheng, yan/JKJ-3632-2023; li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023; Zhang, Tingting/U-3871-2017; liu, xinyu/IWD-6630-2023; Ma, Jin/JQW-3525-2023","Quan, Hude/0000-0002-7848-7256","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71273175, 71203141]; Shanghai Health Bureau [12GWZX0601]; Alberta Innovates-Health Solutions, Canada","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Health Bureau; Alberta Innovates-Health Solutions, Canada","This study was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), grant no. 71273175 and youth grant no. 71203141, as well as the Shanghai Health Bureau, grant no. 12GWZX0601.

CF patients are susceptible to lung infections, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Once infection is established, patients require lifetime treatment using nebulised antibiotics. Newer dry powder formulations of antibiotics may reduce treatment burden and improve compliance. Our objective was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of (i) colistimethate sodium dry powder for inhalation (DPI) and (ii) tobramycin DPI versus nebulised tobramycin for the treatment of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection in patients with CF from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS). We developed a state transition model based on transitions between three strata of lung function measured in terms of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % predicted. Additional health states representing post-lung transplantation and dead are also modelled. The model structure was informed by systematic reviews of evidence concerning the plausibility of potential relationships between intermediate endpoints and final outcomes. The model assumes that treatment impacts on FEV1 trajectory, which manifest as changes in health-related quality of life. No survival benefit is assumed due to the absence of robust quantifiable evidence. Model parameters were informed by patient-level and aggregate data from two randomised controlled trials together with the best available evidence from the literature. Resource use and costs associated with drug acquisition, the management of exacerbations and reduced nebuliser maintenance were drawn from reference sources and expert opinion. Costs were valued at 2011/2012 prices. Costs and health outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3.5 %. Simple and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken, including additional analyses of Patient Access Scheme (PAS) price discounts offered by the manufacturers of both DPI products. Colistimethate sodium DPI is expected to produce fewer quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than nebulised tobramycin. Based on its list price, colistimethate sodium DPI is expected to be dominated by nebulised tobramycin. When the PAS is incorporated, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for colistimethate sodium DPI versus nebulised tobramycin is expected to be approximately A 288,600 pound saved per QALY lost. Based on its current list price, the ICER for tobramycin DPI versus nebulised tobramycin is expected to be approximately A 124,000 pound per QALY gained. When the proposed PAS is included, tobramycin DPI is expected to dominate nebulised tobramycin.

The existence of unit roots can be useful to estimate the relevance of past mushroom prices in the formation of new mushroom prices. If no influence from past mushroom prices exists, that should imply that mushroom prices are mainly determined by the existing market, the existing environmental conditions, and that the significance of past events could be very weak or non existent. The main conclusion of the paper is that mushroom prices follow a stationary behaviour, and that occasional changes in market conditions should not induce to a new equilibrium. This statement should be relevant both for professional mushroom producers and policy makers, especially those related to public forest policies.","[Alfranca, Oscar] Tech Univ Catalunya, Dept Agribusiness Engn & Biotechnol, Castelldefels 08860, Spain; [Voces, Roberto; Diaz-Balteiro, Luis] Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Forestry Econ & Management, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Alfranca, O (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Catalunya, Dept Agribusiness Engn & Biotechnol, Bldg D4-C,Esteve Terradas 8, Castelldefels 08860, Spain.",oscar.alfranca@upc.edu,"Diaz-Balteiro, Luis/B-7169-2009","Diaz-Balteiro, Luis/0000-0002-4435-2740",,,,,24,0,0,0,1,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1461,1473,,,,,,13,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600165,0

For such games, we establish sufficient conditions for existence of a value of the game, maximin and minimax strategies for the players, and a Nash equilibrium. If all discontinuities favor one player, then a value exists and that player has a maximin strategy. A property called payoff approachability implies existence of an equilibrium, and that the resulting value is invariant: games with the same payoffs at points of continuity have the same value and -equilibria. For voting games in which two candidates propose policies and a candidate wins election if a weighted majority of voters prefer his proposed policy, we provide tie-breaking rules and assumptions about voters' preferences sufficient to imply payoff approachability. These assumptions are satisfied by generic preferences if the dimension of the space of policies exceeds the number of voters; or with no dimensional restriction, if the electorate is sufficiently large. Each Colonel Blotto game is a special case in which each candidate allocates a resource among several constituencies and a candidate gets votes from those allocated more than his opponent offers; in this case, for simple-majority rule we prove existence of an equilibrium with zero probability of ties.","[Barelli, Paulo; Govindan, Srihari] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Wilson, Robert] Stanford Business Sch, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Rochester; Stanford University,"Barelli, P (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",paulo.barelli@rochester.edu; s.govindan@rochester.edu; rwilson@stanford.edu,"Barelli, Paulo/AAH-1016-2021","Barelli, Paulo/0000-0002-6772-8368; Govindan, Srihari/0000-0002-3410-3054",,,,,32,10,10,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2014,82.0,1,,,,,271,314,,10.3982/ECTA11008,0.0,,,44,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA7KQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331276700007,0

This is because the falls in the stock price process due to discrete dividend payouts will significantly increase the mathematical difficulty in pricing the option. On the other hand, much literature uses other dividend settings to simplify the difficulty, but these settings may produce inconsistent pricing results. This paper derives accurate approximating formulae for pricing a popular path-dependent option, the barrier stock option, with discrete dividend payouts. The fall in stock price due to dividend payout at an exdividend date t is approximated by an accumulated price decrement due to a continuous dividend yield up to time t. Thus, the stock price process prior to time t and after time t can be separately modelled by two different lognormal-diffusive stock processes which help us to easily derive analytical pricing formulae. Numerical experiments suggest that our formulae provide more accurate and coherent pricing results than other approximation formulae. Our formulae are also robust under extreme cases, like the high volatility (of the stock price) case. Besides, our formulae also extend the applicability of the first-passage model (a type of structural credit risk model) to measure how the firm's payout influences its financial status and the credit qualities of other outstanding debts.","[Dai, Tian-Shyr] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Informat & Finance Management, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; [Chiu, Chun-Yuan] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Informat Management, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Dai, TS (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Informat & Finance Management, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",d88006@csie.ntu.edu.tw,,,"National Science Council [NSC 98-2410-H-009-019-, NSC 100-2410-H-009-025]","National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This work was supported by the National Science Council under grant numbers: NSC 98-2410-H-009-019-; NSC 100-2410-H-009-025.

In this framework the estimation of multifractal spectrum is one of popular methods allowing one to detect and quantify the underlying complexity present in the system. Among many different approaches, the Multifractal Diffusion Entropy Analysis, based on estimation of Renyi entropy, provides an innovative approach for evaluation of multifractal exponents. In the recent article [1], we have shown that the proper estimation of probability histograms is crucial for correct evaluation of Renyi entropy and ensuing multifractal exponents. In this paper we summarize our recent results and apply them to various real financial time series, recorded both on minute and daily basis. Our aim is to illustrate the potency of the method proposed in the field of financial time series.

The effects of scaling the spreads of forecast distributions, of introducing a mixture with the underlying unconditional distribution under both the linear opinion pool and the logarithmic opinion pool are all considered.

Methods We searched the databases DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), NHS EED (National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database), HTA (Health Technology Assessment), and PubMed for CUAs. Studies were included if they were full economic evaluations and reported quality-adjusted life-years as the health outcome. Study characteristics and instruments used to estimate utility weights were described and a logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with the choice of either the direct (e.g. standard gamble) or the preference-based measure (PBM) approach (e.g. EQ-5D). Results We identified 227 CUAs with a maximum in 2009, 2010, and 2012. Most CUAs were conducted in depression, dementia, or psychosis, and came from the US or the UK, with the EQ-5D being the most frequently used instrument. The application of the direct approach was significantly associated with depression, psychosis, and model-based studies. The PBM approach was more likely to be used in recent studies, dementia, Europe, and empirical studies. Utility weights used in model-based studies were derived from only a small number of studies. Limitations We only searched four databases and did not evaluate the quality of the included studies. Conclusions Direct instruments and PBMs are used to elicit utility weights in CUAs with different frequencies regarding study type, mental disorder, and country.","[Sonntag, Michael; Koenig, Hans-Helmut; Konnopka, Alexander] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Serv Res, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf,"Sonntag, M (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Serv Res, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",mi.sonntag@uke.de,"König, Hans-Helmut/P-1211-2018",,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01EH1101B],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (grant number 01EH1101B).,,405,16,16,1,36,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2013,31.0,12,,,,,1131,1154,,10.1007/s40273-013-0107-9,0.0,,,24,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,269CM,24293216.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328218100005,0

We model the asset drawdown process as the current relative distance from the historical maximum of the asset value. We first consider a vanilla insurance contract whereby the protection buyer pays a constant premium over time to insure against a drawdown of a pre-specified level. This leads to the analysis of the conditional Laplace transform of the drawdown time, which will serve as the building block for drawdown insurance with early cancellation or drawup contingency. For the cancellable drawdown insurance, we derive the investor's optimal cancellation timing in terms of a two-sided first passage time of the underlying drawdown process. Our model can also be applied to insure against a drawdown by a defaultable stock. We provide analytic formulas for the fair premium and illustrate the impact of default risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA289 issued in June 2013. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from two phase III, multicentre, randomised controlled trials (RCTs): Controlled myelofibrosis study with oral JAK inhibitor treatment (COMFORT)-II compared ruxolitinib with best available therapy (BAT), and COMFORT-I compared ruxolitinib with placebo. These RCTs demonstrated that ruxolitinib confers significant benefits in terms of spleen size reduction and improvement in symptom burden. In the COMFORT-II trial, a reduction in spleen volume of a parts per thousand yen35 % was achieved in 28 % of ruxolitinib-treated patients compared with 0 % of patients in the BAT group (p < 0.001) at 48 weeks, and there was a mean change in spleen volume of -30.1 versus +7.3 % (p < 0.001). Ruxolitinib also provided significant improvements in myelofibrosis-associated symptoms and health-related quality-of-life compared with BAT and placebo. The ERG concluded that ruxolitinib appears to reduce splenomegaly and its associated symptoms, but that there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the manufacturer's cost-effectiveness estimates due to limitations in the manufacturer's model. The manufacturer's model did not allow for disease progression, did not accurately capture symptomatic relief, had several implausible or unjustified assumptions, and there were several parameter choices that the ERG found sub-optimal. ERG sensitivity analyses found that nearly all plausible adjustments to the model reduced the cost effectiveness of ruxolitinib. It is very likely that the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 73,980 pound/quality-adjusted life-year presented by the manufacturer represents a best-case scenario. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that ruxolitinib was clinically effective, but could not be considered a cost effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources for treating disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adults with myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib is not recommended for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis and post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis in NICE TA289.","[Wade, Ros; Rose, Micah; Neilson, Aileen Rae; Stirk, Lisa; Rodriguez-Lopez, Rocio; Craig, Dawn; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Bowen, David] St Jamess Inst Oncol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; Saint James's University Hospital,"Wade, R (通讯作者)，Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ros.wade@york.ac.uk,"Stirk, Lisa/A-2463-2010; Wade, Ros/AAB-7268-2019","Neilson, Aileen/0000-0003-3758-0566; Rodriguez Lopez, Rocio/0000-0003-2460-8128; Wade, Rosalind Fay/0000-0002-8666-8110",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [11/79/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project number 11/79/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

Essentially different loss functions can lead to the same forecasts in all situations, though within the class of all continuous loss functions, this is strongly nongeneric. With the small set of exceptional cases ruled out, generic nonparametric preference recovery is theoretically possible, but identification depends critically on the amount of variation in the conditional distributions of the process being forecast. There exist processes with sufficient variability to guarantee identification, and much of this variation is also necessary for a process to have universal identifying power.

A moment restriction model is semiparametric and distribution-free; therefore it imposes mild assumptions. Yet it is reasonable to expect that the probability law of observations may have some deviations from the ideal distribution being modeled, due to various factors such as measurement errors. It is then sensible to seek an estimation procedure that is robust against slight perturbation in the probability measure that generates observations. This paper considers local deviations within shrinking topological neighborhoods to develop its large sample theory, so that both bias and variance matter asymptotically. The main result shows that there exists a computationally convenient estimator that achieves optimal minimax robust properties. It is semiparametrically efficient when the model assumption holds, and, at the same time, it enjoys desirable robust properties when it does not.","[Kitamura, Yuichi] Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn Res Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Otsu, Taisuke] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Evdokimov, Kirill] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Yale University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Princeton University,"Kitamura, Y (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn Res Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",yuichi.kitamura@yale.edu; t.otsu@lse.ac.uk; kevdokim@princeton.edu,"Evdokimov, Kirill/AAA-9436-2019","Evdokimov, Kirill/0000-0002-0292-3568","National Science Foundation [SES-0241770, SES-0551271, SES-0851759, SES-0720961]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0851759] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are grateful to a co-editor and two anonymous referees for helpful remarks and suggestions.

We study its scope by deriving a tractable mean-variance model adjusted for ambiguity and solving the corresponding portfolio allocation problem. In the problem with a risk-free asset, a risky asset, and an ambiguous asset, we find that portfolio rebalancing in response to higher ambiguity aversion only depends on the ambiguous asset's alpha, setting the performance of the risky asset as benchmark. In particular, a positive alpha corresponds to a long position in the ambiguous asset, a negative alpha corresponds to a short position in the ambiguous asset, and greater ambiguity aversion reduces optimal exposure to ambiguity. The analytical tractability of the enhanced ArrowPratt approximation renders our model especially well suited for calibration exercises aimed at exploring the consequences of model uncertainty on equilibrium asset prices.","[Maccheroni, Fabio; Marinacci, Massimo] Univ Bocconi, Dept Decis Sci, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Maccheroni, Fabio; Marinacci, Massimo] Univ Bocconi, IGIER, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Ruffino, Doriana] Univ Minnesota, Dept Finance, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Maccheroni, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Dept Decis Sci, Via Sarfatti 25, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",fabio.maccheroni@unibocconi.it; massimo.marinacci@unibocconi.it; druffino@umn.edu,,"MARINACCI, MASSIMO/0000-0002-0079-4176; MACCHERONI, FABIO/0000-0001-6338-6383",European Research Council; AXA-Bocconi Chair; Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota,European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); AXA-Bocconi Chair; Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System),"We thank Pauline Barrieu, David Bates, Emanuele Borgonovo, Veronica Roberta Cappelli, John Cochrane, Marco Giacoletti, Massimo Guidolin, Lars Hansen, Sujoy Mukerji, Fulvio Ortu, Andrea Resti, Alessandro Sbuelz, Claudio Tebaldi, Piero Veronese, the co-editor, four anonymous referees, and especially Giulia Brancaccio and Simone Cerreia-Vioglio for helpful comments.

Our analysis is performed under the same conditions on the innovations as in Chang and Park (2002), thereby allowing for general linear processes driven by (possibly conditionally heteroskeclastic) martingale difference innovations. We show that the limiting null distributions of the t-statistics for unit roots at the zero and Nyquist frequencies and joint F-type statistics are pivotal, whereas those of the t-statistics at the harmonic seasonal frequencies depend on nuisance parameters that derive from the lag parameters characterizing the linear process. Moreover, the rates on the lag truncation required for these results to hold are shown to coincide with the corresponding rates given in Chang and Park (2002); in particular, an o(T-1/2) rate is shown to be sufficient.","[Taylor, A.

Life insurers offering life annuities assume that annuitant lives will self-select, and price the longevity risk with an annuity mortality table that assumes above-average longevity. This leads to annuities being less attractive to a wide range of individuals, and limits the viability of private annuity markets. This paper quantifies heterogeneity and its financial implications for annuity prices using well-established frailty models and a more recently developed Markov ageing model calibrated to population mortality data.

In this article we study the class of Log phase-type (LogPH) distributions as a parametric alternative in fitting heavy tailed data. Transformed from the popular phase-type distribution class, the LogPH introduced by Ramaswami exhibits several advantages over other parametric alternatives. We analytically derive its tail related quantities including the conditional tail moments and the mean excess function, and also discuss its tail thickness in the context of extreme value theory. Because of its denseness proved herein, we argue that the LogPH can offer a rich class of heavy-tailed loss distributions without separate modeling for the tail side, which is the case for the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). As a numerical example we use the well-known Danish fire data to calibrate the LogPH model and compare the result with that of the GPD. We also present fitting results for a set of insurance guarantee loss data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In industries where fixed costs are an important determinant of market structure, this static analysis ignores the dynamic effects of the regulation on entry, investment, and market power. I evaluate the welfare costs of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act on the U.S. Portland cement industry, accounting for these effects through a dynamic model of oligopoly in the tradition of Ericson and Pakes (1995). Using the two-step estimator of Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007), I recover the entire cost structure of the industry, including the distributions of sunk entry costs and capacity adjustment costs. My primary finding is that the Amendments have significantly increased the sunk cost of entry, leading to a loss of between $810M and $3.2B in product market surplus.

Assuming homoskedasticity, Harvey, Leybourne, and Taylor (2011, Journal of Econometrics, forthcoming) propose decision rules based on a four-way union of rejections of quasi-differenced (QD) and ordinary least squares (OLS) detrended tests, both with and without a linear trend, to deal with the first two problems. In this paper we first discuss, again under homoskedasticity, how these union tests may be validly bootstrapped using the sieve bootstrap principle combined with either the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) or wild bootstrap resampling schemes. This serves to highlight the complications that arise when attempting to bootstrap the union tests. We then demonstrate that in the presence of nonstationary volatility the union test statistics have limit distributions that depend on the form of the volatility process, making tests based on the standard asymptotic critical values or, indeed, the i.i.d. bootstrap principle invalid. We show that wild bootstrap union tests are, however, asymptotically valid in the presence of nonstationary volatility. The wild bootstrap union tests therefore allow for a joint treatment of all three of the aforementioned issues in practice.","[Taylor, A. M.

More precisely, we model the disturbances with the Normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) and Variance gamma (VG) distribution. Besides modelling the residuals we also compare the prices of January 2010 out of the money call and put options for two of the Slovenian largest cities Ljubljana and Maribor under normally distributed disturbances and NIG and VG distributed disturbances. The results of our numerical analysis demonstrate that the normal model fails to capture adequately tail risk, and consequently significantly misprices out of the money options. On the other hand prices obtained using NIG and VG distributed disturbances fit well to the results obtained by bootstrapping the residuals. Thus one should take extreme care in choosing the appropriate statistical model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The numerical schemes proposed here are deterministic in nature but their proof relies on known results from probability theory regarding the weak convergence of probability measures. We adapt those results to unbounded payoffs under certain mild assumptions that are satisfied in finance. Because our approximation schemes avoid repeated simulations and provide computational savings, they can potentially be used when calculating simultaneously the price of several derivatives contingent on the same underlying. We show how to apply the new methods to calculate the price of spread options and American call options on a stock paying a known dividend. The method proves useful for calculations related to the log-Weibull model proposed recently for empirical asset pricing.","[Fabozzi, Frank J.] EDHEC Business Sch, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Leccadito, Arturo] Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Sci Aziendali, I-87030 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Tunaru, Radu S.] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",University of Calabria; City University London,"Fabozzi, FJ (通讯作者)，EDHEC Business Sch, New York, NY 10016 USA.",frank.fabozzi@edhec.edu,"Tunaru, Radu/O-1185-2015","Leccadito, Arturo/0000-0002-9101-4242; Tunaru, Radu/0000-0002-5623-9876",,,,,43,0,0,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In this paper, we extend this empirical evidence by showing that the refining margin is stationary and therefore exhibits different dynamics from crude oil or its primary refined products. Furthermore, we show that crude oil, heating oil and gasoline are not only cointegrated but also share common long-term dynamics. This finding has crucial implications in terms of managing and hedging the risk faced by refining companies because the common long-term trend finding implies that the refining margin risk only reflects short-term effects. Specifically, in this paper, a way to hedge the refining margin with crack-spread options is analyzed, and we find that assuming a common long-term trend for crude oil, heating oil and gasoline is the most accurate approach to hedging.","[Garcia Mirantes, Andres] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Toledo 45071, Spain; [Poblacion, Javier] Banco Espana, DGA Supervis, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Poblacion, Javier] Colegio Univ Estudios Financieros CUNEF, Madrid 28004, Spain; [Serna, Gregorio] Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Madrid 28802, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Banco de Espana; CUNEF Universidad; Universidad de Alcala,"Serna, G (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Plaza Victoria 2, Madrid 28802, Spain.",gregorio.serna@uah.es,"Serna, Gregorio/M-3004-2014","Serna, Gregorio/0000-0002-4106-7063",,,,,30,7,8,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We first introduce six main approaches in the linear equation system literature to handle endogenous regressors with linear projections: (i) 'substitution' replacing the endogenous regressors with their projected versions on the system exogenous regressors x, (ii) instrumental variable estimator (IVE) based on E{(error) x x} = 0, (iii) 'model-projection' turning the original model into a model in terms of only x-projected variables, (iv) 'system reduced form (RF)' finding RF parameters first and then the structural form (SF) parameters, (v) 'artificial instrumental regressor' using instruments as artificial regressors with zero coefficients, and (vi) 'control function' adding an extra term as a regressor to control for the endogeneity source. We then check if these approaches are applicable to LDV models using conditional mean/quantiles instead of linear projection. The six approaches provide a convenient forum on which semiparametric estimators in the literature can be categorized, although there are a few exceptions. The pros and cons of the approaches are discussed, and a small-scale simulation study is provided for some reviewed estimators.","[Lee, Myoung-Jae] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Lee, Myoung-Jae] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Korea University; Australian National University,"Lee, MJ (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",myoungjae@korea.ac.kr,,"Lee, Myoung-jae/0000-0002-3935-7491",,,,,57,5,7,0,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics, both at the University of York, were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions regarding the use of dronedarone within the UK NHS. The ERG review comprised a critique of the submitted evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of dronedarone. The ERG examined the search strategy used to obtain relevant evidence, the selection of studies included in the assessment, outcome measures chosen and statistical methods employed. The ERG also validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model and used it to explore the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results to key assumptions. The main clinical effectiveness evidence supporting the use of dronedarone as a treatment for AF came from four randomized controlled trials. These trials were compared with a broader set of trials examining the effectiveness of other AADs for AF: amiodarone, sotalol and class 1c agents (flecainide and propafenone). The evidence suggested that all AADs decreased the recurrence of AF but dronedarone had the smallest effect. A mixed treatment comparison analysis of the trials showed that dronedarone was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality than other AADs, but this was highly uncertain. There was limited evidence to assess the effect of dronedarone on stroke, and no statistically significant differences between dronedarone and other AADs were found for treatment discontinuation. From the evidence presented by the manufacturer, dronedarone appeared highly cost effective in each of the population groups examined compared with using standard baseline therapy alone as first-line treatment, or compared with sotalol or amiodarone as first-line AAD, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) well below (sic)20 000 per QALY gained. The ICER for dronedarone relative to class 1c agents was around 19000 per QALY. Although the evidence presented by the manufacturer indicated that dronedarone was cost effective, the estimates of treatment effect relative to other AADs and safety in the longer term were highly uncertain. The NICE Appraisal Committee in its preliminary guidance did not recommend the use of dronedarone for AF. However, following the response from a large number of consultees and commentators, NICE revised its preliminary guidance to allow the use of the drug in a specific subgroup of AF patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors.","[McKenna, Claire; Sarowar, Muhammad; Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Maund, Emma; Fox, David; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Pepper, Chris] Yorkshire Heart Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; University of Sheffield,"McKenna, C (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",claire.mckenna@york.ac.uk,,", Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research [08/214],National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 08/214) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

The frequency of the *2 allele varies by ethnicity and the Maoris, Asians and Pacific Islanders of New Zealand have a relatively high incidence. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate, from a New Zealand health system perspective, the cost effectiveness of treating all ACS patients with generic clopidogrel compared with prasugrel, and also compared with the genetically guided strategy that *2 allele carriers receive prasugrel and non-carriers receive clopidogrel. Methods: A decision-tree model consisting of five health states (myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding, stent thrombosis and cardiovascular death) was developed. Clinical outcome data (two TRITON-TIMI 38 genetic sub-studies) comparing clopidogrel and prasugrel for both *2 allele carriers and non-carriers were combined with the prevalence of the heterozygosity for the *2 allele in New Zealand Europeans (15%), Maoris (24%), Asians (29%) and Pacific Islanders (45%) to determine the predicted adverse event rate for the New Zealand population. National hospital diagnosis-related group (DRG) discharge codes were used to determine alternative adverse event rates, along with the costs of hospitalizations during the 15 months after patients presented with an ACS. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per QALY (calculated using literature-reported weights). Monte Carlo simulations and alternative scenario analysis based on both clinical trial and national hospital incidence were used. Additional analysis considered the overall TRITON-TIMI 38 rates. Costs (in New Zealand dollars [$NZ], year 2009 values) and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. Results: Actual hospital-based adverse event rates were higher than those reported in the TRITON-TIMI 38 randomized controlled trial and the genetic sub-studies, especially for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death, and for Maoris and Pacific Islanders. For both sources of adverse event rates, treating the population with prasugrel was associated with worse outcomes (QALYs) than clopidogrel. However, prasugrel became cost effective ($NZ31751/QALY) when the overall TRITON-TIMI 38 rates were used. A genetic test to guide the selected use of prasugrel was cost effective ($NZ8702/QALY versus $NZ24617/QALY) for hospital and clinical trial incidence, respectively. Based on the hospital rates, the genetically guided strategy was especially cost effective for Maoris ($NZ7312/QALY) and Pacific Islanders ($NZ7041/QALY). These results were robust to the sensitivity analysis, except the genetically guided strategy under the 15-month clinical trial event rate scenario ($NZ168748/QALY) did not remain cost effective under a $NZ50 000 threshold. Conclusions: Use of a genetic test to guide thienopyridine treatment in patients with ACS is a potentially cost-effective treatment strategy, especially for Maoris and Pacific Islanders. This treatment strategy also has the potential to reduce ethnic health disparities that exist in New Zealand. However, the results comparing clopidogrel and prasugrel are sensitive to whether the genetic sub-studies or the overall TRITON-TIMI 38 rates are used. While the national hospital event rates may be more appropriate for the New Zealand population, many assumptions are required when they are used to adjust the genetic sub-studies rates.","[Panattoni, Laura; Brown, Paul M.; Te Ao, Braden] Univ Auckland, Sch Populat Hlth, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Brown, Paul M.] Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA USA; [Webster, Mark; Gladding, Patrick] Univ Auckland, Sch Med, Auckland, New Zealand; [Webster, Mark] Auckland City Hosp, Green Lane Cardiovasc Serv, Auckland, New Zealand; [Gladding, Patrick] Cleveland Clin Fdn, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Gladding, Patrick] Theranost Lab, Cleveland, OH USA",University of Auckland; University of California System; University of California Merced; University of Auckland; Auckland City Hospital; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,"Panattoni, L (通讯作者)，Palo Alto Med Fdn, Res Inst, Dept Hlth Policy Res, 2350 W El Camino Real, Mountain View, CA 94040 USA.",laura.e.panattoni@gmail.com,"Brown, Patrick/E-4085-2012","Brown, Patrick/0000-0001-6857-8608; Te Ao, Braden/0000-0002-1050-200X; Gladding, Patrick/0000-0002-0380-3592","Auckland District Health Board A-Plus Trust, an organization of the New Zealand national public health system; charitable grant","Auckland District Health Board A-Plus Trust, an organization of the New Zealand national public health system; charitable grant","The funding for this study was provided by the Auckland District Health Board A-Plus Trust, an organization of the New Zealand national public health system.

We previously published an article in PharmacoEconomics in which we described a mechanism-based economic modelling approach that incorporates data obtained during phase II clinical studies on the relationships between dose, exposure and response. We now describe case studies of rituximab for the treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma based on this methodology. Methods: We utilized a population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model linking serum rituximab concentration to progression-free survival, to simulate the effectiveness of rituximab in various clinical contexts. These served as inputs to economic models of follicular lymphoma, based on National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) appraisals, to assess the cost effectiveness of rituximab. Our results were compared with trial-based estimates from the NICE appraisals. In a further analysis, we simulated the results of an ongoing trial to generate predictions of cost effectiveness. Results: Our analyses suggest an acceptable degree of concordance between simulation- and trial-based estimates of cost effectiveness. For first-line and maintenance therapy, deviations of (sic)2099 and (sic)1355 per QALY, respectively, from trial-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates of (sic)8290 and (sic)7721 per QALY gained would not affect reimbursement decisions. The probability of rituximab-containing regimens being cost effective at (sic)20000 and (sic)30000 per QALY thresholds was 1 for both First-line and maintenance therapy in both simulated and trial-based analyses. Conclusions: Our analyses demonstrate the feasibility of mechanism-based economic analyses, which may have applications during drug development to the following: (i) directing future research based on the cost of reducing uncertainty; (ii) assessing subgroups, dosing schedules and protocol deviations; and (iii) informing strategic research and development and pricing decisions.","[Pink, Joshua; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Inst Med & Social Care Res, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales; [Lane, Steven] Univ Liverpool, Dept Biostat, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",Bangor University; University of Liverpool,"Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Inst Med & Social Care Res, Dean St, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Pink, Joshua/0000-0002-7597-4198; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459","Medical Research Council, North West Hub for Trial Methodology Research; Medical Research Council [G0800792] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0800792] Funding Source: UKRI","Medical Research Council, North West Hub for Trial Methodology Research; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This study was funded by the Medical Research Council, as part of the North West Hub for Trial Methodology Research.

The interest increase in multivariate mixtures and their applicability when they are combined with clustering methods motivated us to opt for these methods to analyse financial markets' dynamics. An empirical investigation of a set of interest rate time series is performed using a new methodology. The objective of these analyses is to determine the similarities and specificities among the analysed financial time series. Interest rates are subsequently classified according to their behavior. Such a study has been widely exploited for stock price changes using traditional methods, whereas interest rates have been less considered. The major advantage of cluster analysis is that it gives the study more realism, since it represents a functional relationship between independent and dependent variables.

Specialty pharmaceuticals are high-cost medications that treat complex, chronic, rare, and difficult-to-manage conditions. These drugs require special drug handling, appropriate clinical outcomes monitoring, and effective cost controls. The primary scope of this article is to discuss various strategies being implemented for specialty pharmaceutical utilization and cost management and correlated outcomes in the USA; these outcomes include enhanced health insurance plan benefit designs with formulary modifications and greater patient cost burden. Additional methods to manage specialty pharmaceuticals include the use of specialty pharmacies for drug distribution, increased emphasis on coordination of care and evidence-based medicine, as well as healthcare reform and regulations. Healthcare spending, both in the US and globally, continues to increase, with a rising proportion of drug spend towards specialty pharmaceuticals. Continued specialty pharmaceutical innovation and introduction of biosimilar products will evolve the currently utilized management strategies for these drugs.","[Patel, Bijal Nitin; Audet, Patricia R.] Univ Sci, Mayes Coll Healthcare Business & Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Audet, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Sci, Mayes Coll Healthcare Business & Policy, 600 S 43rd St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",b.patel@usciences.edu; p.audet@usciences.edu,,,,,,,52,18,20,0,22,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2014,32.0,11,,,,,1105,1114,,10.1007/s40273-014-0196-0,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0LJ,25118989.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344627300008,0

This provides a picture of how unregulated financial innovation pushes an economy towards the ideal limit of complete markets. Hedging new products with existing products allows financial institutions to reduce the associated risk and hence the risk premium. This has the expected consequence that markets, under such ideal conditions, converge to market completeness as the repertoire of financial instruments expands. As markets approach completeness, however, two 'unintended consequences' also arise: (i) equilibrium portfolios develop a marked susceptibility to idiosyncratic shocks and/or parameter uncertainty and (ii) hedging engenders divergent trading volumes in the interbank market. Combining these suggests an inverse relation between financial stability and the size of the financial sector, which can be quantified within the present framework. These results suggest that even under perfect competition and symmetric information, the pursuit of market efficiency-in terms of completeness-may erode financial stability. The proliferation of financial instruments exacerbates the effects of market imperfections and, in order to prevent an escalation of perverse effects, markets may require institutional structures that become more and more substantial as their complexity expands.","Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, I-34014 Trieste, Italy",Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP),"Marsili, M (通讯作者)，Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Str Costiera 11, I-34014 Trieste, Italy.",marsili@ictp.it,"Marsili, Matteo/AAX-2124-2021","Marsili, Matteo/0000-0001-9437-6989",,,,,23,2,3,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Recent major bankruptcies have included seemingly robust companies such as Enron, Kmart, Global Crossing, WorldCom, and Lehman Brothers. These cases have become of serious public concern due to the huge influence these companies have on the real economy. This research proposes a hybrid evolution approach to integrate particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the support vector machine (SVM) technique for the purpose of predicting financial failures. The preparation phase collected an initial sample of 68 companies listed by the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC). The financial datasets were constructed based on 33 financial ratios, four non-financial ratios and one combined macroeconomic index. To select suitable indicators for the input vector, the principle component analysis (PCA) technique was applied to reduce the data and determine how groupings of indicators measure the same concept. In the swarming phase, PSO was applied to obtain suitable parameters for SVM modeling without reducing the classification accuracy rate. In the modeling phase, the SVM model was used to build a training set that was used to calculate the model's accuracy and fitness value. Finally, these optimized parameters were used in the hybrid PSO-SVM model to evaluate the model's predictive accuracy. This paper provides four critical contributions. (1) Using the PCA technique, the statistical results indicate that the financial prediction performance is mainly affected by financial ratios rather than non-financial and macroeconomic ratios. (2) Even with the input of nearly 70% fewer indicators, our approach is still able to provide highly accurate forecasts of financial bankruptcy. (3) The empirical results show that the PSO-SVM model provides better classification accuracy (i.e. normal vs. bankrupt) than the grid search (Grid-SVM) approach. (4) For six well-known UCI datasets, the PSO-SVM model also provides better prediction accuracy than the Grid-SVM, GA-SVM, SVM, SOM, and SVR-SOM approaches. Therefore, this paper proposes that the PSO-SVM approach is better suited for predicting potential financial distress.","Natl Taichung Inst Technol, Dept Informat Management, Taichung 404, Taiwan",,"Chen, MY (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Inst Technol, Dept Informat Management, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",mychen@ntit.edu.tw,"Chen, Mu-Yen/AAO-6568-2021",,"National Scientific Council (NSC) of the Republic of China (ROC) [NSC-98-2410-H-025-011, NSC-99-2410-H-025-011]","National Scientific Council (NSC) of the Republic of China (ROC)(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The author is grateful for the support of the National Scientific Council (NSC) of the Republic of China (ROC) for this work under grant Nos.

It is recommended that atrial fibrillation patients at medium or high risk of stroke use an oral anticoagulant to reduce the risk of stroke. In the past few years, three new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have been introduced in competition to the older oral anticoagulant warfarin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban in a Norwegian setting. We created a probabilistic decision-analytic Markov model to simulate the life of patients with atrial fibrillation. We performed several scenario analyses, including changing the switching age for dabigatran from 80 to 75 years old. Assuming the European Society of Cardiology guidance, sequential dabigatran (2 x 150 mg daily until 80 years old, 2 x 110 mg thereafter) seems to be the most cost-effective alternative for high-risk AF patients. For medium-risk patients, apixaban (2 x 5 mg daily) seems to be somewhat more effective than dabigatran, but dabigatran is still marginally the most cost-effective alternative. In scenario analyses reducing dabigatran from 2 x 150 mg to 2 x 110 mg at the age of 75 years (instead of at age 80), apixaban (2 x 5 mg daily) becomes the most cost-effective alternative for both risk groups. We have found apixaban or sequential dabigatran to be the alternatives most likely to be considered cost effective, depending on the switching age for dabigatran. These conclusions are highly sensitive to assumptions made in the analysis.","[Wisloff, Torbjorn; Hagen, Gunhild; Klemp, Marianne] Norwegian Knowledge Ctr Hlth Serv, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Wisloff, Torbjorn] Oslo Univ Hosp, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Wisloff, Torbjorn] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Hagen, Gunhild] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth & Gen Practice, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Klemp, Marianne] Univ Oslo, Dept Pharmacol, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Knowledge Centre for Health Services; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Oslo,"Wisloff, T (通讯作者)，Norwegian Knowledge Ctr Hlth Serv, Postboks 7004, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",twisloff@gmail.com,"Wisløff, Torbjørn/AFM-8289-2022; Klemp, Marianne/AAQ-5652-2021","Wisløff, Torbjørn/0000-0002-7539-082X; Klemp, Marianne/0000-0002-9530-8344; Hagen, Gunhild/0000-0001-7464-9652",,,,,56,40,45,0,22,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2014,32.0,6,,,,,601,612,,10.1007/s40273-014-0152-z,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0KN,24715603.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344625200008,0

J,"Johnson, W",,,,"Johnson, Will",,,The combinatorial game theory of well-tempered scoring games,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAME THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Combinatorial games; Scoring games; Milnor games,,"The general behavior of combinatorial scoring games is not well-understood. In this paper, we focus on a special class of well-tempered scoring games. By analogy with Grossman and Siegel's notion of even- and odd-tempered normal play games, we declare a dicot scoring game to be even-tempered if all its options are odd-tempered, and odd-tempered if it is not atomic and all its options are even-tempered. Games of either sort are called well-tempered. These show up naturally when analyzing one of the knot games introduced by Henrich et al. We consider disjunctive sums of well-tempered scoring games, and develop a theory for them analogous to the standard theory of disjunctive sums of normal play partizan games. We isolate a special class of inversive well-tempered games which behave like normal play partizan games or like the Milnor games considered by Milnor and Hanner.

This approach is based on splitting the value of the VA into a European part and an early exercise premium following the work of Kim and Yu (1996) and Carr et al. (1992). The technique is first applied to the simplest VA with GMAB (path-independent benefits) and is then shown to be possibly generalized to the case when benefits are path-dependent. Fees are paid continuously as a fixed percentage of the fund value. Our approach is useful to investigate the impact of path-dependent benefits on surrender incentives. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This approach combines quasi-maximum-likelihood fitting of asymmetric conditional autoregressive range (ACARR) models to estimate the current volatility and classical extreme value theory (EVT) to estimate the tail of the innovation distribution of the ACARR model. The proposed approach reflects two well-known phenomena found in most financial time series: stochastic volatility and the fat-tailedness of conditional distributions. This approach presents two main advantages over the McNeil and Frey approach. First, the ACARR model in this approach is an asymmetric model that treats the upward and downward movements of the asset price asymmetrically, whereas the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model in the McNeil and Frey approach is a symmetric model that ignores the asymmetric structure of the asset price. Second, the proposed method uses classical EVT to estimate the tail of the distribution of the residuals to avoid the threshold issue in the modern EVT model. Since the McNeil and Frey approach uses modern EVT, it may estimate the tail of the innovation distribution poorly. Back testing of historical time series data shows that our approach gives better VaR estimates than the McNeil and Frey approach.","[Chou, Heng-Chih] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Shipping & Transportat Management, Keelung, Taiwan; [Wang, David K.] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Taiwan Ocean University; National University Kaohsiung,"Wang, DK (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",dwang@nuk.edu.tw,,"Wang, David K./0000-0003-4919-3432",,,,,64,7,9,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We investigated the cost effectiveness of using the RS assay versus current clinical practice (CCP) in post-menopausal women with estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-positive, one to three positive axillary lymph-node ESBC from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system. We developed a decision analytic model to project the lifetime clinical and economic consequences of ESBC. We assumed that the RS assay would classify patients among risk levels (low, intermediate and high) and corresponding adjuvant treatment regimens. The model was parameterized using 7-year follow-up data from the Manitoba Cancer Registry, cost data from Manitoba Health administrative databases and secondary sources. Costs are presented in 2012 Canadian dollars, and future costs and benefits were discounted at 5 %. In the base case analysis, the RS assay compared with CCP led to an increase of 0.08 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and an increase in cost of Can$36.2 per person, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Can$464/QALY gained. The ICER was most sensitive to the proportion of women classified to intermediate risk by the RS assay who received adjuvant chemotherapy, and absolute risk of relapse among patients receiving the RS assay. The RS assay is likely to be cost effective in the Canadian healthcare system. Field evaluations of the assay in this patient population will help reduce uncertainty in clinical guidelines for intermediate-range RS-assay values and specific disease outcomes by the RS assay, which are important drivers of ICER.","[Hannouf, Malek B.; Xie, Bin] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada; [Xie, Bin] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON, Canada; [Brackstone, Muriel] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Oncol & Surg, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON, Canada; [Zaric, Gregory S.] Univ Western Ontario, Ivey Business Sch, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada; [Zaric, Gregory S.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Hannouf, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada.",mbassamh27@gmail.com,,,Academic Development Grant from Western University; CIHR Strategic Training Program in Cancer Research and Technology Transfer; Canada Research Chairs program,Academic Development Grant from Western University; CIHR Strategic Training Program in Cancer Research and Technology Transfer(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canada Research Chairs program(Canada Research Chairs),"Funding was provided by an Academic Development Grant from Western University.

However, financial time series is characteristically nonlinear, non-stationary, noisy, high degree of uncertainty, and hidden relationships. According to many scholars these characteristics are the reason of the unavailable information regarding to the behavior of financial market between the future and past captured prices. Such inherent, which, are not taken into account when prediction models are built, considered as a noise where the changing of the financial time series over time is implied the non-stationary characteristic. As a rustle of the above characteristic, prediction of financial time series data considered as a most challenging tasks of time series prediction. Support vector machine has great potential and superior performance in practical applications. Moreover, it can be regarded as a statistical learning theory algorithm with the principles of risk minimization structure, which have been adaptive by SVM. Therefore, this unique capability and abilities have drawn the attention of investors as well as researchers to utilize such technique in financial time series prediction. As a result of introducing the insensitivity loss function SVM by Vapnik, regression model SVM, become called support vector regression. Hence SVR solve many problems regarding nonlinear estimation and financial time series prediction, the attention of utilizing such model has been also increased dramatically. Thus SVR has been used widely utilized in prediction of time series data. In this paper, SVR will be utilized for FTSE100 financial time series prediction. The full details of the work will be explained in the presentation where a prediction model is designed by applying ensemble learning techniques for improving the prediction accuracy. Several support vector regression classifiers have been applied as the members of ensemble model. In financial time series prediction model, any improvement of the accuracy is considered to be good. A considerable improvement to the prediction accuracy has been achieved in this work using an ensemble SVR model. Furthermore, the proposed method will be compared using different fusion methods ( majority vote and membership degree).

In particular, we will study a recent seismic swarm happened in S Spain, named the Torreperogil-Sabiote seismic swarm/sequence. This sequence is represented (tk, (xk, Yk)) k = 1,..N with tk the occurrence time of the kth event and mk is an outcome of a positive real random variable Mk.In seismology, mk corresponds to the magnitude of the kth event. Assuming T-s and T-E the start- and end-time of the observation period, the occurrence times constitute an increasing series, Ts < ti <....tN < TE. The set of geographic coordinates (xk, Yk), k = 1,..N C R-2, correspond to event locations. In the first step, the study focuses on the temporal behaviour of the swarm-time series. On the basis of the daily activity rate, three main phases are identified and analyzed. The performed analysis combines different seismological relationships to improve our understanding of the physical process related to event occurrences. The energy released during each event is estimated using the seismic moment and each phase is characterized by the cumulative seismic moment. To derive the frequency of the magnitude, a detailed analysis of threshold magnitude me for which all events with magnitude m, m >= me are reported in our data base (swarm-time series), is performed using different approaches. We used the maximum curvature (Maxc), the Goodness of fit (Gft), the entire magnitude range (Emr) and the Mean Base Slope (Mhos) approach, to derive the threshold magnitude me It is found to be around 1.3 mbLg for the three analyzed phases. The Gutenberg-Richter size distribution relationship log N(M >= m) = a b m with N(M >= m) the number of events with magnitude above, is analyzed for for events with magnitude m, m >= me. The slope in the former relationship called b-value, is an important parameter used different seismological fields (e.g. seismic hazard, forecasting), this parameter is linked to the ground fracturation in a given area. In this study, this parameter is estimated using the maximum likelihood method. Its estimated values are 1.84 +/- 0.10, 1.03 +/- 0.03 and 1.02 +/- 0.02 for the phase 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

Market impact is empirically observed to be a concave function of metaorder size, i.e. the impact per share of large metaorders is smaller than that of small metaorders. We formulate a stylized model of an algorithmic execution service and derive a fair pricing condition, which says that the average transaction price of the metaorder is equal to the price after trading is completed. We show that at equilibrium the distribution of trading volume adjusts to reflect information, and dictates the shape of the impact function. The resulting theory makes empirically testable predictions for the functional form of both the temporary and permanent components of market impact. Based on the commonly observed asymptotic distribution for the volume of large trades, it says that market impact should increase asymptotically roughly as the square root of metaorder size, with average permanent impact relaxing to about two-thirds of peak impact.","[Farmer, J.

To fully elucidate and evaluate the cost drivers of pregnancy in the US for payers, a systematic review was conducted to understand the main cost components and primary factors that contribute to the direct costs of pregnancy, pregnancy-related complications and unintended pregnancy among women of childbearing age (15-44 years). We performed electronic searches in the PubMed database from January 2000 to December 2012, and major women's health and pharmacoeconomics conference proceedings from 2011 to 2012. The systematic review is comprised of studies that reported pregnancy, pregnancy-related complications, unplanned pregnancy, and pregnancy-induced monetary costs. The review excluded narrative reports, systematic reviews, model-derived cost of pregnancy papers, non-US-based studies, and reports based solely on expert opinions. Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria and assessed the quality of the data collected. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus or by arbitration through a third party, with reference to the original sources. We collected information on the study design and outcomes for each included study. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines in designing, performing, and reporting of the systematic review. We identified 40 studies from electronic and handsearching methods. We classified studies based on the primary research topic focusing on the overall cost of pregnancy (N = 10), cost of pregnancy-related complications (N = 26), cost of unintended pregnancy (N = 2), cost of planned pregnancy (N = 1), or cost of pregnancy by facilities (N = 1). In the quality assessment, randomized, non-randomized, and retrospective database studies had low to moderate risk of bias. We determined primary cost drivers based on the highest cost reported in each study. The identified cost drivers were inpatient care, pregnancy delivery, multiple births, complicated cesarean sections, high-risk pregnancy, preterm birth, low birth weight, complications due to conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, anemia, and cancer, and in vitro fertilization. In 2008, the overall mean cost per hospital stay for pregnancy-related incidence ranged from $3,306 to $9,234 in 2012 dollars. The mean cost of pregnancy-related complications that led to preterm birth was as high as $326,953 for an infant born at 25 weeks. It is estimated that over 50 % of live births were unintended in the US. The difference in the cost of unintended pregnancy and intended pregnancy was approximately $536 million. One limitation of the systematic review was the exclusion of model-based cost studies which were excluded because of the high level of variation and heterogeneity across sources of reported cost. Another limitation of the review is that the cost of pregnancy perspective is restricted to the US. Preventing pregnancy-related complications and reducing unintended pregnancies may lower the overall economic burden of pregnancy on the US health care system.","[Huynh, Lynn; Tran, Kevin N.; Knuth, Senta; Duh, Mei Sheng] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [McCoy, Mark; Law, Amy] Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceut Inc, Wayne, NJ USA; [Lefebvre, Patrick] Grp Anal Ltee, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Sullivan, Sean] Veritech Corp, Mercer Isl, WA USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals,"Duh, MS (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",mduh@analysisgroup.com,,,"Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(Bayer AGBayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals)","Financial support for this study was provided by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,53,28,35,0,26,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2013,31.0,11,,,,,1005,1030,,10.1007/s40273-013-0096-8,0.0,,,26,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,257ZD,24158771.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000327425600005,0

Based on the possibility theory, fuzzy return and liquidity are quantified by possibilistic mean, and market risk and liquidity risk are measured by lower possibilistic semivariance. Then, two possibilistic mean semivariance models with real constraints are proposed. To solve the proposed models, a fuzzy multi-objective programming technique is utilized to transform them into corresponding single-objective models and then a genetic algorithm is designed for solution. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the application of our models. Comparative results show that the designed algorithm is effective for solving the proposed models.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based upon the manufacturers' submission to NICE. The evidence, which was derived mainly from a double-blind, phase III, placebo-controlled trial of aripiprazole in patients aged 10-17 years, showed that aripiprazole performed significantly better than placebo in reducing mania according to the primary outcome measurement (the Young Mania Rating Scale at 4 weeks). Safety outcomes indicated that aripiprazole was significantly more likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms and somnolence than placebo. The manufacturers also presented a network meta-analysis of aripiprazole versus other atypical antipsychotics commonly used to treat manic episodes (olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone) to show that aripiprazole performed similarly to the comparator drugs in terms of efficacy and safety. Aripiprazole was demonstrated to perform better in safety outcomes of (1) less weight gain than olanzapine and quetiapine; and (2) less prolactin increase than olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone. Results from the manufacturers' economic evaluation showed that use of aripiprazole second-line dominated all of the other treatment strategies that were considered. However, there was considerable uncertainty in this result, and clinical advisors indicated that the actual treatment strategy employed in practice is likely to be dependent upon the patient's characteristics. The ERG demonstrated that if this personalised medicine resulted in improved cost effectiveness for any of the other treatment strategies, then they had the potential to dominate use of aripiprazole second-line. In conclusion, whilst a strategy including aripiprazole appeared to be cost effective relative to a strategy without it, there was not robust enough evidence to recommend a specific place for aripiprazole within the treatment pathway.","[Uttley, Lesley; Kearns, Ben; Ren, Shijie; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Uttley, L (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",l.uttley@sheffield.ac.uk,"Kearns, Benjamin/H-3686-2019","Kearns, Benjamin/0000-0001-7730-668X; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [09/123/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 09/123/01).

We need to make the best use of these patient-level data to obtain estimates of country-specific CE. Several methods, ranging from simple to statistically complex, have existed for years. We investigated which of these methods are used to estimate CE ratios in economic evaluations performed alongside recent, multinational RCTs that enrolled at least 500 patients. In this systematic literature review, studies were classified based on whether resource use, unit costs, health outcomes and utility value sets were obtained from all countries, a subset of countries or one country. We recorded if the study presented trial-wide and country-specific CE results and reported the statistical analyses that were used to estimate them. We included 21 studies, of which the majority used measurements of health care utilization and health outcomes from all countries to estimate CE. Thirteen studies used a one-country valuation of health care utilization; six used a multi-country valuation. Despite the availability of country-specific utility value sets, none of the studies that presented quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) used multi-country valuation. Valuation of health care utilization and health outcomes was not always consistent within a study: three studies combined a multi-country valuation of health care utilization, with a one-country valuation of health outcomes. Most studies calculated trial-wide CE estimates, while 11 studies calculated country- or region-specific estimates. Thirteen studies used relatively simple methods, which do not take the possible interaction between the country and treatment effect on health care utilization and health outcomes into account. Eight studies used more advanced statistical methods. Three of them used a fixed-effects modeling approach. Five studies explicitly took the hierarchical structure of the data into account, which leads to more appropriate estimates of population average results and associated standard errors. In this way, they help improve transferability of the published results. Based on this systematic review, we concluded that the uptake of more advanced statistical methods has been relatively slow, while simpler na < ve methods are still routinely employed.","[Vemer, Pepijn; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P.

Here, we generalize this idea by choosing the interest and transition rates from a set that allows for mutual dependence.

Chronic HCV infection is usually asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease, making an estimation of the total population affected difficult to elicit. The gold standard treatment option to date has been a combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Recent developments have led to the introduction of two protease inhibitors for use in chronic HCV-boceprevir and telaprevir. Phase III studies have shown both agents have the potential to significantly increase the probability of attaining a sustained virologic response (the primary outcome of interest in chronic HCV) in genotype 1 infections. However, the added cost of these agents also presents the need for decision makers to determine their place on drug formularies. The protease inhibitors are to be administered as triple therapy with the existing gold standard. However, significant variation exists as to the proposed duration of triple therapy, use of lead-in pegylated interferon and ribavirin and subsequent pegylated interferon therapy after finishing the course of triple therapy. Treatment algorithms also exist for the use of stopping rules in the case of early non-responders. The aim of this review is to highlight the current understanding of the economic impact protease inhibitors may have on health care systems and considerations required in the treatment of HCV. Economic and health-related quality of life issues are addressed from multiple viewpoints. The major aspects of the economic evaluations, to date, that included triple therapy as an alternative in the treatment of chronic HCV are brought to light. Future economic evaluations in alternative settings would be useful. The review also emphasizes the challenges for future research. This includes the potential for new therapies to no longer require inclusion of pegylated interferon and/or ribavirin, as well as the use of protease inhibitors in non-genotype 1 patients or those with significant co-morbidities such as HIV/AIDS.","[Turner, Stuart J.; Brown, Jack; Paladino, Joseph A.] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA; [Brown, Jack] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Publ Hlth, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA; [Paladino, Joseph A.] CPL Assoc, Buffalo, NY USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Brown, J (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, 205 Kapoor Hall, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA.",jebkac@gmail.com,,,,,,,95,3,3,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2013,31.0,9,,,,,739,751,,10.1007/s40273-013-0073-2,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,209FH,23839698.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323739500002,0

Replacing, in the theoretical formulas, the true parameter value by an estimator based on n observations of the profit and loss variable induces an asymptotic bias of order 1/n in the coverage probabilities. This paper shows how to correct for this bias by introducing a new estimator of the VaR, called estimation-adjusted VaR (EVaR). This adjustment allows for a joint treatment of theoretical and estimation risks, taking into account their possible dependence. The estimator is derived for a general parametric dynamic model and is particularized to stochastic drift and volatility models. The finite sample properties of the EVaR estimator are studied by simulation and an empirical study of the S&P index is proposed.","[Gourieroux, Christian; Zakoian, Jean-Michel] CREST, F-92245 Malakoff, France; [Gourieroux, Christian] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Zakoian, Jean-Michel] Univ Lille 3 EQUIPPE, Lille, France",University of Toronto; Universite de Lille,"Zakoïan, JM (通讯作者)，CREST, 15 Blvd G Peri, F-92245 Malakoff, France.",zakoian@ensae.fr,"Zakoian, Jean-Michel/J-5484-2019","Zakoian, Jean-Michel/0000-0002-7344-1849",Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) via the Project ECONOM\ RISK [ANR 2010 blanc 1804 03],Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) via the Project ECONOM\ RISK(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors sincerely thank Peter C.B.

The pricing model is constructed as a random mixture of N reference models, where the distribution of mixture weights is obtained by solving a well-posed convex optimization problem. Application of this method to equity and index options shows that, whereas multivariate diffusion models with constant correlation fail to match the prices of index and component options simultaneously, a jump-diffusion model with a common jump component affecting all stocks enables to do so. Furthermore, we show that even within a parametric model class, there is a wide range of correlation patterns compatible with observed prices of index options.

The model is based on distortion functions, i.e. some transformations of a multivariate distribution which permit to generate new families of multivariate distribution functions. We derive some properties of considered distortions. A suitable proximity indicator between level curves, is introduced in order to evaluate the quality of candidate distortion parameters. Using this proximity indicator and properties of distorted level curves, we give a specific estimation procedure.

The relative model risk measure is defined as the expected shortfall of the hedging strategy at a given time horizon for a chosen significance level.

When there is a change in mortality rates, the respective surplus (negative reserve) changes for life insurance and annuity policies lead to oppositive sign changes, which provides mortality hedging strategies with a portfolio of life insurance and annuity policies. We first show that by the strategy of matching duration of the weighted surplus at time 0, the surplus changes at time 0 for both portfolios P-TP (the n-year term life insurance and the n-year pure endowment) and P-WA (the n-payment whole life insurance and the n-year deferred whole life annuity) in response to a proportional or parallel shift in the underlying force of mortality are always negative. Next, we prove that the term life insurance, the whole life insurance and the deferred whole life annuity cannot always form a feasible portfolio (feasibility means that all the weights of the product members of a portfolio are positive) by the strategy of matching two durations or one duration and one convexity of the weighted surplus at time 0.

We derive explicit formulas for the derivatives of the utility indifference price with respect to claims and wealth. The elegant structure of these formulas is a reflection of surprising algebraic identities for the derivatives of the optimal consumption stream. Namely, the partial derivative of the optimal consumption stream with respect to the endowment is always a projection. Furthermore, it is an orthogonal projection with respect to a natural economic inner product. These algebraic identities generate cancellations between the terms entering derivatives of the indifference price and allow us to prove sharp global bounds for the indifference price that become exact when the claims to wealth ratio is large and risk aversion is between one and two. For general risk aversion, we show that, in the large claims to wealth ratio limit, the asymptotic expansion of the indifference price is given in terms of fractional powers of the wealth, depending on risk aversion. When risk aversion is equal to one, the fractional power depends on the underlying claim.","[Malamud, Semyon] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, Quartier UNIL Dorigny, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Trubowitz, Eugene; Wuethrich, Mario V.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Malamud, S (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, Quartier UNIL Dorigny, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",semyon.malamud@epfl.ch; trub@math.ethz.ch; wueth@math.ethz.ch,,"Malamud, Semyon/0000-0001-6574-7322",,,,,43,7,9,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

Academic literature on non-life insurance risk to date has only considered an ultimo perspective (using traditional methods) and, more recently, a one-year perspective (for solvency purposes). However, strategic management in an insurance company requires a multi-year time horizon for economic decision making, providing the motivation for this paper. This is the first paper to derive analytically closed formulae for multi-year non-life insurance risk in the additive loss reserving model as defined by variation of multi-year claims development results. Embedding future accident years leads to an integrated approach to quantifying multi-year risk arising from the settlement of outstanding claims (reserve risk) and future claims yet to occur (premium risk). An application study will serve to illustrate the usefulness of the new multi-year horizon. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Addressing both problems simultaneously, this paper proposes a two-step procedure that rebalances the predictive regression by fractionally differencing the predictor based on a first-stage estimation of the memory parameter. Extensive simulations indicate that our procedure has good size, is robust to estimation error in the first stage, and can yield improved power over cases in which an integer order is assumed for the regressor. We also extend our approach beyond the standard predictive regression context to cases in which the dependent variable is also fractionally integrated, but not cointegrated with the regressor. We use our procedure to provide a valid test of forward rate unbiasedness that allows for a long memory forward premium.","[Maynard, Alex] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Smallwood, Aaron] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Omaha, NE 68182 USA",University of Guelph; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; University of Nebraska System,"Maynard, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Coll Management & Econ, McKinnan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",maynarda@uoguelph.ca,"Maynard, Alex/T-8253-2019","Maynard, Alex/0000-0002-0596-527X",SSHRC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This paper has substantially benefited from comments by the editor, Esfandiar Maasoumi, two referees, and an associate editor.

Math. Finance, 2011, 18, 537563]) we present a new call option where the holder enjoys the early exercise feature of American options whereupon his payoff (deliverable immediately) is the best prediction of the European payoff under the hypothesis that the true drift of the stock price equals a contract drift. Inherent in this is a protection feature which is key to the British call option. Should the option holder believe the true drift of the stock price to be unfavourable (based upon observed price movements) he can substitute the true drift with the contract drift and minimise his losses. The practical implications of this protection feature are most remarkable as not only can the option holder exercise at or below the strike price to a substantial reimbursement of the original option price (covering the ability to sell in a liquid option market completely endogenously) but also when the stock price movements are favourable he will generally receive high returns. We derive a closed form expression for the arbitrage-free price in terms of the rational exercise boundary and show that the rational exercise boundary itself can be characterised as the unique solution to a nonlinear integral equation. In addition we derive the British putcall symmetry relations which express the arbitrage-free price and the rational exercise boundary of the British call option in terms of the arbitrage-free price and the rational exercise boundary of the British put option where the roles of the contract drift and the interest rate have been swapped. These relations provide a useful insight into the British payoff mechanism that is of both theoretical and practical interest. Using these results we perform a financial analysis of the British call option that leads to the conclusions above and shows that with the contract drift properly selected the British call option becomes a very attractive alternative to the classic European/American call.","[Peskir, Goran; Samee, Farman] Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Peskir, G (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",goran@maths.man.ac.uk,,,Credit Suisse London,Credit Suisse London,"We are grateful to Credit Suisse London for hospitality and support.

This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG report and NICE's subsequent decisions. In the initial appraisal by NICE, trastuzumab was rejected for use in the licensed population. Given this result, the manufacturer submitted additional evidence. In the final appraisal decision, trastuzumab was approved, in accordance with supplementary guidance issued by NICE on appraising life-extending, end-of-life treatments, for patients whose human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status was defined by an immunohistochemistry 3 positive (IHC3+) result. This appraisal highlights the need to fully assess the impact of different approaches to diagnostic testing on the cost effectiveness of targeted treatments. In this appraisal, it was found that the diagnostic strategy influenced the effectiveness and cost of trastuzumab. In the future, different diagnostic strategies should be compared in the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis.","[Spackman, Eldon; Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Rice, Stephen; Norman, Gill; Eastwood, Alison] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Suh, Dong-Churl] Chung Ang Univ, Coll Pharm, Seoul 156756, South Korea",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Chung Ang University,"Spackman, E (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",eldon.spackman@york.ac.uk,"Norman, Gill/O-7029-2014","Norman, Gill/0000-0002-3972-5733",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [08/219/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"The authors would like to acknowledge clinical advisors Daniel Swinson and Matthew Seymour.

We show how statistical dimension reduction techniques can be applied in models with these features. In particular, we consider estimation of derivatives of average structural functions in large consumer demand systems, which depend nonlinearly on the prices of many goods. Utility maximization imposes nonlinear cross equation constraints including Slutsky symmetry, and preference heterogeneity yields demand functions that are nonseparable in unobservables. The standard method of achieving dimension reduction in demand systems is to impose strong, empirically questionable economic restrictions such as separability. In contrast, the validity of statistical methods of dimension reduction such as principal components has not hitherto been studied in contexts like these. We derive the restrictions implied by utility maximization on dimension-reduced demand systems and characterize the implications for identification and estimation of structural marginal effects. We illustrate the results by reporting estimates of the effects of gasoline prices on the demands for many goods, without imposing any economic separability assumptions.","[Lewbel, Arthur] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Boston College,"Lewbel, A (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",lewbel@bc.edu,,"Lewbel, Arthur/0000-0003-3864-2618",,,,,28,0,0,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Conversely, evidence of time variation in beta using this model is equivalent to non-normality in the unconditional distribution of asset returns. Using the multivariate normal as a model for the joint distribution of returns on market indices and predetermined information variables, it is shown how to capture skewness and kurtosis in the unconditional distributions of asset returns. Under the assumptions of the model, asset returns are unconditionally distributed as an extended quadratic form (EQF) in normal variables. Expressions are given for the moment generating function and for the computation of the distribution and density functions. The market-timing model is derived formally using this model. The properties of bias when the standard linear betas model is used to estimate alpha when the correct model is the EQF are also investigated. It is shown that a different time varying betas model can arise as a consequence of portfolio selection. It is also shown that the predetermined information variables have the potential to account for the time series properties of returns, including heterogeneity of variance. An empirical study applies the model to returns on 46 UK bond funds. An analysis of the residuals shows that the model described in this paper is able to capture the dynamics of alpha and beta and properly account for other features of the time series of returns for 28 of these funds, of which 15 exhibit time variation in beta. The study reports the effect of the EQF model on the computation of VaR and CVaR and bias in the estimation of alpha.","[Adcock, C.

The objective of this article is.to provide an update, as well as to revisit the development of the construct of QOL and its measurement as applied to schizophrenia. Since our previous article, there has been significant growth in the number of publications about QOL in schizophrenia. Unfortunately, alongside this significant increase in research interest, a number of concerns have also risen about the limitations and lack of impact the concept of QOL has on clinical care and health-policy decision making. A number of concerns previously outlined (such as lack of consensus on a uniform definition of QOL) continue to be an issue. However, we believe that a uniform definition may not be possible, and instead, it may be preferable to have several definitions, which may enrich the concept and broaden its usefulness. Some of the scales we reviewed in 1997 continue to be in use, while others are now rarely or never used. New scales with better psychometrics have been introduced, but most are without theoretical or conceptual foundation. On the other hand, the field of scaling in general has been changing over the past few years and is moving towards a new approach for scale development, based on item response theory, item banks and computer adaptive testing. Unfortunately, this has not extended to QOL in schizophrenia. There continues to be a dearth of theoretical and conceptual models for QOL in schizophrenia, which seems to create the perception that the construct lacks a good theoretical and scientific foundation. One of the major gaps identified in this review is the recognized lack of impact of QOL measurements on clinical management or policy decision making. The majority of publications continue to focus on measurement rather than what to do with the data. The lack of strategies to integrate QOL data in clinical care, as well as the failure to contribute to policy decisions, particularly in cost analysis or resource allocations, has created the perception that the construct of QOL in schizophrenia is not that useful. It is evident that, for QOL in schizophrenia to regain its promise, researchers must take the ultimate next step beyond measurement: to develop credible strategies for integrating QOL data in clinical practice. Additionally, more focused research is needed to demonstrate the role of QOL, not only as an outcome in itself but also as a contributor to other outcomes, such as adherence to medications, more satisfaction, less resource utilization and so on. Since self-appraisal of QOL does not happen in a vacuum but relates to the total human experience in all its biological, psychosocial and environmental aspects, particular attention must also be focused on important neurobiological dimensions such as affect and cognition. Both are significantly affected by the illness itself and its treatment.","[Awad, A. George] Humber River Reg Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON M6M 3Z4, Canada; [Awad, A.

The invariant properties of notions of positive dependence and copulas under increasing transformations are often used in the studies of economics, finance, insurance and many other fields. In this paper, we examine the notions of the conditionally increasing (CI), the conditionally increasing in sequence (CIS), the positive dependence through the stochastic ordering (PDS), and the positive dependence through the upper orthant ordering (PDUO). We first use counterexamples to show that the statements in Theorem 3.10.19 of Muller and Stoyan (2002) about the invariant properties of CIS and CI under increasing transformations are not true. We then prove that the invariant properties of CIS and CI hold under strictly increasing transformations. Furthermore, we give rigorous proofs for the invariant properties of PDS and PDUO under increasing transformations. These invariant properties enable us to show that a continuous random vector is PDS (PDUO) if and only of its copula is PDS (PDUO). In addition, using the properties of generalized left-continuous and right-continuous inverse functions, we give a rigorous proof for the invariant property of copulas under increasing transformations on the components of any random vector.

Several notions of positive dependence have been proposed to describe such dependent risks. In this paper, we assume that the risks in the individual risk model are positively dependent through the stochastic ordering (PDS). The PDS risks include independent, comonotonic, conditionally stochastically increasing (CI) risks, and other interesting dependent risks. By proving the convolution preservation of the convex order for PDS random vectors, we show that in individualized reinsurance treaties, to minimize certain risk measures of the retained loss of an insurer, the excess-of-loss treaty is the optimal reinsurance form for an insurer with PDS dependent risks among a general class of individualized reinsurance contracts. This extends the study in Denuit and Vermandele (1998) on individualized reinsurance treaties to dependent risks. We also derive the explicit expressions for the retentions in the optimal excess-of-loss treaty in a two-line insurance business model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, the underlying asset price is assumed to follow a diffusion process in which both the dividend yield and volatility are functions of time and the underlying asset price. Using the generalized homotopy analysis method, the determination of the early exercise boundary is separated from the valuation procedure of American options. Then, an exact and explicit solution for American options on a dividend-paying stock is derived as a Maclaurin series. In addition, the corresponding optimal early exercise boundary and the Greeks are obtained in closed-form solutions. A nonlinear sequence transformation, the Pade technique, is used to effectively accelerate the convergence of the partial sums of the infinite series. As the homotopy constructed in this paper is based on a generalized deformation with a shape parameter and kernel function, the error of the homotopic approximation could be reduced further for a fixed order.

Not surprisingly, many matrix exponential approximations used in applied probability are particular cases of the first and second order admissible Fade approximations of a Laplace transform, where admissible stands for nonnegative in the case of a density, and for nonincreasing in the case of a ccdf (survival function). Our first contribution below is the observation that for Cramer-Lundberg processes and Brownian perturbed Cramer-Lundberg processes there are three distinct rational approximations of the Poilaczek Khinchine transform, corresponding to approximating (a) the claims transform, (b) the stationary excess transform, and (c) the aggregate loss transform. A second contribution is providing three new always admissible second order approximations for the ruin probabilities of the Cramer-Lundberg process with Brownian perturbation, one of which reduces in the absence of perturbation to De Vylder's approximation. Our third contribution is a method for comparing the resulting approximations, based on the concept of largest weak-admissibility interval of the compounding/traffic intensity parameter rho.

We allow for the possibility that some or even all of the explanatory variables are arbitrarily correlated with the random coefficients, thus permitting endogeneity. We assume the existence of observed instrumental variables Z that are jointly independent with the random coefficients, although we place no structure on the joint determination of the endogenous variable X and instruments Z, as would be required for a control function approach. The model fits within the spectrum of generalized instrumental variable models, and we thus apply identification results from our previous studies of such models to the present context, demonstrating their use. Specifically, we characterize the identified set for the distribution of random coefficients in the binary response model with endogeneity via a collection of conditional moment inequalities, and we investigate the structure of these sets by way of numerical illustration.","[Chesher, Andrew; Rosen, Adam M.] Inst Fiscal Studies, Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, London WC1E 7AE, England; [Chesher, Andrew; Rosen, Adam M.] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"Chesher, A (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, 7 Ridgmount St, London WC1E 7AE, England.",andrew.chesher@ucl.ac.uk; adam.rosen@ucl.ac.uk,,,"UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-589-28-0001]; European Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2009-StG-240910-ROMETA]; ESRC [ES/I034021/1, ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank participants at the June 2011 joint Northwestern Econometrics and Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (CeMMAP) conference in honour of Joel Horowitz for comments, and we are grateful to Konrad Smolinski for assistance with computations in the initial stages of this work.

The model features a multi-sector economy with overlapping generations, heterogeneous workers, endogenous accumulation of sector-specific experience, and costly switching of sectors. The model's estimates yield median costs of mobility ranging from 1.4 to 2.7 times annual average wages, but a high dispersion of these costs across the population. In addition, sector-specific experience is imperfectly transferable across sectors, leading to additional barriers to mobility. Using the estimated model for counterfactual trade liberalization experiments, the main findings are: (1) there is a large labor market response following trade liberalization but the transition may take several years; (2) potential aggregate welfare gains are significantly reduced due to the delayed adjustment; (3) trade-induced welfare effects depend on initial sector of employment and on worker demographics such as age and education. The experiments also highlight the sensitivity of the transitional dynamics with respect to assumptions regarding the mobility of capital.","Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Dix-Carneiro, R (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 201A Social Sci Bldg, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",rafael.dix.carneiro@duke.edu,,,,,,,53,166,233,5,74,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2014,82.0,3,,,,,825,885,,10.3982/ECTA10457,0.0,,,61,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AJ4YG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337685500001,0

One of their new risk measures is skewness-aware deviation, which is closely related to constant absolute risk aversion utility functions. This measure captures downside risk more effectively than traditional variance does. The authors also propose a second measure, skewness-aware variance, which is derived from skewness-aware deviation. This measure simplifies asset allocation problems and empirical results indicate that it captures risk better than traditional variance. However, this measure is also found to be inconsistent due to factor selection. Additionally, in the aspect of skewness-aware deviation, optimal portfolios based upon skewness-aware variance are sometimes less efficient than optimal portfolios that base themselves on traditional variance.","[Bae, Kwangil] Chonnam Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Kwangju, South Korea",Chonnam National University,"Bae, K (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ Business Adm, 77 Yongbong Ro, Kwangju 500757, South Korea.",k.bae@chonnam.ac.kr,"Bae, Kwangil/P-4898-2016","Bae, Kwangil/0000-0002-3797-5050",Chonnam National University,Chonnam National University,"This study was financially supported by Chonnam National University.

This enables the possibility to accommodate for varying local regularity, and to decouple it from long-range dependence properties. While we believe that mBm is potentially useful in a variety of applications in finance, we focus here on a multifractional stochastic volatility Hull & White model that is an extension of the model studied in Comte and Renault. Using the stochastic calculus with respect to mBm developed in Lebovits and Levy Vehel, we solve the corresponding stochastic differential equations. Since the solutions are of course not explicit, we take advantage of recently developed numerical techniques, namely functional quantization-based cubature methods, to get accurate approximations. This allows us to test the behavior of our model (as well as the one in Comte and Renault) with respect to its parameters, and in particular its ability to explain some features of the implied volatility surface. An advantage of our model is that it is able both to fit smiles at different maturities, and to take volatility persistence into account in a more precise way than Comte and Renault.","[Corlay, Sylvain] Bloomberg LP Quantitat Financial Res, New York, NY USA; [Lebovits, Joachim] Univ Paris 06, Regular Team, INRIA Saclay, F-75252 Paris 5, France; [Lebovits, Joachim; Vehel, Jacques Levy] Ecole Cent Paris, MAS Lab, Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Saclay,"Lebovits, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Lab Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoires, UMR 7599, Case 188,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 5, France.",jolebovits@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,52,52,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

For bivariate AR(1) processes, the limit distributions of causality tests based on least squares estimation depend on the presence of nonstationary processes. When nonstationary processes are present, the limit distributions of such tests are usually very complicated, and the full-sample bootstrap method becomes inconsistent as pointed out in Choi (2005, Statistics and Probability Letters 75, 39-48). In this paper, a profile empirical likelihood method is proposed to test for causality. The proposed test statistic is robust against the presence of nonstationary processes in the sense that one does not have to determine the existence of nonstationary processes a priori.

Examples include research-based or commission-based companies. In this context, Bayraktar et al. (2013a) show that a dividend barrier strategy is optimal when dividend decisions are made continuously. In practice, however, companies that are capable of issuing dividends make dividend decisions on a periodic (rather than continuous) basis. In this paper, we consider a periodic dividend strategy with exponential inter-dividend-decision times and continuous monitoring of solvency. Assuming hyperexponential gains, we show that a periodic barrier dividend strategy is the periodic strategy that maximizes the expected present value of dividends paid until ruin. Interestingly, a 'liquidation-at-first-opportunity' strategy is optimal in some cases where the surplus process has a positive drift. Results are illustrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

China's Experience from the Essential Medicines Program,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,VILLAGE HEALTH CLINICS; 10 PROVINCES; CARE; PNEUMONIAE; SYSTEM,"Before the new round of healthcare reform in China, primary healthcare providers could obtain a fixed 15 % or greater mark-up of profits by prescribing and selling medicines. There were concerns that this perverse incentive was a key cause of irrational medicine use. China's new Essential Medicines Program (EMP) was launched in 2009 as part of the national health sector reform initiatives. One of its core policies was to eliminate primary care providers' economic incentives to overprescribe or prescribe unnecessarily expensive drugs, which were regarded as consequences of China's traditional financing system for health institutions. The objective of the study was to measure changes in prescribing patterns in primary healthcare facilities after the removal of the economic incentives for physicians to overprescribe as a result of the implementation of the EMP. A comparison design was applied to 8,258 prescriptions in 2007 and 8,278 prescriptions in 2010, from 83 primary healthcare facilities nationwide. Indicators were adopted to evaluate medicine utilization, which included overall number of medicines, average number of Western and traditional Chinese medicines, pharmaceutical expenditure per outpatient prescription, and proportion of prescriptions that contained two or more antibiotics. We further assessed the use of medicines (antibiotics, infusion, hormones, and intravenous injection) per disease-specific prescription for hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery heart disease, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and gastritis. A difference-in-difference analysis was employed to evaluate the net policy effect. Overall changes in indicators were not found to be statistically significant between the 2 years. The results varied for different diseases. The number of Western drugs per outpatient prescription decreased while that of traditional Chinese medicines increased. Overuse of antibiotics remained an extensive problem in the treatment of many diseases, though there was some significant improvement in certain diseases, like diabetes in rural areas. Medicine expenditure per prescription also decreased. It seems that the removal of a perverse economic incentive alone would not lead to improvement of healthcare providers' prescribing patterns. The rationality of the Essential Medicines List and the lack of payers' and providers' meaningful involvement in the development of the policy possibly contribute to the lack of significant changes in prescribing behaviors. It is suggested that China should adopt more comprehensive policies for healthcare facilities, physicians, patients, and payers, rather than just relying on economic incentives to improve rational use of medicines.","[Chen, Mingsheng; Wang, Lijie; Chen, Wen; Zhang, Luying; Jiang, Hongli; Mao, Wenhui] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Econ, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Chen, W (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Econ, 138 Yi Xue Yuan Rd,POB 187, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",cms123@foxmail.com; janew1011@gmail.com; wenchen@fudan.edu.cn; zhangluying@fudan.edu.cn; jianghl@fudan.edu.cn; maowenhui1015@gmail.com,"Li, Ye/JBS-2949-2023; zhang, yue/JAC-3705-2023; yang, rui/JHI-3328-2023; Chen, Nuo/JZD-0344-2024; Mao, Wenhui/T-3573-2019; liu, xinyu/IWD-6630-2023; MAO, Wenhui/L-1734-2019","Mao, Wenhui/0000-0001-9214-7787; Chen, Mingsheng/0000-0001-9741-0986",Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China,Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China,"The authors, Wen Chen, Mingsheng Chen, Lijie Wang, Luying Zhang, Hongli Jiang, and Wenhui Mao, declare that they have no competing interests.

A number of circular time series models have been proposed including the circular autoregressive model. We extend the iterative outlier detection procedure which has been successfully used in linear time series models to the circular autoregressive model. The proposed procedure shows a good performance when investigated via simulation for the circular autoregressive model of order one.

Moreover, we propose an alternative approach where we turn the problem of prognosis into to a diagnosis problem. We do this by using the temporal sequence values of every feature, to estimate their future values and performing diagnosis on those.

On a first approximation, we have compared simulated time series with the corresponding observational time series, obtaining correlations of 0.88 between the proxy-record delta O-18([2]) and simulated V, and 0.79 between the reconstructed atmospheric CO2 concentration([2-7]) and simulated C, used to quantify the maximum observational variance that this simple model is able to explain. Fourier transform, wavelet transform, cross-wavelet transform, wavelet coherence and cross-recurrence analysis are useful tools to quantify the performance of a model at reproducing the dynamics embedded in observational time series. The analysis shows that the model reproduces closely the dynamics embedded in the ice volume time series, but for the CO2 case the coherence between simulated and observational CO2 is only sporadic, indicating that both time series do not follow the same dynamical behavior, although, in the deglacial periods the two carbon series become dynamically close. The analysis reinforces the hypothesis that some specific mechanisms included in the model are able to closely reproduce the glacial-interglacial oscillations and thus suggests which specific mechanisms should be more seriously investigated in the climate system. These techniques may be applied to other climatic time series to quantify the performance of a model simulating the dynamics of the climate system.","[Herrero, Carmen; Garcia-Olivares, Antonio] Inst Ciencias Mar CSIC, Barcelona 08003, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro Mediterraneo de Investigaciones Marinas y Ambientales (CMIMA); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM),"Herrero, C (通讯作者)，Inst Ciencias Mar CSIC, Pg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",herrero@icm.csic.es; agolivares@icm.csic.es,"Herrero, Carmen/J-5030-2012",,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1068,1080,,,,,,13,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600119,0

Therefore, informal care should be considered in economic evaluations of health interventions. Different methods to do so exist. This paper provides an overview of state-of-the-art methods available for this purpose, illustrated with practical examples. Since the choice of measurement and valuation technique depends on the type and perspective of the economic evaluation, this paper supports researchers in choosing the appropriate techniques to include informal care in their economic evaluation of a health intervention.

Objective Our objective was to examine the cost effectiveness of adherence-enhancing interventions compared with care as usual in randomised controlled trials, and to assess the methodological quality of economic evaluations. Methods MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EconLit and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases were searched for randomised controlled trials reporting full economic evaluations of adherence-enhancing interventions (published up to June 2013). Information was collected on study characteristics, cost effectiveness of treatment alternatives, and methodological quality. Results A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were included. The quality of economic evaluations and the risk of bias varied considerably between trials. Four studies showed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below the willingness-to-pay threshold. Few studies seemed to evaluate interventions that successfully changed adherence. Conclusions Only 14 randomised controlled trials examined the cost effectiveness of adherence interventions. Despite that some studies showe favourable ICERs, the overall quality of studies was modest and the economic perspectives applied were frequently narrow. To demonstrate that adherence interventions can be cost effective, we recommend that proven-effective adherence programmes are subjected to comprehensive economic evaluations.","[Oberje, Edwin J.

Does such a process always converge to a stable matching if one exists? If so, how quickly? Are some stable matchings more likely to be obtained by this process than others? In this paper we are going to provide answers to these and similar questions, posed by economists and computer scientists. In the first part of the paper we give an alternative proof for the theorems by Diamantoudi et al. and Inarra et al., which imply that the corresponding stochastic processes are absorbing Markov chains. The second part of the paper proposes new techniques to analyse the behaviour of matching markets. We introduce the Stable Marriage and Stable Roommates Automaton and show how the probabilistic model checking tool PRISM may be used to predict the outcomes of stochastic interactions between myopic agents. In particular, we demonstrate how one can calculate the probabilities of reaching different matchings in a decentralised market and determine the expected convergence time of the stochastic process concerned. We illustrate the usage of this technique by studying some well-known marriage and roommates instances and randomly generated instances.","[Biro, Peter] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Norman, Gethin] Univ Glasgow, Sch Comp Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; University of Glasgow,"Biró, P (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.",birop@econ.core.hu; gethin.norman@glasgow.ac.uk,"Norman, Gethin/AAG-1482-2020","Norman, Gethin/0000-0001-9326-4344; Biro, Peter/0000-0001-7011-3463",EPSRC [EPE0119931]; OTKA [K69027]; Hungarian Academy of Sciences under its Momemtum Programme [LD-0042010]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/E011993/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/E011993/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); OTKA(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); Hungarian Academy of Sciences under its Momemtum Programme; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This study was supported by EPSRC grants EPE0119931, by OTKA grant K69027 and by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences under its Momemtum Programme (LD-0042010).

In an experimental test of Aumann's conjecture, Charness (Games Econ Behav 33(2):177-194, 2000) found that cheap-talk messages facilitate coordination when they precede the action, but not when they follow the action. Standard game-theoretical modeling abstracts from this timing effect, and therefore cannot account for it. To allow for a formal analysis of the timing effect, I study the sequential equilibria of the signaling game in which the sender is modeled as comprising two selves: an acting self and a signaling self. I interpret Aumann's argument in this context to imply that all of the equilibria in this game are 'babbling' equilibria, in which the message conveys no information and does not affect the behavior of the receiver. Using this framework, I show that a fully communicative equilibrium exists-only if the message precedes the action but not when the message follows the action. In the latter case, no information is transmitted in any equilibrium. This result provides a game-theoretical explanation for the puzzling experimental results obtained by Charness (2000). I discuss other explanations for this timing-of-message effect and their relationship to the current analysis.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Zultan, R (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",zultan@bgu.ac.il,"Zultan, Ro'i/C-8353-2012","Zultan, Ro'i/0000-0002-4256-8601",,,,,32,4,7,0,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

These technologies tend to be characterized by their potential to make valued contributions to patient health in areas of relative unmet need, and have high acquisition costs and uncertainty within the evidence base on their actual impact on health. Decision makers are increasingly interested in linking reimbursement strategies to the degree of uncertainty in the evidence base and, as a result, reimbursement for innovative technologies is frequently linked to some form of patient access or risk-sharing scheme. As the dominant methods of economic evaluation report final outcomes only at the time horizon of the analysis, they present only aggregated information. This omits much of the information available on how net benefit is distributed within the time horizon. In this article, we introduce the Net Benefit Probability Map (NBPM), which maps net health benefit versus time to identify how certain decision makers can be about the benefit of technologies at multiple time points. Using an illustrative example, we show how the NBPM can inform decision makers about how long it will take for innovative technologies to 'pay off', how methodological choices on discount rates affect results and how alternative payment mechanisms can reduce the risk for decision makers facing innovative technologies.","[McCabe, Christopher] Univ Alberta, Sch Community Based Med, Capital Hlth Endowed Chair Emergency Med Res, Fac Med & Dent, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M8, Canada; [Edlin, Richard] Univ Auckland, Sch Populat Hlth, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Hall, Peter] Univ Leeds, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Alberta; University of Auckland; University of Leeds,"McCabe, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Sch Community Based Med, Capital Hlth Endowed Chair Emergency Med Res, Fac Med & Dent, Suite 736,Univ Terrace,8303 112th St, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M8, Canada.",mccabe1@ualberta.ca,"Hall, Peter S/O-3131-2019","Hall, Peter S/0000-0001-6015-7841; Edlin, Richard/0000-0001-5216-083X","National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-0707-10101, CL-2012-02-501] Funding Source: researchfish; Department of Health [RP-PG-0707-10101] Funding Source: Medline",National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Department of Health,,,23,10,12,0,11,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2013,31.0,9,,,,,731,737,,10.1007/s40273-013-0077-y,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,209FH,23877738.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323739500001,0

Parameter estimates used in the DAMs are often based on the results of a regression analysis, but there is little guidance relating to these. This study had two objectives. The first was to identify the frequency of use of regression models in economic evaluations, the parameters they inform, and the amount of information reported to describe and support the analyses. The second objective was to provide guidance to improve practice in this area, based on the review. The review concentrated on a random sample of economic evaluations submitted to the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of its technology appraisal process. Based on these findings, recommendations for good practice were drafted, together with a checklist for critiquing reporting standards in this area. Based on the results of this review, statistical regression models are in widespread use in DAMs used to support economic evaluations, yet reporting of basic information, such as the sample size used and measures of uncertainty, is limited. Recommendations were formed about how reporting standards could be improved to better meet the needs of decision makers. These recommendations are summarised in a checklist, which may be used by both those conducting regression analyses and those critiquing them, to identify what should be reported when using the results of a regression analysis within a DAM.","[Kearns, Ben; Ara, Roberta; Wailoo, Allan; Alava, Monica Hernandez; Campbell, Mike] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Manca, Andrea] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Abrams, Keith] Univ Leicester, Sch Med, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Sheffield; University of York - UK; University of Leicester,"Kearns, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",b.kearns@sheffield.ac.uk,"Campbell, Michael J/I-4253-2014; Kearns, Benjamin/H-3686-2019; Abrams, Keith/AAA-2557-2020","Campbell, Michael J/0000-0003-3529-2739; Kearns, Benjamin/0000-0001-7730-668X; Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617; Hernandez, Monica/0000-0003-4474-5883; Abrams, Keith/0000-0002-7557-1567","NICE through its Decision Support Unit; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [CDF-2009-02-21]; National Institute for Health Research [CDF-2009-02-21, NF-SI-0512-10159] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [CDF-2009-02-21] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)",NICE through its Decision Support Unit; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This article is based on a report that was funded by NICE through its Decision Support Unit.

There is great variation in the sophistication of the methods utilized but to date very little discussion of the appropriate theoretical framework to guide the design and evaluation of these models. In this paper, we argue that recognizing mapping models as a form of indirect health state valuation allows the use of the framework described by Dolan for the measurement of social preferences over health. Using this framework, we identify substantial concerns with the method for valuing health states that is implicit in indirect utility models (IUMs), the conflation of two sets of respondents' values in such models, and the lack of a structured and statistically reasonable approach to choosing which states to value and how many observations per state to require in the estimation dataset. We also identify additional statistical challenges associated with clustering and censoring in the datasets for IUMs, additional to those attributable to the descriptive systems, and a potentially significant problem with the systematic understatement of uncertainty in predictions from IUMs. Whilst recognizing that IUMs appear to meet the needs of reimbursement organizations that use quality-adjusted life years in their appraisal processes, we argue that current proposed quality standards are inadequate and that IUMs are neither robust nor appropriate mechanisms for estimating utilities for use in cost-effectiveness analyses.","[McCabe, Christopher] Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Capital Hlth Endowed Res Chair, Edmonton, AB T6G 2T4, Canada; [Edlin, Richard] Univ Auckland, Sch Populat Hlth, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Meads, David] Univ Leeds, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Brown, Chantelle] United BioSource Corp, London, England; [Kharroubi, Samer] Univ York, Dept Math, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Alberta; University of Auckland; University of Leeds; United Biosource Corporation; University of York - UK,"McCabe, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Capital Hlth Endowed Res Chair, Suite 736 Univ Terrace,8303 112 St, Edmonton, AB T6G 2T4, Canada.",mccabe1@ualberta.ca,"Kharroubi, Samer/AAQ-4583-2020; McCabe, Christopher J/E-2051-2016","McCabe, Christopher/0000-0001-5728-4129; Edlin, Richard/0000-0001-5216-083X","UK Medical Research Council NICE Methods Programme [G0901490]; Capital Health Research Chair Endowment at the University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB, Canada); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [RP-PG-0707-10101] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); Medical Research Council [G0901490] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-0707-10101] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0901490] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Medical Research Council NICE Methods Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Capital Health Research Chair Endowment at the University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB, Canada); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This work was funded by the UK Medical Research Council NICE Methods Programme: G0901490 Methods for the Indirect Estimation of Health State Utilities.

By examining warrant return properties, volatility behaviour and pricing errors, we document a stylized fact that call warrants have a considerable linkage with their underlying but put warrants have almost none. The combination of the arbitrage pricing theory and the resale-option bubble theory (proposed by Scheinkman and Xiong in 2003) is adopted to explain this stylized fact. Specifically, the arbitrage pricing framework tells that it is possible for puts (calls) to be overpriced (underpriced) due to short-sales prohibition in the Chinese stock market, while the resale-option bubble theory proves that puts do have bubbles but calls do not. The bubble dilutes the linkage between put prices and their underlying stock prices.

Dealing with discrete demands, we study two properties: additivity and dummy. We show that these properties are insufficient to guarantee a unit-flow representation similar to that of Wang (Econ Lett 64:187-192, 1999). To obtain a characterization of unit flows, we strengthen the dummy axiom and introduce a property that requires the cost share of every agent to be non-decreasing in the incremental costs generated by their demand.

Although these tests perform fairly well as omnibus tests for comparing two probability density functions (PDFs), they may have poor power against specific departures such as in location, scale, skewness, and kurtosis. We propose a new test for the equality of two PDFs based on a modified version of the Neyman smooth test using empirical distribution functions minimizing size distortion in finite samples. The suggested test can detect the specific directions of departure from the null hypothesis. Specifically, it can identify deviations in the directions of mean, variance, skewness, or tail behavior. In a finite sample, the actual probability of type-I error depends on the relative sizes of the two samples. We propose two different approaches to deal with this problem and show that, under appropriate conditions, the proposed tests are asymptotically distributed as chi-squared. We also study the finite sample size and power properties of our proposed test. As an application of our procedure, we compare the age distributions of employees with small employers in New York and Pennsylvania with group insurance before and after the enactment of the community rating legislation in New York. It has been conventional wisdom that if community rating is enforced (where the group health insurance premium does not depend on age or any other physical characteristics of the insured), then the insurance market will collapse, since only older or less healthy patients would prefer group insurance. We find that there are significant changes in the age distribution in the population in New York owing mainly to a shift in location and scale.","[Bera, Anil K.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ghosh, Aurobindo] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Xiao, Zhijie] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Singapore Management University; Boston College,"Xiao, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",zhijie.xiao@bc.edu,"GHOSH, Aurobindo/D-1426-2009",,,,,,53,14,14,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Oral antivirals can suppress viral replication and prevent or delay the development of cirrhosis and liver-related complications. Objective The aim of this study was to systematically review the quality of cost-effectiveness evidence on first-line treatment with entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir difumarate (TDF) for patients with chronic hepatitis B. Methods We searched electronic databases and retrieved articles published up to October 2011, in which the cost effectiveness of ETV or TDF was compared with that of other oral antivirals. The quality of the studies identified was assessed with a standard checklist for critical appraisal. Results We selected 16 original papers, all published in the last 5 years. There was a conflict of interest in 12 of the 16 studies due to sponsorship by the corresponding pharmaceutical companies. According to the validity assessment, ten studies were classified as high quality. Five studies performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing ETV with TDF; they concluded that TDF dominates ETV. The other 11 studies compared ETV or TDF with other strategies; all concluded that ETV and TDF are both cost-effective interventions. Conclusions This systematic review shows that there is valid evidence suggesting that ETV and TDF are cost-effective interventions for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B in many health systems. In countries where both alternatives are available, it appears that TDF dominates ETV. These results could help decision makers and clinicians to understand economic issues regarding the available drugs for first-line treatment of hepatitis B.","[Buti, Maria] Hosp Gen Univ Valle Hebron, Serv Hepatol, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Buti, Maria] Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Enfermedades Hepat & Digest, Barcelona, Spain; [Oyagueez, Itziar; Lozano, Virginia; Casado, Miguel A.] Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res Iberia, Madrid, Spain",Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBEREHD; Instituto de Salud Carlos III,"Buti, M (通讯作者)，Hosp Gen Univ Valle Hebron, Serv Hepatol, Paseo Valle Hebron 119, Barcelona 08035, Spain.",mbuti@vhebron.net,"Oyagüez, Itziar/L-2185-2019","Oyagüez, Itziar/0000-0002-3047-6152; Buti Ferret, Maria/0000-0002-0732-3078",,,,,65,14,17,1,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2013,31.0,1,,,,,63,75,,10.1007/s40273-012-0009-2,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,138TT,23329593.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318533600006,0

It has been suggested that such measures allow developers to assess potential market profitability in an early stage of development, but may result in discouraging investment in efficient research if not used appropriately. Objective The objective of this study is to identify the pattern of the factors determining cost effectiveness and assess the evolution of cost-effectiveness potential for drugs in development using lipid-lowering therapy as a case study. Methods The study is based on observational clinical and market data covering a 20-year period (from 1990 to 2010) in the UK. Real-life clinical data including total cholesterol laboratory test results were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Data link (CPRD) and are used to illustrate how the clinical effectiveness of existing standard care changed over time in patients managed in clinical practice. Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) data were extracted and the average price of the drug mix used was computed throughout the study period. Using this information, the maximum clinical benefit and cost savings to be had were estimated for each year of the analysis using a cost-effectiveness model. Subsequently, the highest price a new technology providing the maximum clinical effectiveness possible (i.e. eliminating cardiovascular risk from high cholesterol levels) could achieve under current cost-effectiveness rules was calculated and used as a measure of the potential cost effectiveness of drugs in development. Results The results in this study show that the total cholesterol values of patients managed in clinical practice moved steadily towards recommended clinical targets. Overall, the absolute potential for incremental health-related quality of life decreased by approximately 78 %, contracting from 0.36 QALYs to 0.08 QALYs, which resulted in a saving of approximately 15 % of the costs related to cardiovascular events. The price of the drug mix used in the management of high blood cholesterol varied considerably across the years: the weighted average monthly price (in year 2007 values) started at approximately 14 pound, peaked around 26 pound and progressively decreased to its minimum at 6.85 pound in 2010. As a consequence, the maximum price allowed by current cost-effectiveness rules for a new technology achieving the clinical target was found to decrease by a minimum of 80 % between 1990 and 2010. Conclusion The analysis supports the hypothesis that the potential for cost effectiveness of new therapies is dependent on factors specific to each disease area and furthermore to sub-populations within disease areas. Despite a clinical need still existing, the results suggest that no more technologies are likely to be developed in certain disease areas based on their low perceived cost-effectiveness potential. This occurs without considering the immediate and future value of the effectiveness lost, which may depend on the technical difficulty of materializing future advancements, and ignores the permanent character of such a decision. The analysis suggests that a single, static and arbitrary cost-effectiveness threshold may not be sufficient to capture the drug-development dynamics occurring at the disease level and successfully direct research to the disease areas that are most valued by society.","[Camejo, Rodrigo Refoios; Rutten, Frans] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Med Ctr, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McGrath, Clare] AstraZeneca, HTA Policy & Payer Evidence, Macclesfield, Cheshire, England; [Miraldo, Marisa] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, Healthcare Management Grp, London, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; AstraZeneca; Imperial College London,"Camejo, RR (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Med Ctr, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",rodrigo.refoioscamejo@gmail.com,"Miraldo, Marisa/ABF-2584-2020","Miraldo, Marisa/0000-0002-5772-7740; Refoios Camejo, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5507-4857",Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT); Pfizer,Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Pfizer(Pfizer),"Whilst conducting this study, R.

In the setting under study, investors are endowed with an option to surrender. The goal of the paper is to study how this option impacts the default risk of the issuing company and the value of the contracts it issues. Surrender risk has been extensively studied in arbitrated markets, using trees or least-squares Monte Carlo methods for valuations, although practitioners often rely on econometric methods. We deal with surrender risk in a third way, assuming policyholders have sets of information and preferences that differ from those of financial market agents, but without relying on econometric methods. In particular, policyholders are supposed to be only partially rational (at least in the financial sense). This is done by modeling surrender risk through a Cox process correlated to the assets and interest rate dynamics. The paper provides formulas for the dynamics of the assets of the issuing firm (these dynamics drive the default time of the company), and for the valuation of liabilities and equity. A numerical illustration is provided.","[Le Courtois, Olivier] EM Lyon Business Sch, F-69134 Ecully, France; [Nakagawa, Hidetoshi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan",emlyon business school; Hitotsubashi University,"Le Courtois, O (通讯作者)，EM Lyon Business Sch, 23 Ave Guy de Collongue, F-69134 Ecully, France.",lecourtois@em-lyon.com,,"Le Courtois, Olivier/0000-0003-3186-0639",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [20241038]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20241038] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) No. 20241038 from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

However, due to the low incidence of AML, it is not always feasible to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of personalized medicine using clinical trials. Decision analytic models provide an alternative data source. Objective The aim of this study was to develop and validate a decision analytic model that represents the full disease course of AML. Methods We used a micro simulation with discrete event components to incorporate both patient and disease heterogeneity. Input parameters were calculated from patient-level data. Two hematologists critically evaluated the model to ensure face validity. Internal and external validity was tested by comparing complete remission (CR) rates and survival outcomes of the model with original data, other clinical trials and a population-based study. Results No significant differences in patient and treatment characteristics, CR rate, 5-year overall and disease-free survival were found between the simulated and original data. External validation showed no significant differences in survival between simulated data and other clinical trials. However, differences existed between the simulated data and a population-based study. Conclusions The model developed in this study is proved to be valid for analysis of an AML population participating in a clinical trial. The generalizability of the model to a broader patient population has not been proven yet. Further research is needed to identify differences between the clinical trial population and other AML patients and to incorporate these differences in the model.","[Leunis, Annemieke; Redekop, W.

It is well known that the maximum aggregate loss follows a compound geometric distribution, in which the summands consist of the ascending ladder heights. In the present paper, we propose to investigate the distribution of the discounted sum of ascending ladder heights over a finite or an infinite-time intervals. In particular, the moments of the discounted sum of ascending ladder heights over a finite and an infinite-time intervals are derived in both the classical compound Poisson risk model and the Sparre Andersen risk model with exponential claims. The application of a particular Gerber-Shiu functional is central to the derivation of these results, as is the mixed Erlang distributional assumption. Finally, we define VaR and TVaR risk measures in terms of the discounted sum of ascending ladder heights. We use a moment-matching method to approximate the distribution of the discounted sum of ascending ladder heights allowing the computation of the VaR and TVaR risk measures. We conclude this paper with a numerical example illustrating different topics discussed in the paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although modelling techniques play an increasingly important role in the economic evaluation of depression interventions, comparatively little attention has been paid to issues around modelling studies with a focus on potential biases. This, however, is important as different modelling approaches, variations in model structure and input parameters may produce different results, and hence different policy decisions. This paper presents a critical review of literature on recently published model-based cost-utility studies of depression. Taking depression as an illustrative example, through this review, we discuss a number of specific issues in relation to the use of decision-analytic models including the type of modelling techniques, structure of models and data sources. The potential benefits and limitations of each modelling technique are discussed and factors influencing the choice of modelling techniques are addressed. This review found that model-based studies of depression used various simulation techniques. We note that a discrete-event simulation may be the preferred technique for the economic evaluation of depression due to the greater flexibility with respect to handling time compared with other individual-based modelling techniques. Considering prognosis and management of depression, the structure of the reviewed models are discussed. We argue that a few reviewed models did not include some important structural aspects such as the possibility of relapse or the increased risk of suicide in patients with depression. Finally, the appropriateness of data sources used to estimate input parameters with a focus on transition probabilities is addressed. We argue that the above issues can potentially bias results and reduce the comparability of economic evaluations.","[Afzali, Hossein Haji Ali; Karnon, Jonathan; Gray, Jodi] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Afzali, HHA (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Discipline Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",hossein.hajialiafzali@adelaide.edu.au,,"Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099; Gray, Jodi/0000-0002-1119-7078",Australian Research Council; South Australia Department of Health,"Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); South Australia Department of Health(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA))","This research would not have been possible without the financial support of the Australian Research Council and the South Australia Department of Health.

Unlike other procedures for seasonality, this approach allows for the intraday volatility pattern to change over time, resulting in an increase in the filtering performance over the extant deterministic filtering models. We quantify the gains in the filtering performance by comparing our model with the flexible Fourier form (FFF) model of Andersen and Bollerslev [J. Empir. Finance, 1997a, 4, 115-158]. Moreover, the ARCSV model does not create any statistical distortion in the filtered series, as occurs with other de-seasoning processes. We prove that the ARCSV model satisfies the spectral criteria required to be judged as a good filtering process. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the performance of the ARCSV model is superior to the FFF model.

We consider a continuous-time stochastic volatility model in which the stock price is Geometric Brownian Motion with volatility described by a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We also study two discrete-time models: a discretization of the continuous model via a Euler scheme and a discrete model in which the returns are a zero mean i.i.d. sequence where the volatility is a fractional ARIMA process. We implement a particle filtering algorithm to estimate the empirical distribution of the unobserved volatility, which we then use in the construction of a multinomial recombining tree for option pricing. We also discuss appropriate parameter estimation techniques for each model. For the long-memory parameter we compute an implied value by calibrating the model with real data.

This paper considers some of the concerns with the 'received wisdom' in valuing health to describe it using a generic descriptive system and to value it using the hypothetical preferences of the general public. Methods: The literature on the dimensions of health that matter most to people was reviewed and this paper discusses the use of global measures of subjective well-being (SWB) as a possible alternative. New analysis of the British Household Panel Survey was conducted to explore the relationship between life satisfaction and the preference-based quality-of-life measure the SF-6D. The impact on life satisfaction of each level for each dimension of the SF-6D is estimated through a linear model predicting life satisfaction with the SF-6D levels as determinants. Results: Valuing changes in the health of the general population via changes in life satisfaction would lead to different weights being attached to the different dimensions of health, as compared to a well used utility score in which weights are taken from general population preferences. If preferences elicited via standard gamble exercises are based only on a prediction of what it would be like to live in a particular health state, then these results suggest that reductions in physical functioning matter less than people imagine and reductions in mental health impact upon our lives more than preferences would suggest. Conclusions: Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, it is shown that a focus on SWB would place greater emphasis on mental health conditions. The implications for health policy are considered.","[Lee, Henry] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London W2 1NY, England; [Dolan, Paul] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Peasgood, Tessa] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Imperial College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Sheffield,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Room 1029,10th Floor,QEQM Bldg,St Marys Hosp Camp, London W2 1NY, England.",henry.lee@imperial.ac.uk,,"Peasgood, Tessa/0000-0001-8024-7801",Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),"The authors would like to thank Pfizer for supporting this work (the authors' work is independent of the funders, who have reviewed the manuscript) and the UK Data Archive for supplying the data from the BHPS.

Here we introduce a hybrid model of default, in which a firm enters a distressed state once its nontradable credit worthiness index hits a critical level. The distressed firm then defaults upon the next arrival of a Poisson process. To value defaultable bonds and credit default swaps (CDSs), we introduce the concept of robust indifference pricing. This paradigm incorporates both risk aversion and model uncertainty. In robust indifference pricing, the optimization problem is modified to include optimizing over a set of candidate measures, in addition to optimizing over trading strategies, subject to a measure dependent penalty. Using our model and valuation framework, we derive analytical solutions for bond yields and CDS spreads, and find that while ambiguity aversion plays a similar role to risk aversion, it also has distinct effects. In particular, ambiguity aversion allows for significant short-term spreads.","[Jaimungal, Sebastian] Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Sigloch, Georg] Univ Toronto, Dept Math, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Jaimungal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",sebastian.jaimungal@utoronto.ca,,"Jaimungal, Sebastian/0000-0002-0193-0993",NSERC; MITACS of Canada,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); MITACS of Canada,"We are indebted to Marcel Rindisbacher, who introduced us to the concept of robust portfolio optimization.

The study involves modelling the time-varying skewness and excess kurtosis of returns. The empirical results show that adding a preference for positively skewed returns to traditional mean-variance models may not lead to more speculative hedging/investment behaviours. Post-hedged return distributions suggest that the third moments of hedged portfolios have probably been well adjusted by mean-variance strategies, rendering three-moment decision models on a par with traditional mean-variance models. Additionally, considering the aversion to excess kurtosis will cause investors to hedge more. The research also provides empirical support for traditional minimum-variance strategies.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi 621, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Lai, JY (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 621, Taiwan.",finjyl@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,41,5,6,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The efficacy of oral rufinamide as adjunctive therapy in patients with LGS uncontrolled on one to three concomitant antiepileptic drugs was demonstrated in a pivotal, 12-week, randomized, double-blind trial. Rufinamide significantly reduced the 28-day frequency of both drop attacks and total seizures compared with placebo, and significantly increased the proportions of patients experiencing a >= 50% reduction in each seizure frequency. A significantly higher proportion of rufinamide than placebo recipients recorded an improvement in seizure severity at the end of treatment. Reductions in the frequency of drop attacks and total seizures were maintained in a long-term (up to 3 years), open-label extension study. Oral rufinamide was generally well tolerated in pdtients with LGS. Somnolence and vomiting were the most common adverse events occurring more frequently with rufinamide than with placebo. Two pharmacoeconomic analyses, using decision-analysis models with 3-month cycles over a time horizon of 3 years, assessed the cost effectiveness and cost utility, respectively, of rufinamide compared with topiramate and lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in patients with LGS from the perspective of the UK NHS. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that rufinamide would be associated with incremental costs of 62 pound (drop attacks) or 2151 pound (total seizures) per 1% increase in the number of patients achieving a >50% reduction in seizure frequency over 3 years. The cost-utility analysis predicted that the incremental cost per QALY gained for rufinamide compared with the next less-costly and undominated therapy would be more than 5-fold higher than the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold range in the UK. In conclusion, the available pharmacoeconomic data indicate that rufinamide is more effective, but more expensive, than alternative adjunctive therapies approved for use in patients with LOS in the UK. Rufinamide would appear to be a cost-effective alternative to topiramate. Although rufinamide exceeds conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds when compared with lamotrigine, it may still be considered a valuable treatment option for a devastating orphan disease such as LGS.","Adis, Auckland, New Zealand",Adis International,"McCormack, PL (通讯作者)，Adis, 41 Centorian Dr,Private Bag 65901,Mairangi Bay,N, Auckland, New Zealand.",demail@adis.co.nz,,,,,,,16,5,8,0,2,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,3,,,,,247,256,,10.2165/11208630-000000000-00000,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,911AK,22332960.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301689500007,0

To date, adult health state values have been routinely used in the calculation of QALYs for the economic evaluation of healthcare treatment and preventive programmes, including those targeted at adolescents. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to apply profile case best-worst scaling (BWS) discrete-choice experiment (DCE) methods to obtain adolescent-specific values for the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D), a new generic preference-based measure of health-related quality of life developed specifically for application in cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments and interventions targeted at young people. A secondary aim was to assess the feasibility of a web-based method of data collection for the valuation of health states defined by the CHU9D. Methods: A web-based survey was developed including the CHU9D instrument and a series of BWS DCE questions. Specifically, respondents were asked to indicate the best and worst attribute levels from a series of ten health states defined by the CHU9D, presented one at a time. The survey was administered to a community-based sample of consenting adolescents (n = 590) aged 11-17 years. A conditional logistic regression model was applied to estimate values (part-worth utilities) for each level of the nine attributes relating to the CHU9D. A marginal utility matrix was then estimated to generate an adolescent-specific scoring algorithm on the full health = 1 and dead. scale required for the calculation of QALYs. Results: The results indicate that participants were able to readily choose 'best' and 'worst' attribute levels for the CHU9D health states. Large differences in value were found between the first and fifth levels (indicating 'no problems' and 'severe problems', respectively) for all nine attributes relating to the CHU9D. In general, there was little differentiation between the middle levels of all attributes indicating only limited additional value for adolescents of moving between these levels. Comparison of the adolescent-specific algorithm and the existing adult scoring algorithm for the CHU9D revealed some significant differences in values for identical health states, which may have important implications for the application of the CHU9D to value adolescent treatment and service programmes particularly for mental health. In general, adolescents appeared to place more weight upon the CHU9D attributes relating to mental health (worried, sad and annoyed) than would be implied by application of the existing algorithm based upon adult values. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary indications that there may be potentially important and systematic differences in the valuations attached to identical health states by adolescents in comparison with adult population groups. The study findings lend support to the potential future application of profile case BWS DCE methods to undertake large-scale health state valuation studies directly With young adolescent population samples and provide support for the feasibility and acceptability of a web-based mode of administration for this purpose.","[Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5041, Australia; [Flynn, Terry; Terlich, Frances] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Study Choice CenSoC, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Stevens, Katherine; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci HEDS, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Sawyer, Michael] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Paediat, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; University of Technology Sydney; University of Sheffield; University of Adelaide,"Ratcliffe, J (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Repatriat Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Room 52,A Block,Daws Rd,Daw Pk, Adelaide, SA 5041, Australia.",julie.ratcliffe@flinders.edu.au,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Stevens, Katherine/E-4679-2010; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Stevens, Katherine/0000-0002-9018-6413; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988",Flinders University Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee [4701]; Flinders University,Flinders University Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee; Flinders University,This study was approved by the Flinders University Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee (project no. 4701).

We consider a delta-hedging strategy (DHS) for vanilla options under the diffusion model (DM) and the proposed jump-diffusion model (JDM), assuming discrete trading intervals and transaction costs, and derive an approximation for the probability density function (PDF) of the profit-and-loss (P&L) of the DHS under both models. We find that, under the log-normal model of Black-Scholes-Merton, the actual PDF of the P&L can be well approximated by the chi-squared distribution with specific parameters. We derive an approximation for the P&L volatility in the DM and JDM. We show that, under both DM and JDM, the expected loss due to transaction costs is inversely proportional to the square root of the hedging frequency. We apply mean-variance analysis to find the optimal hedging frequency given the hedger's risk tolerance. Since under the JDM it is impossible to reduce the P&L volatility by increasing the hedging frequency, we consider an alternative hedging strategy, following which the P&L volatility can be reduced by increasing the hedging frequency.","Bank Amer Merrill Lynch, London EC1 1HQ, England",Bank of America Corporation,"Sepp, A (通讯作者)，Bank Amer Merrill Lynch, 2 King Edward St, London EC1 1HQ, England.",artur.sepp@baml.com,,,,,,,55,12,12,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Each series in the panel consists of a linear time trend and a random error. The linear time trend is subject to a break that occurs at the same date for all series. The error term is cross-sectionally correlated through a factor structure. The break date is estimated jointly with the common factors. In particular, two break date estimators are analysed: the first is obtained as an iterative solution while the second is obtained as a global solution. The asymptotic properties of these estimators are analysed under both global and local asymptotic frameworks. These two estimators are shown to be asymptotically equivalent and to achieve a faster rate of convergence than the simple break date estimator that does not take common factors into account.

I use a hierarchy of finance model which assumes that internally generated finance for investment is available at a lower cost than external finance, and implies the existence of distinct financial regimes depending on the firm's financial policy. I estimate the empirical investment equation derived from the model using GMM, taking into account the endogeneity of the selection and allowing for debt finance, imperfect competition and the existence of a possible measurement error in the user cost of capital. The empirical results suggest that the Euler equation model is not seriously misspecified for a sub-sample of firms pursuing a particular financial policy.","[Marabel Romo, Jacinto] Univ Alcala UAH, BBVA, Madrid 28033, Spain; [Marabel Romo, Jacinto] Univ Alcala UAH, Dept Management Sci, Madrid 28033, Spain",Universidad de Alcala; Universidad de Alcala,"Romo, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala UAH, BBVA, Via Poblados S-N, Madrid 28033, Spain.",jacinto.marabel@bbva.com,,,,,,,10,4,4,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Both fixed and proportional costs are considered in the problem. The value function is defined as the expected total discounted dividends up to the time of ruin. Although the same problem has already been studied in the pure diffusion model and the spectrally negative Levy process, the optimal dividend problem in an upward jump model has two different aspects in determining the optimal dividends barrier and in the property of the value function. First, the value function is twice continuous differentiable in the diffusion case, but it is not in the jump model. Second, under the spectrally negative Levy process, downward jumps will not cause any payment actions; however, it might trigger dividend payments when there are upward jumps. In deriving the optimal barriers, we show that the value function is bounded by a linear function. Using this property, we establish the verification theorem for the value function. By solving the quasi-variational inequalities associated with this problem, we obtain the closed-form solution to the value function and hence the optimal dividend strategy when the income sizes follow a common exponential distribution. In the presence of a fixed transaction cost, it is shown that the optimal strategy is a two-barrier policy, and the optimal barriers are only dependent on the fixed cost and not the proportional cost. A numerical example is used to illustrate how the fixed cost plays a significant role in the optimal dividend strategy and also the value function. Moreover, an increased fixed cost results in larger but less frequent dividend payments.","[Zhou, Ming] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yiu, Ka Fai Cedric] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Yiu, KFC (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",macyiu@polyu.edu.hk,"Yiu, Cedric Ka Fai/C-1784-2009","Yiu, K.F.C./0000-0002-7523-4069","Natural Science Foundation of China [10701082]; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry; RGC [PolyU(5001/11P)]; AMSS-PolyU Joint Research Institute; Research Committee of Hong Kong Polytechnic University","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); RGC(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); AMSS-PolyU Joint Research Institute; Research Committee of Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University)","The first author was supported by a grant from the Natural Science Foundation of China (10701082) and by the Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry.

A generalized time series model, that allows for modeling the conditional mean and variance of the claim amounts, is proposed for the claims development. On contrary to the classical stochastic reserving techniques, the number of model parameters does not depend on the number of development periods, which leads to a more precise forecasting. Moreover, the time series innovations for the consecutive claims are not considered to be independent anymore. Conditional least squares are used to estimate model parameters and consistency of these estimates is proved. The copula approach is used for modeling the dependence structure, which improves the precision of the reserve distribution estimate as well.

Sample size is well-defined if one has i.i.d real observations, but is not well-defined for vector observations or in non-i.i.d. settings; extensions of critera such as BIC to such settings thus requires a definition of effective sample size that applies also in such cases.

We solve the mean-variance portfolio selection problem using the embedding technique pioneered by Zhou and Li [Appl. Math. Optimiz., 2000, 42, 19-33] and show that it is equivalent to a target-based optimization problem, consisting of the minimization of a quadratic loss function. We support the use of the target-based approach in DC pension funds for three reasons. Firstly, it transforms the difficult problem of selecting the individual's risk-aversion coefficient into the easier task of choosing an appropriate target. Secondly, it is intuitive, flexible and adaptable to the member's needs and preferences. Thirdly, it produces final portfolios that are efficient in the mean-variance setting. We address the issue of the comparison between an efficient portfolio and a portfolio that is optimal according to the more general criterion of maximization of the expected utility (EU). The two natural notions of Variance Inefficiency and Mean Inefficiency are introduced, which measure the distance of an optimal inefficient portfolio from an efficient one, focusing on their variance and on their expected value, respectively. We illustrate the general procedure for finding the mean-variance inefficiency for the HARA class of utility functions, and then focus on the popular classes of CARA and CRRA utility functions. In these cases we prove the intuitive but non-trivial result that the mean-variance inefficiency decreases with the risk aversion of the individual and increases with the time horizon and the Sharpe ratio of the risky asset. As a by-product we prove that the CARA and CRRA optimal portfolios are not mean-variance efficient. Numerical investigations stress the impact of the time horizon on extent of the mean-variance inefficiency of CARA and CRRA utility functions. While at the instantaneous level EU optimality and efficiency coincide (see Merton [J. Econ. Theory, 1971, 3, 373-413]), we find that, for short durations, they do not differ significantly. However, for longer durations, which are typical for pension funds, the extent of the inefficiency turns out to be remarkable and should be taken into account by pension fund investment managers seeking appropriate rules for portfolio selection. Indeed, we see this result as a fourth reason for supporting the use of the target-based approach in DC pension schemes.","[Vigna, Elena] Univ Turin, Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy; [Vigna, Elena] Univ Turin, CeRP, Turin, Italy",Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Turin; University of Turin,"Vigna, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy.",elena.vigna@econ.unito.it,,,,,,,51,72,78,2,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

To the best of our knowledge, no such study has ever been performed on FTSE-100 options, where the dividends have a discreteness pattern different from the S&P-100. Unlike the Harvey and Whaley study, both American and European options are considered, a more accurate benchmark is proposed, and a comprehensive comparison of the accuracy of a larger set of valuation methods is performed. It is shown that there are significant differences in accuracy and speed among different methods, and that, for both American and European options, a great deal of accuracy can be gained by using an approximation that takes into account the discrete nature of the FTSE-100 index option dividends.","[Areal, Nelson; Rodrigues, Artur] Univ Minho, Sch Econ & Management, NEGE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Areal, N (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Sch Econ & Management, NEGE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",nareal@eeg.uminho.pt,"Areal, Nelson/C-1151-2008; Rodrigues, Artur/A-1098-2009","Areal, Nelson/0000-0002-1157-0178; Rodrigues, Artur/0000-0002-7279-4490",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/GES/78033/2006]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/GES/78033/2006] Funding Source: FCT,Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),Support from the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (project PTDC/GES/78033/2006) is acknowledged.

By employing existing option pricing engines for estimating future option prices (possibly in an approximate way, to increase computation speed), in the absence of transaction costs the resulting stochastic optimization problem is easily solved at each trading date as a least-squares problem with as many variables as the number of traded assets and as many constraints as the number of predicted scenarios. As shown through numerical examples, the approach is particularly useful and numerically viable for exotic options where closed-form results are not available, as well as relatively long expiration dates where tree-based stochastic approaches are excessively complex.","[Bemporad, Alberto] IMT Inst Adv Studies Lucca, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Bellucci, Leonardo; Gabbriellini, Tommaso] MPS Capital Serv Modelling & Quantitat Anal, Siena, Italy",IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,"Bemporad, A (通讯作者)，IMT Inst Adv Studies Lucca, Piazza San Ponziano 6, I-55100 Lucca, Italy.",alberto.bemporad@imtlucca.it,,,MPS Capital Services,MPS Capital Services,The authors sincerely thank Alexandre Radicchi and Eric Remo Robert Reynolds for stimulating discussions.

The default event is specified by a Poisson process whose intensity is modeled by a switching Levy process. This model presents several interesting features. First, as Levy processes encompass numerous jump processes, our model can duplicate the sudden jumps observed in credit spreads. Also, due to the presence of jumps, probabilities do not vanish at very short maturities, contrary to models based on Brownian dynamics. Furthermore, as the parameters of the Levy process are modulated by a hidden Markov chain, our approach is well suited to model changes of volatility trends in credit spreads, related to modifications of unobservable economic factors.","[Hainaut, Donatien] ESC Rennes, Rennes, France; [Hainaut, Donatien] CREST, Rennes, France; [Le Courtois, Olivier] EM Lyon, Lyon, France",Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business; emlyon business school,"Hainaut, D (通讯作者)，ESC Rennes, Rennes, France.",donatien.hainaut@esc-rennes.fr,,"Le Courtois, Olivier/0000-0003-3186-0639",,,,,32,10,10,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Indeed, since April 2012, the CBT has computed its reference exchange rate based on the average exchange rate on the interbank market instead of a fixed currency basket. Over the last decade, nominal exchange rate exhibits a depreciation tendency; which is supposed to improve the competitiveness of the economy; Tunisia's external position and rebuilding foreign reserve buffers. But there is a doubt that the response of the current account to changes in the exchange rate could be large in Tunisia. Indeed, policy makers have debated using the exchange rate to motivate an improvement in the trade and service balances. This result hinges on the satisfaction of the Marshall-Lerner condition, which states that the sum of import and export demand price elasticities, must be higher than unity. In this context, we are interested to assess the impact of the exchange rate variations first on commercial balance then on service balance. For that, it is necessary to estimate the import demand elasticity and export demand elasticity, if these elasticities are sufficiently high (the sum is higher than unity) then the depreciation will reduce trade deficit and current account deficit. If they are low, the depreciation will generate an inflation effect without reducing external deficit. A typical finding in the empirical literature is that import and export demand elasticities are rather low, and that the Marshall-Lerner (ML) condition does not hold. However, despite the evidence against the ML condition, the consensus is that real depreciations do improve the current account, though after a lag because of J-curve effects. This paper attempts to measure the effects of the real exchange rate on the commercial balance and then on service balance using quarterly data from 2000 to 2013. First, we estimate two VAR models which gathered trade balance or service balance on one hand and domestic and foreign output and the real exchange rate on the other hand. Then we perform time series Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) of stationarity test, cointegration test, stability test and Granger causality test. Impulse Response Function (IRF) has also been generated to explain the response to shock amongst the variables. The distinction between short run and long run elasticities is crucial for our study and leads to what is known as the J-curve effect. Indeed, a real depreciation will worsen the current account balance in the short run but will improve it in the longer run when the Marshall-Lerner-Robinson condition is satisfied. Preliminary results show that the sum of long run elasticity is higher than unity for goods and either for services. However, it is higher for services than for goods. Compared to the elasticities' estimations undertaken over 1970 to 1998, on an annual data basis, our results exhibit higher elasticities. So, in the context of greater exchange rate flexibility, monetary and exchange rate policy will need to be closely coordinated, since depreciation will fuel inflation which becomes a serious problem for Tunisia after revolt.","[Marrakchi, Fatma Charfi; Attafi, Jalila] Univ Tunis El Manar, Fac Sci Econ & Gest Tunis, El Manar, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis-El-Manar,"Marrakchi, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis El Manar, Fac Sci Econ & Gest Tunis, El Manar, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,186,187,,,,,,2,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600020,0

Due to the interactions between the water cycle and climate, an intensification on evapotranspiration and runoff is expected. The evapotranspiration (ET) affects the agriculture production, and it is very important in areas affected by water scarcity and droughts. Therefore the uncertainties in the identification of plausible trends of ET and potential ET (PET), should be taken into account. PET is a key factor in the water balance, misunderstanding of this process impacts on runoff estimation. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are valuable tools to analyze, understand and predict trends in the medium and long-term of components to hydrological cycle. However, divergent projections are obtained from RCMs in some cases. Methodologies combining multiple RCMs (or ensemble) allow the quantification and reduction of uncertainty in the projections. In this work, a revised model of REA method (Reliability Ensemble Averaging) for building ensembles of temperature is evaluated. The convergence criterion has been removed, and the seasonal variations of temperature, are considered. From the results, a positive trend of simulated PET for 2050 was identified from the RCMs ensemble. Increasing knowledge about plausible impacts of CC on components of the hydrological cycle at basin scale, is an important step for building adaptive capacity to the impacts on Spain.","[Olmos Gimenez, Patricia; Garcia Galiano, Sandra G.] Univ Politecn Cartagena, R&D Grp Water Resources Management, Dept Civil Engn, Cartagena, Spain; [Giraldo Osorio, Juan Diego] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Civil Engn, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Giménez, PO (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cartagena, R&D Grp Water Resources Management, Dept Civil Engn, Cartagena, Spain.",patricia_olmos@live.com; sandra.garcia@upct.es,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1417,1423,,,,,,7,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600160,0

That makes it possible to apply the previous step to two resulting sparser time series recursively, producing thus higher-order runs. Runs of all orders are represented as a labelled binary tree. This structure is termed extremal hull transform of time series. An entropy function associated to the tree so arisen serves as its information contents and complexity measure. We will point out a relation to the wavelet transform and provide an empirical evidence of the usefulness of the method to analyze big temporal data sets, such as tick-by-tick Forex quotes and technological data.","[Skulimowski, Andrzej M.

It was shown that P-positions (the kernel) of NIM(a, b) are given by the following recursion: x(n) = mex(b)({x(i),y(i) vertical bar 0 <= i < n}), y(n) = x(n) + an; n >= 0, and conjectured that for all a, b the limits l(a, b) = x (n) (a, b)/n exist and are irrational algebraic numbers. In this paper we prove that showing that l(a,b) = a/r-1, where r > 1 is the Perron root of the polynomial P(z) = z(b+1) - z -1 - Sigma(a-1)(i=1) z([ib/a]), whenever a and b are coprime; furthermore, it is known that l(ka, kb) = kl(a, b). In particular, l(a,1) = alpha(a) = 1/2(2-a+root a(2)+4). In 1982, Fraenkel introduced the game NIM(a) = NIM(a, 1), obtained the above recursion and solved it explicitly getting x(n)=[alpha(a)n], y(n) = x(n)+ an = [alpha(a)+a)n] . Here we provide a polynomial time algorithm based on the Perron-Frobenius theory solving game NIM(a, b), although we have no explicit formula for its kernel.","[Boros, Endre; Gurvich, Vladimir; Oudalov, Vladimir] Rutgers State Univ, RUTCOR, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Gurvich, V (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, RUTCOR, 640 Bartholomew Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",boros@rutcor.rutgers.edu; gurvich@rutcor.rutgers.edu; voudalov@rutcor.rutgers.edu,"Gurvich, Vladimir/J-5763-2017; Boros, Endre/I-3066-2013","Boros, Endre/0000-0001-8206-3168","NSF [IIS-0803444, CMMI-0856663]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [0856663] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1161476] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))","The first and third authors gratefully acknowledge the partial support by the NSF grant IIS-0803444; the first author also thanks the partial support by the NSF grant CMMI-0856663.

These findings are consistent with historical evidence that Nile shocks increased this authority's political influence by raising the probability he could coordinate a revolt. I find that the available data provide support for this interpretation and weigh against some of the most plausible alternatives. For example, I show that while Nile shocks increased historical references to social unrest, deviant floods did not increase a proxy for popular religiosity.

To prevent moral hazard and to be consistent with the spirit of reinsurance, we follow Vajda (1962) and assume that both the insurer's retained loss and the proportion paid by a reinsurer are increasing in indemnity. We analyze the optimal solutions for a wide class of reinsurance premium principles which satisfy three axioms (law invariance, risk loading and preserving convex order) and encompass ten of the eleven widely used premium principles listed in Young (2004). Our results show that the optimal ceded loss functions are in the form of three interconnected line segments. Further simplified forms of the optimal reinsurance are obtained for the premium principles under an additional mild constraint.

We employ Structural Vector Autoregressive and Vector Error Correction models on the returns of the DCE and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soybean futures during trading and non-trading hours, and the result suggests that information transfers between DCE and CBOT in both directions, in particular that the DCE soybean futures prices influence price discovery in CBOT. Furthermore, the impulse response analysis and forecasted error variance decomposition show that the information transfer from DCE to CBOT is at a similar magnitude as that from CBOT to DCE. This shows that the DCE plays a prominent role in the global soybean futures price discovery.

The test statistics are shown to have limiting distributions independent of the common factors, making it possible to pool the individual statistics.

These hurdles could delay access to new and promising drugs. Since 1992, French law authorizes the use of unlicensed drugs on an exceptional and temporary basis through a compassionate-use programme, known as Temporary Authorization for Use (ATU). This programme was implemented to improve early access to drugs under development or authorized abroad. However, it is suspected to be inflationary, bypassing public bodies in charge of health technology assessment (HTA) and of pricing. Objective The aim of this study is to observe the market access after the formal licensing of drugs that went through this compassionate-use programme Methods We included all ATUs that received an MA between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2010. We first examined market access delays from these drugs using the standard administrative path. We positioned this result in relation to launch delays observed in France (for all outpatient drugs) and in other major European markets. Second, we assessed the bargaining power of a hospital purchaser after those drugs had obtained an MA by calculating the price growth rate after the approval. Results During the study period, 77 ATUs were formally licensed. The study concluded that, from the patient's perspective, licensing and public bodies' review time was shortened by a combined total of 36 months. The projected 11-month review time of public bodies may be longer than delays usually observed for outpatient drugs. Nonetheless, the study revealed significant benefits for French patient access based on comparable processing to launch time with those of other European countries with tight price control policies. In return, a 12 % premium, on average, is paid to pharmaceutical companies while drugs are under this status (sub-analysis on 56 drugs). Conclusions In many instances, the ATU programme responds to a public health need by accelerating the availability of new drugs even though this study suggests an impact of the programme on the market access of these drugs for which the standard administrative path is longer than usual. In addition, pharmaceutical companies seem to market compassionate-use drugs with a presumed benefit/risk ratio at a price that guarantees a margin for future negotiation.","[Degrassat-Theas, Albane; Le Pen, Claude] Univ Paris 09, Lab Econ & Management Hlth Org LEGOS, F-75016 Paris, France; [Degrassat-Theas, Albane; Paubel, Pascal] Paris Descartes Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Droit & Sante, Paris, France; [Degrassat-Theas, Albane; de Curzon, Olivier Parent; Sinegre, Martine] Publ Welf Hosp Paris AP HP, Dept Pharm, Gen Agcy Equipment & Hlth Prod AGEPS, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); AGEPS Agence Generale des Equipements et Produits de Sante - APHP,"Degrassat-Théas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Lab Econ & Management Hlth Org LEGOS, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75016 Paris, France.",albane.degrassat-theas@eps.aphp.fr,"Degrassat-Théas, Albane/HTQ-3094-2023",,,,,,22,14,15,0,19,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2013,31.0,4,,,,,335,343,,10.1007/s40273-013-0039-4,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,138TX,23529210.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318534000007,0

A new quantity, the exogeneity score, plays a central role in this analysis, permitting an omitted variable representation for effect biases.

The most prevalent approach in market practice, Monte Carlo simulation, has been observed to be time consuming and sometimes extremely costly. In this paper we propose alternative analytical methods for the calculation of risk measures for variable annuity guaranteed benefits on a stand-alone basis. The techniques for analytical calculations are based on the study of geometric Brownian motion and its integral. Another novelty of the paper is to propose a quantitative model which assesses both market risk on the liability side and revenue risk on the asset side in the same framework from the viewpoint of risk management. As we demonstrate by numerous examples on quantile risk measure and conditional tail expectation, the methods and numerical algorithms developed in this paper appear to be both accurate and computationally efficient.

The share of the surplus that a player can guarantee herself under first-order knowledge of rationality is determined (as a function of her probability of becoming committed), as is the bargaining posture that she must announce in order to guarantee herself this much. This maxmin share of the surplus is large relative to the probability of becoming committed (e.g., it equals 30% if the commitment probability is 1 in 10 and equals 13% if the commitment probability is 1 in 1000), and the corresponding bargaining posture simply demands this share plus compensation for any delay in reaching agreement.","Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Wolitzky, A (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wolitzky@stanford.edu,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I thank the editor and three anonymous referees for helpful comments.

J,"Dahms, R",,,,"Dahms, Rene",,,LINEAR STOCHASTIC RESERVING METHODS,ASTIN BULLETIN,,,English,Article,,,,,,Stochastic Reserving; Mean Squared Error of Prediction; Solvency Reserving Risk; Claims Development Result,PREDICTION; ERROR,"In this article we want to motivate and analyse a wide family of reserving models, called linear stochastic reserving methods (LSRMs). The main idea behind them is the assumption that the (conditionally) expected changes of claim properties during a development period are proportional to exposures which depend linearly on the past. This means the discussion about the choice of reserving methods can be based on heuristic reasons about exposures driving the claims development, which in our opinion is much better than a pure philosophic approach. Moreover, the assumptions of LSRMs do not include the independence of accident periods. We will see that many common reserving methods, like the Chain-Ladder-Method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson-Method and the Complementary-Loss-Ratio-Method, can be interpreted in this way. But using the LSRM framework you can do more. For instance you can couple different triangles via exposures. This leads to reserving methods which look at a whole bundle of triangles at once and use the information of all triangles in order to estimate the future development of each of them. We will present unbiased estimators for the expected ultimate and estimators for the mean squared error of prediction, which may become an integral part of IFRS 4. Moreover, we will look at the one period solvency reserving risk, which already is an important part of Solvency II, and present a corresponding estimator. Finally we will present two examples that illustrate some features of LSRMs.","Natl Suisse, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland",,"Dahms, R (通讯作者)，Natl Suisse, Steinengraben 41, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland.",rene.dahms@nationalesuisse.ch,,,,,,,12,6,6,0,7,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",0515-0361,,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2012,42.0,1,,,,,1,34,,10.2143/AST.42.1.2160710,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,010FV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309081000001,0

We treat the factor model as a weighted additive nonparametric regression model, with the factor returns serving as time-varying weights and a set of univariate nonparametric functions relating security characteristic to the associated factor betas. We use a time-series and cross-sectional pooled weighted additive nonparametric regression methodology to simultaneously estimate the factor returns and characteristic-beta functions. By avoiding the curse of dimensionality, our methodology allows for a larger number of factors than existing semiparametric methods. We apply the technique to the three-factor FamaFrench model, Carhart's four-factor extension of it that adds a momentum factor, and a five-factor extension that adds an own-volatility factor. We find that momentum and own-volatility factors are at least as important, if not more important, than size and value in explaining equity return comovements. We test the multifactor beta pricing theory against a general alternative using a new nonparametric test.","[Connor, Gregory] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Hagmann, Matthias] Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst, Oxford OX2 65D, England; [Hagmann, Matthias] AHL, Springfield, MA USA; [Linton, Oliver] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",Maynooth University; University of Oxford; University of Cambridge,"Connor, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",gregory.connor@nuim.ie; mhagmann@ahl.com; obl20@cam.ac.uk,,"Connor, Gregory/0000-0001-5911-4983","Science Foundation of Ireland; ESRC; ERC; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1, ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Science Foundation of Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Harold Uhlig, Enno Mammen, and three referees for helpful comments.

The data are supplied by the UK Continuous Mortality Investigation and relate to claims settled in the years 1999-2005. There are non-recorded dates of diagnosis and settlement and these are included in the analysis as missing values using their posterior predictive distribution and MCMC methodology. The possible factors affecting the delay (age, sex, smoker status, policy type, benefit amount, etc.) are investigated under a Bayesian approach. A 3-parameter Burr generalised-linear-type model is fitted, where the covariates are linked to the mean of the distribution. Variable selection using Bayesian methodology to obtain the best model with different prior distribution setups for the parameters is also applied. In particular, Gibbs variable selection methods are considered, and results are confirmed using exact marginal likelihood findings and related Laplace approximations. For comparison purposes, a lognormal model is also considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The martingale approach to modeling price bubbles assumes that the asset's market price process is exogenous and the fundamental price, the expected future cash flows under a martingale measure, is endogenous. In contrast, we define the asset's fundamental price process exogenously and asset price bubbles are endogenously determined by market trading activity. This enables us to generate a model that explains both bubble formation and bubble bursting. In our model, the quantity impact of trading activity on the fundamental price process-liquidity risk-is what generates price bubbles. We study the conditions under which asset price bubbles are consistent with no arbitrage opportunities and we relate our definition of the fundamental price process to the classical definition.","[Roch, Alexandre F.] ESG UQAM, Dept Finance, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jarrow, Robert A.] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Protter, Philip] Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Cornell University; Columbia University,"Roch, AF (通讯作者)，ESG UQAM, Dept Finance, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",alexandre.f.roch@gmail.com,,"Protter, Philip/0000-0003-1344-0403; Roch, Alexandre/0000-0002-8206-0765",NSF [DMS-0906995]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1138756] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"Philip Protter is supported, in part, by NSF grant DMS-0906995.",,23,14,15,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The present study compares access to licensed and subsidized medicines under a single-payer system in each of the US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand (NZ). These systems are the US Department of Veterans Affairs National Formulary (VANF), the UK NHS for England and Wales, Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and NZ's Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC). The VANF, PBS and PHARMAC all use positive lists of medicines that are subsidized, along with pharmacoeconomic analysis and price negotiations with suppliers. The NHS uses a negative list of medicines that are not to be subsidized, along with pharmacoeconomic analysis of a small number of medicines and caps on manufacturers' profits. Objective: Our objective was to compare licensed and subsidized medicines in terms of the following: (i) total numbers of entities (unique Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] codes); (ii) times since first registration (age) of the entities; and (iii) numbers of innovative entities. Methods: This was an observational study in order to test pre-defined hypotheses. All products listed in a major prescribing reference in each country were included in the study. All products were classified by ATC code and their registration dates recorded. Products were collapsed by ATC code to determine 'best-case' licensing and subsidy for each entity, along with the date of first registration. Innovative entities selected for 'fast-track' approval by the US FDA or as a 'breakthrough or substantial improvement' by the Canadian Patented Medicines Prices Review Board were identified. Results were verified by a sensitivity analysis that excluded entities only available in injectable formulations (as these may not always be listed in general prescribing references), and by a parallel analysis done by active agent rather than ATC code. Results: Of the 918 entities and 64 innovative entities licensed in the US, 505 and 20, respectively, were subsidized by the VANF. In the UK, this was 1020 and 58 (1016 and 58 NHS subsidized); in Australia, this was 879 and 49 (567 and 30 PBS subsidized); and in NZ, this was 765 and 39 (503 and 19 PHARMAC subsidized). With the exception of the UK, entities licensed in the US were newer than elsewhere. The median ages were as follows: 6607 days in the US (VANF subsidized 8203 days; p < 0.001); 7319 days in the UK (NHS subsidized 7319 days; p = 0.903); 7795 days in Australia (PBS subsidized 8065 days; p = 0.406); and 8936 days in NZ (PHARMAC subsidized 10 724 days; p < 0.001). NHS subsidized entities were newer than elsewhere. VANF and PHARMAC subsidized entities were significantly older than licensed entities in their respective countries. Conclusion: The single-payer systems examined differ in the number and age of licensed and subsidized entities, along with access to innovative entities. The NHS subsidized the most entities, the newest entities and the most innovative entities. NZ's PHARMAC system subsidized the fewest and oldest entities, and the fewest innovative entities. The VANF and PBS consistently fell between the other two systems in terms of the number of subsidized entities, age of subsidized entities and number of subsidized innovative entities.","[Ragupathy, Rajan; Tordoff, June; Norris, Pauline] Univ Otago, Sch Pharm, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Aaltonen, Katri] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Pharm, Fac Hlth Sci, Kuopio, Finland; [Reith, David] Univ Otago, Dunedin Sch Med, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",University of Otago; University of Eastern Finland; University of Otago,"Ragupathy, R (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Sch Pharm, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",rajan.ragupathy@gmail.com,"Norris, Pippa/G-7931-2018; Aaltonen, Katri/GSO-2466-2022; Norris, Pauline/I-1526-2017","Norris, Pippa/0000-0001-8632-4636; Norris, Pauline/0000-0003-1656-871X; Aaltonen, Katri/0000-0002-1737-264X; Tordoff, June/0000-0001-5571-7592","NZ Government, a University of Otago School of Pharmacy; School of Pharmacy; NZ Government; Finnish Cultural Foundation; Division of Health Sciences","NZ Government, a University of Otago School of Pharmacy; School of Pharmacy; NZ Government; Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); Division of Health Sciences","Funding used for the study and the preparation of this paper: Rajan Ragupathy completed this research as part of PhD study, during which he received an interest-free student loan from the NZ Government, a University of Otago School of Pharmacy stipend for living costs and course fees, and School of Pharmacy and Division of Health Sciences grants for attending conferences.

Objectives: This study aims to examine the impact of co-morbidity burden on EQ-5D index scores in a nationally representative sample of the US. Methods: The pooled 2001 and 2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was used. The total number of chronic conditions for each individual was calculated based on Clinical Classification Categories codes. Spline regression was used to identify nonlinear age effects: individuals were separated into four quartiles based on age. Censored least absolute deviation was used to regress EQ-5D index scores on age and chronic co-morbidity, controlling for income, gender, race, ethnicity, education, physical activity and smoking status. Interactions between age and chronic conditions were also explored. Results: The coefficients for chronic co-morbidities were highly statistically significant with large magnitudes for those with two or more chronic conditions (coefficient two chronic conditions = -0.16; coefficient nine chronic conditions = -0.28). After controlling for chronic co-morbidities and other confounders, age was not statistically significant except for those aged >58 years and the magnitude of this coefficient was very small (coefficient aged >58 years = -0.0006). The interactions between age and chronic comorbidity were significant, but the deleterious impact of their interaction was largely dominated by the existence and number of chronic conditions. Conclusions: Chronic conditions have a significant deleterious impact on EQ-5D index scores that is much more pronounced than age and other sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics. Future analyses and cost-utility models should incorporate the impact of multiple morbidity.","[Sullivan, Patrick W.] Regis Univ, Sch Pharm, Denver, CO 80221 USA; [Ghushchyan, Vahram H.] Univ Colorado, Sch Pharm, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Bayliss, Elizabeth A.] Kaiser Permanente, Inst Hlth Res, Denver, CO USA; [Bayliss, Elizabeth A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Family Med, Denver, CO 80202 USA",Regis University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; Kaiser Permanente; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Sullivan, PW (通讯作者)，Regis Univ, Sch Pharm, 3333 Regis Blvd,H-28, Denver, CO 80221 USA.",psulliva@regis.edu,,,National Institute on Aging [1R03AG027348-01],National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"Funding was provided by the National Institute on Aging (grant no. 1R03AG027348-01).

If a model is adequately specified, it should not leave interesting features of the data-generating process in the errors. Despite the common tradition, the importance of diagnostic checking as a safeguard against mis-specification has only recently been recognized by neural network (NN) practitioners, possibly because this type of semi-parametric methodology was not originally designed for economic and financial applications. The purpose of this paper is to compare a number of analytical statistical testing procedures suitable to diagnostic checking on a neural network regression model. We present the standard Lagrange multiplier (LM) testing framework designed under the assumption of identically distributed disturbances and also examine two modifications that are robust to heteroskedasticity in errors. One modification also gives the researcher an opportunity to incorporate information concerning the volatility structure of the data-generating process in the testing procedure. By means of a Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the performance of these tests under GARCH-type heteroskedasticity in errors and various distributional assumptions. The results show that although the primary concern of the researcher may be to design a regression model that accurately captures relations in the mean of the conditional distribution, developing a good approximation of the underlying volatility structure generally increases the efficiency of tests in detecting non-adequacy of a NN model.","[Thomaidis, Nikos S.; Dounias, Georgios D.] Univ Aegean, Dept Financial & Management Engn, Management & Decis Engn Lab, GR-82100 Chios, Greece",University of Aegean,"Thomaidis, NS (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Dept Financial & Management Engn, Management & Decis Engn Lab, 8 Michalon Str, GR-82100 Chios, Greece.",nthomaid@fme.aegean.gr,"Thomaidis, Nikos/AAF-1754-2020; Dounias, G/AFW-0818-2022","Thomaidis, Nikos/0000-0002-6796-6171;",Public Benefit Foundation; 'Empirikion' Foundation,Public Benefit Foundation; 'Empirikion' Foundation,"We would like to thank Jeffrey Wooldridge for useful remarks on the statistical procedures studied in this paper.

Traditionally, they were included in the numerator of a cost-effectiveness analysis, through either the human-capital or the friction-cost method. It has been argued, however, that productivity costs are already included in the denominator (i.e. in the QALY measure) because respondents consider the effect a given health state will have on their income when valuing health states. If that is the case, many previous economic evaluations might have double counted productivity costs by including them in both the numerator and the denominator. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine whether respondents valuing EQ-5D health states using the time trade-off (TTO) method spontaneously consider income effects, whether this consideration influences subsequent valuations and whether explicit ex post instructions influence valuations. Methods: Through an online survey, we asked 321 members of the Dutch general population to value four EQ-5D health states through three different TTO exercises. The first exercise was a standard TTO question. Respondents were then asked whether they had included income effects. Depending on their answer, the second TTO exercise instructed them to either include or exclude income effects. The third TTO exercise provided explicit information regarding the income loss associated with the health state. Results: Data were available from 321 members of the Dutch general public. Of these respondents, 49% stated they had spontaneously included income effects. Twenty-five percent of the sample did not trade any time in any of the TTO exercises and these respondents were excluded from the analysis. Results of t-tests showed there were only weakly significant differences in valuations for one health state between those who spontaneously included income effects and those who did not. Explicit instruction led to some significant differences at the aggregate level, but the effect was inconsistent at the individual level. When explicit information on the amount of income loss was provided, all states were valued lower when associated with a larger income loss. Conclusions: This study offers further evidence indicating that income losses do not significantly affect health state valuations.","[Tilling, Carl; Tsuchiya, Aki; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Krol, Marieke; van Exel, Job; Brouwer, Werner] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Krol, Marieke; van Exel, Job; Brouwer, Werner] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Sheffield,"Tilling, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",eca03cjt@googlemail.com,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023; Tsuchiya, Aki/A-2167-2010; van Exel, Job/E-6191-2013; Krol, Marieke/HGA-7950-2022","Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397; Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; van Exel, Job/0000-0002-4178-1777; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Krol, Marieke/0000-0002-6153-0828",Economic and Social Research Council,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"At the time the research was conducted, Carl Tilling was a PhD student funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.

Specifically, we determine the capital allocation that minimizes the excesses of sets of portfolios in a lexicographical sense. The excess of a set of portfolios is defined as the expected loss of that set of portfolios in excess of the amount of risk capital allocated to them. The underlying idea is that large excesses are undesirable, and therefore the goal is to determine the allocation for which the largest excess is as small as possible. We show that this allocation rule yields a unique allocation, and that it satisfies some desirable properties. We also show that the allocation can be determined by solving a series of linear programming problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The innovative feature of the model concerns the frequency of trading: rather than remaining constant over time, each agent in a group is only assumed to become active with a certain probability over a given market period. Depending on the trading strategy, part of this elementary kind of intrinsic noise is additive and another part is multiplicative. Using bootstrap and Monte Carlo methods, it is demonstrated that this combination can contribute to explaining the stylized facts of the daily returns on financial markets, such as volatility clustering, fat tails, and the autocorrelation patterns.","[Westerhoff, Frank] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany; [Franke, Reiner] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; University of Kiel,"Westerhoff, F (通讯作者)，Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany.",frank.westerhoff@uni-bamberg.de,"Westerhoff, Frank/GSN-6357-2022; Westerhoff, Frank/ABG-4984-2021; Westerhoff, Frank/F-2933-2015","Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103; Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103",,,,,33,20,20,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology provided within the manufacturer's submission to NICE. The ERG also independently searched for relevant evidence and modified the manufacturer's decision analytic model to examine the impact of altering some of the key assumptions. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from a phase III, multicentre, multinational, two-arm, randomized, open-label study with the primary objective of confirming the non-inferiority of oxaliplatin plus capecitabine (XELOX) compared with oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid (FOLFOX-4) in adult patients with histologically confirmed mCRC who had not previously been treated. The ERG considered that the NO 16966 trial was of reasonable methodological quality and demonstrated a significant improvement in both progression-free and overall survival when bevacizumab is added to either XELOX or FOLFOX-4. The ERG considered that the size of the actual treatment effect of bevacizumab was uncertain due to trial design limitations, imbalance of a known prognostic factor, relatively short treatment duration compared with that allowed within the trial protocol, and interpretation of the statistical analyses. The manufacturer's submission included a de novo economic evaluation using a cost-effectiveness model built in Microsoft (R) Excel. The ERG believed that the modelling structure employed was appropriate but highlighted several areas of uncertainty that had the potential to have a significant impact on the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The areas of uncertainty identified by the ERG included whether chemotherapy would be administered continuously or intermittently, patient access scheme (PAS) costs and uptake, survival that was dependent on the statistical analyses used, and the likely duration of continued treatment with bevacizumab after cessation of oxaliplatin and the efficacy associated with continuation. The STA described here highlighted the challenges in appraising interventions with a complex PAS. Based on the analyses that include a discount to the list price of oxaliplatin, the ERG concluded that the ICERs for the addition of bevacizumab to XELOX or FOLFOX were both over 50000 pound. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that bevacizumab in combination with oxaliplatin and either 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid or capecitabine (i.e. FOLFOX or XELOX) was not recommended for the treatment of mCRC.","[Whyte, Sophie; Pandor, Abdullah; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Whyte, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",Sophie.Whyte@shef.ac.uk,"Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [0821101],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 0821101) and will be published as part of a compendium of Evidence Review Group articles in Health Technology Assessment (HTA).

The aim of this systematic literature review was to describe the impact of HNC and its treatment on the physical, emotional, and social well-being of patients over time, by examining longitudinal studies of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) evaluating these domains. Databases (MEDLINE and Embase) were searched to identify studies published in English between January 2004 and January 2014 analyzing the humanistic aspects of HNC in adult patients. Additional relevant publications were identified through manual searches of abstracts from recent conference proceedings. Of 1,566 studies initially identified, 130 met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated in the assessment. Investigations using a variety of PRO instruments in heterogeneous patient populations consistently reported that PRO scores decrease significantly from diagnosis through the treatment period, but generally recover to baseline in the first year post-treatment. This trend was observed for many functional domains, although some side effects, such as xerostomia, persisted well beyond 1 year. In addition, considerable evidence exists that baseline PRO scores can predict clinical endpoints such as overall and progression-free survival. Many aspects of HNC, both disease and treatment specific, profoundly affect patients' quality of life. Improved knowledge of these effects on PRO may allow for more informed treatment decisions and can help physicians to better prepare patients for changes they may experience during therapy. Furthermore, the predictive value of baseline PRO data may enable healthcare providers to identify at-risk patients in need of more intensive intervention.","[Wissinger, Erika; Byrnes, Michael; Travers, Karin] Evidera, Lexington, MA USA; [Griebsch, Ingolf; Lungershausen, Juliane] Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH & Co KG, Ingelheim, Germany; [Pashos, Chris L.] Takeda Pharmaceut Int Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Evidera; Boehringer Ingelheim; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.","Pashos, CL (通讯作者)，Takeda Pharmaceut Int Inc, 40 Landsdowne St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",chris.pashos@takeda.com,"Griebsch, Ingolf/JRW-6501-2023",,Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH,Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH(Boehringer Ingelheim),"This research was funded in part by Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH.

In this paper, we generalize the Kirk [Managing Energy Price Risk, 1995] approximate formula for pricing a two-asset spread option to the case of a multi-asset basket-spread option. All the advantageous properties of being simple, accurate and efficient are preserved. As the final formula retains the same functional form as the Black-Scholes formula, all the basket-spread option Greeks are also derived in closed form. Numerical examples demonstrate that the pricing and hedging errors are in general less than 1% relative to the benchmark results obtained by numerical integration or Monte Carlo simulation with 10 million paths. An implicit correction method is further applied to reduce the pricing errors by factors of up to 100. The correction is governed by an unknown parameter, whose optimal value is found by solving a non-linear equation. Owing to its simplicity, the computing time for simultaneous pricing and hedging of basket-spread option with 10 underlying assets or less is kept below 1 ms. When compared against the existing approximation methods, the proposed basket-spread option formula coupled with the implicit correction turns out to be one of the most robust and accurate methods.","[Lau, Chun-Sing; Lo, Chi-Fai] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, North Sci Ctr, Dept Phys, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Lau, CS (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, North Sci Ctr, Dept Phys, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cslau@phy.cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,28,4,6,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We propose a theoretical model in which households, given a fixed investment in housing, allocate their net wealth across bank time deposits, stocks and mortgage. Besides considering housing as an indivisible and illiquid asset that restricts the portfolio choice decision, we take into account the financial constraints that households face when they apply for external funding. For every representative household in the EFF, we solve this theoretical problem and obtain the theoretically optimal portfolio that is then compared with households' actual choices. We find that households significantly under-invest in stocks and deposits while the optimal and actual mortgage investments agree. Considering the three types of financial assets at once, we find that the households headed by highly financially sophisticated, older, retired, richer, and unconstrained persons are the ones investing more efficiently.","[Mayordomo, Sergio; Rodriguez-Moreno, Maria] Univ Navarra, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Pamplona 31009, Spain; [Pena, Juan Ignacio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, Madrid 28903, Spain",University of Navarra; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Mayordomo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Edificio Amigos, Pamplona 31009, Spain.",smayordomo@unav.es,"R-Moreno, Maria Dolores/M-5732-2018; Pena, Juan Ignacio/I-3570-2015","Mayordomo, Sergio/0000-0001-8363-5500; Pena, Juan Ignacio/0000-0003-2435-3583",,,,,35,4,4,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In contrast to traditional participating or classical unit-linked life insurance products, the guarantee offered to the policyholders is achieved by a periodical rebalancing process between three funds: the policy reserves (i.e. the premium reserve stock, thus causing interaction effects with traditional participating life insurance contracts), a guarantee fund, and an equity fund. In this paper, we consider an insurer offering both, dynamic hybrid and traditional participating life insurance contracts and focus on the policyholders' perspective. The results show that higher guarantees do not necessarily imply a higher willingness-to-pay, but that in case of dynamic hybrid contracts, a minimum guarantee level should be offered in order to ensure that the willingness-to-pay exceeds the minimum premium the insurer has to charge when selling the contract. In addition, strong interaction effects can be found between the two products, which particularly impact the willingness-to-pay of the dynamic hybrids. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The preference parameters are estimated in two stages. We estimate conditional expectations nonparametrically in the first stage. Then, in the second stage, we estimate the preference parameters based on the maximum score estimator of Manski, using the choice data and first-stage estimates. This setting can be extended to maximum score estimation with nonparametrically generated regressors. In this paper, we establish consistency and derive the rate of convergence of the two-stage maximum score estimator. Moreover, we also provide sufficient conditions under which the two-stage estimator is asymptotically equivalent in distribution to the corresponding single-stage estimator that assumes the first-stage input is known. We also present some Monte Carlo simulation results for the finite-sample behaviour of the two-stage estimator.","[Chen, Le-Yu] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lee, Sokbae] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Sung, Myung Jae] Hongik Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 121791, South Korea",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Seoul National University (SNU); Hongik University,"Chen, LY (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",lychen@econ.sinica.edu.tw; sokbae@snu.ac.kr; mjaesung@hongik.ac.kr,"Lee, Sokbae/F-7514-2011","Lee, Sokbae/0000-0003-4080-7733","National Science Council of Taiwan [102-2410-H-001-012]; European Research Council [ERC-2009-StG-240910-ROMETA]; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2012-S1A3-A2033467]; 2014 Hongik University Research Fund; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1, ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I034021/1, ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI","National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); 2014 Hongik University Research Fund; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This work was in part supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan (102-2410-H-001-012), by the European Research Council (ERC-2009-StG-240910-ROMETA), by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2012-S1A3-A2033467) and by the 2014 Hongik University Research Fund.

For such preferences, we define relevant measures, show that they are treated as if they were the only marginals possibly governing the state space, and connect them with the measures appearing in the aforementioned representation. These results allow us to interpret relevant measures as reflecting part of perceived ambiguity, meaning subjective uncertainty about probabilities over states. Under mild conditions, we show that increases or decreases in ambiguity aversion cannot affect the relevant measures. This property, necessary for the conclusion that these measures reflect only perceived ambiguity, distinguishes the set of relevant measures from the leading alternative in the literature. We apply our findings to a number of well-known models of ambiguity-sensitive preferences.

However, the problem that different insured receive a different value for money is even increased by tax incentives. If enhanced annuities are introduced, the percentage of insured who should annuitize further increases.

We aimed to estimate cost effectiveness of the PINCER intervention by combining effectiveness in error reduction and intervention costs with the effect of the individual errors on patient outcomes and healthcare costs, to estimate the effect on costs and QALYs. We developed Markov models for each of six medication errors targeted by PINCER. Clinical event probability, treatment pathway, resource use and costs were extracted from literature and costing tariffs. A composite probabilistic model combined patient-level error models with practice-level error rates and intervention costs from the trial. Cost per extra QALY and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated from the perspective of NHS England, with a 5-year time horizon. The PINCER intervention generated A 2,679 pound less cost and 0.81 more QALYs per practice [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): -A 3,037 pound per QALY] in the deterministic analysis. In the probabilistic analysis, PINCER generated 0.001 extra QALYs per practice compared with simple feedback, at A 4.20 pound less per practice. Despite this extremely small set of differences in costs and outcomes, PINCER dominated simple feedback with a mean ICER of -A 3,936 pound (standard error A 2,970) pound. At a ceiling 'willingness-to-pay' of A 20,000 pound/QALY, PINCER reaches 59 % probability of being cost effective. PINCER produced marginal health gain at slightly reduced overall cost. Results are uncertain due to the poor quality of data to inform the effect of avoiding errors.","[Elliott, Rachel A.; Franklin, Matthew] Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharm, Div Social Res Med & Hlth, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Putman, Koen D.; Annemans, Lieven] Vrije Univ Brussel, Interuniv Ctr Hlth Econ Res, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium; [Annemans, Lieven; Verhaeghe, Nick] Univ Ghent, Interuniv Ctr Hlth Econ Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Eden, Martin] Univ Manchester, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Hayre, Jasdeep] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Manchester M1 4BT, Lancs, England; [Rodgers, Sarah; Avery, Anthony J.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Queens Med Ctr, Div Primary Care, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Sheikh, Aziz] Univ Edinburgh, eHlth Res Grp, Ctr Populat Hlth Sci, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sheikh, Aziz] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Primary Care, Boston, MA 02120 USA",University of Nottingham; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Ghent University; University of Manchester; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; University of Nottingham; University of Edinburgh; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Elliott, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharm, Div Social Res Med & Hlth, Univ Pk,East Dr, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",rachel.elliott@nottingham.ac.uk,"Sheikh, Aziz/D-2818-2009; Putman, Koen/ABG-6361-2021; Franklin, Matthew/J-8109-2019; Elliott, Rachel/P-5894-2018","Sheikh, Aziz/0000-0001-7022-3056; Franklin, Matthew/0000-0002-2774-9439; Elliott, Rachel/0000-0002-3650-0168; Eden, Martin/0000-0002-1542-2527; Avery, Anthony/0000-0001-7591-4438; Rodgers, Sarah/0000-0003-1676-1982; Putman, Koen/0000-0002-7235-3759",Patient Safety Research Program of the UK Department of Health; Commonwealth Fund; National Institute for Health Research [SPCR-042] Funding Source: researchfish,Patient Safety Research Program of the UK Department of Health; Commonwealth Fund; National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"Funding: Patient Safety Research Program of the UK Department of Health.; Aziz Sheikh is supported by The Commonwealth Fund, a private independent foundation based in New York City, NY, USA.

First, what is the relative importance of different linkages in causing global financial crises? The second question concerns whether or not investor behaviour affects contagion. I use a two-market agent-based model that incorporates insights from behavioural finance to answer these open questions. Simulated managers only affect contagion when they control a small proportion of the total assets in each market.

The model naturally extends the traditional fixed effects panel data regression model to allow for semiparametric effects. Multiple regression equations are permitted, and the model includes the aggregated partially linear model as a special case. A weighted profile least squares estimator for the parametric components is proposed and shown to be asymptotically more efficient than those neglecting the contemporaneous correlation. Furthermore, a weighted two-stage estimator for the nonparametric components is also devised and shown to be asymptotically more efficient than those based on individual regression equations. The asymptotic normality is established for estimators of both parametric and nonparametric components. The finite-sample performance of the proposed methods is evaluated by simulation studies.","[You, Jinhong] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xian] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Macquarie University,"You, JH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",jinhongyou@gmail.com,"zhou, xian/JYQ-9844-2024","Zhou, Xian/0000-0001-5807-9426",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11071154]; leading Academic Discipline Program; 211 Project for Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (the third phase); [B803],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); leading Academic Discipline Program(Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project); 211 Project for Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (the third phase);,"You's research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (11071154).

Fourier transform techniques are used to transform the partial differential equation to a corresponding ordinary differential equation whose solution can be readily found by using the integrating factor method. An integral expression of the American option written on any two assets is then obtained by applying Duhamel's principle.

This approach allows the actuary to include risk factors not only in the mean but also in other key parameters governing the claiming behavior, like the degree of residual heterogeneity or the no-claim probability. In this broader setting, the Negative Binomial regression with cell-specific heterogeneity and the zero-inflated Poisson regression with cell-specific additional probability mass at zero are applied to model claim frequencies. New models for claim severities that can be applied either per claim or aggregated per year are also presented. Bayesian inference is based on efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques and allows for the simultaneous estimation of linear effects as well as of possible nonlinear effects, spatial variations and interactions between risk factors within the data set. To illustrate the relevance of this approach, a detailed case study is proposed based on the Belgian motor insurance portfolio studied in Denuit and Lang (2004). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A special feature of the proposed criterion is that it takes into account the uncertainty in estimated common factors. The new criterion is based on estimating the predictive mean squared error in forecasting with correction for asymptotic bias. The resulting estimate of bias-corrected forecast-error is shown to be min{N, T root T} consistent. The proposed criterion is a natural extension of the traditional Akaike information criterion (AIC), but it does not require the distributional assumptions for the likelihood. Results of real data analysis and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed criterion works well in comparison with the commonly used AIC and Bayesian information criteria.","[Ando, Tomohiro] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Kohoku Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 223, Japan; [Tsay, Ruey S.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Keio University; University of Chicago,"Tsay, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ruey.tsay@chicagobooth.edu,,,"Inamori Foundation, Japan; Booth School of Business, University of Chicago","Inamori Foundation, Japan; Booth School of Business, University of Chicago(University of Chicago)","The authors would like to thank the co-editor and anonymous reviewers for constructive and helpful comments that improved the quality of the article considerably.

IQ is the key ingredient enabling inference about volatility and the presence of jumps in financial time series and is thus of considerable interest in applications. We document the significant empirical challenges for IQ estimation posed by commonly encountered data imperfections and set forth three complementary approaches for improving IQ-based inference. First, we show that many common deviations from the jump-diffusive null can be dealt with by a novel filtering scheme that generalizes truncation of individual returns to truncation of arbitrary functionals on return blocks. Second, we propose a new family of efficient robust neighborhood truncation (RNT) estimators for integrated power variation based on order statistics of a set of unbiased local power variation estimators on a block of returns. Third, we find that ratio-based inference, originally proposed in this context by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002, Journal of Applied Econometrics 17, 457-477), has desirable robustness properties in the face of regularly occurring data imperfections and thus is well suited for empirical applications.

More effective than standard non-biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (nbDMARDs), anti-TNFs are also substantially more expensive. Consequently, a number of model-based economic evaluations have been conducted to establish the relative cost-effectiveness of anti-TNFs. However, anti-TNFs are associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events (ADEs) such as serious infections relative to nbDMARDs. Such ADEs will likely impact on both the costs and consequences of anti-TNFs, for example, through hospitalisations and forced withdrawal from treatment. The aim of this review was to identify and critically appraise if, and how, ADEs have been incorporated into model-based cost-effectiveness analyses of anti-TNFs for adult patients with RA. A systematic literature review was performed. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid EMBASE; Web of Science; NHS Economic Evaluations Database) were searched for literature published between January 1990 and October 2013 using electronic search strategies. The reference lists of retrieved studies were also hand searched. In addition, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence technology appraisals were searched to identify economic models used to inform UK healthcare decision making. Only full economic evaluations that had used an economic model to evaluate biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) (including anti-TNFs) for adult patients with RA and had incorporated the direct costs and/or consequences of ADEs were critically appraised. To be included, studies also had to be available as a full text in English. Data extracted included general study characteristics and information concerning the methods used to incorporate ADEs and any associated assumptions made. The extracted data were synthesised using a tabular and narrative format. A total of 43 model-based economic evaluations of bDMARDs for adult RA were identified from 2,483 initially identified studies (2,473 published; ten technology appraisals). Of these, nine studies had incorporated the incidence and costs of ADEs and were critically reviewed. One study also explicitly estimated the potential consequences for patient utility. There was a general lack of detail specifically reporting on how ADEs were included in the economic models. Furthermore, there was substantial heterogeneity amongst the nine studies concerning the (i) application of risk-related terminology; (ii) method of incorporating the incidence, costs and consequences of ADEs; and (iii) ADE-related assumptions. Model-based economic evaluations have played an integral role in healthcare reimbursement and funding decisions relating to anti-TNFs for adult patients with RA. However, current economic models have not routinely or systematically considered the direct costs or consequences of ADEs, which may bias the estimates of the relative cost-effectiveness of anti-TNFs. Omitting information on relevant costs and consequences of interventions for RA will affect the validity of the associated recommendations for informed decision making. To improve current practice it is recommended that (i) greater efforts be made to provide appropriate long-term safety data on the use of anti-TNFs in adult RA; (ii) empirical research be undertaken to identify and quantify the impact of, and possible methods for, including ADEs in economic models to inform future good practice guidelines; and (iii) economic modelling guidelines and reference cases be updated to explicitly identify ADEs as an important treatment outcome and address how they might be incorporated into economic models. Improved consideration of the possible implications of ADEs in economic models will ensure that healthcare decision makers are provided with reliable and accurate information with which to make efficient reimbursement and financing decisions.","[Heather, Eleanor M.; Payne, Katherine; Harrison, Mark] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Symmons, Deborah P.

A small delta t expansion allows to compute explicitly this change of measure. Finally, a given European option's price is obtained as the expectation in P of the discounted payoff with a weight given by the change of measure dQ/dP. This procedure is implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation, and allows to compute the option prices, without further adjustable parameters. The computed implied volatility surfaces are compared with empirical surfaces based on European put and call options on the SP500 from 1996 to 2010. Our pricing scheme is able to reproduce the level, the smile, the smirk and the term structure of the surfaces, without any calibration on the observed option prices. We discuss the respective roles of the P and Q measures, the distribution of the terminal prices in both measures, the small impact of the risk aversion and drift premium, and finally we suggest simplifications of our pricing scheme for practical purposes.","[Fernandez, Luis] Argentiere Capital AG, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland",,"Zumbach, G (通讯作者)，Ch Charles Baudouin 8, CH-1228 Saconnex Darve, Switzerland.",gilles.zumbach@bluewin.ch,,,,,,,16,3,3,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Although the shape of membership functions has an important effect on the forecasting performance, piecewise crisp membership functions are used in all of these models without showing any plausible reason. Therefore, the forecasting is performed by using interval arithmetic operations instead of fuzzy inference. In this study, a new fuzzy time series model is proposed. In this model, triangular and trapezoidal membership functions are used instead of classical piecewise crisp membership functions and the forecasting is performed by using Mamdani-type fuzzy inference with centroid defuzzification. The validation and effectiveness of the proposed model is shown through the example on the forecast of the enrollments of the University of Alabama. The results show that the proposed model has smaller forecasting mean square error value than two main time series models.","[Basyigit, Ali Ihsan; Guzelkaya, Mujde] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Control Engn, TR-80626 Istanbul, Turkey; [Ulu, Cenk] TUBITAK Marmara Res Ctr, Energy Inst, Kocaeli, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University; Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK),"Basyigit, AI (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Control Engn, TR-80626 Istanbul, Turkey.",basyigita@itu.edu.tr; cenk.ulu@tubitak.gov.tr; guzelkaya@itu.edu.tr,"Guzelkaya, Mujde/ABB-1041-2020; ULU, Cenk/A-4369-2019","Guzelkaya, Mujde/0000-0002-4150-4278;",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,634,644,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600073,0

Therefore, instead of matching single isolated events, we focus on understanding the relationships between the events and analyzing them as a sequence of events. Global templates are proposed to recognize a sequence of events first, and then, local templates are used to detect the single events that compose the recognized event-sequence. The proposed approach improves the accuracy of the recognition process and helps in detecting the events that have very simple patterns. The experimental results on real drilling data show the feasibility and the effectiveness of the approach. Moreover, it shows that this approach enables highly accurate recognition process.","[Esmael, Bilal; Arnaout, Arghad; Zoellner, Philipp] TDE Grp GmbH, A-8700 Leoben, Austria; [Thonhauser, Gerhard] Univ Leoben, A-8700 Leoben, Austria",University of Leoben,"Esmael, B (通讯作者)，TDE Grp GmbH, A-8700 Leoben, Austria.",Bilal.Esmael@tde.at; Arghad.Arnaout@tde.at; Philipp.Zoellner@tde.at; Gerhard.Thonhauser@unileoben.ac.at,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,606,619,,,,,,14,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600070,0

Given a set of random processes, the objective is to determine whether one is influenced by the others. For easy interpretation, the system is represented as a connected graph, where nodes indicate the individual time series and directed edges represent causal connections. Interdependence relations can be detected through the fitting of multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models. However, because of inadequacy of data, this may lead to a representation that is difficult for both interpretation and prediction. In this paper, we propose a new technique that uses a frequency domain Lasso approach to detect causal connections. This method keeps the resulting graph sparse by preserving only the most significant edges, and is demonstrated to be a better alternative for long memory processes, compared to the group Lasso technique.","[Gupta, Syamantak Datta; Mazumdar, Ravi R.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Gupta, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",,"Mazumdar, Ravi/ABA-7443-2020","Mazumdar, Ravi/0000-0002-0968-0925",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,946,957,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600108,0

In each stage, a final-good producer contracts with a distinct supplier for the procurement of a customized stage-specific component. Our model yields a sharp characterization for the optimal allocation of ownership rights along the value chain. We show that the incentive to integrate suppliers varies systematically with the relative position (upstream versus downstream) at which the supplier enters the production line. Furthermore, the nature of the relationship between integration and downstreamness depends crucially on the elasticity of demand faced by the final-good producer. Our model readily accommodates various sources of asymmetry across final-good producers and across suppliers within a production line, and we show how it can be taken to the data with international trade statistics. Combining data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Related Party Trade database and estimates of U.S. import demand elasticities from Broda and Weinstein (2006), we find empirical evidence broadly supportive of our key predictions.

Availability, price and affordability of medicines are likely to affect access. Very few studies have included asthma medicines, particularly inhaled corticosteroids, in these countries. Reflections about international reference prices (IRPs) are generally absent from pricing studies, yet some IRPs may be masking the extent of access problems. Our objective was to determine the availability, pricing and affordability of beclometasone, budesonide and salbutamol, the three asthma medicines on the World Health Organization's Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) in selected low- and middle-income countries and to reflect on the appropriateness of using IRPs. A cross-sectional pricing survey was conducted in 52 countries. Data were collected on country demographics including national currency, $US exchange rate and daily wage of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker. Pricing and availability data were collected for salbutamol, beclometasone and budesonide in two private retail pharmacies, the national procurement centre and a main public hospital. Availability was particularly poor for corticosteroids, and worse in national procurement centres and main hospitals. The surveyed strength of beclometasone was only on the EML of ten countries. Considerable variability was found in pricing and affordability across countries. Procurement systems appeared largely inefficient when Asthma Drug Facility prices were applied as references. Some countries appear to be subsidising asthma medicines, making them free or less expensive for patients, while other countries are applying very high margins, which can significantly increase the price for patients unless a reimbursement system exists. Findings raise important policy concerns. Availability of inhaled corticosteroids is poor; many EMLs are not updated; IRPs can be misleading; health systems and patients are paying more than necessary for asthma medicines, which are unaffordable for many patients in many countries.","[Babar, Zaheer-Ud-Din; Lessing, Charon] Univ Auckland, Sch Pharm, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Mace, Cecile; Bissell, Karen] Int Union TB & Lung Dis, Paris, France; [Bissell, Karen] Univ Auckland, Sch Populat Hlth, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland; University of Auckland,"Babar, ZUD (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Sch Pharm, Private Mail Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",z.babar@auckland.ac.nz,"Bissell, Karen/ABB-2734-2020","Bissell, Karen/0000-0002-2026-6311; lessing, charon/0000-0002-3841-0334",International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support of data collectors in all countries that provided data.

In this article, we develop modeling and inference tools for counterfactual distributions based on regression methods. The counterfactual scenarios that we consider consist of ceteris paribus changes in either the distribution of covariates related to the outcome of interest or the conditional distribution of the outcome given covariates. For either of these scenarios, we derive joint functional central limit theorems and bootstrap validity results for regression-based estimators of the status quo and counterfactual outcome distributions. These results allow us to construct simultaneous confidence sets for function-valued effects of the counterfactual changes, including the effects on the entire distribution and quantile functions of the outcome as well as on related functionals. These confidence sets can be used to test functional hypotheses such as no-effect, positive effect, or stochastic dominance. Our theory applies to general counterfactual changes and covers the main regression methods including classical, quantile, duration, and distribution regressions. We illustrate the results with an empirical application to wage decompositions using data for the United States. As a part of developing the main results, we introduce distribution regression as a comprehensive and flexible tool for modeling and estimating the entire conditional distribution. We show that distribution regression encompasses the Cox duration regression and represents a useful alternative to quantile regression. We establish functional central limit theorems and bootstrap validity results for the empirical distribution regression process and various related functionals.","[Chernozhukov, Victor] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fernandez-Val, Ivan] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Melly, Blaise] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Boston University; University of Bern,"Chernozhukov, V (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",vchern@mit.edu; ivanf@bu.edu; blaise.melly@vwi.unibe.ch,"Melly, Blaise S/A-9225-2010; Fernandez-Val, Ivan/G-3455-2016","Melly, Blaise/0000-0001-9592-8749","National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1060889] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1061841] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This paper replaces the earlier independent projects started in 2005, Inference on Counterfactual Distributions Using Conditional Quantile Models by Chernozhukov and Fernandez-Val, and Estimation of Counterfactual Distributions Using Quantile Regression by Melly.

We find that most of the factors affecting the size of the bid-ask spread for covered warrants are common to those affecting the bid-ask spread of regular options (such as hedging costs and order processing costs). However, we also find two results that are specific to covered warrants. First, competition among warrant issuers does not play an important role in reducing covered warrant bid-ask spread. Second, warrant market makers set the bid-ask spread taking into account the risk of trading with scalpers. We estimate quantile regressions to check whether the relations between the covered warrant bid-ask spread and explanatory variables depend on the size of the spread and to check whether results are robust to outliers. We find that the coefficient associated with hedging costs increases considerably as the size of the bid-ask spread increases, implying that a change in the hedging costs affects more warrants with wide bid-ask spread than warrants with tight bid-ask spread.","[Petrella, Giovanni] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Sch Banking Finance & Insurance, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Segara, Reuben] Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Sydney,"Petrella, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Sch Banking Finance & Insurance, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",giovanni.petrella@unicatt.it,"Segara, Reuben/JHU-1131-2023",,,,,,21,2,2,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Around a third of the candlestick rules outperform the buy-and-hold strategy at the conservative Bonferroni level. After adjusting for trading costs, however, just a few rules remain profitable. When we correct for data snooping by applying the SSPA test on double-or-out market timing strategies, no single candlestick rule beats the buy-and-hold strategy after transaction costs. We also design fully automated trading systems by combining the best-performing candlestick rules. No evidence of out-performance is found after transaction costs. Although Japanese candlesticks can somewhat predict intra-day returns on large US caps, we show that such predictive power is too limited for active portfolio management to outperform the buy-and-hold strategy when luck, risk, and trading costs are correctly measured.","[Duvinage, Matthieu] UMons, TCTS Lab, Fac Polytech Mons FPMs, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Mazza, Paolo; Petitjean, Mikael] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Sch Management, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Petitjean, Mikael] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-7000 Mons, Belgium",University of Mons; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Duvinage, M (通讯作者)，UMons, TCTS Lab, Fac Polytech Mons FPMs, 20 Pl Parc, B-7000 Mons, Belgium.",matthieu.duvinage@umons.ac.be,,,,,,,22,11,17,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The resulting dynamics of the surface is static in the moneyness direction, and given by a volatility forecast in the time-to-maturity direction. This difference is the basis of a cross-product approximation of the surface. The subsequent speed-up for option pricing is large, allowing the computation of Greeks and the delta replication strategy in simulations with the cost of replication and the replication risk. The corresponding premia are added to the option arbitrage price in order to compute realistic implied volatility surfaces. Finally, the cross-product approximation for realistic prices can be used to analyse European options on the SP500 in depth. The cross-product approximation is used to compute a mean quotient implied volatility, which can be compared with the full theoretical computation. The comparison shows that the cost of hedging and the replication risk premium have contributions to the implied volatility smile that are of similar magnitude to the contribution from the process for the underlying asset.","[Zumbach, Gilles] Consulting Financial Res, CH-1228 Saconnex Darve, Switzerland; [Fernandez, Luis] JP Morgan, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zumbach, Gilles; Fernandez, Luis] Swissquote Bank, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland",,"Zumbach, G (通讯作者)，Consulting Financial Res, Ch Charles Baudouin 8, CH-1228 Saconnex Darve, Switzerland.",gilles.zumbach@bluewin.ch; luis.fernandez.lf@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

There is special attention to a widely employed semiparametric shape restriction, which requires the threshold-crossing function to be a monotone function of a linear index involving the observable explanatory variables. The restriction brings great computational benefits, allowing calculation of the identified set of index coefficients without calculating the nonparametrically specified threshold function. With the restriction in place, the methods of the paper can be applied to produce identified sets in a class of binary response models with mismeasured explanatory variables.","[Chesher, Andrew] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Chesher, A (通讯作者)，UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",andrew.chesher@ucl.ac.uk,,,"UK Economic and Social Research Council [RES-589-28-0001]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1, ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F015879/1, ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the UK Economic and Social Research Council through a grant (RES-589-28-0001) to the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (CeMMAP).,,30,6,6,1,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Going beyond a simple re-interpretation' of the multi-currency LMM, issues arising in the application of the model to actual commodity market data are specifically addressed. Firstly, liquid market prices are only available for options on commodity futures, rather than forwards, thus the difference between forward and futures prices must be explicitly taken into account in the calibration. Secondly, we construct a procedure to achieve a consistent fit of the model to market data for interest options, commodity options and historically estimated correlations between interest rates and commodity prices.

Cadets at USMA can increase their branch priorities at a fraction of slots by extending their service agreement. This real-life matching problem fills an important gap in the market design literature, providing strong empirical legitimacy to a series of elegant theoretical works on matching with contracts. Although priorities fail a key substitutes condition, the agent-optimal stable mechanism is well defined, and in contrast to the current USMA mechanism it is fair, stable, strategy-proof, and respects improvements in cadet priorities. Adoption of this mechanism benefits cadets and the Army. This new application shows that the matching with contracts model is practically relevant beyond traditional domains that satisfy the substitutes condition.","[Soenmez, Tayfun] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Switzer, Tobias B.] USAF, Hurlburt Field, FL 32544 USA",Boston College; United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force,"Sönmez, T (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",sonmezt@bc.edu; tobias.switzer@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,84,106,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2013,81.0,2,,,,,451,488,,10.3982/ECTA10570,0.0,,,38,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,112YO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316631600001,0

We consider the case where (i) the list of feasible coalitions (those coalitions which are permitted to form) is given in advance; and (ii) each individual's preference is a ranking over those feasible coalitions which include this individual. We are interested in requiring the mechanism to guarantee each coalition the right of forming that coalition at least when every member of the coalition ranks the coalition at the top. We name this property coalitional unanimity. We examine the compatibility between coalitional unanimity and incentive requirements, and prove that if the mechanism is strategy-proof and respects coalitional unanimity, then for each preference profile, there exists at most one strictly core stable partition, and the mechanism chooses such a partition whenever available. Further, the mechanism is coalition strategy-proof and respects coalitional unanimity if, and only if, the strictly core stable partition uniquely exists for every preference profile.","Niigata Univ, Fac Econ, Nishi Ku, Niigata 9502181, Japan",Niigata University,"Takamiya, K (通讯作者)，Niigata Univ, Fac Econ, Nishi Ku, 8050 2 No Cho Ikarashi, Niigata 9502181, Japan.",takamiya@econ.niigata-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [21730155, 23730188]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23730188, 21730155] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author is very thankful to the editors in charge and two anonymous referees for their various suggestions which have improved this paper.

First, it is computationally costly because estimation requires optimising a non-differentiable objective function which is a formidable numerical task, specially with many number of observations and regressors. Second, it is controversial because standard asymptotic inference requires the choice of smoothing parameters and different choices may lead to different conclusions. Bootstrap methods solve the latter problem at the price of enlarging the former. We give a theoretical justification for a new inference method consisting of the construction of asymptotic pivots based on a small number of bootstrap replications. The procedure still avoids smoothing and reduces usual bootstrap methods' computational cost. We show its usefulness to draw inferences on linear or non-linear functions of the parameters of quantile regression models.","[Aguirre, Victor M.] Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Dept Stat, Mexico City 01080, DF, Mexico; [Dominguez, Manuel A.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Cuantitat, Madrid 28223, Spain",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Complutense University of Madrid,"Aguirre, VM (通讯作者)，Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Dept Stat, Rio Hondo 1, Mexico City 01080, DF, Mexico.",aguirre@itam.mx; madt@ccee.ucm.es,"Aguirre, Victor M./J-1050-2019","Aguirre, Victor M./0000-0001-6709-701X",Asociacion Mexicana de la Cultura A.C.; Mexico's National Council of Science and Technology CONACYT [51559]; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Espana [SEJ2007-62908ECON],Asociacion Mexicana de la Cultura A.C.; Mexico's National Council of Science and Technology CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Espana,"Victor Aguirre gratefully acknowledges support from Asociacion Mexicana de la Cultura A.C. and Mexico's National Council of Science and Technology CONACYT, project 51559.

These are early exercisable contracts that give the protection buyer or seller the right to step-up, step-down, or cancel the swap position. The pricing problem is formulated under a structural credit risk model based on Levy processes. This leads to the analytic and numerical studies of several optimal stopping problems subject to early termination due to default. In a general spectrally negative Levy model, we rigorously derive the optimal exercise strategy. This allows for instant computation of the credit spread under various specifications. Numerical examples are provided to examine the impacts of default risk and contractual features on the credit spread and exercise strategy.","[Leung, Tim] Columbia Univ, IEOR Dept, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Yamazaki, Kazutoshi] Osaka Univ, Ctr Study Finance & Insurance, Toyonaka, Osaka 5608531, Japan",Columbia University; Osaka University,"Leung, T (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, IEOR Dept, New York, NY 10027 USA.",leung@ieor.columbia.edu,"Leung, Tim/O-5649-2019; Leung, Tim/G-8480-2012","Leung, Tim/0000-0002-0023-6289; Yamazaki, Kazutoshi/0000-0002-7401-2157","NSF [DMS-0908295]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [22710143]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [2271014]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22710143, 23310103] Funding Source: KAKEN","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank Professor Goran Peskir and the anonymous referees for reading the draft and for their helpful remarks and suggestions.

Maximum likelihood (ML) is the most widely employed method despite the fact that it is only consistent under the Gaussian or the true density, and usually involves convergence problems. Alternatively, the method of moments (MM) is a natural and straightforward procedure, although positivity is only guaranteed in the asymptotic expansion. We show an example for estimating daily returns of the Dow Jones Index with a very long data set, illustrating that both ML and MM yield similar outcomes. Therefore the MM applied to GC densities should be considered as an accurate tool for risk management and forecasting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

By the end of 2011, with the sovereign credit crisis, these spreads were again significant. In this paper we study the valuation of LIBOR interest rate derivatives in a multiple-curve setup, which accounts for the spreads between a risk-free discount curve and LIBOR curves. Towards this end we resort to a defaultable HJM methodology, in which these spreads are explained by an implied default intensity of the LIBOR contributing banks, possibly in conjunction with an additional liquidity factor. Markovian short rate specifications are given in the form of an extended CIR and a Levy Hull-White model for a risk-free short rate and a LIBOR short spread. The use of Levy drivers leads to the more parsimonious specification. Numerical values of the FRA spreads and the basis swap spreads computed with the latter largely cover the ranges of values observed even at the peak of the 2007-2009 crisis.","[Crepey, Stephane; Grbac, Zorana; Hai-Nam Nguyen] Univ Evry Val Essonne, Lab Anal & Probabilites, F-91037 Evry, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Crepéy, S (通讯作者)，Univ Evry Val Essonne, Lab Anal & Probabilites, F-91037 Evry, France.",stephane.crepey@univ-evry.fr,,,Chaire Risque de credi; Federation Bancaire Francaise; DGE,Chaire Risque de credi; Federation Bancaire Francaise; DGE,"The research of the authors benefited from the support of the 'Chaire Risque de credit', Federation Bancaire Francaise, and of the DGE.

Weak identification arises from the presence of a loading coefficient for the nonlinear function that may be close to zero. In that case, standard nonlinear cointegrating limit theory does not provide good approximations to the finite-sample distributions of nonlinear least squares estimators, resulting in potentially misleading inference. A new local limit theory is developed that approximates the finite-sample distributions of the estimators uniformly well irrespective of the strength of the identification. An important technical component of this theory involves new results showing the uniform weak convergence of sample covariances involving nonlinear functions to mixed normal and stochastic integral limits. Based on these asymptotics, we construct confidence intervals for the loading coefficient and the nonlinear transformation parameter and show that these confidence intervals have correct asymptotic size. As in other cases of nonlinear estimation with integrated processes and unlike stationary process asymptotics, the properties of the nonlinear transformations affect the asymptotics and, in particular, give rise to parameter dependent rates of convergence and differences between the limit results for integrable and asymptotically homogeneous functions.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Almost all existing structural change tests in econometrics are designed to detect abrupt breaks. Little attention has been paid to smooth structural changes, which may be more realistic in economics. We propose a consistent test for smooth structural changes as well as abrupt structural breaks with known or unknown change points. The idea is to estimate smooth time-varying parameters by local smoothing and compare the fitted values of the restricted constant parameter model and the unrestricted time-varying parameter model. The test is asymptotically pivotal and does not require prior information about the alternative. A simulation study highlights the merits of the proposed test relative to a variety of popular tests for structural changes. In an application, we strongly reject the stability of univariate and multivariate stock return prediction models in the postwar and post-oil-shocks periods.","[Chen, Bin] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Hong, Yongmiao] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Hong, Yongmiao] Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Hong, Yongmiao] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ WISE, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Hong, Yongmiao] Xiamen Univ, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",University of Rochester; Cornell University; Cornell University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Chen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",bchen8@mail.rochester.edu; yh20@cornell.edu,,"Hong, Yongmiao/0000-0002-9711-9061; Chen, Bin/0000-0001-7201-2359","department of economics, University of Rochester; National Science Foundation of China","department of economics, University of Rochester; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This paper is based on Chen's job market paper titled Testing for Smooth Structural Changes in Time Series Econometric Models via Local Linear Regression.

I derive bounds on structural price elasticities that are a function of the observed effect of a price change on demand, the size of the price change, and the degree of frictions. The degree of frictions is measured by the utility losses agents tolerate to deviate from the frictionless optimum. The bounds imply that frictions affect intensive margin elasticities much more than extensive margin elasticities. I apply these bounds to the literature on labor supply. The utility costs of ignoring the tax changes used to identify intensive margin labor supply elasticities are typically less than 1% of earnings. As a result, small frictions can explain the differences between micro and macro elasticities, extensive and intensive margin elasticities, and other disparate findings. Pooling estimates from existing studies, I estimate a Hicksian labor supply elasticity of 0.33 on the intensive margin and 0.25 on the extensive margin after accounting for frictions.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Harvard University,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",chetty@fas.harvard.edu,,,NSF [SES 0645396]; Sloan Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

However, little attention has been given to how changing public investment in CER may affect private manufacturers' incentives for CER, which has long been a major source of CER. In this work, based on a simple revenue maximizing economic framework, we generate predictions on thresholds to invest in CER for a private manufacturer that compares its own product to a competitor's product in head-to-head trials. Our analysis shows that private incentives to invest in CER are determined by how the results of CER may affect the price and quantity of the product sold and the duration over which resulting changes in revenue would accrue, given the time required to complete CER and the time from the completion of CER to the time of patent expiration. We highlight the result that private incentives may often be less than public incentives to invest in CER and may even be negative if the likelihood of adverse findings is sufficient. We find that these incentives imply a number of predictions about patterns of CER and how they will be affected by changes in public financing of CER and CER methods. For example, these incentives imply that incumbent patent holders may be less likely to invest in CER than entrants and that public investments in CER may crowd out similar private investments. In contrast, newer designs and methods for CER, such as Bayesian adaptive trials, which can reduce ex post risk of unfavourable results and shorten the time for the production of CER, may increase the expected benefits of CER and may tend to increase private investment in CER as long as the costs of such innovative designs are not excessive. Bayesian approaches to design also naturally highlight the dynamic aspects of CER, allowing less expensive initial studies to guide decisions about future investments and thereby encouraging greater initial investments in CER. However, whether the potential effects we highlight of public funding of CER and of Bayesian approaches to trial design actually produce changes in private investment in CER remains an empirical question.","[Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, PORPP, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Basu, Anirban] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Meltzer, David] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Meltzer, David] Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Basu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357660, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",basua@uw.edu,"Meltzer, David/C-2926-2009","Meltzer, David/0000-0003-2790-7393",PACE (Pragmatic Approaches to Comparative Effectiveness) Initiative; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH083706]; National Cancer Institute [RC4CA155809],PACE (Pragmatic Approaches to Comparative Effectiveness) Initiative; National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"The authors are grateful for comments from Bryan Luce, Sean Sullivan and two anonymous reviewers on earlier versions of the paper.

Clinicians and policy makers have several options for reducing morbidity and mortality related to HCV infection, including preventing new infections, screening high-risk populations, and optimizing uptake and delivery of antiviral therapy. Cost-effectiveness analyses provide an estimate of the value for money associated with adopting healthcare interventions. Our objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of hepatitis C interventions (prevention, screening, treatment) targeting substance users and other groups with a high proportion of substance users. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, HealthSTAR and EconLit, and the grey literature. Studies were critically appraised using the Drummond and Jefferson, Neumann et al. and Philips et al. checklists. We developed and applied a quality appraisal instrument specific to cost-effectiveness analyses of HCV interventions. In addition, we summarized cost-effectiveness estimates using a single currency and year (SUS, year 2009 values). Results: Twenty-one economic evaluations were included, which addressed prevention (three), screening (ten) and treatment (eight). The quality of the analyses varied greatly. A significant proportion did not incorporate important aspects of HCV natural history, disease costs and antiviral therapy. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from dominant (less costly and more effective) to $US603 352 per QALY. However, many ICERs were less than $US100 000 per QALY. Screening and treatment interventions involving pegylated interferon and ribavirin were generally cost effective at the SUS 100 000 per QALY threshold, with the exception of some subgroups, such as immune compromised patients with genotype 1 infections. Conclusions: No clear consensus emerged from the studies demonstrating that prevention, screening or treatment provides better value for money as each approach can be economically attractive in certain subgroups. More high-quality economic evaluations of preventing, identifying and treating HCV infection in substance users are needed.","[John-Baptiste, Ava; Yeung, Man Wah; Leung, Victoria; van der Velde, Gabrielle; Krahn, Murray] Univ Toronto, Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment THETA Coll, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada; [John-Baptiste, Ava; Yeung, Man Wah; Leung, Victoria; Krahn, Murray] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [John-Baptiste, Ava; Krahn, Murray] Univ Toronto, Dept Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [John-Baptiste, Ava; Krahn, Murray] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; [John-Baptiste, Ava] Womens Coll, Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [van der Velde, Gabrielle] Inst Work & Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Krahn, Murray] Univ Toronto, Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; University of Toronto; Women's College Research Institute; Institute for Work & Health; University of Toronto,"John-Baptiste, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment THETA Coll, 144 Coll St,6th Floor,Room 658, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada.",a.john.baptiste@gmail.com,,"Krahn, Murray/0000-0001-5836-397X; John-Baptiste, Ava/0000-0001-6108-1105","National Canadian Research Training Programme in Hepatitis C; Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Canada Graduate Scholarship; Canadian Liver Foundation; Team Grant from the CIHR Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes [OTG-88591]; Cancer Care Ontario; Ontario Institute for Cancer Research; Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care; Ministry of Research and Innovation of the Government of Ontario; F.

Using surrogate data analysis and the mutual prediction method of testing for nonlinear interdependence, it is feasible for an analyst, with a scant knowledge of the underlying dynamics of two dynamical systems, to show whether or not the systems are interdependent. This study applies these techniques in testing for nonlinear interdependence of three Chinese stock markets: Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. The empirical results of the present study indicate that the stock market series are nonlinear and that the Chinese stock exchanges are nonlinearly interdependent. Specifically, the evidence indicates that Shanghai and Shenzhen markets are bi-directionally interdependent, while Shanghai and Hong Kong as well as Shenzhen and Hong Kong markets are unidirectionally interdependent, with the direction of interdependence going from the mainland's markets to the Hong Kong market.","[Soofi, Abdol S.] Univ Wisconsin Platteville, Dept Econ, Platteville, WI 53818 USA; [Li, Zhe; Hui, Xiaofeng] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Platteville; Harbin Institute of Technology,"Soofi, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Platteville, Dept Econ, Platteville, WI 53818 USA.",soofi@uwplatt.edu,"Hui, XIAO/GZH-2322-2022","Soofi, Abdol/0000-0002-1869-4958",National Natural Science Foundation of China [70773028],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are grateful to Lianqyue Cao, Alexander Balanov, and the anonymous referees for their helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

This paper examines how such information frictions affect trade. Using data on regional agricultural trade in the Philippines, I first document a number of observed patterns in trade flows and prices that suggest the presence of information frictions. I then incorporate information frictions into a perfect competition trade model by embedding a process whereby heterogeneous producers engage in a costly sequential search process to determine where to sell their produce. I show that introducing information frictions reconciles the theory with the observed patterns in the data. Structural estimation of the model finds that information frictions are quantitatively important: roughly half the observed regional price dispersion is due to information frictions. Furthermore, incorporating information frictions improves the out-of-sample predictive power of the model.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Allen, T (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2003 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",treb.allen@northwestern.edu,,"Allen, Treb/0009-0007-2501-3800",National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I am extremely grateful to Costas Arkolakis, David Atkin, Penny Goldberg, Mark Rosenzweig, and Chris Udry for their substantial guidance and support throughout this project.

Economic evaluations provide insight into the value of healthcare, taking into account cost, quality, and benefits of particular treatments. Our objectives were to systematically review the existing literature to identify economic evaluations of GERD management strategies, to assess the scientific quality of these reports, and to summarize the economic outcomes of these evaluations. We identified economic evaluations and cost studies of GERD management strategies by searching PubMed and the UK NHS Economic Evaluation Database via the Cochrane Library. Searching was restricted to articles in English-language journals from July 2003 to July 2013. Cost-identification articles were excluded from the final analysis. Eighteen articles were included in the final analysis; 61 % of these met all criteria for quality reporting. Overall, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy was preferred (most effective and least costly) as empiric therapy for patients with reflux symptoms, except in patient populations with high Helicobacter pylori prevalence (> 40 %). Initial empiric PPI therapy (vs. initial endoscopy stratification or H. pylori testing) is likely the most cost-effective initial strategy for patients with typical GERD symptoms. Surgery may be cost effective in patients with chronic GERD symptoms at time horizons of 3-10 years. Endoscopic anti-reflux procedures were not cost effective based on available data. Further economic evaluations should adhere to standard reporting measures of cost estimates and outcomes, and should attempt to account for and compare the large heterogeneity of patient phenotypes and treatment effects seen with anti-reflux therapies.","[Gawron, Andrew J.; Pandolfino, John E.; Howden, Colin W.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Gawron, Andrew J.; French, Dustin D.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Ctr Healthcare Studies, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [French, Dustin D.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine,"Gawron, AJ (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, 750 N Lake Shore Dr,10th Floor, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",agawron@northwestern.edu,"Gawron, Andrew/H-4479-2013; French, Dustin D/JQJ-5272-2023","French, Dustin D/0000-0003-4064-3206","National Research Service Award at the Institute for Healthcare studies under Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [T-32 HS 000078]; Public Health Service [R01 DK079902, R01 DK092217]",National Research Service Award at the Institute for Healthcare studies under Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; Public Health Service(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service),"Financial support Dr. Gawron was previously supported by a National Research Service Award postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Healthcare studies under an institutional award from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, T-32 HS 000078 (PI: Jane L.

It also gives theoretical foundations to a generic framework for real-time trading analysis. The common acronym for investigating the causes of bad and good performance of trading is transaction cost analysis Rosenthal [Performance Metrics for Algorithmic Traders, 2009]). Automated algorithms take care of most of the traded flows on electronic markets (more than 70% in the US, 45% in Europe and 35% in Japan in 2012). Academic literature provides different ways to formalize these algorithms and show how optimal they can be from a mean-variance (like in Almgren and Chriss [J. Risk, 2000, 3(2), 5-39]), a stochastic control (e. g. Gueant et al. [Math. Financ. Econ., 2013, 7(4), 477-507]), an impulse control (see Bouchard et al. [SIAM J. Financ. Math., 2011, 2(1), 404-438]) or a statistical learning (as used in Laruelle et al. [Math. Financ. Econ., 2013, 7(3), 359-403]) viewpoint. This paper is agnostic about the way the algorithm has been built and provides a theoretical formalism to identify in real-time the market conditions that influenced its efficiency or inefficiency. For a given set of characteristics describing the market context, selected by a practitioner, we first show how a set of additional derived explanatory factors, called anomaly detectors, can be created for each market order (following for instance Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor [An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods, 2000]). We then will present an online methodology to quantify how this extended set of factors, at any given time, predicts (i.e. have influence, in the sense of predictive power or information defined in Basseville and Nikiforov [Detection of Abrupt Changes: Theory and Application, 1993], Shannon [Bell Syst. Tech. J., 1948, 27, 379-423] and Alkoot and Kittler [Pattern Recogn. Lett., 1999, 20(11), 1361-1369]) which of the orders are underperforming while calculating the predictive power of this explanatory factor set. Armed with this information, which we call influence analysis, we intend to empower the order monitoring user to take appropriate action on any affected orders by re-calibrating the trading algorithms working the order through new parameters, pausing their execution or taking over more direct trading control. Also we intend that use of this method can be taken advantage of to automatically adjust their trading action in the post trade analysis of algorithms.","[Azencott, R.] Univ Houston, Dept Math, Houton, TX USA; [Azencott, R.] Ecole Normale Super, Cachan, France; [Beri, A.] Ohio State Univ, Math Biosci Inst, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Gadhyan, Y.] Univ Delhi, Cluster Innovat Ctr, Delhi 110007, India; [Joseph, N.] Credit Agricole Cheuvreux, Quantitat Res, Paris, France; [Lehalle, C. -A.] CFM, Quantitat Res, F-75007 Paris, France; [Rowley, M.] Rowley Consulting LLC, Quantitat Res, Princeton, NJ USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; Universite Paris Saclay; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Delhi; Credit Agricole,"Lehalle, CA (通讯作者)，CFM, Quantitat Res, 23-25 Rue Univ, F-75007 Paris, France.",charles@lehalle.net,,"Joseph, Nathan Lael/0000-0002-2182-0847; LEHALLE, Charles-Albert/0000-0002-9978-9501",Credit Agricole Cheuvreux Trading and Microstructure Research Initiative; Louis Bachelier Institute; College de France,Credit Agricole Cheuvreux Trading and Microstructure Research Initiative; Louis Bachelier Institute; College de France,"This research has been supported by the Credit Agricole Cheuvreux Trading and Microstructure Research Initiative, in partnership with the Louis Bachelier Institute and the College de France.",,36,0,0,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Currently, it is not possible to estimate health utilities based on the PedsQL (TM) GCS, either directly or indirectly. This paper assesses different mapping methods for estimating EQ-5D health utilities from PedsQL (TM) GCS responses. This study is based on data from a cross-sectional survey conducted in four secondary schools in England amongst children aged 11-15 years. We estimate models using both direct and response mapping approaches to predict EQ-5D health utilities and responses. The mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to assess the predictive accuracy of the models. The models were internally validated on an estimation dataset that included complete PedsQL (TM) GCS and EQ-5D scores for 559 respondents. Validation was also performed making use of separate data for 337 respondents. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models that used the PedsQL (TM) GCS subscale scores, their squared terms and interactions (with and without age and gender) to predict EQ-5D health utilities had the best prediction accuracy. In the external validation sample, the OLS model with age and gender had a MSE (MAE) of 0.036 (0.115) compared with a MSE (MAE) of 0.036 (0.114) for the OLS model without age and gender. However, both models generated higher prediction errors for children in poorer health states (EQ-5D utility score < 0.6). The response mapping models encountered some estimation problems because of insufficient data for some of the response levels. Our mapping algorithms provide an empirical basis for estimating health utilities in childhood when EQ-5D data are not available; they can be used to inform future economic evaluations of paediatric interventions. They are likely to be robust for populations comparable to our own (children aged 11-15 years in attendance at secondary school). The performance of these algorithms in childhood populations, which differ according to age or clinical characteristics to our own, remains to be evaluated.","[Khan, Kamran A.; Petrou, Stavros] Univ Warwick, Div Hlth Sci, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Oxford, England; [Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Red Invest Serv Sanitarios Cronicida REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain; [Walters, Stephen J.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Boyle, Spencer E.] Northumbria Univ, Fac Hlth & Life Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Warwick; University of Oxford; University of Sheffield; Northumbria University,"Khan, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Div Hlth Sci, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",k.a.khan@warwick.ac.uk,"Khan, Kamran/JFJ-9362-2023; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Khan, Kamran/0000-0002-4322-9695; Rivero-Arias, Oliver/0000-0003-2233-6544; Walters, Stephen/0000-0001-9000-8126",Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform; Advantage West Midlands; Wolfson Foundation,Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform; Advantage West Midlands; Wolfson Foundation,"This project benefitted from facilities funded through Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform, with support from Advantage West Midlands and the Wolfson Foundation.

Countries without a national value set are advised to select one based on geographic proximity. In the absence of a Swiss value set, we used foreign value sets to gain insights into their appropriateness for use with Swiss cancer patients. EQ-5D health states and visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings were collected in one German and three Swiss oncology trials. Utilities were calculated based on the United Kingdom (UK), German (GE), French (FR) and European Union (EU) value sets. Resulting differences and Pearson partial correlation coefficients with corresponding VAS ratings were assessed. In total, 202 Swiss and 154 German patients undergoing cancer treatment completed at least two EQ-5D forms. The mean difference between GE-based and FR-, UK- or EU-based utilities was significantly larger than the differences between the latter. The absolute mean difference between utilities and VAS ratings was highest for GE-based utilities, for Swiss (0.170, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.146-0.194) and German patients (0.174, 95 % CI 0.145-0.202). The correlation between GE-based utilities and VAS ratings was the lowest (r = 0.36, 95 % CI 0.33-0.40); the highest was between FR-based utilities and VAS ratings (r = 0.43, 95 % CI 0.39-0.46). For Switzerland, utility calculations based on the German or French value set would be an obvious choice. Our results suggest that the German value set may not be the most appropriate for use with Swiss cancer patients. The French and EU value sets may be relevant alternatives and improve international comparability.","[Matter-Walstra, Klazien; Szucs, Thomas; Schwenkglenks, Matthias] Univ Basel, Inst Pharmaceut Med, ECPM, CH-4056 Bern, Switzerland; [Matter-Walstra, Klazien; Klingbiel, Dirk] Swiss Grp Clin Canc Res Coordinating Ctr, CH-3008 Bern, Switzerland; [Pestalozzi, Bernhard C.] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Basel; University of Zurich; University Zurich Hospital,"Matter-Walstra, K (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Inst Pharmaceut Med, ECPM, Klingelbergstr 61, CH-4056 Bern, Switzerland.",klazien.matter@unibas.ch,"Matter-Walstra, Klazien/ABG-2426-2021","Matter-Walstra, Klazien/0000-0002-5143-8112; Klingbiel, Dirk/0000-0002-9914-0243; Szucs, Thomas/0000-0003-0195-3316; Schwenkglenks, Matthias/0000-0001-7217-1173","Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation; Swiss Cancer Research Foundation [75/08]","Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation; Swiss Cancer Research Foundation","This study was funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation.

In Ireland, The Netherlands, Sweden and the UK, the price of, and access to, a new drug has to be justified by the health gain it delivers compared with current therapy, typically expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. By contrast, in France and Germany, the assessment of added benefit is expressed on an ordinal scale, based on an assessment of the clinical outcomes as compared with existing care. This assessment then influences price negotiations. The objective of this paper is to assess the pros and cons of each approach, both in terms of the assessments they produce and the efficiency and practical feasibility of the process. We reviewed the technology appraisals performed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) relating to 49 anticancer drug decisions in the UK from September 2003 to January 2012. Estimates of the QALYs gained and incremental cost per QALY gained were then compared with the assessments of the Am,lioration du Service M,dical Rendu (ASMR) made by the Haute Autorit, de Sant, (HAS) in France for the same drugs in the same clinical indications. We also undertook a qualitative assessment of the two approaches, considering the resources required, timeliness, transparency, stakeholder engagement, and political acceptability. In the UK, the estimates of QALYs gained ranged from 0.003 to 1.46 and estimates of incremental cost per QALY from A 3,320 pound to A 458,000 pound. The estimate of cost per QALY gained was a good predictor of the level of restriction imposed on the use of the drug concerned. Patient access schemes, which normally imply price reductions, were proposed in 45 % of cases. In France, the distribution of ASMRs was I, 12 %; II, 18 %; III, 24 %; IV, 18 %; V, 22 %; and uncategorized/non-reimbursed, 4 %. Since ASMRs of IV and above signify minor or no improvement over existing therapy, these ratings imply that, in around 40 % of cases, the drugs concerned would face price controls. Overall, the assessments of value added in the two jurisdictions were very similar. A superior ASMR rating was associated with higher QALYs gained. However, a superior ASMR was not associated with a lower incremental cost per QALY. There are substantial differences in respect of the other attributes considered, but these mainly reflect the result of institutional choices in the jurisdictions concerned and it is not possible to conclude that one approach is universally superior to the other. The two approaches produce very similar assessments of added value, but have different attributes in terms of cost, timeliness, transparency and political acceptability. How these considerations impact market access and prices is difficult to assess, because of the lack of transparency concerning prices in both countries and the fact that market access also depends on a broader range of factors. There is some evidence of convergence in the approaches, with the movement in France towards producing cost-effectiveness estimates and the movement in the UK towards negotiated prices.","[Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [de Pouvourville, Gerard; Saba, Grece] Sch Business, ESSEC, Cergy Pontoise, France; [Jones, Elizabeth] OptumInsight, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Haig, Jennifer] OptumInsight, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Cawston, Helene] OptumInsight, Nanterre, France",University of York - UK; ESSEC Business School; Optum; Optum; Optum,"Drummond, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",mike.drummond@york.ac.uk,"Han, KyungJu/J-5563-2014","Han, KyungJu/0000-0002-5006-1886",,,,,25,28,29,0,25,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2014,32.0,5,,,,,509,520,,10.1007/s40273-014-0144-z,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AG9RQ,24599784.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335757600008,0

We show that the GMM estimator is asymptotically as efficient as the maximum likelihood estimator if and only if the true score belongs to the closure of the linear space spanned by the moment conditions. This result generalizes former ones to autocorrelated moments and possibly infinite number of moment restrictions. Second, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bound when the observations are known to be Markov and satisfy a conditional moment restriction. We show that it coincides with the asymptotic variance of the optimal GMM estimator, thus extending results by Chamberlain (1987, Journal of Econometrics 34, 305-33) to a dynamic setting.

In the literature, this is usually done with an assumption of independence between the interest and transition rates. In this paper, it is shown how to valuate life insurance liabilities using affine processes for modelling dependent interest and transition rates. This approach leads to the introduction of so-called dependent forward rates. We propose a specific model for surrender modelling, and within this model the dependent forward rates are calculated, and the market value and the Solvency II capital requirement are examined for a simple savings contract.

Since different types of claims are conceivably correlated with each other, the multivariate count regression models that emphasize the dependency among claim types are more helpful for inference and prediction purposes. Motivated by the characteristics of an insurance dataset, we investigate alternative approaches to constructing multivariate count models based on the negative binomial distribution. A classical approach to induce correlation is to employ common shock variables. However, this formulation relies on the NB-I distribution which is restrictive for dispersion modeling. To address these issues, we consider two different methods of modeling multivariate claim counts using copulas. The first one works with the discrete count data directly using a mixture of max-id copulas that allows for flexible pair-wise association as well as tail and global dependence. The second one employs elliptical copulas to join continuitized data while preserving the dependence structure of the original counts. The empirical analysis examines a portfolio of auto insurance policies from a Singapore insurer where claim frequency of three types of claims (third party property damage, own damage, and third party bodily injury) are considered. The results demonstrate the superiority of the copula-based approaches over the common shock model. Finally, we implemented the various models in loss predictive applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Under very weak conditions, we show that the SLSDVE is asymptotically normal and that the series estimator achieves the optimal convergence rate of the non-parametric regression. In addition, we propose a two-stage local polynomial estimation for the non-parametric component by applying the additive structure and the series estimator. The resultant estimator is asymptotically normal and the asymptotic distribution of each additive component is the same as it would be if the other components were known with certainty.

However, the uncertainty about the model hyperparameters is usually neglected in state space model applications, which causes a negative bias in the newly obtained variance estimates. In our simulation, the model that is currently in use at Statistics Netherlands constitutes the central data generation process. The results suggest that the relative bias in the DLFS signal MSE-estimates is about -18 percent against the true MSE value. This bias can be reduced to about -5 percent with an asymptotic approximation. Further, the performance of several bootstrapping approaches available in the literature is tested on the DLFS model. The results suggest that some of these methods can reduce the MSE bias to less than -1 percent.

In order to reduce the moral hazard, we assume that both the insurer and the reinsurer are obligated to pay more as the amount of loss increases in a typical reinsurance treaty. We further assume that the optimization criterion preserves the convex order. Such a criterion is very general as most of the criteria for optimal reinsurance problems in the literature preserve the convex order. When the reinsurance premium is calculated as a function of the actuarial value of coverage, we show via a stochastic dominance approach that any admissible reinsurance policy is dominated by a stop-loss reinsurance or a two-layer reinsurance, depending upon the amount of the reinsurance premium. Moreover, we obtain a similar result to Mossin's Theorem and find that it is optimal for the insurer to cede a loss asmuch as possible under the net premium principle. To further examine the reinsurance premium for the optimal piecewise linear reinsurance policy, we assume the expected value premium principle and derive the optimal reinsurance explicitly under (1) the criterion of minimizing the variance of the insurer's risk exposure, and (2) the criterion of minimizing the risk-adjusted value of the insurer's liability where the liability valuation is carried out using the cost-of-capital approach based on the conditional value at risk.","[Chi, Yichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Lin, X.

Given two time series, can one tell, in a faithful and quantitative way, the cause and effect between them? Based on a recently established rigorous formalism of information flow, namely, the Liang-Kleeman information flow (see Liang, 2013, for a review), Liang (2014) arrives at a formula that gives this important and challenging question a positive answer. Here causality is measured by the time rate of change of information flowing from one variable, say, X-2 to another, X-1. If the evolution of (X-1, X-2) is governed by dX(1) = F(1)dt + b(11)dW(1) + b(12)dW(2), (1) dX(2) = F(2)dt + b(21)dW(1) + b(22)dW(2), (2) where W-i (i = 1,2) is white noise, Liang (2008) has established that the flow rate from X-2 to X-1 is T-2 1 = -E (1/rho 1 (F-1 rho 1)/partial derivative x(1)) + 1/2E (1/rho 1 partial derivative(2)(b(11)(2) + b(12)(2))rho 1/partial derivative x(1)(2)), (3) where pi is the marginal probability density of X-1, and E the mathematical expectation. T-2 1 can be zero or nonzero. A nonzero T-2 1 means that X-2 is causal to X-2: a positive value means that X-2 makes X-1 more uncertain, and vice versa. This measure is asymmetric between X-1 and X-2; particularly, if the process underlying X-1 has nothing to do with X-2 then the resulting causality from X-2 to X-1 vanishes. Now the dynamics is actually unknown; instead we are given two time series. In this case, the Liang-Kleeman information flow can be equally obtained, with the terms in (3) replaced by their respective estimators. In a linear setting, it is proved that (Liang, 2014) T-2 1 = C-11 C-12 C-2,C-d1 - C-12(2) C-1,C-d1/C-11(2) C-22 - C-11 C-12(2), (4) where C-ij is the sample covariance between X-i and X-j C-i,C-dj the covariance between (i) and X-j, and X-j the finite difference approximation of dX(j)/dt using the Euler forward scheme. The formula is tight in form, and very easy to compute, in sharp contrast to other information-theoretic approaches. Moreover, statistical significance test can be performed for each estimated T-2 1. As validations we have shown that this formula faithfully unravels the cause-effect relations between several touchstone series (both linear and nonlinear) purportedly generated with one-way causality, while traditional approaches fail in this regard. An example system shown in Liang (2014) is: dX(1) = (-X-1 + 0.5X(2))dt + 0.1dW(1), (5) dX(2) = -X(2)dt + 0.1dW(2.) (6) Clearly X-2 drives X-1 but X-1 does not feedback. With this system we generate a sample path and plot the series in Fig. 1. Application of the above formula yields a pair of flow rates: T-2 1 approximate to 0.11, T-1 2 approximate to 0, a remarkable result that accurately recovers the causality between X-1 and X-2. This study has also been applied to the investigation of real world problems; one example is the cause-effect relation between the two major climate modes, the El Nino and Indian Ocean Dipole, which have been linked to the hazards in a far flung regions of the globe, with important results that would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain.

However, optimal solutions to the CVaR minimization are highly susceptible to estimation error of the risk measure because the estimate depends only on a small portion of sampled scenarios. The same is equally true of the other coherent measures. In this paper, by employing robust optimization modelling for minimizing coherent risk measures, we present a simple and practical way for making the solution robust over a certain range of estimation errors. More specifically, we show that a worst-case coherent risk minimization leads to a penalized minimization of the empirical risk estimate. The worst-case risk measure developed in this paper is different from the distributionally worst-case CVaR in Zhu and Fukushima's work of 2009, but these two worst-case risk measures can be simultaneously minimized. Additionally, inspired by Konno, Waki and Yuuki's work of 2002, we examine the use of factor models in coherent risk minimization. We see that, in general, factor model-based coherent risk minimization along the lines of that pursued by Goldfarb and Iyengar in 2003 becomes computationally intractable. Therefore, we apply a simplified version to the factor model-based CVaR minimization, and see that it improves on the performance, achieving better CVaR, turnover, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio than the empirical CVaR minimization and market benchmarks.","[Gotoh, Jun-Ya] Chuo Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1128551, Japan; [Shinozaki, Keita] ACT Co Ltd, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1690073, Japan; [Takeda, Akiko] Keio Univ, Dept Adm Engn, Kohoku Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan",Chuo University; Keio University,"Gotoh, JY (通讯作者)，Chuo Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 2-13-27 Kasuga, Tokyo 1128551, Japan.",jgoto@indsys.chuo-u.ac.jp,"Gotoh, Jun-ya/D-4290-2011","Gotoh, Jun-ya/0000-0002-0097-7298","MEXT [23710176]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23710174, 23710176] Funding Source: KAKEN","MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The research of the first author is partly supported by MEXT Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) 23710176.,,22,21,21,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The effect on the overall survival of removing one or more causes of death is explored under two alternative definitions of removal, ignoring the causes and eliminating them. Under the two definitions of removal, expressions for the overall survival functions in terms of the specified copula (density) and the net (marginal) survival functions are given. The net survival functions are obtained as a solution to a system of non-linear differential equations, which relates them through the specified copula (derivatives) to the crude (sub-) survival functions, estimated from data. The overall survival functions in a model with four competing risks, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and all other causes grouped together, have been implemented and evaluated, based on cause-specific mortality data for England and Wales published by the Office for National Statistics, for the year 2007. We show that the two alternative definitions of removal of a cause of death have different effects on the overall survival and in particular on the life expectancy at birth and at age 65, when one, two or three of the competing causes are removed. An important conclusion is that the eliminating definition is better suited for practical use in competing risks' applications, since it is more intuitive, and it suffices to consider only positive dependence between the lifetimes which is not the case under the alternative ignoring definition.

Moreover we introduce a new family of stochastic orders which arises from the previous construction. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The more theories there are in the market, the higher is the equilibrium price of the long-term asset.

This pricing method complements current studies on the valuation of mortality-linked securities, which only have discrete trading opportunities and insufficient market trading data. Like the Wang transform, the valuation relationship is still risk-neutral (preference-free) and the mortality-linked security is priced as the expected value of its terminal payoff, discounted by the risk-free rate.

For the very low level of rates, we find a proportional behaviour; for rates of an intermediate level we find that the magnitude of moves becomes independent of the level. The linear dependence resumes, however, for very high rates. We find the results to be very robust across currencies, tenors and time periods. Even the data we have collected for the UK Consol yields going back to the XIX century conform closely to the same pattern.

We suggest a two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) and instrumental variable (IV) estimation approach extending earlier work by, e.g., Kelejian and Prucha (1998, 1999). In contrast to those papers, we not only prove consistency for our GMM estimator for the spatial-autoregressive parameter in the disturbance process, but we also derive the joint limiting distribution for our GMM estimator and the IV estimator for the regression parameters. Thus the theory allows for a joint test of zero spatial interactions in the dependent variable, the exogenous variables and the disturbances.

To address the impact of these model assumptions on the SCR, we conduct a sensitivity analysis. We examine changes in the correlation matrix between lines of business and address the choice of copulas.

Such arrangements rely on prospective information regarding the incremental net benefit of the new technology, and its use in practice. However, once the new technology has been adopted in a particular jurisdiction, randomized clinical trials within that jurisdiction are likely to be infeasible and unethical in the cases where they would be most helpful, i.e. with current evidence of positive while uncertain incremental health and net monetary benefit. Informed patients in these cases would likely be reluctant to participate in a trial, preferring instead to receive the new technology with certainty. Consequently, informing risk sharing arrangements within a jurisdiction is problematic given the infeasibility of collecting prospective trial data. To overcome such problems, we demonstrate that global trials facilitate Walling post adoption, leading to more complete and robust risk sharing arrangements that mitigate the impact of costs of reversal on expected value of information in jurisdictions who adopt while a global trial is undertaken. More generally, optimally designed global trials offer distinct advantages over locally optimal solutions for decision makers and manufacturers alike: avoiding opportunity costs of delay in jurisdictions that adopt; overcoming barriers to evidence collection; and improving levels of expected implementation. Further, the greater strength and translatability of evidence across jurisdictions inherent in optimal global trial design reduces barriers to translation across jurisdictions characteristic of local trials. Consequently, efficiently designed global trials better align the interests of decision makers and manufacturers, increasing the feasibility of risk sharing and the expected strength of evidence over local trials, up until the point that current evidence is globally sufficient.","[Eckermann, Simon] Univ Wollongong, Sydney Business Sch, Australian Hlth Serv Res Inst, Wollongong, NSW 3522, Australia; [Willan, Andrew R.] SickKids Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Willan, Andrew R.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Wollongong; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto,"Eckermann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sydney Business Sch, Australian Hlth Serv Res Inst, Room 255,Bldg 40, Wollongong, NSW 3522, Australia.",Simon_Eckermann@uow.edu.au,,,Discovery Grant Program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [44868-03],Discovery Grant Program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"Professor Andrew Willan is funded through the Discovery Grant Program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grant number 44868-03); however, the opinions expressed are those of the authors and should not be attributed to any funding agency.

Methods We synthesized evidence on type 1 diabetes patients using several published sources: The simulation model was based on 13 equations to estimate risks of events and mortality. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was obtained from results of the DCCT (diabetes control and complications trial). Mortality post-CVD event was based on a study using linked administrative data on people with diabetes from Western Australia. Information on incidence of renal disease and the progression to CVD was obtained from studies in Finland and Italy. Lower-extremity amputation (LEA) risk was based on the type 1 diabetes Swedish inpatient registry, and the risk of blindness was obtained from results of a German-based study. Where diabetes-specific data were unavailable, information from other populations was used. We examine the degree and source of parameter uncertainty and illustrate an application of the model in estimating lifetime outcomes of using intensive and conventional treatments for blood glucose control. Results From 15 years of age, male and female patients had an estimated life expectancy of 47.2 (95 % CI 35.2-59.2) and 52.7 (95 % CI 41.7-63.6) years in the intensive treatment group. The model produced estimates of the lifetime benefits of intensive treatment for blood glucose from the DCCT of 4.0 (95 % CI 1.2-6.8) QALYs for women and 4.6 (95 % CI 2.7-6.9) QALYs for men. Absolute risk per 1,000 person-years for fatal CVD events was simulated to be 1.37 and 2.51 in intensive and conventional treatment groups, respectively. Conclusions The model incorporates diabetic complications risk data from a type 1 diabetes population and synthesizes other type 1 specific data to estimate long-term outcomes of CVD, end-stage renal disease, LEA and risk of blindness, along with life expectancy and QALYs. External validation was carried out using life expectancy and absolute risk for fatal CVD events. Because of the flexible and transparent nature of the model, it has many potential future applications.","[Lung, Tom W.

The variation in the magnitude of indirect costs across studies and countries is substantial and affects the transferability of results across jurisdictions. Objective This study explored the factors involved in the variation of reported indirect cost and investigated the feasibility of transferring indirect costs across settings. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies estimating indirect costs for four selected chronic diseases, namely, asthma (AS), diabetes (DI), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and schizophrenia (SC). A multiple linear regression analysis was run to identify the factors that potentially explain the variation in reported indirect costs. Parametric (fixed- and random-effect models) and non-parametric (bootstrapping method) meta-analyses were applied to local gross domestic product (GDP)/capita-adjusted indirect costs for each disease. Results from the three different analytical methods were compared to ascertain the robustness of estimation. Results The systematic literature review identified 77 articles that reported indirect costs of AS (n = 18), DI (n = 20), RA (n = 25) and SC (n = 14) for literature synthesis. Substantial inter- and intra-disease variations among the indirect cost studies were observed with respect to geographic distribution, methodology and magnitude of cost estimation. Regression analysis showed that disease categories and local GDP/capita significantly (p < 0.001) contributed to the variance of indirect cost. The range of intra-disease variation in indirect costs was substantially reduced after adjusting by and expressing values as local GDP/capita. The GDP-adjusted indirect cost in terms of percentage of local GDP/capita of AS was the lowest and that of SC was the highest. Bootstrapping estimation was relatively conservative, with slightly wider confidence intervals (CIs) than the parametric method, with a mean (95 % CI) of 2.12 % (1.4089-2.9332) for AS, 10.65 % (7.215-14.7438) for DI, 21.98 % (17.4360-27.0631) for RA, and 79.19 % (52.4243-117.833) for SC. Conclusion It would be convenient and feasible to construct a universal reference range of indirect cost for a specific disease based on existing data and present this as a percentage of local GDP to assist local decision making in jurisdictions where indirect cost data are not available.","[Zhao, Fei-Li; Li, Shu-Chuen] Univ Newcastle, Sch Biomed Sci & Pharm, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Xie, Feng] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Xie, Feng] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Hlth Res Inst, Programs Assessment Technol, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Hu, Hao] Quintiles Greater China Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Newcastle; McMaster University; McMaster University; IQVIA,"Li, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Sch Biomed Sci & Pharm, R108,MS Bldg, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",ShuChuen.Li@newcastle.edu.au,,"Zhao, Fei-Li/0000-0001-5279-5595",,,,,28,21,27,0,12,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2013,31.0,6,,,,,501,508,,10.1007/s40273-013-0053-6,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,165OR,23620212.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320493700005,0

Since we may want to assume a stable growth rate for the macroeconomics time series, it seems natural to potentially model such a series as a unit root process with drift. This assumption implies that the level of such a time series is the exponential of a unit root process with drift and therefore, it is of substantial interest to investigate analytically the behavior of the exponential of a unit root process with drift. This paper shows that the sum of the exponential of a random walk with drift converges in distribution, after rescaling by the exponential of the maximum value of the random walk process. A similar result was established in earlier work for unit root processes without drift. The results derived here suggest the conjecture that also in the case when the Dickey-Fuller test or the KPSS statistic is applied to the exponential of a unit root process with drift, these tests will asymptotically indicate stationarity.","[de Jong, Robert] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"de Jong, R (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 444 Arps Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",de-jong.8@osu.edu,,,,,,,13,1,2,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Our approach is based on so-called diffusion canonical transformations that produce a large class of multiparameter nonlinear local volatility diffusion models that are mapped onto various simpler diffusions. Using an asymptotic analysis, we arrive at a rigorous boundary classification as well as a characterization with respect to probability conservation and the martingale property of the newly constructed diffusions. Specifically, we analyze and classify in detail four main families of driftless regular diffusion models that arise from the underlying squared Bessel process (the Bessel family), CoxIngersollRoss process (the confluent hypergeometric family), the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion (the OU family), and the Jacobi diffusion (the hypergeometric family). We show that the Bessel family is a superset of the constant elasticity of variance model without drift. The Bessel family, in turn, is nested by the confluent hypergeometric family. For these two families we find further subfamilies of conservative strict supermartingales and nonconservative martingales with an exit boundary. For the new classes of nonconservative regular diffusions we also derive analytically exact first exit time densities that are given in terms of generalized inverse Gaussians and extensions. As for the two other new models, we show that the OU family of processes are conservative strict martingales, whereas the Jacobi family are nonconservative nonmartingales. Considered as asset price diffusion models, we also show that these models demonstrate a wide range of local volatility shapes and option implied volatility surfaces that include various pronounced skew and smile patterns.","[Campolieti, Giuseppe] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Math, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Campolieti, G (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Math, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",gcampoli@wlu.ca,,"Makarov, Roman/0000-0002-0935-9445; Campolieti, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6316-7313",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); SHARCNET (the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); SHARCNET (the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network),The authors acknowledge the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) for discovery research grants as well as SHARCNET (the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network) in providing support for a research chair in financial mathematics.,,27,9,10,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Furthermore, we determine the optimal proportional reinsurance strategy, when so-called expensive reinsurance is available; that is, the premium loading on reinsurance is greater than the loading on the directly written insurance. One can think of our model as taking the one in Taksar (2000, Section 6) and adding a penalty for ruin. We use the Legendre transform to obtain the optimal dividend and reinsurance strategies. Not surprisingly, the optimal dividend strategy is a barrier strategy. Also, we investigate the effect of the penalty P on the optimal strategies. In particular, we show that the optimal barrier increases with respect to P, while the optimal proportion retained and the value function decrease with respect to P. In the end, we explore the time of ruin, and find that the expected time of ruin increases with respect to P under a net profit condition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper studies the hedging problem of annuity cash flows when mortality and interest rates are stochastic. We first propose a Delta-Gamma hedging technique for mortality risk. The risk factor against which to hedge is the difference between the actual mortality intensity in the future and its forecast today, the forward intensity. We specialize the hedging technique first to the case in which mortality intensities are affine, then to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Feller processes, providing actuarial justifications for this selection. We show that, without imposing no arbitrage, we can get equivalent probability measures under which the HJM condition for no arbitrage is satisfied. Last, we extend our results to the presence of both interest rate and mortality risk. We provide a UK calibrated example of Delta-Gamma hedging of both mortality and interest rate risk.

CPDO coupons and principal notes received high initial credit ratings from the major rating agencies, based on complex models for the joint transition of ratings and spreads for all names in the underlying portfolio. We propose a parsimonious model for analysing the performance of CPDO strategies using a top-down approach that captures the essential risk factors of the CPDO. Our approach allows us to compute default probabilities, loss distributions and other tail risk measures for the CPDO strategy and analyse the dependence of these risk measures on various parameters describing the risk factors. We find that the probability of the CPDO defaulting on its coupon payments can be made arbitrarily small-and thus the credit rating arbitrarily high-by increasing leverage, but the ratings obtained strongly depend on assumptions on the credit environment (high spread or low spread). More importantly, CPDO loss distributions are found to exhibit a wide range of tail risk measures inside a given rating category, suggesting that credit ratings are insufficient performance indicators for such complex leveraged strategies. A worst-case scenario analysis indicates that CPDO strategies have a high exposure to persistent spread-widening scenarios and that CPDO ratings are shown to be quite unstable during the lifetime of the strategy.","[Cont, Rama] Columbia Univ, IEOR Dept, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Jessen, Cathrine] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Finance, Copenhagen, Denmark",Columbia University; Copenhagen Business School,"Cont, R (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, IEOR Dept, New York, NY 10027 USA.",rama.cont@columbia.edu,,"CONT, Rama/0000-0003-1164-6053",,,,,26,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Methods: We performed a systematic search of the databases MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library and used hand-searching to identify articles on cost effectiveness of therapies for adult patients with AS published up to November 2010. Results: Of 135 articles, 13 studies were analysed. Two articles were on physical therapies, one article was on NSAIDs and ten articles were on tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (infliximab = 6, etanercept = 2, infliximab and etanercept = 1 and adalimumab = 1). Of the latter, no article directly compared TNF inhibitors. Articles showed substantial heterogeneity in methodological approaches and thus results, which prevented us from any extensive comparison, data pooling or meta-analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for spa-exercise treatment was sic7465 (95% CI 3294, 14 686) per QALY. The ICERs for infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab were sic5307-237010, , sic29 815-123 761 and sic7344-33 303 per QALY, respectively. Conclusions: Modelling treatment strategies in chronic relapsing diseases such as AS presents specific challenges, as reflected in the variation in the cost-effectiveness results reported. Although quite variable, the cost-effectiveness ratios for AS therapies remain within an acceptable range.","[Fautrel, Bruno] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Dept Rheumatol, Serv Rhumatol, F-75013 Paris, France; [Gaujoux-Viala, Cecile; Fautrel, Bruno] Univ Paris 06, GRC UMPC EEMOIS 08, Paris, France; [Gaujoux-Viala, Cecile] Paris Descartes Univ, Lorraine Univ, EA Apemac 4360, Nancy, France",Sorbonne Universite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite de Lorraine,"Fautrel, B (通讯作者)，Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Dept Rheumatol, Serv Rhumatol, 83 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",bruno.fautrel@psl.aphp.fr,"Gaujoux-Viala, Cécile/AAB-5141-2020","Gaujoux-Viala, Cécile/0000-0002-2099-6496",Abbott; BMS; Expansciences; Roche; UCB; Wyeth-Pfizer; Merck; Mundipharma; Shering Plough,Abbott(Abbott Laboratories); BMS(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Expansciences; Roche(Roche Holding); UCB(UCB Pharma SA); Wyeth-Pfizer(WyethPfizer); Merck(Merck & Company); Mundipharma; Shering Plough,"Author disclosures of honoraria for advice or public speaking, grants received and/or advisory board participation are as follows:; CGV: Abbott, BMS, Expansciences, Roche, UCB and Wyeth-Pfizer.; BF: Abbott, BMS, Merck, Mundipharma, Roche, Shering Plough, UCB and Wyeth-Pfizer.",,32,9,10,0,19,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,12,,,,,1145,1156,,10.2165/11596490-000000000-00000,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,050GO,23098324.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312041400004,0

In this design, local polynomial estimators are now routinely employed to construct confidence intervals for treatment effects. The performance of these confidence intervals in applications, however, may be seriously hampered by their sensitivity to the specific bandwidth employed. Available bandwidth selectors typically yield a large bandwidth, leading to data-driven confidence intervals that may be biased, with empirical coverage well below their nominal target. We propose new theory-based, more robust confidence interval estimators for average treatment effects at the cutoff in sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD, and fuzzy kink RD designs. Our proposed confidence intervals are constructed using a bias-corrected RD estimator together with a novel standard error estimator. For practical implementation, we discuss mean squared error optimal bandwidths, which are by construction not valid for conventional confidence intervals but are valid with our robust approach, and consistent standard error estimators based on our new variance formulas. In a special case of practical interest, our procedure amounts to running a quadratic instead of a linear local regression. More generally, our results give a formal justification to simple inference procedures based on increasing the order of the local polynomial estimator employed. We find in a simulation study that our confidence intervals exhibit close-to-correct empirical coverage and good empirical interval length on average, remarkably improving upon the alternatives available in the literature.

However, there is a scant literature on the empirical evidence of the true nature of the relationship between survivorship and persistency in life insurance. When a life insurance contract terminates due to voluntary non-payment of premiums, there is a possible hidden cost resulting from mortality antiselection. This refers to the tendency of policyholders who are generally healthy to select against the insurance company by voluntarily terminating their policies. In this article, we explore the empirical results of the survival pattern of terminated policies, using a follow-up study of the mortality of those policies that terminated from a portfolio of life insurance contracts. The data has been obtained from a major insurer which traced the mortality of their policies withdrawn, for purposes of understanding the mortality antiselection, by obtaining their dates of death from the Social Security Administration office. Using a representative sample of this follow-up data, we modeled the time until a policy lapses and its subsequent mortality pattern. We find some evidence of mortality selection and we consequentially examined the financial cost of policy termination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

(2012) develop bootstrap implementations of the (pseudo-) likelihood ratio (PLR) co-integration rank test and associated sequential rank determination procedure of Johansen (1996). The bootstrap samples are constructed using the restricted parameter estimates of the underlying vector autoregressive (VAR) model which obtain under the reduced rank null hypothesis. They propose methods based on an independent and individual distributed (i.i.d.) bootstrap resampling scheme and establish the validity of their proposed bootstrap procedures in the context of a co-integrated VAR model with i.i.d. innovations. In this paper we investigate the properties of their bootstrap procedures, together with analogous procedures based on a wild bootstrap resampling scheme, when time-varying behavior is present in either the conditional or unconditional variance of the innovations. We show that the bootstrap PLR tests are asymptotically correctly sized and, moreover, that the probability that the associated bootstrap sequential procedures select a rank smaller than the true rank converges to zero. This result is shown to hold for both the i.i.d. and wild bootstrap variants under conditional heteroskedasticity but only for the latter under unconditional heteroskedasticity. Monte Carlo evidence is reported which suggests that the bootstrap approach of Cavaliere et al. (2012) significantly improves upon the finite sample performance of corresponding procedures based on either the asymptotic PLR test or an alternative bootstrap method (where the short run dynamics in the VAR model are estimated unrestrictedly) for a variety of conditionally and unconditionally heteroskedastic innovation processes.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Rahbek, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Robert Taylor, A.

The revised version explicitly takes into account the dependence in time series data and can be used to justify the validity of bagging in the reduction of mean squared forecast error when compared with the unbagged forecasts. Monte Carlo simulations show that the new method works quite well and outperforms the traditional one-step-ahead linear forecast as well as the nonparametric forecast in general, especially when the in-sample estimation period is small. We also find that the bagging forecasts based on misspecified linear models may work as effectively as those based on nonparametric models, suggesting the robustification property of bagging method in terms of out-of-sample forecasts. We then reexamine forecasting powers of predictive variables suggested in the literature to forecast the excess returns or equity premium. We find that, consistent with Goyal and Welch (2008), the historical average excess stock return forecasts may beat other predictor variables in the literature when we apply traditional one-step linear forecast and the nonparametric forecasting methods. However, when using the bagging method or its revised version, which help to improve the mean squared forecast error for unstable predictors, the predictive variables have a better forecasting power than the historical mean.","[Jin, Sainan; Su, Liangjun] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Ullah, Aman] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Singapore Management University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Ullah, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",aman.ullah@ucr.edu,"ullah, aman/JQW-5104-2023; JIN, Sainan/D-1431-2009; SU, Liangjun/D-1445-2009","ullah, aman/0000-0002-7822-9222; Su, Liangjun/0000-0002-0565-6928",SMU [C244/MSS10E006],SMU(Singapore Management University),The authors are grateful to a referee for useful comments and suggestions.

In particular, weekly paclitaxel is now commonly used but has not been subjected to cost-effectiveness analysis. Our aim was to estimate the cost effectiveness of adjuvant docetaxel and weekly paclitaxel versus each other, and compared with standard 3-weekly paclitaxel, in women aged a parts per thousand yen25 years diagnosed with regional breast cancer in New Zealand. A macrosimulation Markov model was used, with a lifetime horizon and health system perspective. The model compared 3-weekly docetaxel and weekly paclitaxel versus standard 3-weekly paclitaxel (E1199 regimen) in the hospital setting. Data on overall survival and toxicities (febrile neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy) were derived from relevant published clinical trials. Epidemiological and cost data were derived from New Zealand datasets. Health outcomes were measured with health-adjusted life-years (HALYs), similar to quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs included intervention and health system costs in year 2011 values, with 3 % per annum discounting on costs and HALYs. The mean HALY gain per patient compared with standard 3-weekly paclitaxel was 0.51 with weekly paclitaxel and 0.21 with docetaxel, while incremental costs were $NZ12,284 and $NZ4,021, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of docetaxel versus 3-weekly paclitaxel was $NZ19,400 (purchasing power parity [PPP]-adjusted $US13,100) per HALY gained, and the ICER of weekly paclitaxel versus docetaxel was $NZ27,100 ($US18,300) per HALY gained. In terms of net monetary benefit, weekly paclitaxel was the optimal strategy for willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds >$NZ27,000 per HALY gained. However, the model was highly sensitive to uncertainty around survival differences, while toxicity-related morbidity had little impact. Thus, if it was assumed that weekly paclitaxel and docetaxel had the same efficacy, docetaxel would be favoured over weekly paclitaxel. Both weekly paclitaxel and docetaxel are likely to be cost effective compared with standard 3-weekly paclitaxel. Weekly paclitaxel was the optimal choice for WTP thresholds greater than $NZ27,000 per HALY gained (PPP-adjusted $US18,000). However, uncertainty remains around relative survival benefits, and weekly paclitaxel becomes cost ineffective versus docetaxel if it is assumed that the two regimens have equal effectiveness. Reduced uncertainty about the relative survival benefits may improve decision making for funding.","[Webber-Foster, Rachel; Kvizhinadze, Giorgi; Blakely, Tony] Univ Otago Wellington, Burden Dis Epidemiol Equity & Cost Effectiveness, Wellington, New Zealand; [Rivalland, Gareth] Auckland City Hosp, Dept Oncol, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Otago; Auckland City Hospital,"Blakely, T (通讯作者)，Univ Otago Wellington, Burden Dis Epidemiol Equity & Cost Effectiveness, POB 7343,23 Mein St, Wellington, New Zealand.",tony.blakely@otago.ac.nz,,"Blakely, Tony/0000-0002-6995-4369",Health Research Council of New Zealand [10/248],Health Research Council of New Zealand(Health Research Council of New Zealand),The BODE3 programme receives funding support from the Health Research Council of New Zealand (10/248).,,60,5,6,1,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2014,32.0,7,,,,,707,724,,10.1007/s40273-014-0154-x,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0KS,24859241.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344625700008,0

Then, we establish this estimator's non-asymptotic statistical properties under the dependent scenario (-mixing and m-dependent) with the weakly cross-correlated error term. At the second step, we obtain a detrended low-dimensional stochastic process that exhibits the dynamics of the original high-dimensional (stochastic) objects and we further justify statistical inference based on this.

Transition probabilities are in the variance gamma class with spot dependent parameters. Markov chain approximations give access to option prices. The model is estimated on option prices across strike and maturity for five days at a time. Properties of the estimated processes are described via an analysis of return quantiles, momentum functions that measure the response of tail probabilities to such moves. Momentum and reversion are also addressed via the construction of reverse conditional expectations. Term structures for the moments of marginal distributions support a decay in skewness and excess kurtosis with maturity at rates slower than those implied by Levy processes. Out of sample performance is additionally reported. It is observed that risk neutral dynamics by and large reflect the presence of momentum in numerous probabilities. However, there is some reversion in the upper quantiles of risk neutral return distributions.","Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Madan, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dbm@rhsmith.umd.edu,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

When these conditions are present, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) may produce very poor parameter estimates. In this study, we first investigate four methods to estimate the parameters of truncated distributions for small samplesMLE, expectation-maximization algorithm, penalized likelihood estimators, and Bayesian methods. Without any proper prior information, Jeffreys' prior for truncated distributions is used. Based on a simulation study for the log-normal distribution, we find that the Bayesian method gives much more credible and reliable estimates than the MLE method. Finally, an application to the operational loss severity estimation using real data is conducted using the truncated log-normal and log-gamma distributions. With the Bayesian method, the loss distribution parameters and value-at-risk measure for every cell with loss data can be estimated separately for internal and external data. Moreover, confidence intervals for the Bayesian estimates are obtained via a bootstrap method.","[Zhou, Xiaoping; Tucker, Ann H.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Giacometti, Rosella] Univ Bergamo, Dept Math Stat Comp Sci & Applicat, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy; [Fabozzi, Frank J.] EDHEC Business Sch, Nice, France",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Bergamo; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Zhou, XP (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",zxp567@gmail.com,"Giacometti, Rosella/AAZ-8099-2020","Giacometti, Rosella/0000-0002-9761-3529",,,,,34,4,7,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This paper aims to contribute to standardization of productivity cost methodology by offering practical guidance on how to estimate productivity costs in economic evaluations. The paper discusses the identification, measurement and valuation of productivity losses. It is recommended to include not only productivity losses related to absenteeism from and reduced productivity at paid work, but also those related to unpaid work. Hence, it is recommended to use a measurement instrument including questions about both paid and unpaid productivity, such as the iMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ) or the Valuation of Lost Productivity (VOLP).

When the bounds are just identified along with known interval length, the local asymptotic minimax decision with respect to a symmetric convex loss function takes an obvious form: an efficient lower bound estimator plus the half of the known interval length. However, when the interval length or any nontrivial upper bound for the length is not known, the minimax approach suffers from triviality because the maximal risk is associated with infinitely long identified intervals. In this case, this paper proposes a local asymptotic minimax regret approach and shows that the midpoint between semiparametrically efficient bound estimators is optimal.","[Song, Kyungchul] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Song, K (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, 997-1873 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",kysong@mail.ubc.edu,,,,,,,28,7,8,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The continuous-time case focuses on Harris recurrent diffusion processes. Notwithstanding finite-sample adjustments discussed in the paper, the proposed tests are simple to implement and rely on tabulated critical values.

The reason it is so important is simple, electricity cannot be stored in large quantities. Therefore, production and consumption must be precisely matched as so to save cost and not waste energy. Time series forecasting is a very common tool for power supply systems, being used worldwide by most system regulators to accurately predict the electricity demand. These series show more than one seasonal pattern, revealing intraday, intraweek and intrayear seasonal patterns. Multiple seasonal exponential smoothing has become the best solution for making forecasts for this type of time series. However, despite its importance, there isn't any software that deploys this methodology at present. Regulators are demanding better forecasting tools which capture this multiple seasonal pattern, and recent works on double and triple seasonal exponential smoothing seem to be a feasible solution. This paper concentrates on a MATLAB implementation of a multiple seasonal exponential smoothing model, explaining its fundamentals and how it works. Following this, an hourly recorded time series of electricity demand in Spain is used to make conclusions about the advantages of this newer model for predictions.","[Carlos Garcia-Diaz, J.; Trull, Oscar] Univ Politecn Valencia, Appl Stat Operat Res & Qual Dept, Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"García-Díaz, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Appl Stat Operat Res & Qual Dept, Valencia, Spain.",juagardi@eio.upv.es,"García-Diaz, J.

Approximately half of the selected 3065 stations showed the autocorrelation peak, and the associated power suppression of the 11 years period or frequency. For the global average, the spectrum suppression was pronounced, and the associated correlation peak was less notable. We were able to simulate the suppression of power by modulating white noise time series representing precipitation with a sinusoidal time series of a given frequency.

Several countries have recently experienced Islamic parties coming to power through democratic elections. Due to strong support among religious conservatives, constituencies with Islamic rule often tend to exhibit poor women's rights. Whether this reflects a causal relationship or a spurious one has so far gone unexplored. I provide the first piece of evidence using a new and unique data set of Turkish municipalities. In 1994, an Islamic party won multiple municipal mayor seats across the country. Using a regression discontinuity (RD) design, I compare municipalities where this Islamic party barely won or lost elections. Despite negative raw correlations, the RD results reveal that, over a period of six years, Islamic rule increased female secular high school education. Corresponding effects for men are systematically smaller and less precise. In the longer run, the effect on female education remained persistent up to 17 years after, and also reduced adolescent marriages. An analysis of long-run political effects of Islamic rule shows increased female political participation and an overall decrease in Islamic political preferences. The results are consistent with an explanation that emphasizes the Islamic party's effectiveness in overcoming barriers to female entry for the poor and pious.","Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm Inst Transit Econ, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Meyersson, E (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm Inst Transit Econ, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",erik.meyersson@hhs.se,,,,,,,51,81,108,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2014,82.0,1,,,,,229,269,,10.3982/ECTA9878,0.0,,,41,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA7KQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331276700006,0

During the accumulation phase, a pension member contributes a predetermined amount of money as premiums and the management of the pension plan invests the premiums in equities and bonds to increase the value of the accumulation. In practice, most of the DC pension plans have return of premium clauses to protect the rights of the plan members who die during the accumulation phase. In the model, the members withdraw their premiums when they die and the difference between the premium and the accumulation (negative or positive) is distributed among the survival members. From the surviving members' point of view, when they retire, they want to maximize the fund size and to minimize the volatility of the accumulation. We formalize the problem as a continuous-time mean-variance stochastic optimal control problem. The management of the pension plan chooses the optimal investment strategy, i.e., the proportions invested in equities and bonds, to maximize the mean-variance utility of the pension member at the time of retirement. Using the variational inequalities methods in Bjork and Murgoci (2009), we transform the mean-variance stochastic control into Markovian time inconsistent stochastic control, then establish a verification theorem, which is similar to one of He and Liang (2008, 2009) and Zeng and Li (2011), to find the optimal strategy and the efficient frontier of the pension member. The differences of the optimal strategies between the Pension plans with and without the return of premium clauses are studied via the Monte Carlo methods. The impacts of the risk averse level on the optimal strategies is also explored by the numerical methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We show that distressed selling by investors exiting a fund and short selling of the fund's positions by traders may have nonnegligible impact on the realized correlations between returns of assets held by the fund. These feedback effects may lead to positive realized correlations between fundamentally uncorrelated assets, as well as an increase in correlations across all asset classes and in the fund's volatility which is exacerbated in scenarios in which the fund undergoes large losses. By studying the diffusion limit of our discrete time model, we obtain analytical expressions for the realized covariance and show that the realized covariance may be decomposed as the sum of a fundamental covariance and a liquidity-dependent excess covariance. Finally, we examine the impact of these feedback effects on the volatility of other funds.

In particular, we derive a model-independent risk-neutral formula for the moments of the asset log-return distribution function by expanding power returns as a weighted sum of vanilla option payoffs (based on results of Breeden and Litzenberger and Carr and Madan). For the numerical study, we develop different popular exponential Levy models, namely the VG, NIG and Meixner models. The new calibration methodology rests on closed-form formulae only: it is shown that the moment matching system can be transformed into a system of algebraic equations that computes directly the optimal value of the market standardized moments under the different Levy models under investigation. Hence, the proposed calibration can be performed almost instantaneously. Furthermore, for the models considered in this paper, the method does not require any search algorithm and hence any starting value for the model parameters and avoids the problem of becoming stuck in local minima.","[Guillaume, Florence; Schoutens, Wim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Guillaume, Florence] Fund Sci Res, Flanders, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Guillaume, F (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Celestijnenlaan 200 B, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.",florence.guillaume@wis.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,12,8,9,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The objective of this study was to examine the real-world cost-effectiveness of oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines (FL) versus FL-only as adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer. A Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime cost and quality-adjusted life-years from a hospital perspective. The effectiveness of the oxaliplatin arm was modelled by combining published efficacy data from the pivotal clinical registration trial (MOSAIC trial) with real-world (RW) data from a Dutch population-based observational study. RW patients were categorised into eligible or ineligible, depending on whether the patients fulfilled the MOSAIC trial eligibility criteria. Ineligible RW patients (18 %) had a poorer prognosis than eligible RW patients (82 %) and MOSAIC trial patients. The effectiveness of the comparator was modelled using MOSAIC trial results. All cost inputs were based on RW patients and reported in Euro 2012. Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed for four different scenarios: (1) cost-effectiveness analyses based on MOSAIC trial patients; (2) cost-effectiveness analyses using MOSAIC and eligible RW patients; (3) cost-effectiveness analyses using MOSAIC and both eligible and ineligible RW patients, assuming oxaliplatin had an equal effect in ineligible and eligible patients; (4) cost-effectiveness analyses using MOSAIC and both eligible and ineligible RW patients, assuming oxaliplatin had no effect amongst ineligibles. For each scenario, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. MOSAIC trial patients and eligible RW patients treated with oxaliplatin had comparable 2-year disease-free survivals (79.5 vs. 78.4 %). Oxaliplatin showed an incremental QALY gain of 1.02, 1.13, 1.17 and 0.93 and incremental cost of a,not sign9,961, a,not sign11,055, a,not sign9,814 and a,not sign11,854 in scenarios 1-4, respectively. The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were a,not sign9,766, a,not sign9,783, a,not sign8,388 and a,not sign12,746 in scenarios 1-4, respectively. In all scenarios, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICERs are acceptable and robust under a wide range of model assumptions. The ICERs of the different scenarios that resulted from combining MOSAIC trial data with data from Dutch daily practice all suggest that FL + oxaliplatin is cost-effective versus FL alone in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer. This article illustrates how one could design and implement a real-world cost-effectiveness study to yield internally valid results that could also be generalisable.","[van Gils, Chantal W.

It is shown that the expected present value of total operating costs up to default H, as a generalization of the classical Gerber-Shiu function, contains more non-trivial quantities than those covered in Cai et al. (2009), such as all moments of the discounted claim costs until ruin. However, it does not appear that the Gerber-Shiu function 0 with a generalized penalty function which additionally depends on the surplus level immediately after the second last claim before ruin (Cheung et al., 2010a) is contained in H. This motivates us to investigate an even more general function Z from which both H and can be retrieved as special cases. Using a matrix version of Dickson-Hipp operator (Feng, 2009b), it is shown that Z satisfies a Markov renewal equation and hence admits a general solution. Applications to other related problems such as the matrix scale function, the minimum and maximum surplus levels before ruin are given as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In our setting, transaction costs may be random, time-dependent, have jumps and the preferences of the agents are modeled by multivariate expected utility functions. We provide a complete characterization of efficient portfolios, generalizing earlier results of Dybvig (Rev Financ Stud 1: 67-88, 1988) and Jouini and Kallal (J Econ Theory 66: 178-197, 1995). We basically show that a portfolio is efficient if and only if it is cyclically anticomonotonic with respect to at least one consistent price system that prices it. Finally, we introduce the notion of utility price of a given contingent claim as the minimal amount of a given initial portfolio allowing any agent to reach the claim by trading, and give a dual representation of it as the largest proportion of the market price necessary for all agents to reach the same expected utility level.","[Campi, Luciano] Univ Paris 13, LAGA, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France; [Campi, Luciano] Univ Paris 13, CREST, Malakoff, France; [Jouini, Elyes] Univ Paris 09, IFD, Paris, France; [Jouini, Elyes] Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, F-75775 Paris, France; [Jouini, Elyes] Inst Univ France, Paris, France; [Porte, Vincent] Credit Agricole SA, Risk Management Grp, Paris, France",Universite Paris 13; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Institut Universitaire de France,"Campi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, LAGA, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",campi@math.univ-paris13.fr,"Campi, Luciano/L-4062-2016","Campi, Luciano/0000-0002-3956-6795; Jouini, Elyes/0000-0003-2506-1726",,,,,30,3,3,2,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

This paper considers one possible explanation: that the structure of existing microfinance contracts may discourage risky but high-expected-return investments. To explore this possibility, I develop a theory that unifies models of investment choice, informal risk-sharing, and formal financial contracts. I then test the predictions of this theory using a series of experiments with clients of a large microfinance institution in India. The experiments confirm the theoretical predictions that joint liability creates two potential inefficiencies. First, borrowers free-ride on their partners, making risky investments without compensating partners for this risk. Second, the addition of peer-monitoring overcompensates, leading to sharp reductions in risk-taking and profitability. Equity-like financing, in which partners share both the benefits and risks of more profitable projects, overcomes both of these inefficiencies and merits further testing in the field.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fischer, G (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",g.fischer@lse.ac.uk,,,Russell Sage Foundation; George and Obie Shultz Fund; National Science Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H010742/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H010742/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Russell Sage Foundation; George and Obie Shultz Fund; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I would like to thank Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Antoinette Schoar for advice and encouragement throughout this research.

Practitioners often use empirical methods that rely heavily on expert opinions. We propose approaches not depending on an expert's advice. We analyze the mortality as a function of both the age of occurrence of the claim and the duration of the care. LTC claimants are marked by a relatively complex mortality pattern. Hence, rather than using parametric approaches or models with expert opinions, adaptive local likelihood methods allow us to extract the information from the data more pertinently. We characterize a locally adaptive smoothing pointwise method using the intersection of confidence intervals rule, as well as a global method using local bandwidth correction factors. The latter is an extension of the adaptive kernel method proposed by Gavin et al. (1995) to likelihood techniques. We vary the amount of smoothing in a location-dependent manner and allow adjustments based on the reliability of the data. Tests, and single indices summarizing the lifetime probability distribution are used to compare the graduated series obtained by adaptive local kernel-weighted log-likelihoods to p-spline and local likelihood models.

In a recent paper, Sayginsoy and Vogelsang (2011, Econometric Theory 27, 992-1025) (SV) show that tests based on fixed-b asymptotics provide a useful solution to this problem in the case where the shocks may be either weakly dependent or display strong dependence within the near-unit-root class. In this paper we analyze the performance of these tests when the shocks may be fractionally integrated, an alternative model paradigm that allows for either weak or strong dependence in the shocks. We demonstrate that the fixed-b trend break statistics converge to well-defined limit distributions under both the null and local alternatives in this case (and retain consistency against fixed alternatives), but that these distributions depend on the fractional integration parameter delta. As a result, it is only when delta is either zero or one that the SV critical values yield correctly sized tests. Consequently, we propose a procedure that employs delta-adaptive critical values to remove the size distortions in the SV test. In addition, use of delta-adaptive critical values also allows us to consider a simplification of the SV test that is (asymptotically) correctly sized across delta but can also provide a significant increase in power over the standard SV test when delta = 1.","[Iacone, Fabrizio] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Leybourne, Stephen J.; Taylor, A.

We show that FSE priors are topologically generic, contrary to the result of Heifetz and Neeman (2006) that FSE is generically impossible, both geometrically and measure-theoretically. Instead of using the BDP approach or convex combinations of priors adopted in Heifetz and Neeman (2006), we prove our genericity results by showing a robustness property of CremerMcLean mechanisms.","[Chen, Yi-Chun] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Xiong, Siyang] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA",National University of Singapore; Rice University,"Chen, YC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",ecsycc@nus.edu.sg; xiong@rice.edu,"Chen, Yi-Chun/AAG-6589-2019","Xiong, Siyang/0009-0004-8393-0058","National Science Foundation [SES-1227620]; Singapore Ministry of Education [1]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1227620] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank the editor and five anonymous referees for insightful comments which have greatly improved the paper.

Recently, considerable efforts have been made to detect chaos and fractal long-memory in finance. While evidence supporting fractal scaling in finance has been accumulating, it is now generally thought that financial time series may not be modeled by chaos or noisy chaos, since the estimated Lyapunov exponent (LE) is negative. A negative LE amounts to a negative Kolmogorov entropy, and thus implies simple regular dynamics of the economy. This is at odds with the general observation that the economy is highly complicated due to nonlinear and stochastic interactions among component systems and hierarchical regulations in the world economy. To resolve this dilemma, and to provide an effective means of characterizing fractal long-memory properties in non-stationary economic time series, we employ a multiscale complexity measure, the scale-dependent Lyapunov exponent (SDLE), to characterize economic time series. SDLE cannot only unambiguously distinguish low-dimensional chaos from noise, but also detect high-dimensional and intermittent chaos, as well as effectively deal with non-stationarity. With SDLE, we are able to show that the reported negative LE may correspond to large-scale convergence, but not imply the absence of small-scale divergence or noisy chaos in the world economy. Using US foreign exchange rate data as examples, we further show how SDLE can readily characterize fractal, persistent or anti-persistent long-range correlations in economic time series.","[Gao, Jianbo] PMB Intelligence LLC, W Lafayette, IN 47996 USA; [Hu, Jing] Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA; [Tung, Wen-Wen] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Zheng, Yi] Kellogg Grp LLC, New York, NY 10006 USA",Affymetrix; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Gao, JB (通讯作者)，PMB Intelligence LLC, POB 2077, W Lafayette, IN 47996 USA.",jbgao@pmbintelligence.com,,,"NSF [CMMI-0825311, 0826119]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1031958] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [0826119] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",The authors thank Professors Yenn-Ru Chen and Sheng-Kwang Hwang at the National Chung Cheng University of Taiwan for many useful discussions.

While all tests are asymptotically robust against distributional mis-specification, their finite sample behaviour may be sensitive to the spatial layout. To overcome this shortcoming, standardized LM tests are suggested. Monte Carlo results show that the new tests possess good finite sample properties. An important observation made throughout this study is that the LM tests for spatial dependence need to be both mean- and variance-adjusted for good finite sample performance to be achieved. The former is, however, often neglected in the literature.","[Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Yang, Zhenlin] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Syracuse University; Syracuse University; Singapore Management University,"Baltagi, BH (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",bbaltagi@maxwell.syr.edu; zlyang@smu.edu.sg,"YANG, Zhenlin/D-1453-2009","YANG, Zhenlin/0000-0002-3390-1329; Baltagi, Badi/0000-0003-0469-4479",Singapore Management University [C244/MSS11E006],Singapore Management University(Singapore Management University),"We are grateful to the Co-Editor, Oliver Linton, and the anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

This so-called Random Regret Minimization (RRM) approach forms an alternative to the dominant Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach. The RRM approach is able to model semi-compensatory choice behaviour and compromise effects, while being as parsimonious and formally tractable as the RUM approach. Objectives Our objectives were to introduce the RRM modelling approach to healthcare-related decisions, and to investigate its usefulness in this domain. Methods Using data from DCEs aimed at determining valuations of attributes of osteoporosis drug treatments and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations, we empirically compared RRM models, RUM models and Hybrid RUM-RRM models in terms of goodness of fit, parameter ratios and predicted choice probabilities. Results In terms of model fit, the RRM model did not outperform the RUM model significantly in the case of the osteoporosis DCE data (p = 0.21), whereas in the case of the HPV DCE data, the Hybrid RUM-RRM model outperformed the RUM model (p < 0.05). Differences in predicted choice probabilities between RUM models and (Hybrid RUM-) RRM models were small. Derived parameter ratios did not differ significantly between model types, but trade-offs between attributes implied by the two models can vary substantially. Conclusion Differences in model fit between RUM, RRM and Hybrid RUM-RRM were found to be small. Although our study did not show significant differences in parameter ratios, the RRM and Hybrid RUM-RRM models did feature considerable differences in terms of the trade-offs implied by these ratios. In combination, our results suggest that RRM and Hybrid RUM-RRM modelling approach hold the potential of offering new and policy-relevant insights for health researchers and policy makers.","[de Bekker-Grob, Esther W.] Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, Dept Publ Hlth, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Chorus, Caspar G.] Delft Univ Technol, Transport & Logist Grp, Delft, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Delft University of Technology,"de Bekker-Grob, EW (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, Dept Publ Hlth, POB 2040, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",e.debekker@erasmusmc.nl,"Chorus, Caspar/K-6667-2012","Chorus, Caspar/0000-0002-6380-4853","Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC - University Medical Centre Rotterdam; The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWO]; Talent Scheme Veni Grant [451-10-001]","Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC - University Medical Centre Rotterdam; The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWO]; Talent Scheme Veni Grant","The authors would like to thank the respondents for filling in the DCE questionnaires; Marie-Louise Essink-Bot and Ewout Steyerberg for their support in conducting the osteoporosis drug treatment DCE study; and Ida Korfage and Robine Hofman for the data collection for the HPV vaccination DCE study.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the evidence review group (ERG). This article presents a summary of the manufacturer's submission, the ERG report and the subsequent development of NICE guidance for the use of dabigatran within the UK National Health Service. Dabigatran was granted marketing authorisation by the European Medicines Agency for a sequential dosing regimen (DBG sequential), in which patients under 80 years are treated with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (DBG150) and patients 80 years and over are given dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (DBG110). NICE decisions are bound by the marketing authorisation; therefore, the decision problem faced by the committee was whether the DBG sequential regimen was effective and cost-effective compared with warfarin or aspirin for patients with non-valvular AF and one or more risk factors. The RE-LY trial, a large multi-centre non-inferiority randomised clinical trial, was the primary source of clinical evidence. DBG150 was shown to be non-inferior, and subsequently superior to warfarin, for the primary outcome of all stroke/systemic embolism. DBG110 was found to be non-inferior to warfarin. Results were presented for a post hoc subgroup analysis for patients under and over 80 years of age, where DBG110 showed a statistically significant reduction of haemorrhagic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage in comparison to warfarin in patients over 80 years of age. This post hoc subgroup analysis by age was the basis for the licensed DBG sequential regimen. The economic evaluation compared the costs and outcomes of DBG110, DBG150 and DBG sequential against warfarin, aspirin, and aspirin plus clopidogrel. Across the three dosing regimens, dabigatran was associated with greater costs and better health outcomes than warfarin; however, DBG150 offered the most benefits and dominated DBG110 and DBG sequential (i.e. less costly and more effective). The cost-effectiveness of DBG150 was less favourable for patients well controlled on warfarin. In the first appraisal meeting, the committee issued a 'minded no' decision until additional analyses on the licensed DBG sequential regimen were presented by the manufacturer. These additional analyses indicated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the DBG sequential regimen compared with warfarin ranged from 8,388 pound to 18,987 pound per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained depending on the level of monitoring costs assumed for warfarin. Patients on warfarin would need to be within therapeutic range 83-85 % of the time for the ICER to exceed 30,000 pound per additional QALY. Following consideration of the additional evidence and the responses from a large number of consultees and commentators, the committee recommended dabigatran as DBG sequential as an option for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular AF with one or more risk factors for ischaemic stroke.","[Faria, Rita; Spackman, Eldon; Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Burch, Jane; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Corbacho, Belen] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York Trials Unit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Todd, Derick] Liverpool Heart & Chest Hosp, Inst Cardiovasc Med & Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Pepper, Chris] Leeds Gen Infirm, Yorkshire Hlth Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Liverpool Heart & Chest Hospital; University of Leeds; Leeds General Infirmary,"Faria, R (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",rita.nevesdefaria@york.ac.uk,"Todd, Derick/ABD-2818-2020; Faria, Rita/H-3198-2019; MUÑOZ, ROSA ANA/H-3964-2018","Faria, Rita/0000-0003-3410-1435; Spackman, David Eldon/0000-0001-8558-5973; fattahi, elahe/0000-0002-8626-9566",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [09/43]; Boehringer Ingelheim; Bayer,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Boehringer Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim); Bayer(Bayer AG),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 09/43) and was as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment (HTA).

The Aberdeen Health Technology Assessment Group were commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The objective of this paper is to summarize the independent review and critique of the evidence submitted for the consideration of the NICE Appraisal Committee and NICE's subsequently issued guidance. The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the manufacturer's submission to NICE. The ERG also independently searched for relevant evidence and modified the manufacturer's decision analytic model to examine the impact of altering some of the key assumptions. For progression-free survival (PFS), there was a statistically significant longer survival for pazopanib compared with placebo (as assessed by the ERG, based upon the original manufacturer submission with a clinical cut-off date of 23 May 2008) [median 11.1 vs. 2.8 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.40; 95 % CI 0.27, 0.60]. Data from the indirect comparison suggested that pazopanib had a greater survival than interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) [HR 0.512; 95 % CI 0.326, 0.802] but provided no evidence of any difference compared with sunitinib (HR 0.949; 95 % CI 0.575, 1.568). With regard to overall survival, 64 % (n = 99) of patients in the pazopanib arm and 63 % (n = 49) of patients in the placebo arm had died and a total of 51 % (n = 40) of placebo patients had crossed over to receive pazopanib. Although data were provided on an intention-to-treat basis, crossover between therapies made such data difficult to interpret. There was no evidence of any statistically significant difference between pazopanib and best supportive care (HR 0.501; 95 % CI 0.136, 2.348). In the indirect comparison, there were no statistically significant differences between pazopanib and IFN-a. (HR 0.627; 95 % CI 0.173, 2.269) or between pazopanib and sunitinib (HR 0.969; 95 % CI 0.359, 2.608). Based upon the work presented including a 12.5 % discount for pazopanib, sunitinib was extendedly dominated by a combination of pazopanib and IFN-alpha. As a consequence, the incremental cost per QALY for pazopanib versus IFN-alpha was (sic)38,925. The results were not greatly altered over the range of univariate deterministic sensitivity analyses conducted by the manufacturer but pair-wise probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that given a threshold value of 30,000, there is a 54 % probability that pazopanib was preferred to sunitinib, 40 % chance against IFN-alpha and 47 % chance against best supportive care. The Appraisal Committee concluded that pazopanib should be recommended as a first-line treatment option for people with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have not received prior cytolcine therapy and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and if the manufacturer provides pazopanib with a 12. 5 % discount on the list price and provides a possible future rebate linked to the outcome of the head-to-head COMPARZ trial, as agreed under the terms of the patient access scheme and to be confirmed when the COMPARZ trial data are made available.","[Kilonzo, Mary; Vale, Luke] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Appl Hlth Sci, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Hislop, Jenni; Elders, Andrew; Fraser, Cynthia; Mowatt, Graham; Vale, Luke] Univ Aberdeen, Unit Inst Appl Hlth Sci, Hlth Serv Res, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Bissett, Donald] Aberdeen Royal Infirm, Dept Clin Oncol, Aberdeen, Scotland; [McClinton, Samuel] Aberdeen Royal Infirm, Dept Urol, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"Kilonzo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Inst Appl Hlth Sci, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Polwarth Bldg, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.",midlonzo@abdn.ac.uk,"Elders, Andrew/N-4195-2015","Elders, Andrew/0000-0003-4172-4702; Vale, Luke/0000-0001-8574-8429","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [08/220/01]; Chief Scientist Office [HERU1, HERU2, HSRU1] Funding Source: researchfish",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 08/220/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment (HTA).

The benefits of a health intervention may be underestimated if spillover effects on family members are not captured, resulting in inaccurate conclusions of economic evaluations. Objective To provide an estimate of, and to summarize measurement approaches for, the spillover disutility of illness on family members, relatives, and caregivers, through a systematic review of the literature. Methods The medical (PubMED), psychology (PsycINFO), and economics (EconLit) literatures were searched from inception through February 2012 for published studies measuring spillover disutility of illness on family members and caregivers. Inclusion criteria were (1) studies using preference-based measures of health-related quality of life, and (2) studies reporting spillover disutility, or (3) studies reporting data from which a spillover disutility could be inferred. Results Fifteen studies were included in this review: seven reported estimates of spillover disutility and eight reported data from which disutility could be inferred. Three studies found no disutility associated with spillover, whereas 12 found measurable effects as large as -0.718 (and two found evidence of positive spillover in subsets of their samples). Generic (indirect) utility instruments were primarily used to measure spillover, including the EQ-5D, QWB, and HUI (n = 13), though two studies used modified versions of the time trade-off technique. Illnesses studied included childhood disorders (e.g., spina bifida, congenital malformations), diseases of the elderly (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and dementia), physically disabling conditions (e.g., arthritis, multiple sclerosis), and medical conditions such as cancer and stroke. The persons affected by spillover included parents, grandparents, spouses/partners, other family caregivers, and household members. Conclusions There is a limited literature on the spillover disutility of illness on family members and caregivers, providing some specific estimates of a generally small, negative effect for particular conditions and individuals. Measurement methods vary across studies and a consensus approach has not yet been reached. Evidence suggests that the inclusion of spillover effects in economic evaluations would increase the relative effectiveness of interventions that address conditions with spillover compared to those without, though such differential benefits may be limited to such specific circumstances.","[Wittenberg, Eve] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Decis Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Prosser, Lisa A.] Univ Michigan Hlth Syst, Div Gen Pediat, Child Hlth Evaluat & Res Unit, Ann Arbor, MI USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Assume that the insurer's surplus process is approximated by a Brownian motion with drift, the insurer can purchase excess-of-loss reinsurance and invest his (or her) surplus in a financial market consisting of one risk-free asset and one risky asset whose price is modeled by a CEV model, and the objective of the insurer is to maximize the expected exponential utility from terminal wealth. Two problems are studied, one being a reinsurance-investment problem and the other being an investment-only problem. Explicit expressions for optimal strategies and optimal value functions of the two problems are derived by stochastic control approach and variable change technique.

Unlike Kyle's assumption that the quantity traded by the noise traders is independent of the asset value, we assume that the noise traders are able to correlate their trade with the true price. This has several implications for the equilibrium, one being that the informed trader's expected profits decrease as the noise traders' ability to correlate positively improve. In the limit, the noise traders do not lose on average, and the informed trader makes zero expected profits. When the correlation is negative, we interpret this as manipulation.

Therefore, the CDR has become a central object of interest under new solvency regulation. In current practice, simple methods based on the first two moments of the CDR are implemented to find a proxy for the distribution of the CDR. Such approximations based on the first two moments are rather rough and may fail to appropriately describe the shape of the distribution of the CDR. In this paper we provide an analysis of higher moments of the CDR. Within a Bayes chain ladder framework we consider two different models for which it is possible to derive analytical solutions for the higher moments of the CDR. Based on higher moments we can e.g. calculate the skewness and the excess kurtosis of the distribution of the CDR and obtain refined approximations.

The literature was searched for economic evaluations of influenza vaccination injection in healthy working adults in the US published since 1995. Ten evaluations described in nine papers were identified. These were synopsized and their results evaluated, the basic structure of all evaluations was ascertained, and sensitivity of outcomes to changes in parameter values were explored using a decision model. Areas to improve economic evaluations were noted. Eight of nine evaluations with credible economic outcomes were favourable to vaccination, representing a statistically significant result compared with a proportion of 50% that would be expected if vaccination and no vaccination were economically equivalent. Evaluations shared a basic structure, but differed considerably with respect to cost components, assumptions, methods, and parameter estimates. Sensitivity analysis indicated that changes in parameter values within the feasible range, individually or simultaneously, could reverse economic outcomes. Given stated misgivings, the methods of estimating influenza reduction ascribed to vaccination must be researched to confirm that they produce accurate and reliable estimates. Research is also needed to improve estimates of the costs per case of influenza illness and the costs of vaccination. Based on their assumptions, the reviewed papers collectively appear to support the economic benefits of influenza vaccination of healthy adults. Yet the underlying assumptions, methods and parameter estimates themselves warrant further research to confirm they are accurate, reliable and appropriate to economic evaluation purposes.",,,"Hogan, TJ (通讯作者)，81 Overlook Rd, Morristown, NJ 07960 USA.",thogan@me.com,,,,,,,24,4,4,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,5,,,,,355,371,,10.2165/11596890-000000000-00000,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,937FX,22462695.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303645500001,0

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors have been shown to effectively treat and maintain remission in patients with moderately to severely active RA compared with conventional agents. The high acquisition cost of TNF-alpha inhibitors prohibits access, which mandates economic investigations into their affordability. The lack of head-to-head comparisons between these agents makes it difficult to determine which agent is the most cost effective. Objective: This study aimed to determine which TNF-alpha inhibitor was the most cost-effective agent for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA from the US healthcare payer's perspective. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to analyse the cost utility of five TNF-alpha inhibitors (in combination with methotrexate [+MTX]) versus MTX monotherapy using Bayesian methods for evidence synthesis. The model had a cycle length of 3 months and an overall time horizon of 5 years. Transition probabilities and utility scores were based on published studies. Total direct costs were adjusted to year 2009 $US using the medical component of the Consumer Price Index. All costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Patient response to the different strategies was determined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)50 criteria. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed to test the robustness of the base-case scenario. The base-case scenario was changed to ACR20 criteria (scenario 1) and ACR70 criteria (scenario 2) to determine the model's robustness. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and cost-effectiveness frontiers were used to estimate the cost-effectiveness probability of each treatment strategy. A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was defined as three times the US GDP per capita ($US139 143 per additional QALY gained). Primary results were presented as incremental cost-effective ratios (ICERs). Results: Etanercept+MTX was the most cost-effective treatment strategy in the base-case scenario up to a WTP threshold of $US546 449 per QALY gained. At a WTP threshold of greater than $US546 499 per QALY gained, certolizumab+MTX was the most cost-effective treatment strategy. One-way analyses showed that the base-case scenario was sensitive to the probability of achieving ACR50 criteria for MTX and each TNF-alpha inhibitor, and changes in the utility score for patients who achieved the ACR50 criteria. With the exception of infliximab, all of the TNF-alpha inhibitors were sensitive to drug cost per cycle. In the scenario analyses, certolizumab+MTX was a dominant treatment strategy using ACR20 criteria, but etanercept+MTX was a dominant treatment strategy using ACR70 criteria. Conclusions: Etanercept+MTX was a cost-effective treatment strategy in the base-case scenario; however, the model was sensitive to parameter uncertainties and ACR response criteria. Although Bayesian methods were used to determine transition probabilities, future studies will need to focus on head-to-head comparisons of multiple TNF-alpha inhibitors to provide valid comparisons.","[Nguyen, Christine M.; Bounthavong, Mark; Mendes, Margaret A.

Thus, we extend the work of Moller (2001a) in several directions: from risk minimization (which is done under a martingale measure) to local risk minimization (which is done under an arbitrary measure), from single claims to payment processes, from complete financial markets to possibly incomplete financial markets, from a single risky asset to several risky assets, and from finite state spaces to general state spaces. Moreover, we show that, when tradable financial assets are independent of mortality, a locally risk-minimizing hedging strategy for most claims in the combined financial and mortality market (such as those arising from equity-indexed annuities) may be expressed as the product of two simpler locally risk-minimizing hedging strategies: one for a purely financial claim, the other for a traditional (i.e. non-equity-linked) life-insurance claim. Finally, we also show, under general assumptions, that the minimal measure for the combined market is the product of the minimal measure for the financial market and the physical measure for the mortality.

Methods: A lifetime Markov model of the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical disease was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of a hypothetical HPV vaccine. Published data on cervical cancer incidence and mortality and prevalence of pre-cursor lesions were used as endpoints to calibrate the age- and HPV-type-specific transition probabilities between health states using the Nelder-Mead simplex method of calibration. A conventional probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to assess uncertainty in vaccine efficacy, cost and utility estimates. To quantify the uncertainty around calibrated transition probabilities, a second PSA (calibration PSA) was performed using 25 distinct combinations of objective functions and starting simplexes. Results: The initial calibration produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $US4300 per QALY for vaccination compared with no vaccination, and the conventional PSA gave a 95% credible interval of dominant to $US9800 around this estimate (2005 values). The 95% credible interval for the ICERs in the calibration PSA ranged from $US1000 to $US37 700. Conclusions: Compared with a conventional PSA, the calibration PSA results reveal a greater level of uncertainty in cost-effectiveness results. Sensitivity analyses around model calibration should be performed to account for uncertainty arising from the calibration process.","[Taylor, Douglas C.

Besides granting robustness, this allows us to verify the impact of a break in more than one point of the conditional distribution. The quantile regression test is then repeatedly implemented as a diagnostic tool to uncover partial or spurious breaks. The test is also implemented to measure the contribution of each explanatory variable to the instability of the regression coefficients, thus finding which one of the different possible sources of breaks linked to the nature of the explanatory variables is the most effective. A real data example of exchange rates shows the presence of a time-driven break, but only at the lower quartile, while the analysis of the explanatory variable excludes its involvement in the break. Since the asymptotic distribution of the OLS test for structural change depends on i.i.d. normal errors and on the exogeneity of the explanatory variables, a Monte Carlo study analyses the behavior of OLS and quantile regression tests for structural changes with lagged endogenous variables, non-normal errors, spurious or partial breaks, and misspecification.","Univ Cassino, Dept Econ, I-80122 Naples, Italy",University of Cassino,"Furno, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino, Dept Econ, Via Orazio 27-D, I-80122 Naples, Italy.",furnoma@tin.it,,"FURNO, Marilena/0000-0001-6635-8476",,,,,18,1,1,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Yet, a distinct literature exists that shows that non-linear econometric frameworks, such as Markov switching, are also natural tools to compute optimal portfolios arising from the existence of good and bad market states. This paper examines whether and how simple VARs can produce portfolio rules similar to those obtained under a simple Markov switching, by studying the effects of expanding both the order of the VAR and the number/selection of predictor variables included. In a typical stock-bond strategic asset allocation problem for UK data, we compute the out-of-sample certainty equivalent returns for a wide range of VARs and compare these measures of performance with those of non-linear models. We conclude that most VARs cannot produce portfolio rules, hedging demands or (net of transaction costs) out-of-sample performances that approximate those obtained from simple non-linear frameworks.","[Guidolin, Massimo] Bocconi Univ, Manchester Business Sch, CAIR, Milan, Italy; [Guidolin, Massimo] Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Milan, Italy; [Hyde, Stuart] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; University of Manchester,"Hyde, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",stuart.hyde@mbs.ac.uk,"Hyde, Stuart/HCH-3878-2022","Hyde, Stuart/0000-0003-0224-5442",,,,,30,1,3,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We accomplish this task by using indirect inference to estimate a structural consumption-savings model, in which individuals both learn about the nature of their income process and partly insure shocks via informal mechanisms. In this framework, we estimate (i) the degree of partial insurance, (ii) the extent of systematic differences in income growth rates, (iii) the precision with which individuals know their own income growth rates when they begin their working lives, (iv) the persistence of typical labor income shocks, (v) the tightness of borrowing constraints, and (vi) the amount of measurement error in the data. In implementing indirect inference, we find that an auxiliary model that approximates the true structural equations of the model (which are not estimable) works very well, with negligible small sample bias. The main substantive findings are that income shocks are moderately persistent, systematic differences in income growth rates are large, individuals have substantial amounts of information about their income growth rates, and about one-half of income shocks are smoothed via partial insurance. Putting these findings together, the amount of uninsurable lifetime income risk that individuals perceive is substantially smaller than what is typically assumed in calibrated macroeconomic models with incomplete markets.","[Guvenen, Fatih] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Mineapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Guvenen, Fatih; Smith, Anthony A., Jr.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Smith, Anthony A., Jr.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University,"Guvenen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 4-101 Hanson Hall,1925 South 4th St, Mineapolis, MN 55455 USA.",guvenen@umn.edu; tony.smith@yale.edu,"Guvenen, Fatih/GSN-2353-2022",,NSF [SES-0649437],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"An earlier version of this paper was circulated under the title Inferring Labor Income Risk From Economic Choices: An Indirect Inference Approach.

Comparisons were between patients receiving no chemotherapy, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and FOLFOX (5-FU + oxaliplatin). A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Patients (a parts per thousand yen65 years) with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III colon cancer at diagnosis in 2004-2009 were identified. The 3-way propensity score matched sample included 3,534 patients. Effectiveness was measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Medicare costs (2010 US dollars) were estimated from diagnosis until death or end of study. FOLFOX patients experienced 6.06 median life-years and 4.73 QALYs. Patients on 5-FU had 5.75 median life-years and 4.50 median QALYs, compared to 3.42 and 2.51, respectively, for the no chemotherapy patients. Average total healthcare costs ranged from US$85,422 for no chemotherapy to US$168,628 for FOLFOX. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for 5-FU versus no chemotherapy were US$17,131 per life-year gained and US$20,058 per QALY gained. ICERs for FOLFOX versus 5-FU were US$139,646 per life-year gained and US$188,218 per QALY gained. Results appear to be sensitive to age, suggesting that FOLFOX performs better for patients 65-69 and 80+ years old while 5-FU appears most effective and cost effective for the age groups 70-74 and 75-79 years.

We consider identification of demand, identification of changes in aggregate consumer welfare, identification of marginal costs, identification of firms' marginal cost functions, and discrimination between alternative models of firm conduct. We explore two complementary approaches. The first demonstrates identification under the same nonparametric instrumental variables conditions required for identification of regression models. The second treats demand and supply in a system of nonparametric simultaneous equations, leading to constructive proofs exploiting exogenous variation in demand shifters and cost shifters. We also derive testable restrictions that provide the first general formalization of Bresnahan's (1982) intuition for empirically distinguishing between alternative models of oligopoly competition.

Options are written on a single underlying asset but may have different characteristics of strikes, maturities, and vesting dates. Our motivation is to model the decision faced by an employee who is granted options periodically on the stock of her company, and who is not permitted to trade this stock. The first part of our study considers the optimal exercise of single options. We prove results under minimal assumptions and give several counterexamples where these assumptions fail-describing the shape and nesting properties of the exercise regions. The second part of the study considers portfolios of options with differing characteristics. The main result is that options with comonotonic strike, maturity, and vesting date should be exercised in order of increasing strike. It is true under weak assumptions on preferences and requires no assumptions on prices. Potentially the exercise ordering result can significantly reduce the complexity of computations in a particular example. This is illustrated by solving the resulting dynamic programming problem in a constant absolute risk aversion utility indifference model.","[Henderson, Vicky] Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst, Oxford OX2 6ED, England; [Sun, Jia] China Credit Rating Co, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Whalley, A.

We identify three natural assets that appear in pricing of the Asian options, namely a stock S, a zero coupon bond B-T with maturity T, and an abstract asset A (an average asset) that pays off a weighted average of the stock price number of units of a dollar at time T. It turns out that each of these assets has its own martingale measure, allowing us to obtain Black-Scholes type formulas for the fixed strike and the floating strike Asian options. The model independent formulas are analogous to the Black-Scholes formula for the plain vanilla options; they are expressed in terms of probabilities under the corresponding martingale measures that the Asian option will end up in the money. Computation of these probabilities is relevant for hedging. In contrast to the plain vanilla options, the probabilities for the Asian options do not admit a simple closed form solution. However, we show that it is possible to obtain the numerical values in the geometric Brownian motion model efficiently, either by solving a partial differential equation numerically, or by computing the Laplace transform. Models with stochastic volatility or pure jump models can be also priced within the Black-Scholes framework for the Asian options.","Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Vecer, J (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",j.vecer@fs.de,"Vecer, Jan/H-9917-2012","Vecer, Jan/0000-0002-1501-4646",,,,,18,13,13,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

The PREGNANT trial tested the efficacy of vaginal progesterone (VP) 8 % gel in reducing the likelihood of PTB among women with a short cervix. We calculated the costs and cost effectiveness of VP gel versus placebo using decision analytic models informed by PREGNANT patient-level data. PREGNANT enrolled 459 pregnant women with a cervical length of 10-20 mm and randomized them to either VP 8 % gel or placebo. We used a cost model to estimate the total cost of treatment per mother and a cost-effectiveness model to estimate the cost per PTB averted with VP gel versus placebo. Patient-level trial data informed model inputs and included PTB rates in low- and high-risk women in each study group at < 28 weeks gestation, 28-31, 32-36, and a parts per thousand yen37 weeks. Cost assumptions were based on 2010 US healthcare services reimbursements. The cost model was validated against patient-level data. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the cost-effectiveness model. The estimated cost per mother was $US23,079 for VP gel and $US36,436 for placebo. The cost-effectiveness model showed savings of $US24,071 per PTB averted with VP gel. VP gel realized cost savings and cost effectiveness in 79 % of simulations. Based on findings from PREGNANT, VP gel was associated with cost savings and cost effectiveness compared with placebo. Future trials designed to include cost metrics are needed to better understand the value of VP.","[Pizzi, Laura T.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Pizzi, Laura T.] Jefferson Sch Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Seligman, Neil S.] Univ Rochester, Div Maternal Fetal Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Med Ctr,Sch Med & Dent, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Baxter, Jason K.; Berghella, Vincenzo] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Div Maternal Fetal Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Jefferson Med Coll, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Jutkowitz, Eric] Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Jefferson University; University of Rochester; Jefferson University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Pizzi, LT (通讯作者)，Jefferson Sch Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice, 901 Walnut St,Suite 901, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",laura.pizzi@jefferson.edu,"seligman, neil/HHN-6019-2022","Berghella, Vincenzo/0000-0003-2854-0239",Actavis,Actavis,"Watson Pharmaceuticals (now Actavis) is the sponsor of this economic analysis.

Methods A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, EconLit and the Cochrane Library databases used free text and Medical Subject Headings terms including psoriasis, biologic therapies indicated for psoriasis, and all types of economic evaluations. Two researchers performed 2-level abstract screening for articles meeting pre-specified inclusion criteria. Assumptions about treatment pathways after first-line biologic failure in the cost-effectiveness models were analysed. A second systematic search was performed for psoriasis clinical practice guidelines. Sequence assumptions were compared with treatment guideline recommendations. Results Of 25 cost-effectiveness modelling studies identified, ten estimated the incremental cost per responder; time horizons varied (12 weeks-18 months) and treatment sequencing was not considered. In 15 studies where treatment sequencing was considered, with time horizons up to 10 years, five studies included only a switch to nonsystemic therapy or best supportive care after first-line biologic failure. Another five of the 15 treatment-pathway studies were available only as abstracts with no details of the sequence assumptions. In five of the 15 studies, first-line biologic failure was followed by second-line biologic monotherapy, one of the recommendations in current treatment guidelines. In only one of these five studies was the efficacy of the second-line biologic adjusted downwards, compared with first-line treatment. Only one of these studies considered dose titration with a first-line biologic and none combination therapy (biologic plus methotrexate or phototherapy) after first-line biologic failure, as recommended in some treatment guidelines. Conclusions Cost-effectiveness models of first-line biologics for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis either do not include subsequent treatment regimens or include only some of the regimens recommended in current treatment guidelines. Results may be sensitive to assumptions about treatment sequencing and the choice and efficacy of subsequent treatment regimens.","[Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Samuel, Miny; McBride, Doreen] RTI Hlth Solut, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England; [Mallya, Usha G.] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ 07396 USA; [Feldman, Steven R.] Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Winston Salem, NC 27104 USA",Research Triangle Institute; Research Triangle Institute; Novartis; Wake Forest University,"Mauskopf, J (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",jmauskopf@rti.org,"Feldman, Steven R./AAH-6971-2021","Feldman, Steven R./0000-0002-0090-6289; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548",Novartis Pharmaceuticals; RTI Health Solutions; Wyeth/Pfizer; Novartis; Abbott; Amgen; Janssen; Pfizer,Novartis Pharmaceuticals(Novartis); RTI Health Solutions; Wyeth/Pfizer(WyethPfizer); Novartis(Novartis); Abbott(Abbott Laboratories); Amgen(Amgen); Janssen(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Pfizer(Pfizer),"Josephine Mauskopf received funding to conduct this study though a contract between Novartis Pharmaceuticals and her employer, RTI Health Solutions.

The two proposed multivariate CTEs are vector-valued measures with the same dimension as the underlying risk portfolio. As for the multivariate Value-at-Risk measures introduced by Cousin and Di Bernardino (2013), the lower-orthant CTE (resp. the upper-orthant CTE) is constructed from level sets of multivariate distribution functions (resp. of multivariate survival distribution functions). Contrary to allocation measures or systemic risk measures, these measures are also suitable for multivariate risk problems where risks are heterogeneous in nature and cannot be aggregated together. Several properties have been derived. In particular, we show that the proposed multivariate CTEs satisfy natural extensions of the positive homogeneity property, the translation invariance property and the comonotonic additivity property. Comparison between univariate risk measures and components of multivariate CTE is provided. We also analyze how these measures are impacted by a change in marginal distributions, by a change in dependence structure and by a change in risk level. Sub-additivity of the proposed multivariate CTE-s is provided under the assumption that all components of the random vectors are independent.

Since July 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has exhibited non-stationary state transition behavior, including: (1) mean regressive behavior during crisis situations during the Great Depression of the 1930s and again in the crisis of 2008 when the availability of credit was interrupted; (2) strongly bifurcated, or trend persistent behavior from the 1940s through 1975; and (3) more efficient behavior since 1975. The bifurcation dynamic evident in the pre-1975 era is somewhat enhanced by conditional volume and moderate volatility. The bifurcation model is used to develop a quantitative measure of the degree of market efficiency, which indicates that the market has become more efficient, i.e. less trend persistent, since 1975 with the advent of negotiated commissions and computerized trading techniques. Similar findings are presented for the S&P 500 index and the CRSP Value Weighted Index, which represent large capitalization markets.

However, the treatment pattern and economic burden of these patients have not been well-understood. The objective of this study was to examine the patient characteristics, treatment pattern, anticoagulant monitoring, and economic burden of VTE among hospitalized patients in China. Hospitalizations with a diagnosis of VTE [including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)] between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2013 were included. Descriptive analysis was conducted for patients' characteristics, anticoagulant treatment, international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring, and hospitalization cost [in 2013 Chinese yuan (Y) and US dollars (US$)]. Multivariate regressions were performed to assess factors associated with oral anticoagulant use and total costs of inpatient care. A total of 1,047 VTE-related hospitalizations were selected. The sample had a mean age of 62.4 years, with 45.9 % female. About 46.3 % of hospitalizations used heparin only, 35.0 % used warfarin, 0.8 % used rivaroxaban, and 18.0 % did not use anticoagulants. Among hospitalizations where warfarin was used, 90.8 % received at least one INR test and only 30 % had the last INR within the target therapeutic range (2-3) before discharge. The mean (standard deviation) total cost per hospitalization was Y29,114 (43,772) [US$4,757 (7,152)]. PE, VTE as primary diagnosis, female, insurance coverage, anticoagulant treatment, co-morbidities, admission condition, and surgical procedure were significantly associated with inpatient costs. Conventional anticoagulants were most commonly used in the study sample. Under-monitoring and suboptimal care may be an issue for patients treated with warfarin. The average total inpatient cost of VTE-related hospitalizations is high.","[Wu, Eric Q.; Du, Ella Xiaoyan; Li, Nanxin; Tan, Ruoding] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Xie, Jipan] Anal Grp Inc, New York, NY USA; [Wu, Chun] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yuanli] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Analysis Group Inc.; Peking University; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Here, we propose two marked point processes to account for these features. The first approach assumes the points are driven by a stochastic hazard rate modulated by a Markov chain while marks are drawn from a regime-specific distribution. In the second approach, the points are driven by a self-exciting process while marks are drawn from an independent distribution. Within this context, we provide a unified approach to efficiently value catastrophe optionssuch as those embedded in catastrophe bondsand show that our results are within the 95% confidence interval computed using Monte Carlo simulations. Our approach is based on deriving the valuation PIDE and utilizes transforms to provide semi-analytical closed-form solutions.

A statistical characterization of time series was applied to assess dataset variability. Time series were passed through various FANN. Each time series was decomposed in 4 time-scale components using 3-level wavelets, which have been passed also through FANN, and recomposed into a single time series. Daubechies db3 wavelet - Rprop FANN (6-4-1) utilization gave positive results for ozone time series optimizing the exclusive use of the FANN for hourly-recorded time series. Nitrogen dioxide was difficult to model due to time series specificity, but wavelet integration improved FANN performances.

In such a setting, the identified set is itself convex and hence fully characterized by its support function. We provide conditions under which, despite being an infinite dimensional parameter, the support function admits n-consistent regular estimators. A semiparametric efficiency bound is then derived for its estimation, and it is shown that any regular estimator attaining it must also minimize a wide class of asymptotic loss functions. In addition, we show that the plug-in estimator is efficient, and devise a consistent bootstrap procedure for estimating its limiting distribution. The setting we examine is related to an incomplete linear model studied in Beresteanu and Molinari (2008) and Bontemps, Magnac, and Maurin (2012), which further enables us to establish the semiparametric efficiency of their proposed estimators for that problem.","[Kaido, Hiroaki] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Santos, Andres] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Boston University; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Kaido, H (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",hkaido@bu.edu; a2santos@ucsd.edu,,"Kaido, Hiroaki/0000-0003-2849-915X",,,,,40,19,25,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2014,82.0,1,,,,,387,413,,10.3982/ECTA10017,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA7KQ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331276700010,0

Currently, daily and weekly streamflow forecasts are mostly made by the auto-regressive (AR) class of statistical models and do not integrate any quantitative information from long term streamflow forecasts, although the multiscale operational policies (e.g. next day operation rule and long term risk aversion curves) are all connected. Here in this work we offer a new contribution to the realm of streamflow forecast models by exploring the concept of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to connect monthly and daily streamflow forecasts in order to improve the performance of the last. Monthly streamflow forecasts are made here using a periodic auto-regressive exogenous model (PARX), which attempts to capture the persistence of the streamflow in the auto-regressive part and the runoff contribution in the exogenous portion through the use of climate information (e.g. an El Nino based index). Daily streamflow forecasts up to four weeks lead time are obtained from a simple auto-regressive model with seasonally varying coefficients. The multiscale connection is made through Bayesian model averaging of the monthly and daily forecasts, where the posterior probabilities of each model are estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, which accounts for uncertainties and allows the use of a wide variety of model distributions. The model performance is illustrated using 79 years of daily streamflow data from the Itaipu streamflow gauge, located in southern Brazil. The results show that beyond 17 days lead time the monthly forecast models present a higher skill to predict the daily flows. Combining both models through BMA leads to a synergy and an increase in the overall R-2 skill beyond 7 days lead. The proposed approach is also flexible to support monthly streamflow forecasts from different (e.g. physical) models and is the first step in simulating monthly streamflow forecasts coupled with annual simulation of streamflows that considers low frequency variability and climate changes.","Univ Brasilia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Lima, CHR (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Campus Univ Darcy Ribeiro, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",chrlima@unb.br,"Lima, Carlos HR/R-6270-2018","Lima, Carlos HR/0000-0001-8650-0951",,,,,27,0,0,0,3,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,781,792,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600087,0

The method is applied to decomposition of the Earths climate system: on the base of 156 years time series of SST anomalies distributed over the globe (http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.KAPLAN/.EXTENDED/.v2/.ssta/) two climatic modes with essentially different time scales (3-5 and 9-11 years) are separated.

In the empirical application, I use monthly implied volatility surfaces corresponding to the IBEX 35 index. The estimation results show that the extended specification for the sticky strike rule presented in this article better represents the behavior of the implied volatility under this rule. Furthermore, there is not one rule that is the most appropriate at all times to explain the evolution of the implied volatility surface. Depending on the market situation, one rule may be more appropriate than another. In particular, when the underlying asset displays trend, the sticky delta rule tends to prevail against the sticky strike rule.

Previous research has proceeded by accreting intuitive choices of variables to serve as components of stress in financial system or specific markets. In addition, the composition of the financial system itself has not been thoroughly tested by previous studies. Thus, parsing out of the financial system into latent factors that may serve as internally reliable and valid constructs has been left largely to intuition and chance. A valid understanding of the latent factors that form the financial system stress is vital. Yet, the problem is vicious as the dynamics of agent interaction are difficult to trace: the agents exhibit adaptive behavior, and the financial system evolves in response to change. This study conducts an integrative systematic review and empirical analysis of financial stress in an evolving financial system to construct a parsimonious set of causal factors that drive the financial system dynamics. The empirical analysis parses out principal axis factors utilizing longitudinal exploratory factor analysis. The resulting factors' correlational and Granger causality structures are applied via confirmatory factor analysis to test the hypotheses of conditional process analysis on the latent stress factors. Our analysis of empirical validity of current stress measures highlights a number of serious problems with the current a priori stress construction. The empirical validity leads us to posit a new theoretical foundation for a deeper understanding of financial stress-one that can adapt to a change in financial system structure and be useful across financial system of diverse architectures (market-based vs. intermediate) and development (emerging or developed).","[Oet, Mikhail V.] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Supervis & Regulat, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA; [Oet, Mikhail V.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Oet, MV (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Supervis & Regulat, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA.",mikhail.v.oet@clev.frb.org,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1460,1460,,,,,,1,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600164,0

The preliminary results show an influence of the situation, height of the building and surrounding obstacles of each station, with +/- 2 mm of white noise estimated. Stations situated in high buildings show prominent seasonal periodicity with +/- 6 mm amplitude. On the other hand, stations built over the surface or made of concrete have better velocity estimation and less periodicity impact. Furthermore, this study show a preliminary classification of the stations using parameters derived from seasonal periodicities and white noise.","[Sanchez-Alzola, A.] Univ Cadiz, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Jerez De La Fra, Spain; [Borque, M.

For the perpetual case, our result reveals that the optimal stopping region for the option seller depends crucially on the dividend rate d. More precisely, we show that when the penalty is small, there are two critical dividends 0 < d(1) < d(2) < such that the optimal stopping region for the option seller takes one of the following forms: (1) an interval if d < d(1); (2) a singleton if d [d(1), d(2)]; or (3) an empty set if d > d(2). When d [d(1), d(2)], the value function is not continuously differentiable at the optimal stopping boundary for the option seller, therefore our result in the perpetual case cannot be established by the free boundary approach with smooth-fit conditions imposed on both free boundaries. For the finite time horizon case, the dependence of the optimal stopping region for the option seller on the time to maturity is exhibited; more precisely, when both and d are small, we show that there are two critical times 0 < T-1 < T-2 < T, such that the optimal stopping region for the option seller takes one of the following forms: (1) an interval if t < T-1; (2) a singleton if t [T-1, T-2]; or (3) an empty set if t > T-2. In summary, for both the perpetual and the finite horizon cases, we characterize in terms of model parameters how the optimal stopping region for the option seller shrinks when the dividend rate d increases and the time to maturity decreases; these results complete the original work of Emmerling for the perpetual case and Kunita and Seko for the finite maturity case. In addition, for the finite time horizon case, we also extend the probabilistic method for the establishment of existence and regularity results of the classical American option pricing problem to the game option setting. Finally, we characterize the pair of optimal stopping boundaries for both the seller and the buyer as the unique pair of solutions to a couple of integral equations and provide numerical illustrations.","[Yam, S.

Second, under the assumption of independent types (the distribution of each agent's private information is not directly affected by other agents' private information), we show how the budget can be balanced without compromising agents' incentives.

Chronic iron overload can be treated using iron-chelating therapies such as desferrioxamine (DFO), deferiprone (DFP) and deferasirox (DFX) monotherapy, or DFO-DFP combination therapy. This study evaluated the relative cost effectiveness of these regimens over a 5-year timeframe from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective, including personal and social services. A Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the treatment regimens over 5 years. Based on published randomized controlled trial evidence, it was assumed that all four treatment regimens had a comparable effect on serum ferritin concentration (SFC) and liver iron concentration (LIC), and that DFP was more effective for reducing cardiac morbidity and mortality. Published utility scores for route of administration were used, with subcutaneously administered DFO assumed to incur a greater quality of life (QoL) burden than the oral chelators DFP and DFX. Healthcare resource use, drug costs (2010/2011 costs), and utilities associated with adverse events were also considered, with the effect of varying all parameters assessed in sensitivity analysis. Incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated for each treatment, with cost effectiveness expressed as incremental cost per QALY. Assumptions that DFP conferred no cardiac morbidity, mortality, or morbidity and mortality benefit were also explored in scenario analysis. DFP was the dominant strategy in all scenarios modelled, providing greater QALY gains at a lower cost. Sensitivity analysis showed that DFP dominated all other treatments unless the QoL burden associated with the route of administration was greater for DFP than for DFO, which is unlikely to be the case. DFP had > 99 % likelihood of being cost effective against all comparators at a willingness-to-pay threshold of A 20,000 pound per QALY. In this analysis, DFP appeared to be the most cost-effective treatment available for managing chronic iron overload in beta-thalassaemia patients. Use of DFP in these patients could therefore result in substantial cost savings.","[Bentley, Anthony; Gillard, Samantha] Abacus Int, Bicester OX26 6HR, Oxon, England; [Spino, Michael; Connelly, John; Tricta, Fernando] ApoPharma Inc, Toronto, ON M9L 227, Canada; [Spino, Michael] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Bentley, A (通讯作者)，Abacus Int, 6 Talisman Business Ctr,Talisman Rd, Bicester OX26 6HR, Oxon, England.",abentley@abacusint.com,,,ApoPharma Inc.,ApoPharma Inc.,"The authors would like to thank Andrew Platt (Quality Manager, Department of Laboratory Haematology), Dr Paul Telfer (consultant haematologist), Prof. Sunil Bhandhari (consultant nephrologist), and Dr Farrukh Shah (consultant haematologist) for their assistance in validating the model inputs and assumptions.

Prior analyses of PD have not examined costs in patients aged under 65 years, a majority of whom are in the workforce. Our objective was to estimate direct and indirect costs associated with PD in patients under the age of 65 years who are newly diagnosed or have evidence of advanced PD. PD patients were selected from a commercially insured claims database (N > 12,000,000; 1999-2009); workloss data were available for a sub-sample of enrollees. Newly diagnosed patients with evidence of similar disorders were excluded. Patients with evidence of advanced PD disease, including ambulatory assistance device users (PDAAD) and institutionalized (PDINST) patients, as well as newly diagnosed PD patients, were analyzed. Each PD cohort was age-, gender- and region-matched to controls without PD. Direct (i.e. insurer payments to providers) and indirect (i.e. workloss) costs were reported in $US, year 2010 values, and were descriptively compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Patients had excess mean direct PD-related costs of $US4,072 (p < 0.001; N = 781) in the year after diagnosis. The PDAAD cohort (N = 214) had excess direct PD-related costs of $US26,467 (p < 0.001) and the PDINST cohort (N = 156) had excess direct PD-related costs of $US37,410 (p < 0.001) in the year after entering these states. Outpatient care was the most expensive cost source for newly diagnosed patients, while inpatient care was the most expensive for PDAAD and PDINST patients. Excess indirect costs were $US3,311 (p < 0.05; N = 173) in the year after initial diagnosis.

We find that: (i) data reject the more restricted GARCH, IGARCH and FamaFrench models in favor of FIGARCH, (ii) oil return is a significant determinant of every sector's return and/or return volatility, (iii) oil effects are asymmetric for oil returns above and below the thresholds, (iv) asymmetry is stronger when oil return volatility is greater, (v) volatilities of sectoral returns exhibit threshold-based regime shifts, and (vi) oil shock effects follow a hyperbolic, rather than an exponential decay pattern, establishing long-term persistence of shocks.

This holds true in market models in which no equivalent local martingale measure exists but only a square-integrable market price of risk. A new probability measure is constructed, which takes the place of an equivalent local martingale measure. To ensure the existence of the delta hedge, sufficient conditions are derived for the necessary differentiability of expectations indexed over the initial market configuration.

The proposed class of premium principles is quite general in the sense that it encompasses eight of the eleven commonly used premium principles listed in Young (2004). Under the additional assumption that both the insurer and reinsurer are obligated to pay more for larger loss, we show that layer reinsurance is quite robust in the sense that it is always optimal over our assumed risk measures and the prescribed premium principles. We further use the Wang's and Dutch premium principles to illustrate the applicability of our results by deriving explicitly the optimal parameters of the layer reinsurance. These two premium principles are chosen since in addition to satisfying the above three axioms, they exhibit increasing relative risk loading, a desirable property that is consistent with the market convention on reinsurance pricing.

We define T-u,T-z to be the first time that the surplus process drops below a certain level z from the initial surplus u(>z). The time of ruin and the time of absolute ruin are special cases of this stopping time. The generalized Gerber-Shiu function is defined on three random variables: the first time that the surplus drops below z from u, T-u,T-z, the surplus prior to T-u,T-z, and the amount by which the surplus is below z. An explicit expression for the Gerber-Shiu function when u = z is obtained when the credit and debit interest rates are equal, and explicit results for the Gerber-Shiu function under exponential claims are then obtained. Using these results, we investigate the probability that the surplus reaches an upper level without dropping below a lower level and the distribution of the maximum severity of ruin.

The insurer's objective is to maximize the expected utility of the terminal wealth subject to the cointegration dynamics of risky assets and the risk of paying out random liabilities with a compound Poisson process. We solve the continuous-time investment problems for the class of the constant relative risk averse utility function using the framework of the HJB equation. An explicit solution is derived by recognizing an exponential affine form in the derivation process. We then investigate the risk-preference of insurers toward statistical arbitrage from pairs-trading using the analytical results. Although a financial market with cointegrated risky assets implies the existence of statistical arbitrage opportunities, insurers may not be interested in those opportunities due to the social responsibility of a high level of risk aversion. However, if insurers are forced to trade cointegrated assets, the derived optimal solution enhances the investment performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These tests have a null hypothesis of nondominance, with the advantage that, if this null is rejected, then all that is left is dominance. This also leads us to define and focus on restricted stochastic dominance, the only empirically useful form of dominance relation that we can seek to infer in many settings. One testing procedure that we consider is based on an empirical likelihood ratio. The computations necessary for obtaining a test statistic also provide estimates of the distributions under study that satisfy the null hypothesis, on the frontier between dominance and nondominance. These estimates can be used to perform dominance tests that can turn out to provide much improved reliability of inference compared with the asymptotic tests so far proposed in the literature.","[Davidson, Russell] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Davidson, Russell] GREQAM, Marseille, France; [Duclos, Jean-Yves] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Davidson, Russell] McGill Univ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Duclos, Jean-Yves] Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",McGill University; Aix-Marseille Universite; Laval University; Universite de Montreal; McGill University; Laval University,"Davidson, R (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",russell.davidson@mcgill.ca,,,"Canada Research Chair program (Chair in Economics, McGill University); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture; PEP Network of the International Development Research Centre","Canada Research Chair program (Chair in Economics, McGill University); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture; PEP Network of the International Development Research Centre(International Development Research Centre - IDRC)","This research was supported by the Canada Research Chair program (Chair in Economics, McGill University) and by grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture, and the PEP Network of the International Development Research Centre.

In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) can issue guidance to approve the routine use of a health intervention, reject routine use or recommend use within a research programme. These latter recommendations have restricted use to 'only in research' (OIR) or have recommended further research alongside routine use ('approval with research' or AWR). However, it is not currently clear when such recommendations are likely to be made. Objectives This study aims to identify NICE technology appraisals where OIR or AWR recommendations were made and to examine the key considerations that led to those decisions. Methods Draft and final guidance including OIR/AWR recommendations were identified. The documents were reviewed to establish the characteristics of the technology appraisal, the cost effectiveness of the technologies, the key considerations that led to the recommendations and the types of research required. Results In total, 29 final and 31 draft guidance documents included OIR/AWR recommendations up to January 2010. Overall, 86 % of final guidance included OIR recommendations. Of these, the majority were for technologies considered to be cost ineffective (83 %) and the majority of final guidance (66 %) specified the need for further evidence on relative effectiveness. The use of OIR/AWR recommendations is decreasing over time and they have rarely been used in appraisals conducted through the single technology appraisal process. Conclusion NICE has used its ability to recommend technologies within research programmes, although predominantly within the multiple technology appraisal process. OIR recommendations have been most frequently issued for technologies considered cost ineffective and the most frequently cited consideration is uncertainty related to relative effectiveness. Key considerations cited for most AWR recommendations and some OIR recommendations included a need for further evidence on long-term outcomes and adverse effects of treatment.","[Longworth, Louise; Youn, JiHee] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Bojke, Laura; Palmer, Stephen; Griffin, Susan; Spackman, Eldon; Claxton, Karl] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Claxton, Karl] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Brunel University; University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Longworth, L (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",louise.longworth@brunel.ac.uk,"Griffin, Susan/AAE-8970-2020","Griffin, Susan/0000-0003-2188-8400; Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Spackman, David Eldon/0000-0001-8558-5973","Medical Research Council (MRC) [G0802659]; MRC [MC_U145079308, G0802659] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0802659, MC_U145079308] Funding Source: researchfish",Medical Research Council (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This review has been conducted as part of a project that is funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) as part of the MRC-National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Methodology Research Programme (grant no.

Dividend strategies that can be found in the literature often yield pay-out patterns that are inconsistent with actual practice. One issue is the high variability of the dividend payment rates over time. We aim at addressing that problem by specifying a dividend strategy that yields stable dividend pay-outs over time. In this paper, we model the surplus of a company with a Brownian risk model. Dividends are paid at a constant rate g of the company's modified surplus (after distribution of dividends), which operates as a buffer reservoir to yield a regular flow of shareholders' income. The dividend payment rate reverts around the drift of the original process mu, whereas the modified surplus itself reverts around the level l = mu/g. We determine the distribution of the present value of dividends when the surplus process is never absorbed. After introducing an absorbing barrier a (inferior to the initial surplus) and stating the Laplace transform of the time of absorption, we derive the expected present value of dividends until absorption. The latter is then also determined if dividends are not paid whenever the surplus is too close to the absorbing barrier. The calculation of the optimal value of the parameter l (and equivalently g) is discussed. We conclude by comparing both barrier and mean reverting dividend strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The plan participant invests the fund wealth and the stochastic interim contribution flows into the financial market. The nominal interest rate model is described by the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (Cox et al., 1985) dynamics. To cope with the inflation risk, the inflation indexed bond is included in the asset menu. The retired individuals receive an annuity that is indexed by inflation and a downside protection on the amount of this annuity is considered. The closed-form solution is derived under the CRRA utility function. Finally, a numerical application is presented to characterize the dynamic behavior of the optimal investment strategy.

Perhaps the most notable change in RA treatment during the last decade is the advent of biologics, and, in particular, anti-tumour necrosis factor agents. Given these advances, it is useful to assess how healthcare and work-loss costs of patients with RA have changed. Objective: Our objective was to assess changes in healthcare utilization and costs from 1997 to 2006 for patients diagnosed with RA. Methods: Two cohorts (1997 and 2006) of patients with RA and matched controls were identified from two administrative claims databases along with subsamples of employed patients and matched controls. The analysis focused on the more homogeneous employee subsample. We compared annual excess co-morbidity rates, resource utilization and healthcare and work-loss costs per patient between the 1997 (n = 279) and 2006 cohorts (n = 837) with difference-in-differences methodology. Results with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: In the employee subsample, there were no statistically significant differences in the excess prevalence of non-RA co-morbidities or Charlson Co-morbidity Index results, except for cardiovascular disease, which decreased by 11.1%. Excess number of ED visits and days hospitalized decreased by 1.1 visits/patient and 0.9 days/patient, respectively, while rheumatologist visits increased by 0.9 visits/patient. Excess per-patient direct costs were unchanged. However, drug costs increased by $US633/patient, but medical costs decreased by $US618/patient (not significant) [year 2006 values]. Conclusion: For employed patients with RA, there were significant reductions in per-patient excess hospital days, as well as ED visits, and no changes in excess total direct costs over time. New treatments introduced during the study period may be associated with cost savings that offset changes in employee utilization of drug and medical services. In addition, the reductions in excess ED visits and hospital days suggest improvements in patient quality of life.","[Birnbaum, Howard G.; Pike, Crystal; Banerjee, Ritesh; Waldman, Tracy] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Cifaldi, Mary] Abbott Labs, Abbott Pk, IL 60064 USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Abbott Laboratories,"Birnbaum, HG (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",hbirnbaum@analysisgroup.com,,,Abbott Laboratories,Abbott Laboratories(Abbott Laboratories),"This research was funded by Abbott Laboratories.

Multi-scale estimators similar to that recently proposed by Zhang (2006) can, in fact, be constructed within a simple regression-based approach by exploiting the linear relation existing between the market microstructure bias and the realized volatilities computed at different frequencies. We show how such a powerful multi-scale regression approach can also be applied in the context of the Zhou [Nonlinear Modelling of High Frequency Financial Time Series, pp. 109-123, 1998] or DST orthogonalization of the observed tick-by-tick returns. Providing a natural orthonormal basis decomposition of observed returns, the DST permits the optimal disentanglement of the volatility signal of the underlying price process from the market microstructure noise. The robustness of the DST approach with respect to the more general dependent structure of the microstructure noise is also shown analytically. The combination of the multi-scale regression approach with DST gives a multi-scale DST realized volatility estimator similar in efficiency to the optimal Cramer-Rao bounds and robust against a wide class of noise contamination and model misspecification. Monte Carlo simulations based on realistic models for price dynamics and market microstructure effects show the superiority of DST estimators over alternative volatility proxies for a wide range of noise-to-signal ratios and different types of noise contamination. Empirical analysis based on six years of tick-by-tick data for the S&P 500 index future, FIB 30, and 30 year U.S. Treasury Bond future confirms the accuracy and robustness of DST estimators for different types of real data.","[Corsi, Fulvio] Univ Lugano, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Corsi, Fulvio] Swiss Finance Inst, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Curci, Giuseppe] Univ Pisa, Dept Phys, I-56100 Pisa, Italy",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); University of Pisa,"Corsi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Lugano, Via Buffi 13, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland.",fulvio.corsi@usi.ch,"Corsi, Fulvio/JPL-0067-2023","Corsi, Fulvio/0000-0003-2683-4479",,,,,52,12,13,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Since 1 January 2005, drug manufacturers are formally required to substantiate the cost effectiveness of drugs that have therapeutic added value in comparison with existing ones through pharmacoeconomic evaluations. Dutch guidelines for pharmacoeconomic research provide methods guidance, ensuring consistency in both the evidence and the decision-making process about drug reimbursement. Aim: This study reviewed the methodological quality of all 21 formally required pharmacoeconomic evaluations of new pharmaceuticals between 1 January 2005 and 1 October 2008, and verified whether these evaluations complied with pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Methods: Data on the quality of the pharmacoeconomic evaluations were extracted from the pharmacoeconomic reports published by the Dutch Health Care Insurance Board (CVZ). The Board's newsletters provided information on the advice to, and reimbursement decisions made by, the Dutch Minister of Health. All data extraction was carried out by two independent reviewers, and descriptive analyses were conducted. Results: The methodological quality was sound in only 8 of the 21 pharmacoeconomic evaluations. In most cases, the perspective of analysis, the comparator drugs, and the reporting of both total and incremental costs and effects were correct. However, drug indication, form (i.e. cost utility/cost effectiveness) and time horizon of the evaluations were frequently flawed. Moreover, the costs and effects of the pharmaceuticals were not always analysed correctly, and modelling studies were often non-transparent. Twelve drugs were reimbursed, and nine were not. Conclusions: The compliance with pharmacoeconomic guidelines in economic evaluations of new pharmaceuticals can be improved. This would improve the methodological quality of the pharmacoeconomic evaluations and ensure consistency in the evidence and the decision-making process for drug reimbursement in the Netherlands.","[Hoomans, Ties] Univ Chicago, Sect Hosp Med, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van der Roer, Nicole; Delwel, Gepke O.] Dutch Hlth Care Insurance Board, Diemen, Netherlands",University of Chicago; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Hoomans, T (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Sect Hosp Med, Dept Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave,MC-5000, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",thoomans@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu,,,"School of Public Health and Primary Care, Maastricht University, the Netherlands; Dutch Health Care Insurance Board","School of Public Health and Primary Care, Maastricht University, the Netherlands; Dutch Health Care Insurance Board","This study was partially sponsored by the School of Public Health and Primary Care, Maastricht University, the Netherlands, and the Dutch Health Care Insurance Board.

However, what happens if a negative event occurs on a holiday? In such a case, we expect two conflicting sentiment effects, which may cancel one another out or, alternatively, one effect may dominate the other. The stock market in Israel provides a unique laboratory in which to test these two conflicting effects, as Israel faced a horrible war on the Yom Kippur holiday in 1973-a war whose influence is still strongly felt today. Indeed, we find two robust effects: A strong and significant positive holiday sentiment effect; and a negative war sentiment effect, which dominates the positive holiday effect.

In particular, we demonstrate how the severity of the inference problem responds to the exact nature of the right tail of the income distribution. It is shown that the density of the studentized inequality measure is heavily skewed to the left, and that the excessive coverage failures of the usual confidence intervals are associated with excessively low estimates of both the point measure and the variance. For further diagnostics, the coefficients of bias, skewness and kurtosis are derived and examined for both studentized and standardized inequality measures. These coefficients are also used to correct the size of confidence intervals. Exploiting the uncovered systematic relationship between the inequality estimate and its estimated variance, variance stabilizing transforms are proposed and shown to improve inference significantly.","[Schluter, Christian] Univ Aix Marseille 2, DEFI, F-13621 Aix En Provence, France; [Schluter, Christian] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Aix-Marseille Universite; University of Southampton,"Schluter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Aix Marseille 2, DEFI, 14 Ave Jules Ferry, F-13621 Aix En Provence, France.",C.Schluter@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,15,6,6,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1368-4221,,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Finally, we conduct Monte Carlo experiments and a real data analysis to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed modeling procedure and compare it with the Nadaraya-Watson method as well as the local linear method.","[Zhang, Chongshan; Yin, Xiangrong] Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30677 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Yin, XR (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30677 USA.",xryin@stat.uga.edu,,,NSF [0806120]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [0806120] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We would like to thank the editors, two referees and our colleague Professor McCormick for constructive comments that greatly improved the presentation of the paper.

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the portfolio optimization problem is established. By applying a power transform and a variable change technique, we derive the explicit solution for the constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility function when the elasticity coefficient is -1 or 0. In order to obtain a general optimal strategy for all values of the elasticity coefficient, we propose a model with two risky assets and one risk-free asset and solve it under a given assumption. Furthermore, we analyze the properties of the optimal strategies and discuss the effects of market parameters on the optimal strategies. Finally, a numerical simulation is presented to illustrate the similarities and differences between the results of the two models proposed in this paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We motivate our empirical analysis based on a general equilibrium model, and use a Markov switching model to identify two regimes of housing returns: the high volatility ('boom-bust') regime and the low volatility ('tranquil') regime. Given US data -, we find that with a single-regime model inflation rate and federal funds rate perform better than other economic aggregates in predicting housing returns. Using the Markov switching model, inflation rate and the federal funds rate are the most consistent predictor for in-sample and out-of-sample forecast of the probability of the 'boom-bust' regime. The results imply that motives for inflation hedging and changes in monetary policy matter for the movements of future housing returns and the possible shifts of regimes in house price cycles.","[Chen, Nan-Kuang; Mao, Ching-Sheng] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10020, Taiwan; [Cheng, Han-Liang] Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chen, NK (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 21 Hsu Chow Rd, Taipei 10020, Taiwan.",nankuang@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,22,9,10,2,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

While more convenient for patients than infused drugs, the possibility of non-adherence and the frequently high costs of targeted OAMs have proven controversial. Our objective was to perform the first comprehensive review of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of targeted OAMs. A literature search in PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) reports published by the National Institute for Health Research HTA Programme in the UK was performed, covering articles published in the 5 years prior to 30 September 2013. Our inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed English-language full-text original research articles with a primary focus on CEA related to targeted OAMs. We categorized these articles by treatment setting (i.e. cancer site/type, line of therapy, and treatment and comparator) and synthesized information from the articles into summary tables. We identified 41 CEAs covering nine of the 18 targeted OAMs approved by the US FDA as of December 2012. These medications were studied in seven cancers, most often as second-line therapy for advanced-stage patients. In over half of treatment settings where a targeted OAM was compared with treatment that was not a targeted OAM, targeted OAMs were considered cost effective. Limitations in interpreting these findings include the risk of bias due to author conflicts of interest, cross-country variation, and difficulties in generalizing clinical trial evidence to community practice. Several types of cost-effectiveness studies remain under-represented in the literature on targeted OAMs, including those for follow-on indications approved after the initial indication for a drug and for off-label indications, head-to-head comparisons of targeted OAMs with other targeted OAMs and targeted intravenous therapies, and studies that adopt a perspective other than the payer's. Keeping up with the increasing number of approved targeted OAMs will also prove an important challenge for economic evaluation.","[Smieliauskas, Fabrice] Univ Chicago, Dept Hlth Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Chien, Chun-Ru] China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chien, Chun-Ru] China Med Univ, Coll Med, Sch Med, Taichung, Taiwan; [Shen, Chan] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Shen, Chan] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Geynisman, Daniel M.] Temple Hlth, Fox Chase Canc Ctr, Dept Med Oncol, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Shih, Ya-Chen Tina] Univ Chicago, Program Econ Canc, Dept Med, Sect Hosp Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; China Medical University Taiwan; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; Fox Chase Cancer Center; University of Chicago,"Shih, YCT (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Program Econ Canc, Dept Med, Sect Hosp Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave,MC 5000, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tshih@bsd.uchicago.edu,"Geynisman, Daniel/AAW-6344-2021","Shih, Ya-Chen Tina/0000-0001-7290-3864; Smieliauskas, Fabrice/0000-0002-9466-9308",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [R01 HS018535]; University of Chicago Cancer Research Foundation Women's Board; Ministry of Health and Welfare [MOHW 103-TD-B-111-03],"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); University of Chicago Cancer Research Foundation Women's Board; Ministry of Health and Welfare(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan)","Drs.

We bypass issues related to utility, bequest and consumption preference by treating the VA as liquid and tradable. This allows us to use an American option pricing framework to derive a so-called optimal initiation region. Our main practical finding is that given current design parameters in which volatility (asset allocation) is restricted to less than 20%, while guaranteed payout rates (GPR) as well as bonus (roll-up) rates are less than 5%, GLWBs that are in-the-money should be turned on by the late 50s and certainly the early 60s. The exception to the rule is when a non-constant GPR is about to increase to a higher age band, in which case the optimal policy is to wait until the new GPR is hit and then initiate immediately. Also, to offer a different perspective, we invert the model and solve for the bonus (roll-up) rate that is required to justify delaying initiation at any age. We find that the required bonus is quite high and more than what is currently promised by existing products. Our methodology and results should be of interest to researchers as well as to the individuals that collectively have over $1 USD trillion in aggregate invested in these products. We conclude by suggesting that much of the non-initiation at older ages is irrational (which obviously benefits the insurance industry). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We allow for general acceptance sets and general eligible assets, including defaultable bonds. Since the payoff of these assets is not necessarily bounded away from zero, the resulting risk measures cannot be transformed into cash-additive risk measures by a change of numeraire. However, extending the range of eligible assets is important because, as exemplified by the recent financial crisis, assuming the existence of default-free bonds may be unrealistic. We focus on finiteness and continuity properties of these general risk measures. As an application, we discuss capital requirements based on Value-at-Risk and Tail-Value-at-Risk acceptability, the two most important acceptability criteria in practice. Finally, we prove that there is no optimal choice of the eligible asset. Our results and our examples show that a theory of capital requirements allowing for general eligible assets is richer than the standard theory of cash-additive risk measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An emerging consensus is that the betas are time-dependent and their estimates are impacted by the return interval and the length of the estimation period. These findings lead to the prominence of the practical implementation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Our goal in this paper is two-fold. After studying the impact of the return interval on the beta estimates, we analyze the sample size effects on the preceding estimation. Working in the framework of fuzzy set theory, we first associate the returns based on closing prices with the intraperiod volatility for the representation by the means of a fuzzy random variable in order to incorporate the effect of the interval period over which the returns are measured in the analysis. Next, we use these fuzzy returns to estimate the beta via fuzzy least square method in order to deal efficiently with outliers in returns, often caused by structural breaks and regime switches in the asset prices. A bootstrap test is carried out to investigate whether there is a linear relationship between the market portfolio fuzzy return and the given asset fuzzy return. Finally, the empirical results on French stocks suggest that our beta estimates seem to be more stable than the ordinary least square (OLS) estimates when the return intervals and the sample size change.

Focusing on the related but distinct goals of model selection and prediction, we argue that different techniques for these two goals are appropriate for the three different problem classes. For M-closed problems we give relative entropy justification that the Bayes information criterion (BIC) is appropriate for model selection and that the Bayes model average is information optimal for prediction. For M-complete problems, we discuss the principle of maximum entropy and a way to use the rate distortion function to bypass the inaccessibility of the true distribution. For prediction in the M-complete class, there is little work done on information based model averaging so we discuss the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and its properties and variants. For the M-open class, we argue that essentially only predictive criteria are suitable. Thus, as an analog to model selection, we present the key ideas of prediction along a string under a codelength criterion and propose a general form of this criterion. Since little work appears to have been done on information methods for general prediction in the M-open class of problems, we mention the field of information theoretic learning in certain general function spaces.","[Clarke, Bertrand] Univ Miami, Dept Med, Ctr Computat Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Clarke, Bertrand] Univ Miami, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ctr Computat Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Clarke, Jennifer] Univ Miami, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Miami, FL USA; [Yu, Chi Wai] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Miami; University of Miami; University of Miami; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Clarke, B (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Med, Ctr Computat Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",bclarke2@med.miami.edu,,"Clarke, Jennifer/0000-0002-2723-7249",,,,,65,2,2,0,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We show that, for the general case of m endogenous variables under a flat prior, posterior moments of order r exist for the coefficients reflecting the endogenous regressors' effect on the dependent variable, if the number of instruments is greater than m +r, even though there is an issue of local non-identification that causes non-elliptical shapes of the posterior. This stresses the need for efficient Monte Carlo integration methods. We introduce an extension of DMC that incorporates an acceptance-rejection sampling step within DMC. This Acceptance-Rejection within Direct Monte Carlo (ARDMC) method has the attractive property that the generated random drawings are independent, which greatly helps the fast convergence of simulation results, and which facilitates the evaluation of the numerical accuracy. The speed of ARDMC can be easily further improved by making use of parallelized computation using multiple core machines or computer clusters. We note that ARDMC is an analogue to the well-known Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampling in the sense that one more difficult' step is used within an easier' simulation method. We compare the ARDMC approach with the Gibbs sampler using simulated data and two empirical data sets, involving the settler mortality instrument of Acemoglu et al. (2001) and father's education's instrument used by Hoogerheide et al. (2012a). Even without making use of parallelized computation, an efficiency gain is observed both under strong and weak instruments, where the gain can be enormous in the latter case.","[Zellner, Arnold] Univ Chicago, Posthumous Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Ando, Tomohiro] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Yokohama, Kanagawa 223, Japan; [Basturk, Nalan; van Dijk, Herman K.] Erasmus Univ, Econometr Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Basturk, Nalan] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy; [Hoogerheide, Lennart; van Dijk, Herman K.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hoogerheide, Lennart; van Dijk, Herman K.] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Chicago; Keio University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Hoogerheide, L (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",l.f.hoogerheide@vu.nl,,"van Dijk, Herman/0000-0003-3240-1020; Basturk, Nalan/0000-0002-0313-3592; Hoogerheide, Lennart/0000-0002-3318-1202",,,,,29,16,17,1,40,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

It complements regime-switching dynamic linear models by allowing the discrete regime to be jointly determined with observed or unobserved continuous state variables. The estimation framework involves a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme to simulate the latent state variable that controls the regime shifts. A simulation exercise shows that neglecting endogeneity leads to biased inference. This method is then applied to the dynamic Nelson-Siegel yield curve model where the unobserved time-varying level, slope and curvature factors are contemporaneously correlated with the Markov-switching volatility regimes. The estimation results indicate that the high volatility tends to be associated with positive innovations in the level and slope factors. More importantly, we find that the endogenous regime-switching dynamic Nelson-Siegel model outperforms the model with and without exogenous regime-switching in terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy.","Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Kang, KH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",kyuho@korea.ac.kr,,,Korea University,Korea University,"I thank the editor (Jianqing Fan) and two anonymous referees for insightful comments.

A discrete choice experiment was conducted on adult patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis during a routine visit to their physician at 15 centres in Italy. We investigated the preferences of patients with respect to five treatment attributes: (1) mode and frequency of administration; (2) time to improvement; (3) time free of symptoms; (4) unintended life expectancy reduction resulting from treatment; and (5) monthly treatment cost. The heterogeneity of preferences was investigated in a mixed logit model with normally distributed random coefficients. Overall, patients preferred the subcutaneous or intravenous route of administration (versus oral administration) and treatments that took less time to show improvement, ensured a longer time free of symptoms, involved a lesser reduction in life expectancy and had lower costs. There was significant preference heterogeneity for all attributes. The cost attribute was found to be significantly more important to females and to older patients (above 60 years of age). Older patients placed significantly greater emphasis on reduced life expectancy, whereas the time free of symptoms was significantly less important to them than to patients under 60 years of age. Patients with higher scores on the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) placed higher value on the time free of symptoms than those with lower DLQI scores. For the overall sample, the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for a month's reduction in the time to improvement was a,not sign32.4, whereas the WTP for one additional month without symptoms was significantly higher (a,not sign68.2).

The forecasting framework includes five steps: (1) determine and partition the universe of discourse, (2) define fuzzy sets and fuzzify the time series, (3) derive fuzzy relationships, (4) forecast, and (5) defuzzify the forecasting outputs. Many researchers using the fuzzy logical rule to construct the fuzzy relationship on step (3) and using 'table-look-up' method on step (4). However, there are three shortcomings in step (3) and (4), which are the rule redundancy, the rule length redundancy, and ignored the characters of fuzzy sets. In this paper, we propose similarity measurement method to prune the length of rule and apply fuzzy inference to raise the character of fuzzy sets on forecast step. And more, the quantile partition is applied on partition the universe of discourse.

Variation in general government debt in Greece over the years is highly cause by general government debt, followed by current account balance and inflation over the remaining periods. Shocks to general government and inflation will cause general government debt to increase while shocks to government deficit, gross savings and current account balance will cause general government debt to decrease.","[Mah, Gisele; Mukuddem-Petersen, Janine; Petersen, Mark] North West Univ, Sch Econ & Decis Sci, Mmabatho, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Mah, G (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ & Decis Sci, Mafikeng Campus,Private Bag X2046, Mmabatho, South Africa.",Gisele.Mah@nwu.ac.za,"MAH, GISELE/AHB-8644-2022","MAH, GISELE/0000-0002-8729-9935",,,,,35,0,0,0,3,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1105,1116,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600123,0

When the drift and diffusion coefficients are of geometric Brownian motion type we obtain a model with parameters that can be estimated in a satisfactory way, a model that allows differentiating regimes in some of the NYSE 21 stocks analyzed and also, that gives very satisfactory results when compared to the usual Black-Scholes model for pricing call options.","[Mota, Pedro P.; Esquivel, Manuel L.] CMA FCT UNL, Dept Math, P-2829056 Quinta Da Torre, Caparica, Portugal",,"Esquível, ML (通讯作者)，CMA FCT UNL, Dept Math, P-2829056 Quinta Da Torre, Caparica, Portugal.",mle@fct.unl.pt,"Mota, Pedro/AAD-5154-2020; Mota, Pedro/JEF-5031-2023; Esquivel, Manuel L./C-8266-2009","Mota, Pedro/0000-0002-5644-3551; Mota, Pedro/0000-0002-5644-3551; Esquivel, Manuel L./0000-0003-4991-7568",FCT/MCTES/PT [ISS-297],FCT/MCTES/PT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This work was partially supported by project ISS-297 from FCT/MCTES/PT.,,11,13,13,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Despite their importance, information on the burden of the different pneumococcal diseases is limited and estimates vary widely. We critically reviewed the full economic evaluations (FEEs) on the new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) conducted in the European Union (EU) to assess their potential contribution to public decision making. We selected the FEEs focussed on PCV-10 and PCV-13 and published in English from January 2007 until June 2013. We screened the selected articles to assess their main methodological features using a common checklist composed of epidemiological, clinical and economic items. All the ten studies selected were based on modelling and the time horizon was always long term. Two studies focused on adults, the remaining eight on infants. Only one study based herd immunity on national data, eight used foreign data or modelling and the last did not consider it. National prices and tariffs were claimed to be sources for unit costs in all studies; however, half of them assumed price parity when one vaccine was not yet marketed, and the figures varied within the countries where more than one study was conducted. Conclusions supported the economic utility of pneumococcal vaccination in all studies, raising some concern only in (i) the independent study, which found that PCV-13 was borderline cost effective, and (ii) the study sponsored by both manufacturers, which estimated an incremental ratio slightly above the national threshold for both PCV-10 and PCV-13. The European studies we analysed are mostly based on weak sources of data. Because of the limited information on vaccine effectiveness and lack of epidemiological and economic data, the need for extensive recourse to assumptions leads to great within- and between-study variability generated by authors' choices.","[van de Vooren, Katelijne; Duranti, Silvy; Curto, Alessandro; Garattini, Livio] IRCCS Inst Pharmacol Res Mario Negri, Ctr Hlth Econ, CESAV, I-24020 Bergamo, Italy",Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS,"Garattini, L (通讯作者)，IRCCS Inst Pharmacol Res Mario Negri, Ctr Hlth Econ, CESAV, Via Camozzi 3 C-O Villa Camozzi, I-24020 Bergamo, Italy.",lgarattini@marionegri.it,,,,,,,135,24,24,0,11,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2014,32.0,1,,,,,29,45,,10.1007/s40273-013-0113-y,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,293KA,24288207.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329968700004,0

First, we demonstrate that, under this approach, the exact computation of the optimal boundary becomes secondary. Consequently, a simple approximation to the optimal boundary suffices to obtain accurate prices. Moreover, the first-passage approach tends to give more accurate prices than the early-exercise-premium integral representation. We present two ways of implementing the approach. The first is based on an exact representation of the first-passage density. The second exploits the method of images, which gives us a family of barriers with first-passage densities given in closed form. Both methods are very easy to implement and give accurate prices. In particular, the images-based method is extremely accurate.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Empresa, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Gutiérrez, O (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Empresa, Edif B,Campus Bellaterra Cerdanyola del Valles, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",oscar.gutierrez@uab.es,"Marcenaro, Oscar D/N-4671-2014","Marcenaro, Oscar D/0000-0003-0939-5064",[MICINN-ECO2010-21393-C04-04],,"The author gratefully thanks the financial support from Project MICINN-ECO2010-21393-C04-04, but regrets the drastic cuts of public funds dedicated to promote scientific research occurred in Spain since 2010.",,25,6,6,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The surplus is modeled by a regime-switching jump diffusion process. A single payoff function is imposed, and one player devises an optimal strategy to maximize the expected payoff function, whereas the other player is trying to minimize the same quantity. Using dynamic programming principle, the upper and lower values of the game satisfy a coupled system of nonlinear integro-differential Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations. Moreover, the existence of the saddle point for this game problem is verified. Because of the jumps and regime-switching, closed-form solutions are virtually impossible to obtain. Our effort is devoted to designing numerical methods. We use Markov chain approximation techniques to construct a discrete-time controlled Markov chain to approximate the value functions and optimal controls. Convergence of the approximation algorithms is proved. Examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the numerical methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, and most importantly, our approach also leads to analytically tractable expressions of multi-LIBOR payoffs. This approach unifies therefore the advantages of well-known forward price models with those of classical LIBOR rate models. Several examples are added and prototypical volatility smiles are shown.

We show that our method enjoys oracle-like properties; i.e., it consistently selects the correct moment conditions in the second set and at the same time, its estimator is as efficient as the GMM estimator based on all correct moment conditions. For empirical implementation, we provide a simple data-driven procedure for selecting the tuning parameters of the penalty function. We also establish oracle properties of the GMM shrinkage method in the practically important scenario where the moment conditions in the first set fail to strongly identify theta(o). The simulation results show that the method works well in terms of correct moment selection and the finite sample properties of its estimators. As an empirical illustration, we apply our method to estimate the life-cycle labor supply equation studied in MaCurdy (1981, Journal of Political Economy 89(6), 1059-1085) and Altonji (1986, Journal of Political Economy 94(3), 176-215).

It is unusual for patients to complete treatment with radiation or chemotherapy without experiencing at least one form of therapy-associated tissue injury or systemic side effect. Often, toxicities do not occur as solitary events; rather, they result in clusters of symptoms that share a common biological aetiology. Like any disease, cancer treatment-related toxicities (CTRTs) vary in their severity. But, in contrast to most diseases in which incidence is described as being present or absent, the current approach to CTRT typically limits reporting to severe cases only. Not only does this dilute the frequency with which CTRTs occur, but it also undermines our ability to determine the full burden of their impact and to accurately assess the cost effectiveness of potential toxicity interventions. In this article, we report the results of a directed literature review for the years 2000-2012, in which we studied and compared three tissue-based toxicities (nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, and oral mucositis) and one systemic toxicity (fatigue). Our results confirm the heavy burden of resource use and cost associated with CTRTs. The inclusion of fatigue in our analysis provided an opportunity to compare and contrast a toxicity in which there are both acute and chronic consequences. Our findings also demonstrate a number of challenges to, and opportunities for, future study. Among the most obvious are the lack of provider consistency in diagnosis and grading, especially when there is no global agreement on severity scales. Compounding this inconsistency is the disconnect between healthcare providers and patients that exists when describing toxicity severity and impact. In many cases, cancer can be thought of as a chronic disease that requires prolonged but episodic treatment once the acute disease is eradicated. This change reflects increasing treatment successes, but it also implies that the burden of CTRTs will be expanded and prolonged. Creation of hierarchical attribution of costs in the presence of simultaneous CTRTs, accurate coding, and consistent tracking tools for toxicities will be imperative for effective appraisal of the costs associated with cancer treatment regimen toxicities.","[Carlotto, Alan; Hogsett, Virginia L.; Maiorini, Elyse M.; Sonis, Stephen T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Dent Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Razulis, Janet G.; Sonis, Stephen T.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Oral Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University; Harvard School of Dental Medicine; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Sonis, ST (通讯作者)，Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Oral Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",ssonis@partners.org,,,,,,,43,112,120,1,27,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2013,31.0,9,,,,,753,766,,10.1007/s40273-013-0081-2,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,209FH,23963867.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323739500003,0

Individual mortality heterogeneity exposes insurers to adverse selection since only relatively healthy lives are expected to purchase annuities. As a result standard annuities are priced assuming above-average longevity, making them expensive for many individuals. In contrast underwritten annuity prices reflect individual risk factors based on underwriting information, as well as age and gender. While underwriting reduces heterogeneity, mortality risk still varies within each risk class due to unobservable individual risk factors, referred to as frailty. This paper quantifies the impact of heterogeneity due to underwriting factors and frailty on annuity values. Heterogeneity is quantified by fitting Generalized Linear Mixed Models to longitudinal data for a large sample of US males. The results show that heterogeneity remains after underwriting and that frailty significantly impacts the fair value of both standard and underwritten annuities. We develop a method to adjust annuity prices to allow for frailty. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We assume the existence of a tradeable derivative with binary pay-off written on the claims development result and available in each development period. General valuation formulas are stated and, under additional assumptions, these valuation formulas simplify to resemble familiar regulatory cost-of-capital-based formulas. However, adoption of the mean-variance framework improves upon the regulatory approach by allowing for potential calibration to observed market prices, inclusion of other tradeable assets, and consistent extension to multiple periods.

Given the recent head-to-head clinical trial study of ustekinumab and etanercept, an economic model comparing the two treatments can be constructed. Etanercept and ustekinumab are indicated for the treatment of chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of ustekinumab, an anti-cytokine biologic, for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of ustekinumab compared with etanercept from a US societal perspective. A Markov model was constructed to simulate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained every 12 weeks over a base-case 3-year time horizon. A hypothetical patient cohort was based on the characteristics of the phase III Active Comparator Psoriasis Trial (ACCEPT). The main outcome measures were costs and QALYs, which were estimated from the US societal perspective. Costs, utilities, treatment strategy, and resource use estimates were obtained from relevant literature. All costs were adjusted to 2011 US dollars. A 3 % annual discount rate was applied to costs and QALYs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were in US dollars per QALY gained. For the base-case 3-year time horizon, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing ustekinumab 90 mg with etanercept 50 mg was US$384,401 per QALY gained. Ustekinumab 45 mg dominates etanercept 50 mg for the same time horizon. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses involving treatment strategy, transition probabilities, valuing outcomes, and resource use and costs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests ustekinumab 90 mg has a minimal (4 %) chance of being cost effective compared with etanercept 50 mg at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$150,000 per QALY improvement. For the same threshold, ustekinumab 45 mg has a high (88 %) chance of being cost effective compared with etanercept 50 mg. Under typical US willingness-to-pay cutoffs, ustekinumab 90 mg is not cost effective compared with etanercept 50 mg therapy in moderate to severe psoriasis patients for the base-case 3-year time horizon. Ustekinumab 45 mg dominates etanercept 50 mg therapy for an equivalent patient psoriasis severity and time horizon.","[Villacorta, Reginald; Hay, Joel W.; Messali, Andrew] Univ So Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Unit A, UGW Unit A, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Villacorta, R (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Unit A, UGW Unit A, 3335 S Figueroa St,Univ Pk Campus, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",rvillaco@usc.edu; jhay@usc.edu; messali@usc.edu,,,,,,,49,22,23,0,21,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2013,31.0,9,,,,,823,839,,10.1007/s40273-013-0078-x,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,209FH,23975739.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323739500008,0

Under the supposition that players in a game may desire to balance maximization of payoff with minimization of strategy complexity, Rubinstein and co-authors studied forms of Nash equilibrium where strategies are maximally simplified in that no strategy can be further simplified without sacrificing payoff. Inspired by this line of work, we introduce a notion of equilibrium whereby strategies are also maximally simplified, but with respect to a simplification procedure that is more careful in that a player will not simplify if the simplification incents other players to deviate. We study such equilibria in two-player machine games in which players choose finite automata that succinctly represent strategies for repeated games; in this context, we present techniques for establishing that an outcome is at equilibrium and present results on the structure of equilibria.","Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Tecnol Informacio & Comunicac, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Chen, HB (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Tecnol Informacio & Comunicac, Barcelona, Spain.",hubie.chen@upf.edu,,,Spanish program Ramon y Cajal; MICINN [TIN2010-20967-C04-02],Spanish program Ramon y Cajal; MICINN(Spanish Government),"The author thanks Rani Spiegler and Olivier Gossner for their useful comments and pointers.

The basic idea is that a player in a game selects a strategy by entering a program, whose behaviour may be conditioned on the programs submitted by other players. Thus, for example, in the prisoner's dilemma, a player can enter a program that says If his program is the same as mine, then I cooperate, otherwise I defect. It can easily be shown that if such programs are permitted, then rational cooperation is possible even in the one-shot prisoner's dilemma. In the original proposal of Tennenholtz, comparison between programs was limited to syntactic comparison of program texts. While this approach has some considerable advantages (not the least being computational and semantic simplicity), it also has some important limitations. In this paper, we investigate an approach to program equilibrium in which richer conditions are allowed, based on model checking-one of the most successful approaches to reasoning about programs. We introduce a decision-tree model of strategies, which may be conditioned on strategies of others. We then formulate and investigate a notion of outcome for our setting, and investigate the complexity of reasoning about outcomes. We focus on coherent outcomes: outcomes in which every decision by every player is justified by the conditions in his program. We identify a condition under which there exist a unique coherent outcome. We also compare our notion of (coherent) outcome with that of (supported) semantics known from logic programming. We illustrate our approach with many examples.","[van der Hoek, Wiebe; Wooldridge, Michael] Univ Liverpool, Dept Comp Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Witteveen, Cees] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Software Technol, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands",University of Liverpool; Delft University of Technology,"van der Hoek, W (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Dept Comp Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",wiebe.Van-Der-Hoek@liv.ac.uk,"Witteveen, Cees/H-6437-2014","van der Hoek, Wiebe/0000-0003-0721-0310",,,,,19,3,3,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

It is assumed that the surplus process is approximated by a diffusion process. The insurer can purchase proportional reinsurance and invest in a financial market which consists of one risk-free asset and multiple risky assets whose price processes follow geometric Brownian motions. Under these, we consider two optimization problems, an investment-reinsurance problem and an investment-only problem. In particular, when the risk aversion depends dynamically on current wealth, the model is more realistic. Using the approach developed by Bjork and Murgoci (2009), the optimal time-consistent strategies for the two problems are derived by means of corresponding extension of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The optimal time-consistent strategies are dependent on current wealth, this case thus is more reasonable than the one with constant risk aversion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While the existing literature models elections using the jury metaphor where a change in information regarding the state induces all voters to switch in favor of only one alternative, we allow for more general preferences where a change in information can induce a switch in favor of either alternative. We show that information is aggregated for any voting rule if, for a randomly chosen voter, the probability of switching in favor of one alternative is strictly greater than the probability of switching away from that alternative for any given change in belief over states. If the preference distribution violates this condition, there exist equilibria that produce outcomes different from the full information outcome with high probability for large classes of voting rules. In other words, unless preferences closely conform to the jury metaphor, information aggregation is not guaranteed to obtain.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Bhattacharya, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, 4528 Posvar Hall,230 South Bouquet St, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",sourav@pitt.edu,,"Bhattacharya, Sourav/0000-0001-9670-5264",,,,,17,32,36,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2013,81.0,3,,,,,1229,1247,,10.3982/ECTA8311,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,146AZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319062500011,0

Using tax policies as a leading example of foresight, simple theory makes transparent the economic behavior and information structures that generate non-fundamental equilibria. Econometric analyses that fail to model foresight will obtain biased estimates of output multipliers for taxes; biases are quantitatively important when two canonical theoretical models are taken as data generating processes. Both the nature of equilibria and the inferences about the effects of anticipated tax changes hinge critically on hypothesized information flows. Different methods for extracting or hypothesizing the information flows are discussed and shown to be alternative techniques for resolving a non-uniqueness problem endemic to moving average representations.","[Leeper, Eric M.; Walker, Todd B.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Leeper, Eric M.] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Leeper, Eric M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yang, Shu-Chun Susan] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Monash University; National Bureau of Economic Research; International Monetary Fund,"Leeper, EM (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",eleeper@indiana.edu; walkertb@indiana.edu; SYang@imf.org,,,NSF [SES-0962221]; Academia Sinica,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan),"Walker acknowledges support from NSF Grant SES-0962221.

We show that the process of sharing surpluses between shareholders and policyholders follows transparent and consistent rules. Subsequently, we develop an asset-liability model for a stylized German life insurer that offers PLAs to evaluate benefit variability and insurer stability given stochastic mortality and capital market developments. Our results suggest that guaranteed benefits can be provided with high credibility via PLAs, while, at the same time, annuitants receive attractive money's worth ratios. Moreover, we show that it might be difficult to offer a fixed benefit annuity providing the same lifetime utility as a PLA for the same premium and a comparably low insolvency risk. Overall, PLA schemes may be an efficient way to deal with risk factors that are highly unpredictable and difficult to hedge over the long run, such as systematic longevity and investment risks.","[Maurer, Raimond; Rogalla, Ralph; Siegelin, Ivonne] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Finance, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Maurer, R (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Finance, Grueneburgpl 1 Uni PF H 23, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany.",maurer@finance.uni-frankfurt.de; rogalla@finance.uni-frankfurt.de; Ivonne.Siegelin@hof.uni-frankfurt.de,,,World Bank; Bundesverband fur Investment; Asset Management; Metzler Exchange Professor program,World Bank(The World Bank India); Bundesverband fur Investment; Asset Management; Metzler Exchange Professor program,"This research reported herein was performed pursuant to a grant from the World Bank.

By solving an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system, the closed-form expressions for the time-consistent investment and reinsurance strategies and the optimal value function are derived.

Their distributional and path-wise properties are explored by following their relation to polynomial and Dirichlet (B-)splines. In particular, it is shown that the density of an LG process can be expressed in terms of Dirichlet (B-)splines, introduced independently by Ignatov and Kaishev and Karlin, Micchelli, and Rinott. We further show that the well-known variance gamma (VG) process, introduced by Madan and Seneta, and the bilateral gamma (BG) process, recently considered by Kuchler and Tappe are special cases of an LG process. Following this LG interpretation, we derive new (alternative) expressions for the VG and BG densities and consider their numerical properties. The LG process has two sets of parameters, the B-spline knots and their multiplicities, and offers further flexibility in controlling the shape of the Levy density, compared to the VG and the BG processes. Such flexibility is often desirable in practice, which makes LG processes interesting for financial and insurance applications. Multivariate LG processes are also introduced and their relation to multivariate Dirichlet and simplex splines is established. Expressions for their joint density, the underlying LG-copula, the characteristic, moment and cumulant generating functions are given. A method for simulating LG sample paths is also proposed, based on the Dirichlet bridge sampling of gamma processes, due to Kaishev and Dimitriva. A method of moments for estimation of the LG parameters is also developed. Multivariate LG processes are shown to provide a competitive alternative in modeling dependence, compared to the various multivariate generalizations of the VG process, proposed in the literature. Application of multivariate LG processes in modeling the joint dynamics of multiple exchange rates is also considered.","[Kaishev, Vladimir K.] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",City University London,"Kaishev, VK (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Fac Actuarial Sci & Insurance, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",v.kaishev@city.ac.uk,,"Kaishev, Vladimir K./0000-0002-4713-7907",,,,,45,8,9,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

The first approach specifies the stochastic process of the underlying spot price and derives from the stipulated spot price dynamics valuation formulas of futures and other derivative contracts through no arbitrage. The second approach, as introduced by Smith [J. Appl. Econometr., 2005, 20, 405422], is to model the dynamics of the entire futures curve directly by a set of common stochastic factors and to specify factor loadings by flexible functions of time-to-maturity and contract delivery month. Empirical applications of the models to four commodities (gold, crude oil, natural gas, and corn) reveal that the volatility of futures prices exhibits more complex dynamics than the pattern implied by the model stipulating a two-factor Gaussian process of the underlying spot price. Specifically, the flexible model of futures returns depicts the maturity effect and, particularly for the three consumption commodities, strong seasonal and cross-sectional variations in variance and covariance of concurrently traded contracts. Incorporating the depicted variance and covariance dynamics leads the flexible model of futures returns to suggest hedging strategies that are more effective than the strategies based on the conventional two-factor Gaussian model.","Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Suenaga, H (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",hiroaki.suenaga@cbs.curtin.edu.au,,"Suenaga, Hiroaki/0000-0002-0208-2586",Australian Research Council [DP1094499]; Australian Research Council [DP1094499] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"I gratefully acknowledge insightful comments from two anonymous reviewers, which helped improve the paper substantially.

We also translate our identified bounds into closed form and asymptotically valid confidence intervals for several economic measures of interest. Applying our methods to much studied U.S. Forest Service timber auctions, we find evidence of correlation among values after controlling for a rich vector of relevant auction covariates; this correlation causes expected profit, the profit-maximizing reserve price, and bidder surplus to be substantially lower than conventional (IPV) analysis of the data would suggest.","[Aradillas-Lopez, Andres; Gandhi, Amit; Quint, Daniel] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Aradillas-López, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",aaradill@ssc.wisc.edu; agandhi@ssc.wisc.edu; dquint@ssc.wisc.edu,,,"NSF [SES-0922062]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0922062] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are very thankful to a co-editor and three anonymous referees for their insightful feedback.

The principal can induce the agent to alter the perceived fundamental value of the firm through misvaluation, thus changing the market estimate of that value. We consider two cases in detail: the one in which the market correctly anticipates only the effort, and the other in which it correctly anticipates both the effort and the amount of misvaluation. In the first case, we find that it is optimal for the principal to induce the agent to apply a non-zero amount of misvaluation. Using calculus of variation techniques, we find the optimal pay-per-performance sensitivity (PPS) of the contract and optimal effort and misvaluation amount, by means of solving of a second order ordinary differential equation. In the second case, which can be viewed as an extension of the seminal Holmstrom-Milgrom model to the case of noisy observations, we find that the optimal misvaluation value is zero, and we compare the resulting optimal contract to the Holmstrom-Milgrom contract.","[Capponi, Agostino] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Cvitanic, Jaksa] EDHEC Business Sch, F-06202 Nice 3, France; [Cvitanic, Jaksa] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Yolcu, Tuerkay] Purdue Univ, Dept Math, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School; California Institute of Technology; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Cvitanic, J (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",capponi@purdue.edu; cvitanic@hss.caltech.edu; tyolcu@math.purdue.edu,,,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1008219] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),,,23,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

Population reimbursement decisions that acknowledge patient heterogeneity could potentially save money and increase population health. To date, however, economic evaluations pay only limited attention to patient heterogeneity. The objective of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge regarding patient heterogeneity within economic evaluation of healthcare programmes. Methods A systematic literature review was performed to identify methodological papers on the topic of patient heterogeneity in economic evaluation. Data were obtained using a keyword search of the PubMed database and manual searches. Handbooks were also included. Relevant data were extracted regarding potential sources of patient heterogeneity, in which of the input parameters of an economic evaluation these occur, methods to acknowledge patient heterogeneity and specific concerns associated with this acknowledgement. Results A total of 20 articles and five handbooks were included. The relevant sources of patient heterogeneity (demographics, preferences and clinical characteristics) and the input parameters where they occurred (baseline risk, treatment effect, health state utility and resource utilization) were combined in a framework. Methods were derived for the design, analysis and presentation phases of an economic evaluation. Concerns related mainly to the danger of false-positive results and equity issues. Conclusion By systematically reviewing current knowledge regarding patient heterogeneity within economic evaluations of healthcare programmes, we provide guidance for future economic evaluations. Guidance is provided on which sources of patient heterogeneity to consider, how to acknowledge them in economic evaluation and potential concerns. The improved acknowledgement of patient heterogeneity in future economic evaluations may well improve the efficiency of healthcare.","[Grutters, Janneke P.

In a genetic post hoc substudy of the PROVE IT trial, the rate of event reduction was greater in carriers of the Trp719Arg variant in kinesin family member 6 protein (KIF6) than in noncarriers. We assessed the cost effectiveness of testing for the KIF6 variant followed by targeted statin therapy (KIF6 Testing) versus not testing patients (No Test) and treating them with P40 or A80 in the USA from a payer perspective. Methods A Markov model was developed in which 2-year event rates from PROVE IT were extrapolated over a lifetime horizon. Costs and utilities were derived from published literature. All costs were in 2010 US dollars except the cost of A80, which was in 2012 US dollars because the generic formulation was available in 2012. Expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for each strategy over a lifetime horizon. Results Lifetime costs were US$31,700; US$37,100 and US$41,300 for No Test P40, KIF6 Testing and No Test A80 strategies, respectively. The No Test A80 strategy was associated with more QALYs (9.71) than the KIF6 Testing (9.69) and No Test P40(9.57) strategies. No Test A80 had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$232,100 per QALY gained compared with KIF6 Testing. KIF6 Testing had an ICER of US$45,300 per QALY compared with No Test P40. Conclusions Testing ACS patients for KIF6 carrier status may be a cost-effective strategy at commonly accepted thresholds. Treating all patients with A80 is more expensive than treating patients on the basis of KIF6 results, but the modest gain in QALYs is achieved at a cost/QALY that is generally considered unacceptable compared with the KIF6 Testing strategy. Compared with treating all patients with P40, the KIF6 Testing strategy had an ICER below US$50,000 per QALY. The conclusions from this study are sensitive to the price of generic A80 and the effect on adherence of knowing KIF6 carrier status. The results were based on a post hoc substudy of the PROVE IT trial, which was not designed to test the effectiveness of KIF6 testing.","[Parthan, Anju; Leahy, Kevin J.; O'Sullivan, Amy K.] OptumInsight, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Iakoubova, Olga A.; Bare, Lance A.; Devlin, James J.] Celera Corp, Alameda, CA USA; [Weinstein, Milton C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Optum; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Without assuming cross-section independence, we establish asymptotic distribution for the proposed test statistic for the case. where both the cross-section dimension and the time dimension go to infinity simultaneously, and then analyze the power function of the proposed test under a sequence of local alternatives that involve a nonlinear multifactor model.

The results apply to a class of extremum estimators and corresponding tests and CS's that are based on criterion functions that satisfy certain asymptotic stochastic quadratic expansions and that depend on the parameter that determines the strength of identification. This covers a class of models estimated using maximum likelihood (ML), least squares (LS), quantile, generalized method of moments, generalized empirical likelihood, minimum distance, and semi-parametric estimators. The consistency/lack-of-consistency and asymptotic distributions of the estimators are established under a full range of drifting sequences of true distributions. The asymptotic sizes (in a uniform sense) of standard and identification-robust tests and CS's are established. The results are applied to the ARMA(1, 1) time series model estimated by ML and to the nonlinear regression model estimated by LS.

We analyze to what extent the theoretically crucial distinction of finite versus infinite-horizon games is reflected in the outcomes of a prisoner's dilemma experiment. We compare three different experimental termination rules in four treatments: a known finite end, an unknown end, and two variants with a random termination rule (with a high and with a low continuation probability, where cooperation can occur in a subgame-perfect equilibrium only with the high probability). We find that the termination rules do not significantly affect average cooperation rates. Specifically, employing a random termination rule does not cause significantly more cooperation compared to a known finite horizon, and the continuation probability does not significantly affect average cooperation rates either. However, the termination rules may influence cooperation over time and end-game behavior. Further, the (expected) length of the game significantly increases cooperation rates.

At each stage, each player chooses to use some facilities and pays a cost that increases with the congestion. Two versions of the model are examined: a public monitoring setting where agents observe the cost of each available facility, and a private monitoring one where players observe only the cost of the facilities they use. A partial folk theorem holds: a Pareto-optimal outcome may result from selfish behavior and be sustained by a belief-free equilibrium of the repeated game. We prove this result assuming that players use strategies of bounded complexity and we estimate the strategic complexity needed to achieve efficiency. It is shown that, under some conditions on the number of players and the structure of the game, this complexity is very small even under private monitoring.

This structure is present in various dependency models which have previously been proposed and analyzed. It is then shown that this structure in turn often implies particular functional forms for joint discounted densities of ruin related variables including some or all of the deficit at ruin, the surplus immediately prior to ruin, and the surplus after the second last claim. Then, employing a fairly general interclaim time structure which involves a combination of Erlang type densities, a complete identification of a generalized Gerber-Shiu function is provided. An application is given applying these results to a situation involving a mixed Erlang type of claim amount assumption.

It has also induced an increasing number of deadly tropical cyclones with a continuing trend. Many individual meteorological dynamic simulations and statistical models are available for forecasting hurricanes but they neither forecast well hurricane intensity nor produce clear-cut consensus. We develop a novel hurricane forecasting model by straddling two seemingly unrelated disciplines - physical science and finance - based on the well known price discovery function of trading in financial markets. Traders of hurricane derivative contracts employ all available forecasting models, public or proprietary, to forecast hurricanes in order to make their pricing and trading decisions. By using transactional price changes of these contracts that continuously clear the market supply and demand as the predictor, and with calibration to extract the embedded hurricane information by developing hurricane futures and futures option pricing models, one can gain a forward-looking market-consensus forecast out of all of the individual forecasting models employed. Our model can forecast when a hurricane will make land-fall, how destructive it will be, and how this destructive power will evolve from inception to landing. While the NHC (National Hurricane Center) blends 50 plus individual forecasting results for its consensus model forecasts using a subjective approach, our aggregate is market-based. Believing their proprietary forecasts are sufficiently different from our market-based forecasts, traders could also examine the discrepancy for a potential trading opportunity using hurricane derivatives. We also provide a real case analysis of Hurricane Irene in 2011 using our methodology.","[Chang, Jack S.

Prominent examples include stochastic volatility models, jump diffusion models, and models based on Levy processes. These all have their own shortcomings, and evidence suggests that none is up to the task of satisfactorily pricing and hedging extremely long-dated claims. Since they all fall within the ambit of risk-neutral valuation, it is natural to speculate that the deficiencies of these models are (at least in part) attributable to the constraints imposed by the risk-neutral approach itself. To investigate this idea, we present a simple two-parameter model for a diversified equity accumulation index. Although our model does not admit an equivalent risk-neutral probability measure, it nevertheless fulfils a minimal no-arbitrage condition for an economically viable financial market. Furthermore, we demonstrate that contingent claims can be priced and hedged, without the need for an equivalent change of probability measure. Convenient formulae for the prices and hedge ratios of a number of standard European claims are derived, and a series of hedge experiments for extremely long-dated claims on the S&P 500 total return index are conducted. Our model serves also as a convenient medium for illustrating and clarifying several points on asset price bubbles and the economics of arbitrage.","[Hulley, Hardy; Platen, Eckhard] Univ Technol Sydney, Finance Discipline Grp, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Platen, Eckhard] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Math Sci, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Hulley, H (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Finance Discipline Grp, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",hardy.hulley@uts.edu.au; eckhard.platen@uts.edu.au,,"Platen, Eckhard/0000-0003-4595-3123",,,,,47,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

The Aberdeen Technology Assessment Review (TAR) Group, commissioned to act as the evidence review group (ERG), critically reviewed and supplemented the submitted evidence. This paper describes the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The ERG critically appraised the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence submitted by the manufacturer, independently searched for relevant literature, conducted a critical appraisal of the submitted economic models and explored the impact of altering some of the key model assumptions as well as combining relevant sensitivity analyses. Three trials were used to inform the safety and efficacy aspects of this submission; however, one high-quality randomized controlled trial (RAISE study) was the principal source of evidence and was used to inform the economic model. Eltrombopag had greater odds of achieving the primary outcome of a platelet count between 50 x 10(boolean AND 9)/L and 400 x 10(boolean AND 9)/L during the 6-month treatment period than placebo (odds ratio [OR] 8.2, 99% CI 3.6, 18.7). In the eltrombopag group, 50/83 (60%) of non-splenectomized patients and 18/49 (37%) of splenectomized patients achieved this outcome. The median duration of response was 10.9 weeks for eltrombopag (splenectomized 6 and non-splenectomized 13.4) compared with 0 for placebo. Eltrombopag patients required less rescue medication and had lower odds of bleeding events for both the splenectomized and the non-splenectomized patients. For a watch-and-rescue strategy of care, the comparator was placebo and the ERG found that substantial reductions in the cost of eltrombopag are needed before the incremental cost per QALY is less than 30 pound 000. There was significant uncertainty, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) reported varying from 33 pound 561 to 103 pound 500 per QALY (splenectomized) and 39 pound 657 to 150 pound 245 per QALY (non-splenectomized). All costs are presented in, year 2008 values, as this was the costing year for the manufacturer's model. Other than bleeding, no adverse events were modelled. In relation to the long-term treatment model, the ERG questioned the robustness of the use of non-randomized non-comparative data. The base-case results restricting the time horizon to 2 years and prescribing eltrombopag as second-line treatment post-rituximab were found to be favourable towards eltrombopag. As rituximab is not a licensed treatment for ITP, the ERG were concerned that its inclusion may not be reflective of clinical practice. None of the treatment sequences resulted in an ICER approaching the recommended threshold of 30 pound 000 per QALY gained. Eltrombopag appears to be a safe treatment for ITP (although long-term follow-up studies are awaited) and has short-term efficacy. However, NICE found based on the evidence submitted and reviewed that there was no robust evidence on the long-term efficacy or cost effectiveness of eltrombopag and a lack of direct evidence for eltrombopag tested against other relevant comparators.","[Boyers, Dwayne] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Inst Appl Hlth Sci, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Jia, Xueli; Jenkinson, David; Mowatt, Graham] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Serv Res Unit, Inst Appl Hlth Sci, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"Boyers, D (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Inst Appl Hlth Sci, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.",d.boyers@abdn.ac.uk,"Boyers, Dwayne/AAJ-8774-2021; Jia, Shirley/AAE-4821-2020",,"NIHR [08/81/01]; Chief Scientist Office [HERU1, HERU2, HSRU1] Funding Source: researchfish",NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland),This project was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 08/81/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment (HTA).

This paper addresses this question in the context of a three-factor short-, medium- and long-term model for crude oil spot prices by studying the relations between these factors and appropriate economic variables. An affine combination of the short- and medium-term factors is identified as the (instantaneous) convenience yield. Estimating a structural vector auto-regression model we find that the short-term factor mainly relates to demand variables in the physical markets and to trading variables in the futures markets (such as the net short position of commercial hedgers), the medium-term factor relates to business cycles, demand and trading variables, and the long-term factor relates mainly to financial factors.","[Dempster, M.

This non-affine model gives prices of options on realized variance that allow upward-sloping implied volatility of variance smiles. Heston's model [Rev. Financial Stud., 1993, 6, 327-343], the benchmark affine stochastic volatility model, leads to downward-sloping volatility of variance smiles-in disagreement with variance markets in practice. Using control variates, we propose a robust method to express the Laplace transform of the variance call function in terms of the Laplace transform of the realized variance. The proposed method works in any model where the Laplace transform of realized variance is available in closed form. Additionally, we apply a new numerical Laplace inversion algorithm that gives fast and accurate prices for options on realized variance, simultaneously at a sequence of variance strikes. The method is also used to derive hedge ratios for options on variance with respect to variance swaps.","[Drimus, Gabriel G.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Drimus, GG (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math, Univ Pk 5, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",gdrimus@math.ku.dk,,,,,,,46,44,54,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

J,"Fitzpatrick, C; Floyd, K",,,,"Fitzpatrick, Christopher; Floyd, Katherine",,,A Systematic Review of the Cost and Cost Effectiveness of Treatment for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,,TREATMENT OUTCOMES; FEASIBILITY; COHORT; HEALTH,"Background: Around 0.4 million cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) occur each year. Only a small fraction of these cases are treated according to international guidelines. Evidence relevant to decisions about whether to scale-up treatment for MDR-TB includes cost and cost-effectiveness data. Up to 2010, no systematic review of this evidence has been available. Objective: Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the cost and cost effectiveness of treatment for MDR-TB and synthesize the available data. Methods: We searched for papers published or prepared for publication in peer-review journals and grey literature using search terms in five languages: English, French, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. From an initial set of 420 studies, four were included, from Peru, the Philippines, Estonia and Tomsk Oblast in the Russian Federation. Results on costs, effectiveness and cost effectiveness were extracted. Assessment of the quality of each economic evaluation was guided by two existing checklists around which there is broad consensus. Costs were adjusted to a common year of value (2005) to remove distortions caused by inflation, and calculated in two common currencies: $US and international dollars (I$), to standardize for purchasing power parity. Data from the four identified studies were then synthesized using probabilistic sensitivity analysis, to appraise the likely cost and cost effectiveness of MDR-TB treatment in other settings, relative to WHO benchmarks for assessing whether or not an intervention is cost effective. Best estimates are provided as means, with 5th and 95th percentiles of the distributions. Results: The cost per patient for MDR-TB treatment in Estonia, Peru, the Philippines and Tomsk was $US10 880, $US2423, $US3613 and $US14 657, respectively. Best estimates of the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DAL'Y) averted were $US598 (I$960), $US163 (I$291), $US143 (I$255) and $US745 (I$1059), respectively. The main influences on costs were (i) the model of care chosen (the extent to which hospitalization or ambulatory care were relied upon) and (ii) the second-line drugs included in the treatment regimen. When extrapolated to other settings, the best estimate of the cost of treatment varied from $US3401 to $US195 078, depending on the region and model of care. The cost per DALY averted was lower than GDP per capita in all 14 WHO sub-regions considered, with better cost effectiveness for outpatient versus inpatient models of care. Conclusions: Treatment for MDR-TB can be cost effective in low- and middle-income countries. Evidence about the relative cost effectiveness of outpatient versus inpatient models of care is limited and more data are needed from Africa and Asia especially India and China, which have the largest number of cases. Unless there is strong evidence that hospitalization is necessary to achieve high rates of adherence to treatment, patients with MDR-TB should be treated using mainly ambulatory care.","[Fitzpatrick, Christopher; Floyd, Katherine] World Hlth Org, Stop TB Dept, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland",World Health Organization,"Fitzpatrick, C (通讯作者)，World Hlth Org, Stop TB Dept, Ave Appia 20, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.",fitzpatrickc@who.int,,"Fitzpatrick, Christopher/0000-0002-3067-8328",,,,,26,120,130,0,23,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,1,,,,,63,80,,10.2165/11595340-000000000-00000,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,874SB,22070215.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000298977300005,0

Deal price movements, that are consistent with order flows, tend to continue a run once it is started. Indeed, conditional probabilities of a run continuing in the same direction after several consecutive observations exceed 0.5. However, quote prices do not show such a run tendency. Hence, a random walk hypothesis is refuted in a simple test of a run using tick-by-tick data. In addition, a longer continuous increase of the price tends to be followed by a larger reversal. The findings suggest that those market participants who have access to real-time, tick-by-tick transaction data may have an advantage in predicting exchange rate movements. The findings reported here also lend support to the momentum trading strategy.","[Ito, Takatoshi] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Hashimoto, Yuko] Int Monetary Fund, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Ohnishi, Takaaki] Canon Inst Global Studies, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1006511, Japan; [Ohnishi, Takaaki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Takayasu, Misako] Tokyo Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Computat Intelligence & Syst Sci, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268502, Japan; [Takayasu, Hideki] Sony Comp Sci Labs, Shinagawa Ku, Tokyo 1410022, Japan; [Watanabe, Tsutomu] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan",University of Tokyo; International Monetary Fund; University of Tokyo; Tokyo Institute of Technology; Hitotsubashi University,"Ito, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",tito@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Takayasu, Misako/H-9890-2014; Takayasu, Hideki/B-9899-2015","Takayasu, Misako/0000-0002-2467-614X; Takayasu, Hideki/0000-0002-4452-5517","JSPS [15203008]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15203008, 18GS0101, 23686019] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors are grateful to EBS for their appreciation of the value of academic research and for providing a proprietary data set for academic purposes with few restrictions and for a modest fee.

A Best-Worst Attribute Experiment Comparing the Values of Women Consumers and GPs,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CHOICE; WILLINGNESS; PREFERENCES,"Background: In the past decade, the range of contraceptives available has increased dramatically. There are limited data on the factors that determine women's choices on contraceptive alternatives or what factors providers consider most important when recommending contraceptive products to women. Objectives: Our objectives were to compare women's (consumers') preferences and GPs' (providers') views in relation to existing and new contraceptive methods, and particularly to examine what factors increase the acceptability of different contraceptive products. Methods: A best-worst attribute stated-choice experiment was completed online. Participants (Australian women of reproductive age and Australian GPs) completed questions on 16 contraceptive profiles. 200 women of reproductive age were recruited through a commercial panel. GPs from all states of Australia were randomly sampled and approached by phone; 162 GPs agreed to participate. Participants chose the best and worst attribute levels of hypothetical but realistic prescribed contraceptive products. Best and worst choices were modelled using multinomial logit and product features were ranked from best to worst according to the size of model coefficients. Results: The most attractive feature of the contraceptive products for both GPs and women consumers were an administration frequency of longer than 1 year and light or no bleeding. Women indicated that the hormonal vaginal ring was the least attractive mode of administration. Conclusions: Women and GPs agree that longer-acting methods with less bleeding are important features in preferred methods of contraception; however, women are also attracted to products involving less invasive modes of administration. While the vaginal ring may fill the niche in Australia for a relatively non-invasive, moderately long-acting and effective contraceptive, the results of this study indicate that GPs will need to promote the benefits of the vaginal ring to overcome negative perceptions about this method among women who may benefit from using it.","[Knox, Stephanie A.; Viney, Rosalie C.; Haas, Marion R.] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Street, Deborah J.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Math Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Fiebig, Denzil G.] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Weisberg, Edith; Bateson, Deborah] Family Planning NSW, Sydney Ctr Reprod Hlth Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Knox, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Level 4,645 Harris St, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",stephanie.knox@chere.uts.edu.au,"Haas, Marion Ruth/H-2732-2017; Fiebig, Denzil/A-9479-2011; Bateson, Deborah/A-4563-2018","Fiebig, Denzil/0000-0002-3707-1940; Bateson, Deborah/0000-0003-1035-7110; Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635",Australian Research Council (ARC); University of Technology Sydney (Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation); Family Planning NSW; Organon Australia Pty Ltd; Schering Pty Ltd; Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd.,Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); University of Technology Sydney (Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation); Family Planning NSW; Organon Australia Pty Ltd; Schering Pty Ltd; Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd.(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc),"This project was funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) as an ARC linkage grant, a partnership grant between the University of Technology Sydney (Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation) and the following industry partners: Family Planning NSW, Organon Australia Pty Ltd, Schering Pty Ltd, and Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd.",,22,12,14,0,17,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,12,,,,,1187,1202,,10.2165/11598040-000000000-00000,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,050GO,23078190.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312041400007,0

The models are obtained by augmenting classical perfectly liquid market models with a few additional risk factors that describe liquidity properties of the order book. The resulting models are easy to calibrate and to analyse using standard techniques for multivariate stochastic processes. Despite their simplicity, the models are able to capture several properties that have been found in microstructural analysis of limit order markets. Calibration of a continuous-time three-factor model to Copenhagen Stock Exchange data exhibits, for example, mean reversion in liquidity as well as the so-called crowding out effect, which influences subsequent mid-price moves. Our dynamic models are also well suited for analysing market resilience after liquidity shocks.","[Pennanen, Teemu] Kings Coll London, Dept Math, London, England; [Malo, Pekka] Aalto Univ, Dept Business Technol, Helsinki, Finland",University of London; King's College London; Aalto University,"Pennanen, T (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Math, London, England.",teemu.pennanen@tkk.fi,"Malo, Pekka/G-2348-2013","Pennanen, Teemu/0000-0002-7965-1089",,,,,36,8,8,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Our motivation is the fundamental role of variance swaps in the transfer of variance risk, and the extensive empirical evidence documenting that the variance realized by interest rates is stochastic. We identify a hedging rule involving a static European contract and the gains of a dynamic position on forward interest rate swaps. Two distinguishing features arise in the context of interest rates: the nonlinear and multidimensional relationship between the values of the dynamically traded contracts and the underlying swap rate, and the possible stochasticity of the interest rate at which gains are reinvested. The combination of these two features leads to additional terms in the cumulative dynamic trading gains, which depend on realized variance and are taken into consideration in the determination of the appropriate static hedge. We characterize the static payoff function as the solution of an ordinary differential equation, and derive explicitly the associated dynamic strategy. We use daily interest rate data between 1997 and 2007 to test the effectiveness of our hedging methodology in arithmetic and geometric variance swaps and verify that the hedging error is small compared with the bid-ask spread in swaption prices.","Univ Torcuato Di Tella, Sch Business, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Universidad Torcuato Di Tella,"Merener, N (通讯作者)，Univ Torcuato Di Tella, Sch Business, 1010 Saenz Valiente, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",nmerener@utdt.edu,,,,,,,29,5,5,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The conclusions were generally favourable for vaccination, but often applied a wider perspective (i.e. including productivity losses) than the reference case for economic evaluations used in many countries. Several evaluations estimated outcomes from a single-year epidemiological study, which may limit their validity given the year-to-year variation in influenza transmissibility, virulence, vaccine match and prior immunity. Only one study used a dynamic transmission model able to fully incorporate the indirect herd protection to the wider community.

We first estimate the model under the null hypothesis of common trends by the method of profile least squares, and obtain the augmented residual which consistently estimates the sum of the fixed effect and the disturbance under the null. Then we run a local linear regression of the augmented residuals on a time trend and calculate the non-parametric R2 for each cross-section unit. The proposed test statistic is obtained by averaging all cross-sectional non-parametric R2s, which is close to 0 under the null and deviates from 0 under the alternative. We show that after appropriate standardization the test statistic is asymptotically normally distributed under both the null hypothesis and a sequence of Pitman local alternatives. We prove test consistency and propose a bootstrap procedure to obtain P-values. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the test performs well in finite samples. Empirical applications are conducted exploring the commonality of spatial trends in UK climate change data and idiosyncratic trends in OECD real GDP growth data. Both applications reveal the fragility of the widely adopted common trends assumption.","[Zhang, Yonghui; Su, Liangjun; Phillips, Peter C.

We propose tests for slope heterogeneity in panel data models. Our tests are based on the conditional Gaussian likelihood function in order to avoid the incidental parameters problem induced by the inclusion of individual fixed effects for each cross-sectional unit. We derive the Conditional Lagrange Multiplier test that is valid in cases where N and T is fixed. The test applies to both balanced and unbalanced panels. We expand the test to account for general heteroskedasticity where each cross-sectional unit has its own form of heteroskedasticity. The modification is possible if T is large enough to estimate regression coefficients for each cross-sectional unit by using the MINQUE unbiased estimator for regression variances under heteroskedasticity. All versions of the test have a standard Normal distribution under general assumptions on the error distribution as N. A Monte Carlo experiment shows that the test has very good size properties under all specifications considered, including heteroskedastic errors. In addition, power of our test is very good relative to existing tests, particularly when T is not large.","[Juhl, Ted; Lugovskyy, Oleksandr] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Juhl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, 415 Snow, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",juhl@ku.edu,,,,,,,18,21,23,0,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"520 CHESTNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

A factor method for evaluating security returns based on experts' judgment is proposed and a mean-chance model for optimal portfolio selection is developed taking transaction costs and investors' preference on diversification and investment limitations on certain securities into account. The factor method of evaluation can make good use of experts' knowledge on the effects of economic environment and the companies' unique characteristics on security returns and incorporate the contemporary relationship of security returns in the portfolio. The use of chance of portfolio return failing to reach the threshold can help investors easily tell their tolerance toward risk and thus facilitate a decision making.

Maschler states that the sequence of values of an N-stage zero-sum game Gamma(N) (rho) with incomplete information on one side and prior distribution rho converges as N -> infinity, and that the error term err[Gamma(N) (rho)] = val[Gamma(N) (rho)] - lim(M ->infinity) val[Gamma(M)(rho)] is bounded by C N-1/2 if the set of states K is finite. The paper deals with the case of infinite K. It turns out that, if the prior distribution. is countably-supported and has heavy tails, then the error term can be of the order of N-alpha with alpha is an element of (-1/2, 0), i.e., the convergence can be anomalously slow. The maximal possible a for a given rho is determined in terms of entropy-like family of functionals.

We show that the problem can be reduced to a two-dimensional deterministic problem which involves no buy orders. We derive an explicit expression for the value function and the optimal liquidation strategy. The analysis is complicated by the fact that the intervention boundary, which determines the optimal liquidation strategy, is discontinuous if there are levels in the limit order book with relatively little market depth. Despite this complication, the equation for the intervention boundary is fairly simple. We show that the optimal liquidation strategy possesses the natural properties one would expect, and provide an explicit example for the case where the limit order book has a constant shape function.","[Lokka, Arne] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lokka, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Math, Columbia House,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.lokka@lse.ac.uk,,"Lokka, Arne/0000-0003-0263-267X",,,,,22,6,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

In most of the Western countries, the drug sequences are determined based on disease activity and treatment history of the patients. A model for realistic patient outcomes should reflect the treatment pathways relevant for patients with specific characteristics. This study aimed at developing a model that could simulate long-term patient outcomes and cost effectiveness of treatment strategies with and without inclusion of BRMs following a clinical guideline for treatment decisions. Discrete event simulation taking into account patient characteristics and treatment history was used for model development. Treatment effect on disease activity, costs, health utilities and times to events were estimated using Dutch observational studies. Long-term progression of physical functioning was quantified using a linear mixed-effects model. Costs and health utilities were estimated using two-part models. The treatment strategy recommended by the Dutch Society for Rheumatology where both DMARDs and BRMs were available (Strategy 2) was compared with the treatment strategy without BRMs (Strategy 1). Ten thousand theoretical patients were tracked individually until death. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo simulations were performed with 1,000 sets of parameters sampled from appropriate probability distributions. The simulated changes over time in disease activity and physical functioning were plausible. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of Strategy 2 compared with Strategy 1 was a,not sign124,011. At a willingness-to-pay threshold higher than a,not sign119,167, Strategy 2 dominated Strategy 1 in terms of cost effectiveness but the probability that the Strategy 2 is cost effective never exceeded 0.87. It is possible to model the outcomes of complex treatment strategies based on a clinical guideline for the management of RA. Following the Dutch guideline and using real-life data, inclusion of BRMs in the treatment strategy for RA appeared to be less favourable in our model than in most of the existing models that compared drug sequences independent of patient characteristics and used data from randomised controlled clinical trials. Despite complexity and demand for extensive data, our modelling approach can help to identify the knowledge gaps in clinical guidelines for RA management and priorities for future research.","[Tran-Duy, An] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment KEMT, NL-6202 AZ Maastricht, Netherlands; [Tran-Duy, An; Boonen, Annelies] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, NL-6202 AZ Maastricht, Netherlands; [Tran-Duy, An; Boonen, Annelies] Maastricht UMC, Caphri Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Kievit, Wietske; van Riel, Piet L.

Specifically, actions are either strategic substitutes or strategic complements, and participants have either complete or incomplete information about the structure of a random network. Since economic environments typically have a considerable degree of complementarity or substitutability, this framework applies to a wide variety of settings. We examine behavior and equilibrium selection. The degree of equilibrium play is striking, in particular with incomplete information. Behavior closely resembles the theoretical equilibrium whenever this is unique; when there are multiple equilibria, general features of networks, such as connectivity, clustering, and the degree of the players, help to predict informed behavior in the lab. People appear to be strongly attracted to maximizing aggregate payoffs (social efficiency), but there are forces that moderate this attraction: (1) people seem content with (in the aggregate) capturing only the lion's share of the efficient profits in exchange for reduced exposure to loss, and (2) uncertainty about the network structure makes it considerably more difficult to coordinate on a demanding, but efficient, equilibrium that is typically implemented with complete information.","[Charness, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Charness, Gary] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Charness, Gary] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany; [Feri, Francesco] Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Feri, Francesco] Univ Trieste, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Melendez-Jimenez, Miguel A.] Univ Malaga, Dept Teor & Hist Econ, Malaga 29013, Spain; [Sutter, Matthias] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [Sutter, Matthias] Univ Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Sutter, Matthias] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Trieste; Universidad de Malaga; European University Institute; University of Innsbruck; University of Cologne,"Charness, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, 2127 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",charness@econ.ucsb.edu; Francesco.Feri@rhul.ac.uk; melendez@uma.es; matthias.sutter@uibk.ac.at,"Charness, Gary/JVP-0357-2024; Sutter, Matthias/R-2018-2018","Sutter, Matthias/0000-0002-6143-8706; Melendez Jimenez, Miguel Angel/0000-0001-5350-3726","University of Innsbruck; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2011-26996]; Regional Government of Andalusia [SEJ2009-4794, SEJ2011-8065]",University of Innsbruck; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Regional Government of Andalusia(Junta de Andalucia),"We thank Juan Carrillo, Matthew Jackson, Fernando Vega-Redondo, four anonymous referees, and seminar participants at Stanford University, Chapman University, University of Amsterdam (CREED), University of Lyon, University of Bologna, Royal Holloway University of London, University of the Basque Country, 2011 EWEBE conference, the 2012 Royal Economic Society Meeting, and the 2012 CESifo conference in Munich for valuable comments.

We seek to co-assess a set of sophisticated real-world non-convex investment policy limitations, such as cardinality constraints, buy-in thresholds, transaction costs, particular normative rules, etc. within the frame of four popular portfolio selection cases: (a) the mean-variance model, (b) the mean-semi variance model, (c) the mean-MAD (mean-absolute deviation) model and (d) the mean-semi MAD model. In such circumstances, the portfolio selection process reflects to a mixed-integer bi-objective (or in general multiobjective) mathematical programme. We precisely develop all corresponding modelling procedures and then solve the underlying problem by use of a novel generalized algorithm, which was exclusively introduced to cope with the above-mentioned singularities. The validity of the attempt is verified through empirical testing on the S&P 500 universe of securities. The technical conclusions obtained not only confirm certain findings of the particular limited existing theory but also shed light on computational issues and running times. Moreover, the results derived are characterized as encouraging enough, since a sufficient number of efficient or Pareto optimal portfolios produced by the models appear to possess superior out-of-sample returns with respect to the benchmark.","[Xidonas, Panos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Decis Support Syst Lab, Athens, Greece; [Mavrotas, George] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Chem Engn, Lab Ind & Energy Econ, Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; National Technical University of Athens,"Xidonas, P (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Decis Support Syst Lab, Athens, Greece.",pxid@epu.ntua.gr,,"Xidonas, Panos/0000-0003-3325-1474",,,,,24,4,4,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Using the principle of smoothed maximum score estimation (Horowitz, 1992; Econometrica 60(3), 505-531), a consistent and asymptotically normal (C.A.N.) estimator for beta is proposed under the restriction that the median of the error conditional on the covariates is equal to 0. Furthermore, the rate of convergence in probability is close to the parametric rate, if certain functions admit enough derivatives.

FM patients suffer from reduced quality of life, daily functioning and productivity. A single FM patient can cost society tens of thousands of dollars each year, with the overall expense increasing alongside disease severity. Indirect costs account for the majority of total expenditures and involve losses in productivity, reduced work hours, absenteeism, disability, unemployment, early retirement, informal care and other out-of-pocket costs. Health care utilization increases in concert with the severity of illness. Moreover, FM patients often have several comorbid illnesses (e.g. depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances), resulting in extreme escalation of overall health care expenditures. Medications with the best efficacy in the treatment of FM include the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and nortriptyline, cyclobenzaprine (a skeletal muscle relaxant), tramadol, duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin and gabapentin. Corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics, with the exception of tramadol, are not considered efficacious. Medication selection should be individualized and influenced by the severity of illness and the presence of comorbidities and functional disabilities.","Washington State Univ, Dept Pharmacotherapy, Coll Pharm, Spokane, WA 99210 USA",Washington State University,"Skaer, TL (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Dept Pharmacotherapy, Coll Pharm, Riverpoint Campus,POB 1495, Spokane, WA 99210 USA.",tskaer@wsu.edu,,,,,,,57,59,70,0,27,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2014,32.0,5,,,,,457,466,,10.1007/s40273-014-0137-y,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AG9RQ,24504852.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335757600004,0

There is limited information available on Medicare costs associated with treating SREs. The objective of this study was to ascertain SRE-related costs among older men with metastatic prostate cancer in the US. We analysed patients aged 66 years or older who were diagnosed with incident stage IV (M1) prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007 from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare dataset. A propensity score for the incidence of an SRE was estimated using a logistic regression model including demographic and clinical baseline variables. Patients with SREs (cases) were matched to patients without SREs (controls) based on the propensity score, length of follow-up (i.e. date of prostate cancer diagnosis to last date of observation) and death. Health resource utilization cost differences between cases and controls over time were compared using generalized linear models. Healthcare costs were examined by type of SRE (pathological fracture only, pathological fracture with concurrent surgery, spinal cord compression only, spinal cord compression with concurrent surgery, and bone surgery only) and by source of care (inpatient, physician/non-institutional provider, skilled nursing facility, outpatient and hospice). All costs were adjusted to 2009 US dollars, using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. Application of the inclusion criteria resulted in 1,131 metastatic prostate cancer patients with SREs and 6,067 patients without SREs during follow-up. The average age of the sample was 79 years, and 14 % were African American. A total of 928 patients with SREs were matched to 928 patients without SREs. The average health care utilization cost of patients with SREs was US$29,696 (95 % confidence interval [CI] US$24,730-US$34,662) higher than that of the controls. The most expensive SRE group was spinal cord compression with concurrent surgery (US$82,868: 95 % CI US$67,472-US$98,264) followed by bone surgery only (US$37,496: 95 % CI US$29,684-US$45,308), pathological fracture with concurrent surgery (US$34,169: 95 % CI US$25,837-US$ 42,501), spinal cord compression only (US$25,793: 95 % CI US$20,933-US$30,653) and pathological fracture only (US$14,649: 95 % CI US$6,537-US$22,761). The largest cost difference by source of care was observed for hospitalizations (p < 0.01). Metastatic prostate cancer patients with SREs incur higher costs compared to similar patients without SREs. SRE costs among older stage IV (M1) prostate cancer patients vary by SRE type, with spinal cord compression and concurrent surgery costing at least twice as much as other SREs.","[Jayasekera, J.; Onukwugha, E.; Bikov, K.; Mullins, C.

Our central result is a simple formula for the marginal externality damage of emissions (or, equivalently, for the optimal carbon tax). This formula, which holds under quite plausible assumptions, reveals that the damage is proportional to current GDP, with the proportion depending only on three factors: (i) discounting, (ii) the expected damage elasticity (how many percent of the output flow is lost from an extra unit of carbon in the atmosphere), and (iii) the structure of carbon depreciation in the atmosphere. Thus, the stochastic values of future output, consumption, and the atmospheric CO2 concentration, as well as the paths of technology (whether endogenous or exogenous) and population, and so on, all disappear from the formula. We find that the optimal tax should be a bit higher than the median, or most well-known, estimates in the literature. We also formulate a parsimonious yet comprehensive and easily solved model allowing us to compute the optimal and market paths for the use of different sources of energy and the corresponding climate change. We find coalrather than oilto be the main threat to economic welfare, largely due to its abundance. We also find that the costs of inaction are particularly sensitive to the assumptions regarding the substitutability of different energy sources and technological progress.","[Golosov, Mikhail] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Hassler, John; Krusell, Per] Stockholm Univ, IIES, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tsyvinski, Aleh] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Princeton University; Stockholm University; Yale University,"Golosov, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, 111 Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",golosov@princeton.edu; john@hassler.se; per.krusell@iies.su.se; a.tsyvinski@yale.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0748815] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,71,365,390,27,274,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2014,82.0,1,,,,,41,88,,10.3982/ECTA10217,0.0,,,48,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA7KQ,,,Y,N,2024-03-09,WOS:000331276700002,0

These tools rely on two arbitrary choice of parameters: the window size of comparison, m, and the tolerance for distinguishing two vectors, r. The arbitrary choice of the parameters is a huge drawback in these tools since two very distinctive series may be classified differently depending on the choice of the parameters. There are two attempts to overcome such a drawback. One, pApEn, is based on the peak value of ApEn for a given m. The other, vApEn, is based on a double summation of ApEn values along all suitable m and r, resulting in a pseudo-volume below the surface thus obtained. pApEn is much more robust than ApEn (and SampEn), even though the arbitrary choice of m still poses subjectivity in the analysis. Moreover, recently we made a set of tests with pApEn and observed that some inconsistencies emerged for different values of m. vApEn, on the other hand, is extremely demanding on computational time/resources, and turns out prohibitive for series containing more than 400 points even in powerful conventional computers. Here we propose an approach based on the construction of the area under the curve of ApEn versus tolerance r, and it differs from the other tools: (a) from pApEn, which takes only one ApEn value and have no prescriptions for m; and (b) from vApEn, which takes all the areas for all possible windows size m. The tool, a1ApEn, consists in constructing a detailed tolerance vector and to compute the ApEn values, for the window size m = 1. We normalize the tolerance vector and compute the area from the ApEn values relative to the normalized tolerances. The window size 1 is chosen because it can be proven that it results in the largest area compared to m = 2, 3, 4,...N-1; remaining then no subjectivity in the parameters' choice. We tested the consistency of the tool using a set of standard time-series. The results show that a1ApEn is an adequate approach to characterize temporal organization of time-series without the problems suffered by pApEn and vApEn.","[Soubhia Natali, Jose Eduardo; Chaui-Berlinck, Jose Guilherme] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Lab Fisiol Teor, BR-05508090 Butanta Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Natali, JES (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Lab Fisiol Teor, Rua Matao Tr 14,321, BR-05508090 Butanta Sao Paulo, Brazil.",jesnatali@gmail.com; jgcb@usp.br,"Chaui-Berlinck, Jose Guilherme SM/A-4430-2016; Natali, Jose/G-8567-2016","Natali, Jose/0000-0001-8422-2767",,,,,11,0,0,0,0,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1149,1160,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600127,0

Results are presented for the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) normalized bias and t-ratio-based tests (Dickey and Fuller, 1979, Journal of the American Statistical Association 745, 427-431; Said and Dickey, 1984; Biometrika 71, 599-607). the variance ratio unit root test of Breitung (2002, Journal of Econometrics 108, 343-363), and the M class of unit-root tests introduced by Stock (1999, in Engle and White (eds.), A Festschrift in Honour of Clive W. J. Granger) and Perron and Ng (1996, Review of Economic Studies 63, 435-463). We show that although the ADF statistics remain asymptotically pivotal (provided the test regression is properly augmented) in the presence of persistent cycles, this is not the case for the other statistics considered and show numerically that the size properties of the tests based on these statistics are too unreliable to be used in practice. We also show that the t-ratios associated with lags of the dependent variable of order greater than two in the ADF regression are asymptotically normally distributed. This is an important result as it implies that extant sequential methods (see Hall, 1994, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics 17, 461-470; Ng and Perron, 1995, Journal of the American Statistical Association 90, 268-281) used to determine the order of augmentation in the ADF regression remain valid in the presence of persistent cycles.","[Castro, Tomas del Barrio] Univ Balearic Isl, Palma de Mallorca, Spain; [Rodrigues, Paulo M.

This is because borrowers will default only if both the net operating income and the property value fall below the threshold levels. To make modeling more complicated, the property value at the time of default will determine the loss-given default. In this paper, I derive closed-form solutions for the probability of default and the expected loss of commercial real estate mortgages in a Merton framework. The model is in its essence still a single risk factor model, although there is a sector risk factor that influences both the net operating income and the property value.

These conditions are typically referred to as completeness conditions. The second and third hypothesis testing problems we examine concern testing for identification directly in some nonparametric models with endogeneity involving quantile independence restrictions. For each of these hypothesis testing problems, we provide conditions under which any test will have power no greater than size against any alternative.

Notwithstanding the fact that in this framework, the local volatility depends on a particularly complex expectation where no closed-form expression exists and it is neither directly related to European call prices or other liquid products, we present in this contribution a method based on Monte Carlo Simulations to calibrate the local volatility model. We further compare the Variable Annuity Guarantee prices obtained In three different settings, namely the local volatility, the stochastic volatility and the constant volatility models all combined with stochastic interest rates and show that an appropriate volatility modeling is important for these long-dated derivatives.

Such a convergence can be applied in the determination of models of participation in the benefit or of saving products with a guaranteed minimum return. As an immediate application of the result obtained for the one-factor model, for a class of two-factor model, we also investigate the almost sure convergence of the long-term return t(-mu) integral(t)(0) Y (s)ds for some mu >= 1, where Y (t) follows an extended Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model with stochastic reversion level -X (t)/(2 beta) in which X (t) follows an extension of the square root process.

We assume that the owner can exercise the option at a finite, although possibly large, number of exercise dates. The method is computationally efficient for high-dimensional problems and is easy to apply. Its efficiency stems from our use of quasi-Monte Carlo techniques, which have proven effective in the case of European derivatives. The valuation of a Bermudan derivative hinges on the optimal exercise strategy. The optimal exercise decision can be reduced to the evaluation of a series of conditional expectations with respect to different distributions. These expectations can be approximated by sampling from just a single distribution at each exercise point. We provide a theoretical basis for the selection of this distribution and develop a simple approximation that has good convergence properties. We describe how to implement the method and confirm its efficiency using numerical examples involving Bermudan options written on multiple assets and options on a foreign asset with a stochastic interest rate.","[Boyle, Phelim P.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Kolkiewicz, Adam W.; Tan, Ken Seng] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Waterloo,"Tan, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",kstan@uwaterloo.ca,"Kolkiewicz, Adam/P-6906-2019","Kolkiewicz, Adam/0000-0003-4720-5081",Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC; MOE Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities [11JJD790004],Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); MOE Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities,Phelim P.

Prevalence is highly related to age, with every fourth individual older than 40 years old developing AF during his lifetime. Due to an aging population, the prevalence of AF is estimated to at least double within the next 50 years. This article presents AF-related cost-of-illness studies and reviews 19 cost effectiveness studies and six cost studies published roughly over the past decade, which have compared different antiarrhythmic medications for AF. A systematic literature search for studies published between June 2000 and December 2011 was conducted in PubMed using the combination of keywords ((atrial fibrillation OR atrial flutter) AND cost). Current cost effectiveness analyses of dronedarone and the pill-in-the-pocket strategy are subject to substantial uncertainties with regard to clinical benefit. Comparing rate control with rhythm control, a cost effectiveness advantage for rate control was shown in several but not all studies. Within antiarrhythmic drug treatments, magnesium added onto ibutilide was shown to be more cost effective than ibutilide alone. Comparing chemical and electrical cardioversion, the latter was recommended as more cost effective from the healthcare system perspective in all reviewed studies but one. Catheter ablation appeared more cost effective than antiarrhythmic drugs in the medium to long run after 3.2-63.9 years. Admissions to hospital, inpatient care and interventional procedures as well as mortality benefit are key drivers for the cost effectiveness of AF medications. No clear cost effectiveness advantage emerged for one specific antiarrhythmic drug from the studies that compared antiarrhythmic agents. Rate control as well as catheter ablation appear more cost effective than rhythm control in the treatment of AF. Rate control treatment also seems more cost effective than electrical cardioversion in AF patients.","[Brueggenjuergen, Bernd] Steinbeis Hsch Berlin, Inst Hlth Econ, D-10247 Berlin, Germany; [Kohler, Stefan; Reinhold, Thomas; Willich, Stefan N.] Charite Univ Med Ctr, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Ezzat, Nadja] Boston Healthcare Associates Int, Berlin, Germany; [Ezzat, Nadja] Boston Healthcare Associates Int, Celle, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin,"Brüggenjürgen, B (通讯作者)，Steinbeis Hsch Berlin, Inst Hlth Econ, Steinbeis Haus,Gurtelstr 29A-30, D-10247 Berlin, Germany.",bernd.brueggenjuergen@stw.de,"Kohler, Stefan/GPT-0877-2022","Kohler, Stefan/0000-0003-1365-7506; Reinhold, Thomas/0000-0001-5169-7029",,,,,70,5,6,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2013,31.0,3,,,,,195,213,,10.1007/s40273-013-0028-7,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,138TW,23444271.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318533900004,0

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG undertakes a critical review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence of the technology based upon the manufacturer's submission to NICE. The ERG also independently searches for relevant evidence and evaluates modifications to the manufacturer's decision-analytic model. This paper provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The clinical effectiveness data were derived from three placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A meta-analysis pooling across all doses of retigabine found beneficial effects of retigabine in terms of responder rate (odds ratio [OR] 2.79; 95 % CI 2.08, 3.76) and rate of seizure freedom (OR 2.54; 95 % CI 0.92, 6.98) [both double-blind phase analyses]. When compared in a network meta-analysis with the selected comparator antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) [eslicarbazepine acetate, lacosamide, pregabalin, tiagabine and zonisamide], retigabine offered broadly similar efficacy in terms of responder rate and freedom from seizure. The de novo decision-analytic model presented within the submission evaluated the cost effectiveness of retigabine compared with these AEDs and no treatment (i.e. maintenance therapy). After numerous additional analyses, the ERG considered the use of retigabine to be not cost effective for NICE at thresholds below 43,000 pound if no treatment was considered a relevant comparator. The NICE Appraisal Committee decided that an appropriate comparator was an active treatment. The Committee recommended that retigabine is offered as an option for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults aged 18 years and older with epilepsy, only when previous treatment with carbamazepine, clobazam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, sodium valproate and topiramate has not provided an adequate response, or has not been tolerated.","[Craig, Dawn; Rice, Stephen; Paton, Fiona; Fox, David; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Craig, D (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",dawn.craig@york.ac.uk,,,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [10/51/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 10/51/01) and has been published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment [55].

Assessment of the external validity of stated preference studies, such as discrete-choice experiments (DCEs), remains an under-researched area. Objectives The primary aim was to explore the preferences of All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG) appraisal committee and appraisal sub-committee (the New Medicines Group) members ('appraisal committees') for specific new medicines adoption criteria. Secondary aims were to explore the external validity of respondents' stated preferences and the impact of question choice options upon preference structures in DCEs. Methods A DCE was conducted to estimate appraisal committees members' preferences for incremental cost effectiveness, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, annual number of patients expected to be treated, the impact of the disease on patients before treatment, and the assessment of uncertainty in the economic evidence submitted for new medicines compared with current UK NHS treatment. Respondents evaluated 28 pairs of hypothetical new medicines, making a primary forced choice between each pair and a more flexible secondary choice, which permitted either, neither or both new medicines to be chosen. The performance of the resultant models was compared against previous AWMSG decisions. Results Forty-one out of a total of 80 past and present members of AWMSG appraisal committees completed the DCE. The incremental cost effectiveness of new medicines, and the QALY gains they provide, significantly (p < 0.0001) influence recommendations. Committee members were willing to accept higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and lower QALY gains for medicines that treat disease impacting primarily upon survival rather than quality of life, and where uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness estimates has been thoroughly explored. The number of patients to be treated by the new medicine did not exert a significant influence upon recommendations. The use of a flexible-choice question format revealed a different preference structure to the forced-choice format, but the performance of the two models was similar. Aggregate decisions of the AWMSG were well predicted by both models, but their sensitivity (64 %, 68 %) and specificity (55 %, 64 %) were limited. Conclusions A willingness to trade the cost effectiveness and QALY gains against other factors indicates that economic efficiency and QALY maximisation are not the only considerations of committee members when making recommendations on the use of medicines in Wales. On average, appraisal committee members' stated preferences appear consistent with their actual decision-making behaviours, providing support for the external validity of our DCEs. However, as health technology assessment involves complex decision-making processes, and each individual recommendation may be influenced to varying degrees by a multitude of different considerations, the ability of our models to predict individual medicine recommendations is more limited.","[Linley, Warren G.; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Inst Med & Social Care Res, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Inst Med & Social Care Res, Dean St, Bangor LL57 1UT, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Linley, Warren/0000-0003-2587-3564; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459",AWMSG Steering Committee; AWTTC; Bangor University,AWMSG Steering Committee; AWTTC; Bangor University,"We wish to thank all pilot respondents and all AWMSG and NMG appraisal committee members who kindly participated in this study.

However, few economic evaluations of pharmacological treatments for GAD have been published to date, and those available have assessed only a limited number of drugs. Objective To assess the cost effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for patients with GAD in the UK. Methods A decision-analytic model in the form of a decision tree was constructed to compare the costs and QALYs of six drugs used as first-line pharmacological treatments in people with GAD (duloxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine, pregabalin, sertraline and venlafaxine extended release [XL]) and 'no pharmacological treatment'. The analysis adopted the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) in the UK. Efficacy data were derived from a systematic literature review of double-blind, randomized controlled trials and were synthesized using network meta-analytic techniques. Two network meta-analyses were undertaken to assess the comparative efficacy (expressed by response rates) and tolerability (expressed by rates of discontinuation due to intolerable side effects) of the six drugs and no treatment in the study population. Cost data were derived from published literature and national sources, supplemented by expert opinion. The price year was 2011. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the underlying uncertainty of the model input parameters. Results Sertraline was the best drug in limiting discontinuation due to side effects and the second best drug in achieving response in patients not discontinuing treatment due to side effects. It also resulted in the lowest costs and highest number of QALYs among all treatment options assessed. Its probability of being the most cost-effective drug reached 75 % at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 pound per extra QALY gained. Conclusion Sertraline appears to be the most cost-effective drug in the treatment of patients with GAD. However, this finding is based on limited evidence for sertraline (two published trials). Sertraline is not licensed for the treatment of GAD in the UK, but is commonly used by primary care practitioners for the treatment of depression and mixed depression and anxiety.","[Mavranezouli, Ifigeneia; Meader, Nick] UCL, Natl Collaborating Ctr Mental Hlth, Ctr Outcomes Res & Effectiveness, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Meader, Nick] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Cape, John] Camden & Islington NHS Fdn Trust, London, England; [Cape, John; Kendall, Tim] UCL, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kendall, Tim] Royal Coll Psychiatrists, Natl Collaborating Ctr Mental Hlth, London SW1X 8PG, England; [Kendall, Tim] NHS Foundat Trust, Sheffield Hlth & Social Care, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of London; University College London; University of York - UK; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Mavranezouli, I (通讯作者)，UCL, Natl Collaborating Ctr Mental Hlth, Ctr Outcomes Res & Effectiveness, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",i.mavranezouli@ucl.ac.uk,"John, Cape/B-9039-2009; MAVRANEZOULI, IFIGENEIA/C-2430-2008","John, Cape/0000-0003-3108-7228; MAVRANEZOULI, IFIGENEIA/0000-0001-9095-3566; Meader, Nick/0000-0001-9332-6605",NICE in the UK [19],NICE in the UK,"The economic analysis presented in this paper was undertaken to inform a clinical practice guideline on anxiety (partial update) developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH), commissioned and funded by NICE in the UK [19].

The key contribution of the current paper is the construction of a new, cash-invariant liquidity-adjusted risk measure that can naturally be interpreted as a capital requirement.

The developed representation utilizes a state process with a particularly simple dynamic structure, which in turn renders this representation highly suitable for unit root, cointegration, and polynomial cointegration analysis. We also propose a new definition of polynomial cointegration that overcomes limitations of existing definitions and extends the definition of multicointegration for I(2) processes of Granger and Lee (1989a, Journal of Applied Econometrics 4, 145-159). A major purpose of the canonical representation for statistical analysis is the development of parameterizations of the sets of all state space systems of a given system order with specified unit root frequencies and integration orders. This is, e. g., useful for pseudo maximum likelihood estimation. In this respect an advantage of the state space representation, compared to ARMA representations, is that it easily allows one to put in place restrictions on the (co) integration properties.

It allows one party of an over-the-counter derivative to close off its position at marked-to-market price when the other party's credit rating downgrades to an agreed alarming level. Although the default risk is significantly reduced, the non-defaulting party may still suffer losses in case that the other party defaults without triggering the termination clause prior to default. At the heart of the valuation of credit risk adjustment(CVA) is the computation of the probability of default. We employ techniques from ruin theory and complex analysis to provide solutions for probabilities of default, which in turn lead to very efficient and accurate algorithms for computing CVA. The underlying risk model in question is an extension of the commercially available KMV-Merton model and hence can be easily implemented. We provide a hypothetical example of CVA computation for an interest-rate swap with downgrade-triggered termination clause. The paper also contributes to ruin theory by presenting some new results on finite-time ruin probabilities in a jump-diffusion risk model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we address this problem by providing closed-form representations, asymptotically, of the joint transition density. Specifically, we construct an expansion of the joint density through a hierarchy of parabolic equations after applying total volatility-of-volatility scaling and a near-Gaussian coordinate transformation. We then establish an existence result to characterize the truncation error and provide explicit joint density formulas for the first three orders. Our approach inherits the same spirit of a small total volatility-of-volatility assumption as in the original SABR analysis. Our results for the joint transition density serve as a basis for managing forward smile risk. Through numerical experiments, we illustrate the accuracy of our expansion in terms of joint density, marginal density, probability mass, and implied volatilities for European call options.","Columbia Univ, Dept APAM, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Wu, Q (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept APAM, New York, NY 10027 USA.",qw2107@columbia.edu,,"Wu, Qi/0000-0002-4028-981X","NSF [DMS0410234, DMS0914529]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I am very grateful to a referee for pointing out an error in the calculation in an earlier version of this paper, and I thank both referees for their helpful comments.

We call this option the taxpayer put, where the strike is the negative of the level of reserve capital at stake in the firm. We contribute by (i) valuing this taxpayer put, and (ii) determining the level for reserve capital without a reference to ratings. Reserve capital levels are designed to mitigate the adverse incentives for unnecessary risk introduced by the taxpayer put at the firm level. In our approach, the level of reserve capital is set to make the aggregate risk of the firm externally acceptable, where the specific form of acceptability employed is positive expectation under a concave distortion of the cash flow distribution. It is observed that, in the presence of the taxpayer put, debt holders may not be relied upon to monitor risk as their interests are partially aligned with equity holders by participating in the taxpayer put. Furthermore, the taxpayer put leads to an equity pricing model associated with a market discipline that punishes perceived cash shortfalls.","[Madan, Dilip B.] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Eberlein, Ernst] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg Inst Adv Studies, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Freiburg,"Madan, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dbm@rhsmith.umd.edu,,,,,,,48,15,16,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Holding constant market illiquidities, one should always hedge first with 'like' derivatives, next with derivatives one layer down the hierarchy of derivatives, and lastly using the underlying.","Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Jarrow, RA (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 451 Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",raj15@cornell.edu,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Not only does this challenge the academic risk management literature about the predominance of operative risks in asset management, it is also at odds with current practice in asset management firms. Asset managers do not hedge market risks even though these risks are systematically built into the revenue generation process. This is surprising as shareholders would not optimally choose asset management companies as their source of market beta. They rather prefer to participate in alpha generation and fund gathering expertise of investment managers as financial intermediaries. At the very minimum, asset managers need to monitor their 'fees at risk' to understand what impact product design, benchmark choice and fee contract design have on revenue volatility. This calls for a much wider interpretation of the risk management function that too narrowly focuses on client risks.","Morgan Stanley, London E14 4QA, England",,"Scherer, B (通讯作者)，Morgan Stanley, 25 Cabot Sq, London E14 4QA, England.",bernd.scherer@edhec.edu,,"Dr Scherer, Bernd/0000-0001-6926-5347",,,,,15,1,1,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Our main focus is on the class of linear contracts (one of the most commonly used contingent contracts) which consist of a transfer and a flat rate of profit sharing. We characterize outcomes implementable by linear contracts and provide a foundation for them by showing that, in finite type spaces, every social choice function that can be implemented using a more general nonlinear contingent contract can also be implemented using a linear contract. We then qualitatively describe the set of implementable outcomes. We show that a general class of social welfare criteria can be implemented. This class contains social choice functions (such as the Rawlsian) which cannot be implemented using (uncontingent) transfers.

In these publications he has dealt with a wide range of continuous time models and the associated econometric problems. He has investigated problems from univariate equations to systems of equations, from asymptotic theory to finite sample issues, from parametric models to nonparametric models, from identification problems to estimation and inference problems, and from stationary models to nonstationary and nearly nonstationary models. This paper provides an overview of Peter Phillips's contributions in the continuous time econometrics literature. We review the problems that have been tackled by him, outline the main techniques suggested by him, and discuss the main results obtained by him. Based on his early work, we compare the performance of three asymptotic distributions in a simple setup.

We also allow for asymmetries (leverage effects). We obtain the asymptotic distribution of the log-price process. For the weak fractional cointegration case, we obtain the asymptotic distribution of the ordinary least squares estimator of the cointegrating parameter based on data sampled from an equally spaced discretization of calendar time, and we justify a feasible method of hypothesis testing for the cointegrating parameter based on the corresponding t-statistic. In the strong fractional cointegration case, we obtain the limiting distribution of a continuously averaged tapered estimator as well as other estimators of the cointegrating parameter, and we find that the rate of convergence can be affected by properties of intertrade durations. In particular, the persistence of durations (hence of volatility) can affect the degree of cointegration. We also obtain the rate of convergence of several estimators of the cointegrating parameter in the standard cointegration case.

We give an error bound for our formula and establish its fast rate of convergence to the true price. Our method provides lookback option prices across the quantum of strike prices with greater efficiency than for a single strike price under existing methods. We provide an alternative proof to the Spitzer formula for the characteristic function of the maximum of a discretely observed stochastic process, which yields a numerically efficient algorithm based on convolutions. This is an important result which could have a wide range of applications in which the Spitzer formula is utilized.

Specifically, with respect to portfolio decisions, research has indicated that investors are subject to the disposition effect, i.e. they are reluctant to sell assets that have performed poorly (losers) and prone to sell assets that have performed well (winners). We find that the mutual fund investors in our sample are subject to the disposition effect when they withdraw the redemption proceeds from their account, but not when they reallocate the proceeds within the account. The evidence is consistent with Shefrin and Statman's hypothesis that framing a transaction as a transfer as opposed to a sale mitigates the disposition effect.","[Niehaus, Greg] Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Shrider, David] Farmer Sch Business, Oxford, OH USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Niehaus, G (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",gregn@moore.sc.edu,"Niehaus, Gregory/AAT-5985-2021",,,,,,27,6,7,2,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Second, workers' wages rise with seniority, where seniority is defined as a worker's tenure relative to the tenure of his colleagues. Controlling for tenure, the probability of a worker leaving the firm decreases with seniority. The increase in expected seniority with tenure explains a large part of the negative duration dependence of the separation hazard. Conditional on ten years of tenure, the wage differential between the 10th and the 90th percentiles of the seniority distribution is 1.1-1.4 percentage points in Denmark and 2.3-3.4 in Portugal.","[Buhai, I.

In addition, for both academic and financial communities it is a familiar stylized fact that stock return distributions are not normal. Both empirical evidence and experimental evidence indicate that distributional information of asset returns has an important impact on investors. In this paper, we argue that the right-tail distributional information of returns can provide very valuable information to investors and portfolio managers, and right-tail information should be used together with other (say, left-tail) information in analyzing financial markets. Here, we introduce measures for the right-tail distribution. Quantile regression estimators for the right-tail measures are proposed, and their asymptotic properties are developed. Statistical inference on testing for changes of right-tail distribution is also discussed. A Monte Carlo experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimator. The proposed estimation method may also be applied to estimation of other measures in finance.","[Xiao, Zhijie] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Boston College,"Xiao, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",xiaoz@bc.edu,,,,,,,37,3,6,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Nevertheless, SUP is often provided to non-critically ill patients despite a risk for clinically significant bleeding of roughly 0.1 %. The overuse of SUP therefore introduces added risks for adverse drug events and cost, with minimal expected benefit in clinical outcome. Historically, histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have been the preferred agent for SUP; however, recent data have revealed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as the most common modality (76 %). There are no high quality randomized controlled trials demonstrating superiority with PPIs compared with H2RAs for the prevention of clinically significant bleeding associated with stress ulcers. In contrast, PPIs have recently been linked to several adverse effects including Clostridium difficile diarrhea and pneumonia. These complications have substantial economic consequences and have a marked impact on the overall cost effectiveness of PPI therapy. Nevertheless, PPI use remains widespread in patients who are at both high and low risk for clinically significant bleeding. This article will describe the utilization of PPIs for SUP and present the clinical and economic consequences linked to their use/overuse.","[Barletta, Jeffrey F.; Sclar, David A.] Midwestern Univ, Coll Pharm Glendale, Dept Pharm Practice, Glendale, AZ 85308 USA",Midwestern University; Midwestern University - College of Pharmacy - Glendale,"Barletta, JF (通讯作者)，Midwestern Univ, Coll Pharm Glendale, Dept Pharm Practice, 19555 N 59th Ave, Glendale, AZ 85308 USA.",jbarle@midwestern.edu,"Barletta, Jeffrey F./B-2644-2013","Barletta, Jeffrey/0000-0002-9054-8218",Optimer Pharmaceuticals,Optimer Pharmaceuticals,"Jeffrey F.

These models are supported by the findings that El Nino/Southern Oscillation (as well as other natural phenomena) influence both the number of hurricanes and their strength. Hurricane risk is thus broken into three components: frequency, intensity and damage where the first two depend on the state of the Markov chain and intensity influences the amount of damage to an individual building.

How do they affect long-run adoption? A common fear among development practitioners is that one-off subsidies may negatively affect long-run adoption through reference-dependence: People might anchor around the subsidized price and be unwilling to pay more for the product later. But for experience goods, one-off subsidies could also boost long-run adoption through learning. This paper uses data from a two-stage randomized pricing experiment in Kenya to estimate the relative importance of these effects for a new, improved antimalarial bed net. Reduced form estimates show that a one-time subsidy has a positive impact on willingness to pay a year later inherit. To separately identify the learning and anchoring effects, we estimate a parsimonious experience-good model. Estimation results show a large, positive learning effect but no anchoring. We black then discuss the types of products and the contexts inherit for which these results may apply.","Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Dupas, P (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pdupas@stanford.edu,,"Dupas, Pascaline/0000-0003-0140-9417",NICHD NIH HHS [P01 HD061315] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,39,169,212,3,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2014,82.0,1,,,,,197,228,,10.3982/ECTA9508,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA7KQ,25308977.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331276700005,0

The variables selected include lagged flows and weather inputs also with their lagged values. The performances of this technique were compared and evaluated for the best results amongst various combinations of inputs.

Estimation is regarded as the principal challenge in applying these models since they were proposed by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B, 2001, 63(2), 167-241]. Most previous work has used a Bayesian paradigm, whereas we treat the problem in the framework of maximum likelihood estimation, applying gradient-based simulation optimization. A hidden Markov model is introduced to formulate the likelihood of observations; sequential Monte Carlo is applied to sample the hidden states from the posterior distribution; smooth perturbation analysis is used to deal with the discontinuities introduced by jumps in estimating the gradient. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed gradient-based simulated maximum likelihood estimation approach provides an efficient alternative to current estimation methods.","[Peng, Yi-Jie; Hu, Jian-Qiang] Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Fu, Michael C.] Univ Maryland, Syst Res Inst, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Fudan University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Hu, JQ (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",hujq@fudan.edu.cn,"Hu, Jianqiang/K-2128-2017; Peng, Chunyi/F-3726-2014; Fu, Michael C/N-4098-2013; peng, Yi/O-1682-2015","Fu, Michael C/0000-0003-2105-4932; peng, Yi/0000-0002-2361-2224","National Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-0856256, EECS-0901543]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA9550-10-1-0340]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71071040, 71028001, 70832002, 71061160506]; Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institution of Higher Learning; Programme for Cultivating Innovative Students in Key Disciplines of Fudan University; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [1362303] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institution of Higher Learning; Programme for Cultivating Innovative Students in Key Disciplines of Fudan University; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grants CMMI-0856256 and EECS-0901543, by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) under Grant FA9550-10-1-0340, by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 71071040, 71028001, 70832002, 71061160506, by the Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institution of Higher Learning, and by the Programme for Cultivating Innovative Students in Key Disciplines of Fudan University.",,37,10,12,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

A small trial of co-trimoxazole demonstrated improvements in symptoms and functional parameters over a 3-month period. We therefore conducted a larger trial with a concurrent economic evaluation to investigate this antibiotic further. We report an economic evaluation alongside a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 12 months therapy with 960 mg co-trimoxazole daily in 181 patients with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). Patients were recruited from 28 university and district hospitals in the UK and were aged over 40 years with fibrotic IIP. We report costs to the National Health Service (NHS) and society, change in forced vital capacity (primary endpoint) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, incremental cost effectiveness and cost utility ratios over 12 months. From the perspective of society, mean cost per patient in the co-trimoxazole arm was approximately A 1177 pound higher than in the placebo arm, but mean QALYs were 0.053 higher yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 22,012 pound per QALY gained with a 54.44 % probability of being below A 30,000 pound. The cost of IPF to UK society in 2011 is tentatively estimated at A 124 pound million, of which 13 % is NHS costs, 1 % social services, 2 % patient out-of-pocket costs and 84 % lost productivity. Given commonly employed thresholds in the UK NHS, on balance co-trimoxazole may be a cost-effective treatment for IPF, although there is substantial decision uncertainty. However, recent guidance on the use of immunosuppressive therapy in IPF patients should be taken into account prior to any policy decision.","[Wilson, Edward C.

To ensure non-negative values for the intensity and interest rate, we assume a quadratic Gaussian process for the default intensity and discount interest rate. Correlations among default intensity, discount interest rate, and collateral value are represented by correlations among Brownian motions driving the movement of the Gaussian state variables. Given these assumptions, the expected loss or the mth moment of the loss distribution is obtained by a time integral of an exponential quadratic form of the state variables. The coefficients of the form are derived by solving ordinary differential equations. In particular, with no correlation between the default intensity and the discount interest rate, the coefficients have explicit closed-form solutions. We use numerical examples to analyse the effects of the correlation between the default intensity and the collateral value on expected loss and the standard deviation of the loss distribution.","[Yamashita, Satoshi] Inst Stat Math, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908562, Japan; [Yoshiba, Toshinao] Bank Japan, Chuo Ku, Tokyo 1038660, Japan",Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM) - Japan; Bank of Japan,"Yoshiba, T (通讯作者)，Bank Japan, Chuo Ku, Tokyo 1038660, Japan.",toshinao.yoshiba@boj.or.jp,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Players are assumed to interact with their two neighbors and to imitate actions with the highest average payoffs. We find that the payoff-dominant equilibrium survives in the long run with positive probability. The results derive the conditions under which both risk-dominant-strategy and payoff-dominant-strategy takers co-exist in the long run. The risk-dominant equilibrium is the unique long-run equilibrium for the remaining cases. This study extends and complements the analyses of Eshel et al. (Am Econ Rev 88:157-179, 1998) and Vega-Redondo (Evolution, games, and economic behaviour, 1996).

A number of bootstrap procedures have been proposed in the recent literature some of which include estimated deterministic components and nonzero initial values in the bootstrap recursion while others do the opposite. To date, however, there has not been a study into the relative performance of these two alternative approaches. In this paper we fill this gap in the literature and consider the impact of these choices on both ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized least squares (GLS) detrended tests, in the case of the latter proposing a new bootstrap algorithm as part of our analysis. Overall, for OLS detrended tests our findings suggest that it is preferable to take the computationally simpler approach of not including estimated deterministic components in the bootstrap recursion and setting the initial values of the bootstrap recursion to zero. For GLS detrended tests, we find that the approach of Trenkler (2009), who includes a restricted estimate of the deterministic component in the bootstrap recursion, can improve finite sample behavior further.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Taylor, A.

The bidask spread of the LOB is modeled by a tick-valued continuous-time Markov chain. We consider a small agent who continuously submits limit buy/sell orders at best bid/ask quotes, and may also set limit orders at best bid (resp. ask) plus (resp. minus) a tick for obtaining execution order priority, which is a crucial issue in high-frequency trading. The agent faces an execution risk since her limit orders are executed only when they meet counterpart market orders. She is also subject to inventory risk due to price volatility when holding the risky asset. The agent can then also choose to trade with market orders, and therefore obtain immediate execution, but at a less favorable price. The objective of the market maker is to maximize her expected utility from revenue over a short-term horizon by a trade-off between limit and market orders, while controlling her inventory position. This is formulated as a mixed regime switching regular/impulse control problem that we characterize in terms of a quasi-variational system by dynamic programming methods. Calibration procedures are derived for estimating the transition matrix and intensity parameters for the spread and for Cox processes modelling the execution of limit orders. We provide an explicit backward splitting scheme for solving the problem and show how it can be reduced to a system of simple equations involving only the inventory and spread variables. Several computational tests are performed both on simulated and real data, and illustrate the impact and profit when considering execution priority in limit orders and market orders.","[Guilbaud, Fabien] Univ Paris 07, EXQIM, CNRS, UMR 7599, F-75221 Paris 05, France; [Guilbaud, Fabien] Univ Paris 07, Lab Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoires, CNRS, UMR 7599, F-75221 Paris 05, France; [Huyen Pham] Univ Paris 07, Lab Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoires, CREST ENSAE, F-75221 Paris 05, France; [Huyen Pham] Inst Univ France, CNRS, UMR 7599, F-75221 Paris, France",Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI); Institut Universitaire de France; Universite Paris Cite; Sorbonne Universite,"Pham, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 07, Lab Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoires, CREST ENSAE, F-75221 Paris 05, France.",pham@math.jussieu.fr,,,,,,,24,77,103,3,71,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

These studies found dabigatran was generally cost-effective, considering well-accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds, but estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) varied, even in the same setting. The objective of this study was to compare the findings of the published economic models and identify key model features accounting for differences. Methods All aspects of the economic evaluations were reviewed: model approach, inputs, and assumptions. A previously published model served as the reference model for comparisons of the selected studies in the US and UK settings. The reference model was adapted, wherever possible, using the inputs and key assumptions from each of the other published studies to determine if results could be reproduced in the reference model. Incremental total costs, incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and ICERs (cost per QALY) were compared between each study and the corresponding adapted reference model. The impact of each modified variable or assumption was tracked separately. Results The selected studies were in the US setting (2), the Canadian setting (1), and the UK setting (2). All models used the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation study (RE-LY) as the main source for clinical inputs, and all used a Markov modelling approach, except one that used discrete event simulation. The reference model had been published in the Canadian and UK settings. In the UK setting, the reference model reported an ICER of UK 4,831 pound, whereas the other UK-based analysis reported an ICER of UK 23,082 pound. When the reference model was modified to use the same population characteristics, cost inputs, and utility inputs, it reproduced the results of the other model (ICER UK 25,518) pound reasonably well. Key reasons for the different results between the two models were the assumptions on the event utility decrement and costs associated with intracranial haemorrhage, as well as the costs of warfarin monitoring and disability following events. In the US setting, the reference model produced an ICER similar to the ICER from one of the US models (US$15,115/QALY versus US$12,386/QALY, respectively) when modelling assumptions and input values were transferred into the reference model. Key differences in results could be explained by the population characteristics (age and baseline stroke risk), utility assigned to events and specific treatments, adjustment of stroke and intracranial haemorrhage risk over time, and treatment discontinuation and switching. The reference model was able to replicate the QALY results, but not the cost results, reported by the other US cost-effectiveness analysis. The parameters driving the QALY results were utility values by disability levels as well as utilities assigned to specific treatments, and event and background mortality rates. Conclusions Despite differences in model designs and structures, it was mostly possible to replicate the results published by different authors and identify variables responsible for differences between ICERs using a reference model approach. This enables a better interpretation of published findings by focusing attention on the assumptions underlying the key model features accounting for differences.","[Sorensen, Sonja V.; Peng, Siyang; Kansal, Anuraag R.] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Monz, Brigitta U.] Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH & Co KG, Ingelheim, Germany; [Bradley-Kennedy, Carole] Boehringer Ingelheim Canada Ltd, Burlington, ON, Canada",United Biosource Corporation; Boehringer Ingelheim; Boehringer Ingelheim,"Sorensen, SV (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",Sonja.sorensen@unitedbiosource.com,"MUÑOZ, ROSA ANA/H-3964-2018","Kansal, Anuraag/0000-0001-5609-1464",Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH,Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH(Boehringer Ingelheim),"The project was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH.

Pharmacotherapy is an important and effective treatment modality for hypercholesterolaemia, with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ('statins') the most commonly used class of drugs. Over the past decade, there has been intensive research to identify pharmacogenetic markers to guide treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. This study aimed to review the evidence of incremental cost, effect and cost effectiveness of pharmacogenetic-guided treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Three cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) were identified that studied the value of screening for genotypes of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and kinesin family member 6 (KIF6) prior to initiating statin therapy. For all three CEAs, a major limitation identified was the reproducibility of the evidence supporting the clinical effect of screening for the pharmacogenetic marker. Associated issues included the uncertain value of pharmacogenetic markers over or in addition to existing approaches for monitoring lipid levels, and the lack of evidence to assess the effectiveness of alternative therapeutic options for individuals identified as poor responders to statin therapy. Finally, the economic context of the market for diagnostic tests (is it competitive or is there market power?) and the practicality of large-scale screening programmes to inform prescribing in a complex and varied market may limit the generalizability of the results of the specific CEAs to policy outcomes. The genotype of solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) has recently been associated with increased risk of muscle toxicity with statin therapy and the review identified that exploration of cost effectiveness of this pharmacogenetic marker is likely warranted.","[Sorich, Michael J.; Wiese, Michael D.] Univ S Australia, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Sorich, Michael J.; Wiese, Michael D.] Univ S Australia, Sansom Inst Hlth Res, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [O'Shea, Rebekah L.; Pekarsky, Brita] Baker IDI Heart & Diabet Inst, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of South Australia; University of South Australia; Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute,"Sorich, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",michael.sorich@unisa.edu.au,"Sorich, Michael J/A-1210-2011; Wiese, Michael/A-4743-2011","Sorich, Michael J/0000-0003-1999-866X; Wiese, Michael/0000-0002-3255-9242; O'Shea, Rebekah/0000-0002-5683-9126",National Heart Foundation of Australia [G11A5902],National Heart Foundation of Australia(National Heart Foundation of Australia),"This work was supported by the National Heart Foundation of Australia [G11A5902].

The speculation arises from the traders' heterogeneous posteriors as they make different inferences from sequences of public information. This leads to overpricing in the sense that price exceeds the most optimistic belief about the real value of the asset. We find evidence of speculative overpricing in both incomplete and complete markets, where the information flow is a gradually revealed sequence of imperfect public signals about the state of the world. We also find evidence of asymmetric price reaction to good news and bad news, another feature of equilibrium price dynamics under our model. Markets with a relaxed short-sale constraint exhibit less overpricing.","[Palfrey, Thomas R.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Wang, Stephanie W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",California Institute of Technology; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Palfrey, TR (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",trp@hss.caltech.edu; swwang@pitt.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-0617820]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Social Science Experimental Laboratory at Caltech; California Social Science Experimental Laboratory at UCLA,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); Social Science Experimental Laboratory at Caltech; California Social Science Experimental Laboratory at UCLA,"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Science Foundation (Grant SES-0617820), the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Social Science Experimental Laboratory at Caltech, and the California Social Science Experimental Laboratory at UCLA.

It is a shrinkage estimation method that allows one to select parsimonious models.

In recent years, many authors analyzed this technique from a theoretical and applied point of view. We introduce and study the adaptive LASSO problem for discretely observed multivariate diffusion processes. We prove oracle properties and also derive the asymptotic distribution of the LASSO estimator. This is a nontrivial extension of previous results by Wang and Leng (2007, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 102(479), 1039-1048) on LASSO estimation because of different rates of convergence of the estimators in the drift and diffusion coefficients.

By introducing the concept of time inconsistency in efficiency and defining the induced trade-off, we further demonstrate in this paper that investors behave irrationally under the precommitted optimal mean-variance portfolio policy when their wealth is above certain threshold during the investment process. By relaxing the self-financing restriction to allow withdrawal of money out of the market, we develop a revised mean-variance policy which dominates the precommitted optimal mean-variance portfolio policy in the sense that, while the two achieve the same mean-variance pair of the terminal wealth, the revised policy enables the investor to receive a free cash flow stream (FCFS) during the investment process.

We connect the ruin problem of the ex-dividend risk process with the first passage problem of the Levy process reflected at its running maximum. We prove that if the positive jumps of the risk model form a compound Poisson process and the remaining part is a spectrally negative Levy process with unbounded variation, the Laplace transform (as a function of the initial surplus) of the upward entrance time of the reflected (at the running infimum) Levy process exhibits the smooth pasting property at the reflecting barrier. When the surplus process is described by a double exponential jump diffusion in the absence of dividend payment, we derive some explicit expressions for the Laplace transform of the ruin time, the distribution of the deficit at ruin, and the total expected discounted dividends. Numerical experiments concerning the optimal barrier strategy are performed and new empirical findings are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These predictions are precisely those provided by interim correlated rationalizability (ICR). This negative result is obtained under the assumption that agents have no information on payoffs. This assumption is unnatural in many settings. It is therefore natural to ask whether Weinstein and Yildiz's results remain true under more general information structures. This paper characterizes the robust predictions in static and dynamic games, under arbitrary information structures. This characterization is provided by an extensive form solution concept: interim sequential rationalizability (ISR). In static games, ISR coincides with ICR and does not depend on the assumptions on agents' information. Hence the no information assumption entails no loss of generality in these settings. This is not the case in dynamic games, where ISR refines ICR and depends on the details of the information structure. In these settings, the robust predictions depend on the assumptions on agents' information. This reveals a hitherto neglected interaction between information and higher order uncertainty, raising novel questions of robustness.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Penta, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",apenta@ssc.wisc.edu,,"Penta, Antonio/0000-0003-3796-8245",,,,,27,17,20,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2012,80.0,2,,,,,631,660,,10.3982/ECTA9159,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,909PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301577200004,0

Policy makers in many middle- and low-income countries are in the process of scaling up HIV prevention, treatment and care services in the context of a reduction in international HIV funding due to the global economic downturn. In order to scale up services that are sustainable in the long term, policy makers and implementers need to have access to robust and contemporary strategic information, including financial information on expenditure and cost, in order to be able to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate HIV services. A major problem in middle- and low-income countries continues to be a lack of basic information on the use of services, their cost, outcome and impact, while those few costing studies that have been performed were often not done in a standardized fashion. Some researchers handle this by transposing information from one country to another, developing mathematical or statistical models that rest on assumptions or information that may not be applicable, or using top-down costing methods that only provide global financial costs rather than using bottom-up ingredients-based costing. While these methods provide answers in the short term, countries should develop systematic data collection systems to store, transfer and produce robust and contemporary strategic financial information for stakeholders at local, sub-national and national levels. National aggregated information should act as the main source of financial data for international donors, agencies or other organizations involved with the global HIV response. This paper describes the financial information required by policy makers and other stakeholders to enable them to make evidence-informed decisions and reviews the quantity and quality of the financial information available, as indicated by cost studies published between 1981 and 2008. Among the lessons learned from reviewing these studies, a need was identified for providing countries with practical guidance to produce reliable and standardized costing data to monitor performance, as countries want to improve programmes and services, and have to demonstrate an efficient use of resources. Finally, the issues raised in this paper relate to the provision of all areas of healthcare in countries and it is going to be increasingly important to leverage the lessons learned from the HIV experience and use resources more effectively and efficiently to improve health systems in general.","[Beck, Eduard J.; Gerbase, Sofia; Harling, Guy; De Lay, Paul] UNAIDS Secretariat, Programme Branch, Off Deputy Director, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland; [Avila, Carlos] UNAIDS Secretariat, Dept Evidence Strategy & Results, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland",UNAIDS; UNAIDS,"Beck, EJ (通讯作者)，UNAIDS Secretariat, Programme Branch, Off Deputy Director, 20 Ave Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.",becke@unaids.org,,"Harling, Guy/0000-0001-6604-491X",,,,,66,10,10,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,10,,,,,887,902,,,,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,012QO,22830633.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309251800003,0

Apart from any ethical considerations raised by the presence among us of the very rich, statistical inference is complicated by the need to consider distributions of which the moments may not exist. In extreme cases, no valid inference about expectations is possible until restrictions are imposed on the class of distributions admitted by econometric models. It is therefore important to determine the limits of conventional inference in the presence of heavy tails, and, in particular, of bootstrap inference. In this paper, recent progress in the field is reviewed, and examples given of how inference may fail, and of the sorts of conditions that can be imposed to ensure valid inference.","[Davidson, Russell] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Davidson, Russell] McGill Univ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Davidson, Russell] Ctr Vieille Charite, GREQAM, F-13236 Marseille 02, France",McGill University; Universite de Montreal; McGill University; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Davidson, R (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",russell.davidson@mcgill.ca,,,"Canada Research Chair programme (Chair in Economics, McGill University); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture; University of Surrey","Canada Research Chair programme (Chair in Economics, McGill University); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture; University of Surrey","This research was supported by the Canada Research Chair programme (Chair in Economics, McGill University), and by grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture.

We consider an FX market network in which each node represents an exchange rate and each weighted edge represents a time-dependent correlation between the rates. To provide insights into the clustering of the exchange-rate time series, we investigate dynamic communities in the network. We show that there is a relationship between an exchange rate's functional role within the market and its position within its community and use a node-centric community analysis to track the temporal dynamics of such roles. This reveals which exchange rates dominate the market at particular times and also identifies exchange rates that experienced significant changes in market role. We also use the community dynamics to uncover major structural changes that occurred in the FX market. Our techniques are general and will be similarly useful for investigating correlations in other markets.","[Fenn, Daniel J.] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Math & Computat Finance Grp, Oxford OX1 3LB, England; [Fenn, Daniel J.; Porter, Mason A.; Johnson, Neil F.; Jones, Nick S.] Univ Oxford, CABDyN Complex Ctr, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Porter, Mason A.] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Oxford OX1 3LB, England; [Mucha, Peter J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Math, Carolina Ctr Interdisciplinary Appl Math, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Mucha, Peter J.] Univ N Carolina, Inst Adv Mat Nanosci & Technol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [McDonald, Mark; Williams, Stacy] HSBC Bank, FX Res & Trading Grp, London E14 5HQ, England; [Johnson, Neil F.] Univ Miami, Dept Phys, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Jones, Nick S.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Jones, Nick S.] Oxford Ctr Integrat Syst Biol, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Jones, Nick S.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; HSBC Holdings; University of Miami; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Imperial College London,"Fenn, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Math & Computat Finance Grp, Oxford OX1 3LB, England.",dan.fenn@hsbcib.com,,,"CASE award from the EPSRC; HSBC bank; BBSRC; EPSRC [EP/I005986/1, EP/H046917/1, EP/I005765/1]; James S.

Health economic guidelines recommend the inclusion of future costs related to the intervention of interest within CEAs but provide little guidance regarding the definition of 'related'. In the case of CEAs of therapies that extend the lives of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis but do not impact the need for or the intensity of dialysis, the determination of the relatedness of future dialysis costs to the therapy of interest is particularly ambiguous. The uncertainty as to whether dialysis costs are related or unrelated in these circumstances has led to inconsistencies in the conduct of CEAs for such products, with dialysis costs included in some analyses while excluded in others. Due to the magnitude of the cost of dialysis, whether or not dialysis costs are included in CEAs of such therapies has substantial implications for the results of such analyses, often meaning the difference between a therapy being deemed cost effective (in instances where dialysis costs are excluded) or not cost effective (in instances where dialysis costs are included). This paper explores the issues and implications surrounding the inclusion of dialysis costs in CEAs of therapies that extend the lives of dialysis patients but do not impact the need for dialysis. Relevant case studies clearly demonstrate that, regardless of the clinical benefits of a life-extending intervention for dialysis patients, and due to the high cost of dialysis, the inclusion of dialysis costs in the analysis essentially eliminates the possibility of obtaining a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio. This raises the significant risk that dialysis patients may be denied access to interventions that are cost effective in other populations due solely to the high background cost of dialysis itself. Finally, the paper presents a case for excluding dialysis costs in CEAs of therapies that extend the lives of patients receiving dialysis but do not impact the need for dialysis. The argument is founded on the following: (i) health economic guidelines imply that dialysis costs are unrelated to such therapies and therefore should not be included in CEAs of such therapies; (ii) the high cost and cost-effectiveness ratio associated with dialysis place an unreasonable and insurmountable barrier to demonstrating the cost effectiveness of such therapies, particularly since the decision to fund dialysis has already been made; and (iii) current clinical and reimbursement practices include the use of such therapies for patients with CKD receiving dialysis. We conclude that the exclusion of dialysis costs in such cases is methodologically correct given current health economic guidelines and is consistent with current practices regarding the treatment of dialysis patients.","[Grima, Daniel T.; Bernard, Lisa M.] Cornerstone Res Grp, Burlington, ON L7N 3H8, Canada; [Dunn, Elizabeth S.] Genzyme Corp, Boston, MA USA; [McFarlane, Philip A.] St Michaels Hosp, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; [Mendelssohn, David C.] Humber River Reg Hosp, Toronto, ON, Canada",Cornerstone Research Group; Sanofi-Aventis; Genzyme Corporation; University of Toronto; Saint Michaels Hospital Toronto,"Bernard, LM (通讯作者)，Cornerstone Res Grp, 204-3228 S Serv Rd, Burlington, ON L7N 3H8, Canada.",lbernard@cornerstone-research.com,,,Janssen; Amgen; Genzyme; Takeda; Shire; Baxter; Biovail; BMS; Novartis; Boehringer Ingelheim; Ortho-Biotech; Merck/Schering; Sanofi-Aventis; Abbott/Solvay; Astra Zeneca; GSK; Novo Nordisk,Janssen(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Amgen(Amgen); Genzyme(Sanofi-AventisGenzyme Corporation); Takeda(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd); Shire; Baxter; Biovail; BMS(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Novartis(Novartis); Boehringer Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim); Ortho-Biotech; Merck/Schering(Merck & Company); Sanofi-Aventis(Sanofi-Aventis); Abbott/Solvay(Abbott Laboratories); Astra Zeneca(AstraZeneca); GSK(GlaxoSmithKline); Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),"DM discloses relationships for consulting, honoraria and/or grants with Janssen, Amgen, Genzyme, Takeda, Shire and Baxter.

Because many of these patients experience chronic endobronchial colonization and have to take antibiotics and be treated as inpatients, societal costs of CF may be high. As the disease severity varies considerably among patients, costs may differ between patients. Objectives: Our objectives were to calculate the average total costs of CF per patient and per year from a societal perspective; to include all direct medical and non-medical costs as well as indirect costs; to identify the main cost drivers; to investigate whether patients with CF can be grouped into homogenous cost groups; and to determine the influence of specific factors on different cost categories. Methods: Resource utilization data were collected for 87 patients admitted to an inpatient unit at a CF treatment centre during the first 6 months of 2004 and 125 patients who visited the centre's CF outpatient unit during the entire year. Fifty-four patients were admitted to the hospital and also visited the outpatient unit. Since all patients were exclusively treated at the centre, data could be aggregated. Costs that varied greatly between patients were measured per patient. The remaining costs were summarized as overhead costs and allocated on the basis of days of treatment or contacts per patient. Costs of the outpatient and inpatient units and costs for drugs patients received at the outpatient pharmacy were summarized as direct medical costs. Direct non-medical costs (i.e. travel expenses), as well as indirect costs (i. e. absence from work, productivity losses), were also included in the analysis. Main cost drivers were detected by the analysis of different cost categories. Patients were classified according to a diagnosis-related severity model, and median comparison tests (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests) were performed to investigate differences between the severity groups. Generalized least squares (GLS) regressions were used to identify variables influencing different cost categories. A sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was performed. Results: The mean total cost per patient per year was 41 468 (year 2004 values). Direct medical costs accounted for more than 90% of total costs and averaged (sic)38 869 ((sic)3876 to (sic)88 096), whereas direct non-medical costs were minimal. Indirect costs amounted to (sic)2491 (6% of total costs). Costs for drugs patients received at the outpatient pharmacy were the main cost driver. Costs rose with the degree of severity. Patients with moderate and severe disease had significantly hieher direct costs than the relatively milder group. Regression analysis revealed that direct costs were mainly affected by the diagnosis-related severity level and the expiratory volume; the coefficient indicating the relationship between costs for mild CF patients and other patients rose with the degree of severity. A similar result was obtained for drug costs per patient as the dependent variable. Monte Carlo simulation suggests that there is a 90% probability that annual costs will be lower than (sic)37 300. Conclusions: The share of indirect costs as a percentage of total costs for CF was rather low in this study. However, the relevance of indirect costs is likely to increase in the future as the life expectancy of CF patients increases, which is likely to lead to a rising work disability rate and thus increase indirect costs. Moreover we found that infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa increases costs substantially. Thus, a decrease of the prevalence of P. aeruginosa would lead to substantial savings for society.","[Heimeshoff, Mareike; Schreyoegg, Jonas; Tiemann, Oliver] Univ Hamburg, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Inst Hlth Care Management & Hlth Econ, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Hollmeyer, Helge; Staab, Doris] Charite, Dept Paediat Pneumol & Immunol, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Schreyoegg, Jonas; Tiemann, Oliver] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Munich, Germany",University of Hamburg; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Heimeshoff, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Inst Hlth Care Management & Hlth Econ, Esplanade 36, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",mareike.heimeshoff@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,"Schreyögg, Jonas/AAY-6182-2021","Schreyögg, Jonas/0000-0001-8030-2161","Munich Center of Health Sciences, based at Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich","Munich Center of Health Sciences, based at Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich","The authors would like to thank the Munich Center of Health Sciences, based at Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, for their support.",,37,29,34,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,9,,,,,763,777,,10.2165/11588870-000000000-00000,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,002GL,22690685.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308520000002,0

Objective: Our objective was to compare the real-world treatment patterns and costs between patients with CLBP who initiated duloxetine and matched controls who initiated another non-surgical treatment. Methods: The study sample was selected from a US privately insured claims database (2004-8). Selected patients were aged 18-64 years, and had a low back pain (LBP) diagnosis (per Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS] specifications) with a subsequent CLBP-qualifying diagnosis recorded >= 90 days after the initial LBP diagnosis. Duloxetine-treated patients had >= 1 duloxetine prescription within 6 months after CLBP diagnosis, no prior duloxetine claim, and continuous eligibility >= 12 months before first LBP diagnosis and >= 6 months after index duloxetine prescription (study period). Because duloxetine patients had higher rates of co-morbidities, 553 duloxetine-treated patients were matched to 553 control patients who initiated another non-surgical LBP treatment based on propensity score and time from first LBP diagnosis to treatment initiation. A subset (n = 103 each) of matched employees with disability data was also analysed to assess work loss. Main outcomes measures included study period treatment rates and direct (medical and drug) costs from a third-party payer perspective and employee indirect (work-loss) costs. McNemar tests were used to compare LBP treatment rates. Bias-corrected bootstrapping t-tests were used to compare costs. Results: After matching, the two groups had balanced baseline characteristics including demographics, LBP diagnostic categories, co-morbidity profiles, resource use, treatment patterns and mean direct costs. During the 6-month study period, matched duloxetine-treated patients had significantly lower rates of other pharmacological therapy (e.g. 56.2% vs 64.9% narcotic opioids, p = 0.0024; 34.9% vs 49.5% NSAIDs, p < 0.0001) and non-invasive therapy (28.8% vs 38.5% chiropractic therapy, p = 0.0007; 25.5% vs 35.4% physical therapy, p = 0.0004; 17.5% vs 28.4% exercise therapy, p < 0.0001) than controls. Duloxetine-treated patients versus controls had similar back surgery rates (2.2% vs 3.8%; p = 0.1127) and similar direct costs ($US7658 vs $US7439; p = 0.8119). Among CLBP employees, duloxetine-treated employees versus controls had lower rates of other non-surgical therapy, similar back surgery rates (0.0% vs 3.9%; p = 0.1250), lower total direct and indirect costs ($US5227 vs $US7299; p = 0.0418), and similar indirect costs ($US1806 vs $US2664; p = 0.0528). Conclusions: Duloxetine treatment in CLBP patients/employees versus other non-surgical treatment was associated with reduced rates of non-surgical therapies and similar back surgery rates, without increased costs.","[Ivanova, Jasmina I.] Anal Grp Inc, New York, NY 10020 USA; [Birnbaum, Howard G.; Kantor, Evan; Schiller, Matt] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Swindle, Ralph W.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Analysis Group Inc.; Eli Lilly,"Ivanova, JI (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 10 Rockefeller Plaza,15th Floor, New York, NY 10020 USA.",jivanova@analysisgroup.com,,,"Eli Lilly and Company, IN, USA","Eli Lilly and Company, IN, USA(Eli Lilly)","Funding for this study was provided by Eli Lilly and Company, IN, USA to Analysis Group, Inc.

This model is based on taking the conditional stock return distribution to be normal with its variance itself being a random variable. The form of the actual stock return distribution will depend on the distribution for the variance. In practice, the distributions chosen for the variance appear to be very limited.

The corresponding estimation procedures are derived by the method of moments and the method of maximum likelihood.

Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is available in numerous countries as immediate-release and extended-release tablets for the treatment of major psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with quetiapine have demonstrated its efficacy in bipolar I and II disorders, and the drug has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials. Three cost-effectiveness analyses of maintenance therapy in bipolar I disorder, which used similar Markov models and incorporated data from key clinical trials and a number of other sources, showed that quetiapine, as adjunctive therapy with mood stabilizers (lithium or divalproex), was a cost-effective treatment option from the healthcare payer perspective in the UK and the US. Quetiapine either dominated comparators (typically mood stabilizers alone) or was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios that were usually well below widely accepted thresholds of cost effectiveness. One of the studies evaluated extended-release quetiapine, although clinical efficacy data used in the Markov model were for the immediate-release formulation. In another analysis, which used a discrete-event simulation model and was conducted from the perspective of the UK healthcare payer, quetiapine monotherapy was cost effective compared with olanzapine monotherapy as maintenance treatment for all phases of bipolar I or II disorder. In this model, favourable results were also shown for quetiapine (with or without mood stabilizers) compared with a wide range of maintenance therapy regimens. Another modelled analysis conducted from the UK healthcare payer perspective showed that quetiapine was dominated by haloperidol in the short-term treatment of a manic episode in patients with bipolar I disorder. Both favourable and unfavourable results have been reported in cost analyses of quetiapine in bipolar disorder (type I or type not specified). Possible explanations for some of the variability in results of the pharmacoeconomic analyses include heterogeneity among the models in terms of input parameters or assumptions in the base-case analyses, country- or region-specific differences in estimates of healthcare resource use and associated costs, variability in treatment alternatives, and differences in the year of costing and discounting used in the analyses. In addition, some of the studies had short time horizons and focused on acute manic episodes only, whereas others were longer-term analyses that considered the full spectrum of health states in patients with bipolar disorder. Various limitations of the studies have been recognized, and results from one country may not be applicable to other countries. In conclusion, results of available pharmacoeconomic analyses provide evidence of the cost effectiveness of quetiapine as an adjunct to mood stabilizers for maintenance therapy in (primarily type I) bipolar disorder from a healthcare payer perspective in the UK and the US. Some evidence is available to support the cost effectiveness of quetiapine monotherapy or the use of extended-release quetiapine as adjunctive therapy with mood stabilizers in this setting, although further analyses appear to be warranted. Whether these findings apply to other geographical regions requires further study. Evidence for the long-term (>2-year) cost effectiveness of quetiapine in bipolar disorder is currently limited and further studies are also needed to address the cost effectiveness of quetiapine from a societal perspective and in bipolar II disorder.","Adis, Auckland, New Zealand",Adis International,"Plosker, GL (通讯作者)，Adis, 41 Centorian Dr,Private Bag 65901,N Shore 0754, Auckland, New Zealand.",demail@adis.co.nz,,,,,,,73,8,8,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,7,,,,,611,631,,,,,,21,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,966DG,22559293.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305817200006,0

The representative optimal insurance form is the truncated deductible insurance, where the insured retains all losses once losses exceed a critical level and adopts a particular deductible otherwise. Additionally, the effects of the optimal coverage levels are also examined with respect to benchmark wealth and loss aversion coefficient. Moreover, the efficiencies among various insurances are compared via numerical analysis by assuming that the loss obeys a uniform or log-normal distribution. In addition to optimal insurance, deductible insurance is the most efficient if the benchmark wealth is small and upper-limit insurance if large. In the case of a uniform distribution that has an upper bound, deductible insurance and optimal insurance coincide if benchmark wealth is small. Conversely, deductible insurance is never optimal for an unbounded loss such as a log-normal distribution.","[Huang, Hung-Hsi] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Chiayi 60054, Taiwan; [Wang, Ching-Ping] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Grad Inst Finance Econ & Business Decis, Kaohsiung 80778, Taiwan",National Chiayi University; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Huang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 580 Sinmin Rd, Chiayi 60054, Taiwan.",d86723002@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,29,6,8,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This study assessed the validity of those findings with real-world adjuvant chemotherapy (aCT) recommendations from the US third-party payer perspective. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for stage II, T3, MMR-P colon cancer patients using guideline-compliant, state-transition probability estimation methods in a Markov model. A study of 141 patients from 17 sites in the Mayo Clinic Cancer Research Consortium provided aCT recommendations before and after knowledge of the 12-gene assay results. Progression and adverse events data with aCT regimens were based on published literature. Drug and administration costs for aCT were obtained from 2014 Medicare Fee Schedule. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the drivers and robustness of the primary outcomes. After receiving the 12-gene assay results, physician recommendations in favor of aCT decreased 22 %; fluoropyrimidine monotherapy and FOLFOX recommendations each declined 11 %. Average per-patient drugs, administration, and adverse events costs decreased $US2,339, $US733, and $US3,211, respectively. Average total direct medical costs decreased $US991. Average patient well-being improved by 0.114 QALYs. Savings are expected to persist even if the cost of oxaliplatin drops by > 75 % due to generic substitution. This study provides evidence that real-world changes in aCT recommendations due to the 12-gene assay are likely to reduce direct medical costs and improve well-being for stage II, T3, MMR-P colon cancer patients.","[Alberts, Steven R.; Renfro, Lindsay A.; Srivastava, Geetika] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN 55902 USA; [Yu, Tiffany M.; Hornberger, John] Cedar Associates LLC, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Behrens, Robert J.] Med Oncol & Hematol Associates, Des Moines, IA 50309 USA; [Soori, Gamini S.] Alegant Bergan Mercy Canc Ctr, Omaha, NE 68124 USA; [Dakhil, Shaker R.] Canc Ctr Kansas, Wichita, KS 67214 USA; [Mowat, Rex B.] Toledo Clin, Toledo, OH 43623 USA; [Kuebler, John P.] Columbus Oncol Associates, Columbus, OH 43214 USA; [Kim, George P.] Mayo Clin, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Mazurczak, Miroslaw A.] Sanford Hosp, Sioux Falls, SD 57117 USA; [Hornberger, John] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Mayo Clinic; Cancer Center of Kansas; Mayo Clinic; Sanford Health; Stanford University,"Hornberger, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Sch Med, 291 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ujch@stanford.edu,"Hornberger, John/M-4932-2019; Renfro, Lindsay/IQW-3182-2023",,"Genomic Health, Inc.

The proposed method is based on optimally combining information over multiple quantiles and can be applied to a broad range of parametric and nonparametric settings. When combining information over a fixed number of quantiles, we derive an upper bound on the distance between the efficiency of the proposed estimator and the Fisher information. As the number of quantiles increases, this upper bound decreases and the asymptotic variance of the proposed estimator approaches the Cramer-Rao lower bound under appropriate conditions. In the case of nonregular statistical estimation, the proposed estimator leads to super-efficient estimation. We illustrate the proposed method for several widely used regression models. Both asymptotic theory and Monte Carlo experiments show the superior performance over existing methods.","[Zhao, Zhibiao] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Xiao, Zhijie] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Boston College,"Xiao, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",zhijie.xiao@bc.edu,,,NIDA [P50-DA10075-15],NIDA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)),"We thank Roger Koenker, Steve Portnoy, Victor Chernozhukov, two referees, and seminar attendants at University of Illinois for their very helpful comments.

However, there are various alternative treatment strategies, of which some have been compared using health economic decision models. Objective To assess the quality of health economic decision models comparing thrombosis inhibitors in patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, and to identify areas for quality improvement. Data Sources The literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment (HTA). Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods A review of the quality of health economic decision models was conducted by two independent reviewers, using the Philips checklist. Results Twenty-one relevant studies were identified. Differences were apparent regarding the model type (six decision trees, four Markov models, eight combinations, three undefined models), the model structure (types of events, Markov states) and the incorporation of data (efficacy, cost and utility data). Critical issues were the absence of particular events (e. g. thrombocytopenia, stroke) and questionable usage of utility values within some studies. Limitations As we restricted our search to health economic decision models comparing thrombosis inhibitors, interesting aspects related to the quality of studies of adjacent medical areas that compared stents or procedures could have been missed. Conclusions This review identified areas where recommendations are indicated regarding the quality of future ACS decision models. For example, all critical events and relevant treatment options should be included. Models also need to allow for changing event probabilities to correctly reflect ACS and to incorporate appropriate, age-specific utility values and decrements when conducting cost-utility analyses.","[Hatz, Maximilian H.

The price bounds are established by minimizing the difference between the benchmark price and the replicating portfolio cost subject to the gain loss ratio of excess payoff of the mortality-linked securities. In contrast to the previous studies, the assumptions of no-arbitrage pricing and utility-based pricing are not fully employed in this study because of the incompleteness of the insurance securitization market. Instead, a framework including three insurance basis assets is constructed to search for the price bounds of mortality-linked securities and use the Swiss Re mortality catastrophe bond, issued in 2003, as a numerical example. The proposed price bounds are valuable for setting bid asked spreads and coupon premiums, and establishing trading strategies in the raising mortality securitization markets.

As many models are available, it is imperative for interested readers to know about the steps in selecting and using the most suitable ones. The objective of this paper is to propose a tutorial for the application of appropriate survival modeling techniques to estimate transition probabilities, for use in model-based economic evaluations, in the absence of individual patient data (IPD). An illustration of the use of the tutorial is provided based on the final progression-free survival (PFS) analysis of the BOLERO-2 trial in metastatic breast cancer (mBC). An algorithm was adopted from Guyot and colleagues, and was then run in the statistical package R to reconstruct IPD, based on the final PFS analysis of the BOLERO-2 trial. It should be emphasized that the reconstructed IPD represent an approximation of the original data. Afterwards, we fitted parametric models to the reconstructed IPD in the statistical package Stata. Both statistical and graphical tests were conducted to verify the relative and absolute validity of the findings. Finally, the equations for transition probabilities were derived using the general equation for transition probabilities used in model-based economic evaluations, and the parameters were estimated from fitted distributions. The results of the application of the tutorial suggest that the log-logistic model best fits the reconstructed data from the latest published Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves of the BOLERO-2 trial. Results from the regression analyses were confirmed graphically. An equation for transition probabilities was obtained for each arm of the BOLERO-2 trial. In this paper, a tutorial was proposed and used to estimate the transition probabilities for model-based economic evaluation, based on the results of the final PFS analysis of the BOLERO-2 trial in mBC. The results of our study can serve as a basis for any model (Markov) that needs the parameterization of transition probabilities, and only has summary KM plots available.","[Diaby, Vakaramoko] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, PATH, Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8P 1H1, Canada; [Diaby, Vakaramoko] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Diaby, Vakaramoko; Adunlin, Georges] Florida A&M Univ, Coll Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Div Econ Social & Adm Pharm, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA; [Montero, Alberto J.] Cleveland Clin, Taussig Canc Inst, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",McMaster University; McMaster University; State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,"Diaby, V (通讯作者)，St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, PATH, Res Inst, 25 Main St W,Suite 2000, Hamilton, ON L8P 1H1, Canada.",diaby_v@yahoo.fr; george.adunlin@gmail.com; MONTERO2@ccf.org,"Adunlin, Georges/P-2406-2019; Diaby, Vakaramoko/AAH-4029-2020; Montero, Alberto/AAF-9565-2021","Montero, Alberto/0000-0002-8221-8120",,,,,16,82,90,1,24,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2014,32.0,2,,,,,101,108,,10.1007/s40273-013-0123-9,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AA3GR,24338265.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330981400001,0

Instead of solving an optimal stopping problem, we propose a more realistic approach accounting for policyholders' rationality in exercising their surrender option. The valuation is conducted at the portfolio level by assuming that the surrender rate of the representative agent is bounded from below and from above. The lower bound corresponds to purely exogenous surrender, and the difference between the upper bound and the lower bound represents the rationality of the policyholders. The valuation problem is formulated by a PDE approach and solved with the finite difference method. We show that the rationality of the policyholders has a significant effect on average contract value and hence on the fair contract design. We also present the separating boundary between purely exogenous surrender and endogenous surrender. This provides implications on the predicted surrender activity of the policyholders.","[Li, Jing] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-53111 Bonn, Germany; [Szimayer, Alexander] Univ Hamburg, Dept Business Adm, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Hamburg,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53111 Bonn, Germany.",lijing@uni-bonn.de,"Szimayer, Alexander/AAB-5350-2022",,Bonn Graduate School of Economics,Bonn Graduate School of Economics,"We thank Anna Rita Bacinello, An Chen, Christian Hilpert, Klaus Sandmann, Birgit Schnorrenberg, Filip Uzelac, two anonymous referees, participants of the 15th International Congress on Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, 2011 China International Conference on Insurance and Risk Management and the CEQURA Conference 2012 for helpful comments and discussions.

Specifically, we study expansions for exponential Levy models such as the Variance Gamma and the Normal Inverse Gaussian models as well as their stochastic volatility counterparts, e.g. the VGSV and NIGSV models.

It was one the most severe earthquakes in Japan in recent years. In this paper, we analyze the time series of the unbiased vertical acceleration in nm/s(2) of the earth ground collected by a seismograph located at the University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia. The time series is segmented into three parts, corresponding to the normal seismic activity, a transition phase, and the arrival of earthquake waves. A separate analysis is performed for each segment. Our main achievement is that, by looking at the degradation of the prediction capabilities of the model identified during the normal seismic activity segment, one can discern the transition phase from the normal seismic activity 200-300 seconds before the beginning of the earthquake phase in the collected data. Though this does not allow one to conclude that earthquakes can be forecasted due to the long distance between the epicenter and the data collection location, still we think that the achieved result may open up some further development in the study of earthquakes.","[Bittanti, Sergio; Garatti, Simone] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Bittanti, S (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, Piazza L da Vinici 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",sergio.bittanti@polimi.it; simone.garatti@polimi.it,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,827,835,,,,,,9,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600094,0

This model assumes that potential bidders have private values, observe signals of their values prior to entry, and then choose whether to undertake a costly entry process, but imposes only minimal structure on the relationship between signals and values. It thereby nests a wide range of entry processes, including in particular the Samuelson (1985) and Levin and Smith (1994) models as special cases. Working within the AS model, we map variation in factors affecting entry behavior (potential competition or entry costs) into identified bounds on model fundamentals. These bounds are constructive, collapse to point identification when available entry variation is continuous, and can readily be refined to produce the pointwise sharp identified set. We then extend our core results to accommodate nonseparable unobserved auction-level heterogeneity and potential endogeneity of entry shifters, thereby establishing a formal identification framework for structural analysis of auctions with selective entry.","[Gentry, Matthew] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Li, Tong] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Vanderbilt University,"Gentry, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.l.gentry@lse.ac.uk; tong.li@vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,45,45,61,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2014,82.0,1,,,,,315,344,,10.3982/ECTA10293,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA7KQ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331276700008,0

The surface deformation parameter has been essential in monitoring the eruptive process occurred on El Hierro island (October 10, 2011) and the activity's processes that have occurred subsequent to the underwater eruption. The importance of this process is that GNSS-GPS observations are available for months before the beginning of that process. The FRON station (GRAFCAN), located at Frontera municipality, is operative since late 2010 until now. In addition, since seismic activity began, the National Geographic Institute launched a densifying station network. The first GPS station, HI01, was placed outside the area of seismicity in the last week of July 2011. Meanwhile, two other stations were placed near and the maximum occurrence of seismicity in the region of El Golfo, HI02 and HI03. In the first week of September, another station was added in El Golfo, right on the western part of the seismogenic zone, HI04. During September the network increases with five permanent stations: HI00, HI05, HI08, HI09 and HI10. Finally, regular stations were added in El Julan (HI06 and HI07) and the volcano Tanganasoga (HI11). The location of these stations on the island is shown in Fig. 1. Besides, there are other public permanent stations in La Palma Island (LPAL-IGS, MAZO-GRAFCAN), in La Gomera Island (ALAJ-GRAFCAN), in Tenerife Island (IZAN-IGN, STEI-GRAFCAN) and Gran Canaria Island (MAS1-IGS, GMAS-IGS).

In particular, there is growing interest in options on the VIX volatility index. A number of recent empirical studies have examine whether there is significantly greater risk premium in VIX option prices compared with S&P 500 option prices. We address this issue by proposing and analysing a stochastic volatility model with regime switching. The basic Heston model cannot capture VIX-implied volatilities, as has been documented. We show that the incorporation of sharp regime shifts can bridge this shortcoming. We take advantage of asymptotic and Fourier methods to make the extension tractable, and we present a fit to data, both in times of crisis and relative calm, which shows the effectiveness of the regime switching.","[Papanicolaou, Andrew; Sircar, Ronnie] Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn ORFE, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Papanicolaou, A (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn ORFE, Sherrerd Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",apapanic.brown@gmail.com,,"Papanicolaou, Andrew/0000-0002-5543-1268","NSF [DMS-0739195, DMS-1211906]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [0739195, 1211906] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"The authors thank Lisa Goldberg for discussion on regime models, as well as Jim Gatheral and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Other operations have no major influence on extraction time. Data extraction from OpenTSDB to an external tool (e.g. pandas or R) is a viable option even for considerably sized datasets as long as analysis is not too demanding. In case datasets grow even further or many of them have to be simultaneously considered, and when analysis is more time consuming, then distributed processing could be beneficial despite higher effort required to develop necessary algorithms.

In particular, credit derivatives with a leverage component are subject to gap risk, a risk associated with the occurrence of jumps in the underlying credit default swap spreads. In the framework of first passage time models, we consider a model that addresses these issues. The principal idea is to model a credit quality process as an Ito integral with respect to a Brownian motion with a stochastic volatility. Using a representation of the credit quality process as a time-changed Brownian motion, one can derive formulas for conditional default probabilities and credit spreads. An example for a stochastic volatility process is the square root of a Levy-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The model can be implemented efficiently using a technique called Panjer recursion. Calibration to a wide range of dynamics is supported. We illustrate the effectiveness of the model by valuing a leveraged credit-linked note.","[Packham, Natalie; Schmidt, Wolfgang M.] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Ctr Pract Quantitat Finance, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schloegl, Lutz] Nomura Int Plc, Fixed Income Quantitat Res Grp, London, England",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Packham, N (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Ctr Pract Quantitat Finance, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",n.packham@frankfurt-school.de,,"Packham, Natalie/0000-0002-8065-747X",,,,,20,7,7,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

At the time of death, a benefit payment is due. It may depend not only on the price of a stock or stock fund at that time, but also on prior prices. The problem is to calculate the expected discounted value of the benefit payment. Because the distribution of the time of death can be approximated by a combination of exponential distributions, it suffices to solve the problem for an exponentially distributed time of death. The stock price process is assumed to be the exponential of a Brownian motion plus an independent compound Poisson process whose upward and downward jumps are modeled by combinations (or mixtures) of exponential distributions. Results for exponential stopping of a Levy process are used to derive a series of closed-form formulas for call, put, lookback, and barrier options, dynamic fund protection, and dynamic withdrawal benefit with guarantee. We also discuss how barrier options can be used to model lapses and surrenders. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Claim triangles are handled as panel data, where the claim amounts within the same accident year are dependent. Various correlation structures are introduced within the GEE framework.

Besides, we consider a more general market with multiple assets that can all be risky. By applying the Lagrange method and stochastic dynamic programming techniques, we derive the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which can be converted into six correlated but relatively simple partial differential equations (PDEs). The explicit solutions for these six PDEs are derived by using the homogenization approach and the variable transformation technique. Then the closed-form expressions for the optimal strategy and the efficient frontier can be obtained through the Lagrange dual theory.

In particular, we show that the Bridge estimator is oracle efficient. It can correctly distinguish between relevant and irrelevant variables and the asymptotic distribution of the estimators of the coefficients of the relevant variables is the same as if only these had been included in the model, i.e. as if an oracle had revealed the true model prior to estimation. In the case of more explanatory variables than observations we prove that the Marginal Bridge estimator can asymptotically correctly distinguish between relevant and irrelevant explanatory variables if the error terms are Gaussian. Furthermore, a partial orthogonality condition of the same type as in Huang et al.

As a result, it is important to understand structural and methodological approaches used in published decision-analytic models for examining the cost effectiveness of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) for prostate cancer (PCa) chemoprevention. This understanding allows us to provide recommendations for using decision modelling in future economic evaluations of chemoprevention for PCa. Methods A review of the published literature was performed using MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library to identify studies involving mathematical decision models that evaluated 5ARIs for PCa chemoprevention. Published articles were reviewed and key modelling components were extracted and summarized. Recommendations for developing future decision models to examine the economic consequences of PCa chemoprevention were presented. Results We identified seven published models of PCa chemoprevention. All the models identified used a Markov framework with time horizons ranging from 4 years to lifetime. Due to the wide range of patient risk groups examined, PCa risk data were taken from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and other databases or estimates published in relevant clinical trials. Treatment effects included change in the incidence of high- and low-grade PCa and impacts on benign prostate hyperplasia. Adverse events were considered to affect compliance, discontinuation and quality of life. Quality-of-life impacts were similar among studies. Examination of modelling parameter sensitivities was comprehensive. Conclusions Published models have examined the cost effectiveness of PCa chemoprevention; however, limitations exist. Decision models should take into account the full PCa clinical pathway when compiling health states. The time horizon should be long enough to consider the full benefit of chemoprevention while allowing actual time receiving the drug to occur from the start of the model until a man's life expectancy is less than 10 years. Baseline PCa risk should be specific to the population of concern. Models should examine the impact on both low- and high-grade tumours and account for the impact of 5ARIs on benign prostatic hyperplasia. Because chemoprevention has an upfront effect, the structure of the model should be constructed so that the downstream effect of avoiding or delaying recurrence can be considered. Adverse events due to chemoprevention should be considered through compliance, discontinuation or quality-of-life impact, and understanding the impact of avoiding PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia events are important model properties.","[Earnshaw, Stephanie R.; Brogan, Andrew P.; McDade, Cheryl L.] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",Research Triangle Institute,"Earnshaw, SR (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",searnshaw@rti.org,,"Earnshaw, Stephanie/0000-0003-2975-6509",,,,,47,3,3,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2013,31.0,4,,,,,289,304,,10.1007/s40273-013-0037-6,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,138TX,23519744.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318534000004,0

The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article summarizes the ERG's review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer and provides a summary of the Appraisal Committee's (AC) decision. The clinical evidence was derived from a multi-centred, open-label, randomized phase III study (PRIMA) comparing first-line maintenance treatment with RTX with observation only in 1,018 patients with previously untreated advanced fNHL. Median time to event (MTE) for the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) in the RTX arm was not estimable due to data immaturity; median PFS in the observation arm was 48.36 months. A statistically significant benefit of RTX maintenance therapy for PFS was reported (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95 % CI 0.44-0.68; p < 0.0001). Statistically significant differences in favour of RTX were also reported for a range of secondary endpoints. Assessment of overall survival benefit could be not made due to insufficient events. The ERG's main concern with the clinical-effectiveness data presented was their lack of maturity. The submitted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was within the NICE threshold.

The ERG considered it impossible to draw firm conclusions regarding the clinical or cost effectiveness of the intervention as the dataset was as yet too immature.

The objective of this paper was to review past and current developments related to the inclusion, identification, measurement and valuation of productivity costs in economic evaluations. The main debates in the theory and practice of economic evaluations of health technologies described in this review have centred on the questions of whether and how to include productivity costs, especially productivity costs related to paid work. The past few decades have seen important progress in this area. There are important sources of productivity costs other than absenteeism (e.g. presenteeism and multiplier effects in co-workers), but their exact influence on costs remains unclear. Different measurement instruments have been developed over the years, but which instrument provides the most accurate estimates has not been established. Several valuation approaches have been proposed. While empirical research suggests that productivity costs are best included in the cost side of the cost-effectiveness ratio, the jury is still out regarding whether the human capital approach or the friction cost approach is the most appropriate valuation method to do so. Despite the progress and the substantial amount of scientific research, a consensus has not been reached on either the inclusion of productivity costs in economic evaluations or the methods used to produce productivity cost estimates. Such a lack of consensus has likely contributed to ignoring productivity costs in actual economic evaluations and is reflected in variations in national health economic guidelines. Further research is needed to lessen the controversy regarding the estimation of health-related productivity costs. More standardization would increase the comparability and credibility of economic evaluations taking a societal perspective.","[Krol, Marieke; Brouwer, Werner; Rutten, Frans] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Krol, Marieke; Brouwer, Werner; Rutten, Frans] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Krol, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",krol@bmg.eur.nl,"Krol, Marieke/HGA-7950-2022; Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023","Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397; Krol, Marieke/0000-0002-6153-0828",AstraZeneca; GlaxoSmithKline; Janssen-Cilag; Pfizer BV; Merck,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Janssen-Cilag(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Pfizer BV; Merck(Merck & Company),"This study was part of a larger project investigating the broader societal benefits of healthcare, which was financially supported by AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen-Cilag Merck and Pfizer BV.

A better knowledge of the costs of depression may provide important information for future national preventive programmes, optimizing cost-effective budgeting. The estimates of national costs may improve the public's awareness of depression and depression-related costs, breaking down the taboo of depression as an illness. Objectives The aims of this study were to analyse the annual cost for different levels of depression and to investigate the annual economic burden of depression in Switzerland. Methods A retrospective, multicentre, non-interventional study in psychiatrist practices was carried out. Outpatients who had been diagnosed with depression in the last 3 years were included. Patient demographics and information on clinical characteristics and resource utilization in the first 12 months after diagnosis were collected. Costs analysis, subdivided into direct and indirect costs, was performed for three depression severity classes (mild, moderate and severe), according to the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17). Costs were also extrapolated to a national level. Regression analysis was performed to control for factors that may have an impact on the cost of depression. Results A total of 556 patients were included. Hospitalization and hospitalization days were directly correlated with disease severity (p < 0.001). Medical resource utilization linked to depression and antidepressant treatments was also correlated to the disease status. Severely depressed patients reported a significantly higher number of workdays lost and were significantly more often on disability insurance. The mean total direct costs per person per year, mainly due to hospitalization costs, were (sic)3,561 for mild, (sic)9,744 for moderate and (sic)16,240 for severe depression. The mean indirect costs per person per year, mainly due to workdays lost, were (sic)8,730 for mild, (sic)12,675 for moderate and (sic)16,669 for severe depression (year 2007/2008 values). Regression analysis showed that hospitalization days, psychiatrist visits in hospital, disability insurance, workdays lost and the HDRS-17 score were significantly correlated to the total costs. Extrapolation at a national level resulted in a total burden of about (sic)8.1-8.3 billion per year. Conclusions The burden of depression in Switzerland was estimated to be about (sic)8 billion per year. The costs of depression were directly related to disease severity. However, since many cases of depression remain unreported and since this analysis only included individuals between 18 and 65 years of age, it is reasonable to suppose that the total burden of depression may be even higher.","[Tomonaga, Yuki] Univ Zurich, Inst Social & Prevent Med, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland; [Haettenschwiler, Josef] Anxiety Disorders & Depress Treatment Ctr Zurich, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hatzinger, Martin] Psychiat Serv, Dept Adult Psychiat, CH-4503 Solothurn, Switzerland; [Holsboer-Trachsler, Edith] Univ Basel, Psychiat Univ Clin UPK, Depress Res Unit, CH-4012 Basel, Switzerland; [Rufer, Michael] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hepp, Urs] Psychiat Serv Aargau, CH-5401 Baden, Switzerland; [Szucs, Thomas D.] Univ Basel, European Ctr Pharmaceut Med, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Basel; University of Zurich; University Zurich Hospital; University of Basel,"Tomonaga, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Hirschengraben 84, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",yuki.tomonaga@uzh.ch,,"Rufer, Michael/0000-0003-4964-4213; Szucs, Thomas/0000-0003-0195-3316","Servier (Suisse) AG, Switzerland","Servier (Suisse) AG, Switzerland","The authors would like to thank the recruiting psychiatrists and all patients for their cooperation.

The residuals of the linear ARCH process are computed using historical data and the (inverse square root of the) covariance matrix. Simple measures of quality assessing the independence and unit magnitude of the residual distributions are proposed. The salient statistical properties of the computed residuals are studied for three data sets of size 54, 55 and 330. Both new terms introduced in the covariance help to produce uncorrelated residuals, but the mean residual magnitudes are much larger than one. The large magnitudes of the residuals are due to the exponential decay of the covariance eigenvalues, corresponding to directions with very small fluctuations in the historical sample. Because the postulated properties of the innovations cannot be obtained regardless of the parameter values, subsequent inferences reach a fundamental limitation in a large multivariate universe.","Swissquote Bank, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland",,"Zumbach, G (通讯作者)，Swissquote Bank, Ch Cretaux 33,Case Postale 319, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland.",gilles.zumbach@swissquote.ch,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The class of generalized empirical likelihood estimators (see Smith, 1997, The Economic Journal 107, 503-519) assigns a set of implied probabilities to each observation such that moment conditions are satisfied. The proposed test statistics for structural change are based on the information content in these implied probabilities. We consider cases of structural change with unknown breakpoint that can occur in the parameters of interest or in the overidentifying restrictions used to estimate these parameters. We also propose a structural change test based on implied probabilities that is robust to weak identification or cases in which parameters are completely unidentified. The test statistics considered here have competitive size and power properties. Moreover, they are computed in a single step, which eliminates the need to compute the weighting matrix required for generalized method of moments estimation.","[Guay, Alain] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lamarche, Jean-Francois] Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Brock University,"Guay, A (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",guay.alain@uqam.ca,,,Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la societe et la culture (FQRSC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la societe et la culture (FQRSC)(FQRNT); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"A previous version, October 2008, of this paper was originally circulated under the title The Information Content of Implied Probabilities to Detect Structural Change.

In order to deal efficiently with the closing-based returns bias induced by market microstructure noise, as well as to handle their uncertain variability, we combine fuzzy set theory and probability theory. The returns are first represented as fuzzy random variables and then used in defining fuzzy versions of some adjusted performance measures. Using a recent ordering method for fuzzy numbers, we propose a ranking of funds based on these fuzzy performance measures. Finally, empirical studies carried out on fifty French hedge funds confirm the effectiveness and give the benefits of our approach over the classical performance ratios. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, all agents hand their individual losses over to a pool and each of them is liable for the conditional expectation of his own loss given the total loss of the pool. We call this risk sharing mechanism the conditional mean risk sharing. If all the conditional expectations involved are non-decreasing functions of the total loss then the conditional mean risk sharing is shown to be Pareto-optimal. Explicit expressions for the individual contributions to the pool are derived in some special cases of interest: independent and identically distributed losses, comonotonic losses, and mutually exclusive losses. In particular, conditions under which this payment rule leads to a comonotonic risk sharing are examined. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We derive numerical theory results characterizing the properties of the nested fixed point algorithm used to evaluate the objective function of BLP's estimator. We discuss problems with typical implementations, including cases that can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. As a solution, we recast estimation as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, which can be faster and which avoids the numerical issues associated with nested inner loops. The advantages are even more pronounced for forward-looking demand models where the Bellman equation must also be solved repeatedly. Several Monte Carlo and real-data experiments support our numerical concerns about the nested fixed point approach and the advantages of constrained optimization. For static BLP, the constrained optimization approach can be as much as ten to forty times faster for large-dimensional problems with many markets.","[Dube, Jean-Pierre; Su, Che-Lin] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Dube, Jean-Pierre; Fox, Jeremy T.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fox, Jeremy T.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Dubé, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jdube@chicagobooth.edu; jtfox@umich.edu; Che-Lin.Su@chicagobooth.edu,,,"Kilts Center for Marketing; Neubauer Faculty Fund; NSF [0721036, SES-0631622]; Olin Foundation; Stigler Center; IBM Corporation Faculty Research Fund at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0721036] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Kilts Center for Marketing; Neubauer Faculty Fund; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Olin Foundation; Stigler Center; IBM Corporation Faculty Research Fund at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business(International Business Machines (IBM)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Daniel Ackerberg, Steven Berry, John Birge, Amit Gandhi, Philip Haile, Lars Hansen, Panle Jia, Kyoo il Kim, Samuel Kortum, Kenneth Judd, Sven Leyffer, Denis Nekipelov, Aviv Nevo, Jorge Nocedal, Ariel Pakes, John Rust, Hugo Salgado, Azeem Shaikh, and Richard Waltz for helpful discussions and comments.

This paper focuses on a single-index model for the conditional quantile. We propose an adaptive estimation procedure and an iterative algorithm which, under mild regularity conditions, is proved to converge with probability I. The resulted estimator of the single-index parametric vector is root-n consistent, asymptotically normal, and based on simulation study, is more efficient than the average derivative method in Chaudhuri, Doksum, and Samarov (1997, Annals of Statistics 19,760-777). The estimator of the link function converges at the usual rate for nonparametric estimation of a univariate function. As an empirical study, we apply the single-index quantile regression model to Boston housing data. By considering different levels of quantile, we explore how the covariates, of either social or environmental nature, could have different effects on individuals targeting the low, the median, and the high end of the housing market.","[Xia, Yingcun] Nanjing Univ, Dept Finance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xia, Yingcun] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Kong, Efang] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England",Nanjing University; National University of Singapore; University of Kent,"Xia, YC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Dept Finance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",staxyc@nus.edu.sg,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [11071113]; RMI, National University of Singapore","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); RMI, National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore)","Xia's research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11071113) and a research grant from RMI, National University of Singapore.

Classical market clearing is enhanced for structured products where the market allows these products to be freely bought at ask prices or sold for bid prices. Competitive pressures lead the market to lower the ask prices and raise the bid prices with the market offering individual investors the widest possible set of acceptable risks provided the aggregate counter cash flow held by the market is consistent with a more conservative prespecified set of acceptable risks. We learn that in equilibrium heterogeneous investors inherit a common hedging objective of maximizing the bid prices of the final structured product sold to market or equivalently minimizing the ask price of what is bought.,"[Madan, Dilip B.] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, Van Munching Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Schoutens, Wim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; KU Leuven,"Madan, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, Van Munching Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dbm@rhsmith.umd.edu; wim@schoutens.be,,,,,,,46,19,20,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

The assumption was that increased childhood survival in vaccinated cohorts leads to increased numbers of children consuming government resource, and an increased number of future tax payers. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the difference in lifetime discounted net tax revenue generated by RV vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts from the Egyptian government perspective. Methods: The model framework adopts the Egyptian government perspective for RV immunization costs (year 2009 values) and all government transfers (e.g. education costs, health costs, pensions). To reflect the government tax revenue, we applied a fixed income tax burden to earnings over the lifetime of vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. At each year of the model, we derive net taxes (gross taxes less transfers) discounted to the immunization year to reflect the present value of RV vaccination investment costs. Results: Projected incremental net present values of the vaccinated cohort versus the unvaccinated cohort are $US6.1 million, $US58.1 million and $US55.7 million at 25-, 50- and 72-year time horizons, respectively. The internal rate of return for the government based on RV vaccination at years 25,50 and 72 was 10.8%, 15.1% and 14.9, respectively. Within the first 5 years of vaccination, 76% of vaccine acquisition costs were offset due to direct and indirect cost savings attributed to a reduction in RV-related disease burden. Investments in RV vaccination in a single year are entirely offset when the vaccinated cohort of newborns reach 22 years of age. Conclusion: The government perspective is useful for evaluating investments in RV vaccination because of ongoing government transfers and tax receipts attributed to changes in RV-attributed morbidity and mortality. The analysis described here illustrates that investing in RV offers tangible long-term fiscal benefits for government over many generations that would not ordinarily be captured in economic evaluations typically applied to healthcare interventions.","[Connolly, Mark P.] Global Market Access Solut, CH-1162 St Prex, Switzerland; [Connolly, Mark P.; Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Groningen, Netherlands; [Topachevskyi, Oleksandr; Standaert, Baudouin] GlaxoSmithKline Biol, Wavre, Belgium; [Ortega, Omayra] Arizona State Univ, Dept Math & Nat Sci, Phoenix, AZ USA",University of Groningen; GlaxoSmithKline; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Connolly, MP (通讯作者)，Global Market Access Solut, Ch Penguey 6B, CH-1162 St Prex, Switzerland.",mark@gmasoln.com,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; Topachevskyi, Oleksandr/0000-0003-4723-9521",GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK Bio); Sanofi Pasteur MSD,GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK Bio)(GlaxoSmithKline); Sanofi Pasteur MSD,"GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK Bio) supported this study by providing funding to Mark Connolly.

Neither alone can provide 100% protection. Consequently it raises the important question about the most efficient combination of screening at specified time intervals and vaccination to prevent cervical cancer. Objective: Our objective was to identify the mix of cervical cancer prevention strategies (screening and/or vaccination against HPV) that achieves maximum reduction in cancer cases within a fixed budget. Methods: We assessed the optimal mix of strategies for the prevention of cervical cancer using an optimization program. The evaluation used two models. One was a Markov cohort model used as the evaluation model to estimate the costs and outcomes of 52 different prevention strategies. The other was an optimization model in which the results of each prevention strategy of the previous model were entered as input data. The latter model determined the combination of the different prevention options to minimize cervical cancer under budget, screening coverage and vaccination coverage constraints. We applied the model in two countries with different healthcare organizations, epidemiology, screening practices, resource settings and treatment costs: the UK and Brazil. 100 000 women aged 12 years and above across the whole population over a 1-year period at steady state were included. The intervention was papanicolaou (Pap) smear screening programmes and/or vaccination against HPV with the bivalent HPV 16/18 vaccine (Cervarix(R) [Cervarix is a registered trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies]). The main outcome measures were optimal distribution of the population between different interventions (screening, vaccination, screening plus vaccination and no screening or vaccination) with the resulting number of cervical cancer and associated costs. Results: In the base-case analysis (= same budget as today), the optimal prevention strategy would be, after introducing vaccination with a coverage rate of 80% in girls aged 12 years and retaining screening coverage at pre-vaccination levels (65% in the UK, 50% in Brazil), to increase the screening interval to 6 years (from 3) in the UK and to 5 years (from 3) in Brazil. This would result in a reduction of cervical cancer by 41% in the UK and by 54% in Brazil from pre-vaccination levels with no budget increase. Sensitivity analysis shows that vaccination alone at 80% coverage with no screening would achieve a cervical cancer reduction rate of 20% in the UK and 43% in Brazil compared with the pre-vaccination situation with a budget reduction of 30% and 14%, respectively. In both countries, the sharp reduction in cervical cancer is seen when the vaccine coverage rate exceeds the maximum screening coverage rate, or when screening coverage rate exceeds the maximum vaccine coverage rate, while maintaining the budget. As with any model, there are limitations to the value of predictions depending upon the assumptions made in each model. Conclusions: Spending the same budget that was used for screening and treatment of cervical cancer in the pre-vaccination era, results of the optimization program show that it would be possible to substantially reduce the number of cases by implementing an optimal combination of HPV vaccination (80% coverage) and screening at pre-vaccination coverage (65% UK, 50% Brazil) while extending the screening interval to every 6 years in the UK and 5 years in Brazil.","[Demarteau, Nadia; Standaert, Baudouin] GlaxoSmithKline Biol, Hlth Econ, Global Vaccine Dev, B-1300 Wavre, Belgium",GlaxoSmithKline,"Demarteau, N (通讯作者)，GlaxoSmithKline Biol, Hlth Econ, Global Vaccine Dev, Ave Fleming 20, B-1300 Wavre, Belgium.",nadia.x.demarteau@gskbio.com,,,"GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Belgium","GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Belgium(GlaxoSmithKline)","This study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Belgium.",,47,29,31,1,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,4,,,,,337,353,,10.2165/11591560-000000000-00000,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,921PX,22409292.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302490700005,0

Methods: A Markov model was used to assess the costs and benefits of Sativex (R) plus oral anti-spasticity medicines or current standard treatment based on their effects on the quality of life of patients. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of costs per additional QALY gained over 5 years of treatment. One-way, multi-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties on the findings. Results: In the base case, Sativex (R) plus oral anti-spasticity medicines resulted in incremental costs of 7600 pound and a QALY gain of 0.15 per person over 5 years (ICER = 49 pound 300 per QALY) [year 2009 data for costs]. Findings were sensitive to the costs of Sativex (R) (price and dose) and differences in utilities between responders and non-responders. Conclusions: Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30 pound 000 per QALY, Sativex (R) appears unlikely to be considered cost effective by UK funders of healthcare for spasticity in MS. This is unfortunate, since it appears that Sativex (R) use is likely to benefit some patients in the management of this common consequence of MS.","[Lu, Lanting; Stein, Ken] Univ Exeter, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Peninsula Technol Assessment Grp PenTAG, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Lu, Lanting; Lang, Iain A.; Stein, Ken] Univ Exeter, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Peninsula Collaborat Leadership Appl Hlth Res & C, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Pearce, Hilary; Roome, Chris; Lang, Iain A.] NHS Devon, Publ Hlth Directorate, Exeter, Devon, England; [Shearer, James] Univ Exeter, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Hlth Econ Grp, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth; University of Exeter; University of Plymouth; University of Exeter,"Lu, LT (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Peninsula Technol Assessment Grp PenTAG, Veysey Bldg,Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England.",lulanting@gmail.com,"Shearer, James/B-4933-2013; Lang, Iain A/B-8255-2008","Shearer, James/0000-0002-1658-9767; Lang, Iain/0000-0002-8473-2350",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) through the Peninsula Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (PenCLAHRC),National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) through the Peninsula Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (PenCLAHRC),"This work was partially funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) through the Peninsula Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (PenCLAHRC), which is based at the University of Exeter.",,22,14,14,0,24,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,12,,,,,1157,1171,,10.2165/11598470-000000000-00000,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,050GO,23072659.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312041400005,0

The holder of the variable annuity contract pays an initial purchase payment to the insurance company, which is then invested in a portfolio of risky assets. Under the GMWB, the holder can withdraw a specified amount periodically over the term of the contract such that the return of the entire initial investment is guaranteed, regardless of the market performance of the underlying asset portfolio. The investors have the equity participation in the reference investment portfolio with protection on the downside risk. The guarantee is financed by paying annual proportional fees. Under the assumption of deterministic withdrawal rates, we develop the pricing formulation of the value function of a variable annuity with the GMWB. In particular, we derive the analytic approximation solutions to the fair value of the GMWB under both equity and interest rate risks, obtaining both the lower and upper bounds on the price functions. The pricing behavior of the embedded GMWB under various model parameter values is also examined.","[Kwok, Yue Kuen] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Peng, Jingjiang] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Leung, Kwai Sun] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Kwok, YK (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",maykwok@ust.hk,,"Kwok, Yue Kuen/0000-0002-3474-445X",,,,,11,36,40,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The asymptotic theory is developed for the estimators under a specific Pitman drift, assuming the break magnitude is within a T-1/2 neighbourhood of zero. Compared to the existing asymptotics assuming a fixed break magnitude or a shrinking one converging at a slower rate than T1/2, the limiting distributions here closely resemble the finite sample distributions of the break point estimators, especially the tail behaviours. Though with a lower convergence rate, the break point estimator from level model concentrates more around the true break point when the break magnitude is small relative to the noise magnitude. With the new limiting distributions, thresholds are provided for empirical researchers to choose the break point estimator based on a mean squared error criterion.","Coll Wooster, Dept Econ, Wooster, OH 44691 USA",University System of Ohio; College of Wooster,"Yang, JJ (通讯作者)，Coll Wooster, Dept Econ, Burton D Morgan Hall, Wooster, OH 44691 USA.",yangjin3@msu.edu,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Instead of using the static square root of time method, we use a dynamic approach based on volatility forecasting by non-linear models. We explore the possibility of improving the estimations using different models and distributions. By comparing the estimations of two risk measures, value at risk and expected shortfall, with different models and innovations at short-, median- and long-term horizon, we find that the best model varies with the forecasting horizon and that the generalized Pareto distribution gives the most conservative estimations with all the models at all the horizons. The empirical results show that the square root method underestimates risk at long horizons and our approach is more competitive for risk estimation over a long term.","[Guegan, Dominique; Zhao, Xin] Univ Paris 01, CES, UMR8174, F-75013 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Guégan, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, UMR8174, 106 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",dguegan@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Determining the cost effectiveness of pharmacist interventions has been complicated by methodological challenges. A critique of 31 economic evaluations carried out alongside comparative studies of pharmacist interventions published between 2003 and 2013 (12 from the UK, six from the USA) found a range of disease-specific and cross-therapeutic interventions targeting both patients and prescribers in a range of settings evaluated through a variety of study designs. Only ten were full economic evaluations, five of which were based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The intervention was usually quite well described, but the comparator was not always clearly described, and some interventions are very context specific due to the variability in pharmacist services available in different countries and practice settings. Complex multidirectional aims of most pharmacist interventions have led to many process, intermediate and longer-term outcomes being included in any one study. Quality of resource use and cost data varied. Most incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were generated from process indicators such as errors and adherence, with only four studies reporting cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Very few studies examined the effect of uncertainty, and methods used were not very clear in some cases. The principal finding from our critique is that poor RCT study design or analysis precludes many studies from finding pharmacist interventions effective or cost effective. We conclude with a set of recommendations for future study design.","[Elliott, Rachel A.] Univ Nottingham, Div Social Res Med & Hlth, Sch Pharm, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Putman, Koen] Vrije Univ Brussel, Interuniv Ctr Hlth Econ Res, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium; [Davies, James] UCL Sch Pharm, London WC1N 1AX, England; [Annemans, Lieven] Univ Ghent, VUB, Brussels, Belgium; [Annemans, Lieven] Ghent Univ Hosp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",University of Nottingham; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; University of London; University College London; Ghent University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Ghent University; Ghent University Hospital,"Elliott, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Div Social Res Med & Hlth, Sch Pharm, Univ Pk,East Dr, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",rachel.elliott@nottingham.ac.uk; kputman@vub.ac.be; james.davies11@ucl.ac.uk; lieven.annemans@ugent.be,"Putman, Koen/ABG-6361-2021; Elliott, Rachel/P-5894-2018","Elliott, Rachel/0000-0002-3650-0168; Putman, Koen/0000-0002-7235-3759",,,,,81,22,23,0,39,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2014,32.0,12,,,,,1185,1199,,10.1007/s40273-014-0197-z,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AU1YB,25145799.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345412300005,0

Our contribution is developed upon the generalized linear models introduced by Renshaw et al., (1996) and Sithole et al., (2000), in which mortality forecasts are generated within the model structure, without the need of additional stochastic processes. To ensure that the resulting forecasts are coherent, a modified time-transformation is developed to stipulate the expected mortality differential between two populations to remain constant when the long-run equilibrium is attained. The model is then further extended to incorporate a structural change, an important property that is observed in the historical mortality data of many national populations. The proposed modeling methods are illustrated with data from two different pairs of populations: (1) Swedish and Danish males; (2) English and Welsh males and U.K. male insured lives.

The ideas of autonomy, freedom, and liberty derive their intuitive appealat least partlyfrom an assumed positive intrinsic value of decision rights. Providing clean evidence for the existence of this intrinsic value and measuring its size, however, is intricate. Here, we develop a method capable of achieving these goals. The data reveal that the large majority of our subjects intrinsically value decision rights beyond their instrumental benefit. The intrinsic valuation of decision rights has potentially important consequences for corporate governance, human resource management, and optimal job design: it may explain why managers value power, why employees appreciate jobs with task discretion, why individuals sort into self-employment, and why the reallocation of decision rights is often very difficult and cumbersome. Our method and results may also prove useful in developing an empirical revealed preference foundation for concepts such as freedom of choice and individual autonomy.","[Bartling, Bjoern; Fehr, Ernst; Herz, Holger] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Bartling, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",bjoern.bartling@econ.uzh.ch; ernst.fehr@econ.uzh.ch; holger.herz@econ.uzh.ch,,"Herz, Holger/0000-0003-3495-1640; Bartling, Bjorn/0000-0002-9496-266X",,,,,57,103,116,4,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,NOV,2014,82.0,6,,,,,2005,2039,,10.3982/ECTA11573,0.0,,,35,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AX2IU,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346767700003,0

However, the possibility that disease-modifying agents (DMAs) may emerge requires an update of existing modeling frameworks. The aim of this study was to develop a simulation allowing for economic evaluation of DMAs in AD. The model was developed based on a previously published, well-validated, discrete event simulation which measures disease severity on the basis of cognition, behaviour, and function, and captures the interrelated changes in these measures for individuals. The updated model adds one more domain, patient dependence, in addition to cognition, behaviour, and function to better characterize disease severity. Furthermore, the model was modified to have greater flexibility in assessing the impact of various important assumptions, such as the long-term effectiveness of DMAs and their impact on survival, on model outcomes. A validation analysis was performed to examine how well the model predicted change in disease severity among patients not receiving DMA treatment by comparing model results to those observed in two recent phase III clinical trials of bapineuzumab. In addition, various hypothetical scenarios were tested to demonstrate the improved features of the model. Validation results show that the model closely predicts the mean changes in disease severity over 18 months. Results from different hypothetical scenarios show that the model allows for credible assessment of those major uncertainties surrounding the long-term effectiveness of DMAs, including the potential impact of improved survival with DMA treatment. They also indicate that varying these assumptions could have a major impact on the value of DMAs. The updated economic model has good predictive power, but validation against longer-term outcomes is still needed. Our analyses also demonstrate the importance of designing a model with sufficient flexibility such that the model allows for assessment of the impact of key sources of uncertainty on the value of DMAs.","[Guo, Shien; Getsios, Denis; Xu, Peng] Evidera, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Revankar, Nikhil] Evidera, London, England; [Thompson, Gwilym] Janssen Cilag Ltd, High Wycombe, Bucks, England; [Bobula, Joel] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA; [Lacey, Loretto] Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy, Dublin, Ireland; [Gaudig, Maren] Alzheimer Immunotherapy, Dublin, Ireland",Evidera; Evidera; Johnson & Johnson; Pfizer,"Guo, SE (通讯作者)，Evidera, 430 Bedford St,Suite 300,Lexington Off Pk, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",shien.guo@evidera.com,,,"Pfizer Inc.; Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC","Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer); Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC","This study was sponsored by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC.",,33,19,19,0,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2014,32.0,11,,,,,1129,1139,,10.1007/s40273-014-0203-5,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0LJ,25124747.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344627300010,0

NICE's cost-effectiveness threshold may increase from A 20,000 pound to A 50,000 pound per QALY on the basis of these and four other considerations: the certainty of the ICER [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio]; whether health-related quality of life is inadequately captured; the innovative nature of the technology; and non-health objectives of the NHS. We demonstrate that NICE's previous amendments are flawed; they contain logical inconsistencies which can result in different values being placed on health gains for identical patients, and they do not apply value weights to patients bearing the opportunity cost of NICE's recommendations. The proposals retain both flaws and are also poorly justified. Applying value weights to patients bearing the opportunity cost would lower NICE's threshold, in some cases to below A 20,000 pound per QALY. Furthermore, this baseline threshold is higher than current estimates of the opportunity cost. NICE's proposed threshold range is too high, for empirical and methodological reasons. NICE's proposals will harm the health of unidentifiable patients, whilst privileging the identifiable beneficiaries of new health technologies.","[Paulden, Mike; McCabe, Christopher] Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, Edmonton, AB T6G 2T4, Canada; [O'Mahony, James F.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin, Ireland; [Culyer, Anthony J.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Heslington, Yorks, England; [Culyer, Anthony J.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Alberta; Trinity College Dublin; University of York - UK; University of Toronto,"Paulden, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, 736 Univ Terrace,8303 112 St, Edmonton, AB T6G 2T4, Canada.",paulden@ualberta.ca,"Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016; McCabe, Christopher J/E-2051-2016","Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980; O'Mahony, James/0000-0003-3414-7388",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Genome Canada; Ireland's Health Research Board; Capital Health Research Chair Endowment,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Ireland's Health Research Board; Capital Health Research Chair Endowment,"The authors wish to thank Richard Edlin for providing insightful comments during discussions prior to the preparation of this manuscript.

For instance, there is considerable evidence of asymmetric fluctuations in many macroeconomic and financial variables, and certain game theoretic models of price determination predict asymmetric cycles in price series. In this paper, we make two primary contributions to the econometric literature on time reversibility. First, we propose a new test of time reversibility, applicable to stationary Markov chains. Compared to existing tests, our test has the advantage of being consistent against arbitrary violations of reversibility. Second, we explain how a circulation density function may be used to characterize the nature of time irreversibility when it is present. We propose a copula-based estimator of the circulation density and verify that it is well behaved asymptotically under suitable regularity conditions. We illustrate the use of our time reversibility test and circulation density estimator by applying them to five years of Canadian gasoline price markup data.","[Beare, Brendan K.; Seo, Juwon] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Beare, BK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr 0508, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",bbeare@ucsd.edu,"Beare, Brendan/GYJ-4599-2022; Seo, Juwon/AAK-6943-2021","Beare, Brendan/0000-0001-9146-131X;",,,,,62,14,16,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of adding TCZ to the current treatment sequence of RA patients from a UK payer's perspective over a patient lifetime horizon. An individual sampling model was developed to synthesise all clinical and economic inputs. Two scenarios were explored separately: patients contraindicated to methotrexate (MTX) and those MTX tolerant. For each scenario, the analysis compared three strategies. The standard of care (SoC) strategy included a sequence of the most commonly prescribed biologics; the other two comparator strategies considered the addition of TCZ to SoC at first line and second line. Patient characteristics were representative of UK patients. Treatment efficacy and quality-of-life evidence were synthesised from clinical trials and secondary sources. An analysis of a patient registry informed the model parameters regarding treatment discontinuation. The safety profile of all treatments in a given strategy was based on a network meta-analysis and literature review. Resource utilisation, treatment acquisition, administration, monitoring and adverse event treatment costs were considered. All costs reflect 2012 prices. Uncertainty in model parameters was explored by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In the MTX-contraindicated population, if TCZ was added to the SoC in first line, the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was A 7,300 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained; if added in second line, the estimated ICER was A 11,400 pound per QALY. In the MTX-tolerant population, the estimated costs and QALYs of the TCZ strategy were similar to those of the SoC strategy. Sensitivity analysis showed that parameters that affect the treatment cost (such as patient weight) can have a noticeable impact on the overall cost-effectiveness results. The majority of the other sensitivity analyses resulted in modest changes to the ICER. For the treatment of RA in MTX-tolerant and contraindicated patients, the addition of TCZ to the SoC was estimated to be a cost-effective strategy.","[Diamantopoulos, Alex; Sungher, D.

For completeness, we also introduce the call on the log-asset price (or CLA) and explore their properties and applications. The decomposition of the GPO into its constituent parts is achieved with the help of the Method of Images to convert certain barrier option payoffs into equivalent European payoffs. This technique considerably simplifies the calculation and adds significant transparency to what is otherwise regarded as very complex problem.

Then, we formulate a quantitative definition of instability contagion in terms thereof. Finally, we analyse the mechanism of instability contagion for both single and multiple economies.

A large part of the problem is that the fundamental value of an asset is, in general, not directly observable and it is poorly constrained to calculate. Further, it is not possible to distinguish between an exponentially growing fundamental price and an exponentially growing bubble price. In this paper, we present a series of new models based on the Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model, which is a flexible tool to detect bubbles and predict changes of regime in financial markets. Our new models identify the fundamental value of an asset price and a crash nonlinearity from a bubble calibration. In addition to forecasting the time of the end of a bubble, the new models can also estimate the fundamental value and the crash nonlinearity, meaning that identifying the presence of a bubble is enabled by these models. In addition, the crash nonlinearity obtained in the new models presents a new approach to possibly identify the dynamics of a crash after a bubble. We test the models using data from three historical bubbles ending in crashes from different markets. They are the Hong Kong Hang Seng index 1997 crash, the S&P 500 index 1987 crash (Black Monday) and the Shanghai Composite index 2009 crash. All results suggest that the new models perform very well in describing bubbles, forecasting their ending times and estimating fundamental value and the crash nonlinearity. The performance of the new models is tested under both the Gaussian residual assumption and non-Gaussian residual assumption. Under the Gaussian residual assumption, nested hypotheses with the Wilks' statistics are used and the p-values suggest that models with more parameters are necessary. Under the non-Gaussian residual assumption, we use a bootstrap method to obtain type I and II errors of the hypotheses. All tests confirm that the generalized JLS models provide useful improvements over the standard JLS model.","[Yan, Wanfeng; Woodard, Ryan; Sornette, Didier] ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Geneva,"Yan, WF (通讯作者)，ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Kreuzpl 5, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",wyan@ethz.ch,,,,,,,27,6,6,0,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This paper provides order and rank conditions for limited information identification of parameters in dynamic models with measurement errors where some aspects of the probability model are not fully specified or utilized. The key is to consider a model for the contaminated data that has richer dynamics than the model for the correctly observed data. Simply counting the total number of unknown parameters in the true model relative to the estimable model will not yield an informative order condition for identification.

To date, it appears that no article has reviewed and critically appraised the cost-effectiveness models developed to evaluate new oral treatments [glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors] for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to provide insight into the utilization of cost-effectiveness modelling methods. The focus of our study was aimed at the applicability of these models, particularly around the major assumptions related to the clinical parameters (glycated haemoglobin [A(1c)], systolic blood pressure [SBP], lipids and weight) used in the models, and subsequent clinical outcomes. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1 January 2004 to 14 February 2013 in order to identify published cost-effectiveness evaluations for the treatment of T2DM by new oral treatments (GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors). Once identified, the articles were reviewed and grouped together according to the type of model. The following data were captured for each study: comparators; country; evaluation and key cost drivers; time horizon; perspective; discounting rates; currency/year; cost-effectiveness threshold, sensitivity analysis; and cost-effectiveness analysis curves. A total of 15 studies were identified in our review. Nearly all of the models utilized a health care payer perspective and provided a lifetime horizon. The CORE Diabetes Model, UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model, Cardiff Diabetes Model, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Diabetes Cost-Effectiveness Group Model and Diabetes Mellitus Model were cited. With the exception of two studies, all of the studies made significant assumptions surrounding the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors on clinical parameters and subsequent short- and long-term outcomes. Moreover, often the differences in the clinical parameters were relatively small (e.g. 1 or 2 mmHg in blood pressure) and would not be considered by many as clinically important. Yet, the impact of these small clinical changes often resulted in large lifetime changes in health outcomes in the models. In particular, many studies assumed that changes in weight associated with the therapies would equate to improved outcomes, despite limited evidence for this assumption. Although the new oral treatments were regarded as cost effective in most studies based upon the studies reviewed, the validity of these projections, particularly for the longer time frames, is questionable. Indeed, although most of these studies have been conducted in the last 5 years, recent trial evidence has already questioned the validity of most of these studies. It is clear that a number of changes are required in the evaluation of diabetes therapies. First and foremost, the basic models need to be updated to include contemporary important clinical trial data assessing hard clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes. Second, there should be less emphasis on 40-year or lifetime costs and consequences of the therapies and a greater focus on short-term (5-year) and intermediate-term (10-year) outcomes. Practice is continually evolving, and the probability that these models would provide any valid predictions beyond 10 years is remote. Third, all modellers should immediately remove the basic assumption that small clinically inconsequential changes in A(1c), SBP, lipids and weight result in major clinical improvements in patients. Future models should aim to include all relevant treatment outcomes, whether these relate to effects on underlying diabetes and its complications or to short- or long-term side effects of treatment. We need to explore why cost-saving interventions could benefit further from adding patient characteristics, which may be able to better predict the use of lower-cost alternatives. Moreover, the vast array of different clinical, cost and utility data used in the different models reviewed makes it apparent that a uniform methodology should be developed for diabetes economic models. In this manner, future models could be run using the same data, which would allow for more acceptable comparability between studies.","[Asche, Carl V.] Univ Illinois, Coll Med Peoria, Ctr Outcomes Res, Peoria, IL 61656 USA; [Hippler, Stephen E.] OSF Healthcare, Peoria, IL 61615 USA; [Eurich, Dean T.] Univ Alberta, Li Ka Shing Ctr Hlth Res Innovat 2 040, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Peoria; University of Alberta,"Asche, CV (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Med Peoria, Ctr Outcomes Res, One Illini Dr, Peoria, IL 61656 USA.",cva@uic.edu,,"Asche, Carl V/0000-0002-3193-6800",,,,,28,24,24,0,30,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2014,32.0,1,,,,,15,27,,10.1007/s40273-013-0117-7,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,293KA,24357160.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329968700003,0

Both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages and both are widely used in a number of monitoring programs. Since the outputs of the active samplers provide information on POPs concentration directly, there is an urgent need to recalculate the results of passive samplers, which is necessary for a comparison of the measurements, basement levels of pollution and propose environmental measures. Although there is an increasing number of calibration studies, no unique method was generally accepted yet. Several recalculation approaches derived both from empirical calibration studies and theoretical physical nature of the sampling process were used to obtain fully comparable data. The paper deals with 10-years-long time series of a concurrent passive and active POPs monitoring conducted at the Kosetice observatory (Czech Republic). Adapted causality testing of explained variation proportion between the active and passive sampling measurements is presented within the paper. This method is demonstrated on five sets of recalculated series with unified periods to estimate effects of the recalculation methods to resulting time series. As a result, there is a proposal how to select the most suitable approach for the recalculation.","[Kalina, Jiri] Inst Biostat & Anal, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; Res Ctr Tox Cpds Environm, Brno 62500, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Institute of Biostatistics & Analyses; Masaryk University Brno,"Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Inst Biostat & Anal, Kamenice 126-3, Brno 62500, Czech Republic.",kalina@mail.muni.cz; boruvkova@recetox.muni.cz,"Kalina, Jiří/F-3221-2016","Kalina, Jiří/0000-0002-4103-6937",,,,,0,0,0,1,8,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,772,780,,,,,,9,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600086,0

To quantify scaling of turbulence we have proposed a generalized two-scale weighted Cantor set model with two different rescaling parameters. By using wealth of data provided by various space missions we have applied this model to intermittent multifractal turbulence in the solar wind magnetized plasma in the inner and the outer heliosphere at the ecliptic and at high heliospheric latitudes and even in the heliosheath, beyond the heliospheric termination shock. It appears that the degree of multifractality falls steadily with the distance from the Sun and is modulated by the solar activity. Here we extend our analysis further in the heliosheath ahead of the heliopause using recent Voyager 1 magnetic field data. We hope that our generalized multifractal model will be a useful tool for analysis of intermittent turbulence in the Solar System plasmas. We thus believe that multifractal time series analysis of various complex environments can shed light on the nature of turbulence.","[Macek, Wieslaw M.] Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, PL-01938 Warsaw, Poland; [Macek, Wieslaw M.] Polish Acad Sci, Space Res Ctr, PL-00716 Warsaw, Poland","Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw; Polish Academy of Sciences; Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Centrum Badan Kosmicznych, Polish Academy of Sciences","Macek, WM (通讯作者)，Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Woycickiego 1-3, PL-01938 Warsaw, Poland.",macek@cbk.waw.pl,"Macek, Wieslaw Marian/AAP-7274-2020","Macek, Wieslaw Marian/0000-0002-8190-4620",,,,,15,0,0,0,3,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,418,429,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600051,0

Even if samples are taken with a constant spatial sampling interval along a marine borehole, an ice core or a speleothem, the sampling becomes irregular when the spatial scale is transformed to the time scale. Additionally, some data can be missing or there may be stratigraphic hiatuses. The Lomb-Scargle method of spectral analysis has been extended to perform cross-spectral analysis with uneven time series where each time series can have their own pattern of irregular sampling. The methodology is illustrated in four different time series case studies: an ice core from Antarctica, an ice core from Greenland and a marine core from the Mediterranean Sea. The time series has been restricted to the Holocene (11,700 yr cal BP to the present) and more specifically to the last 10,000 years where the time series can be considered stationary. The Holocene is part of the present and unusually long interglacial that nevertheless has its own cyclic climatic variations from annual to centennial and millennial time scale.

The surplus can be interpreted as a venture capital like the capital of an economic activity involved in research and development. Like most authors, we consider an upper dividend barrier so that we model the gains of the capital and its return to the capital holders. By establishing a proper and crucial connection between the two models we show and explain clearly the dividends process dynamics for the dual risk model, properties for different random quantities involved as well as their relations. Using our innovative approach we derive some already known results and go further by finding several new ones. We study different ruin and dividend probabilities, such as the calculation of the probability of a dividend, distribution of the number of dividends, expected and amount of dividends as well as the time of getting a dividend. We obtain integro-differential equations for some of the above results and also Laplace transforms. From there we can get analytical results for cases where solutions and/or inversions are possible, in other cases we may only get numerical ones. We present examples under the two cases.

The alternative corresponds to an increase in persistence and includes in particular an abrupt or gradual change from I (d(1)) to I (d(2)), -.5 < d(1) < d(2). We discuss several test statistics based on the ratio of forward and backward sample variances of the partial sums. The consistency of the tests is proved under a very general setting. We also study the behavior of these test statistics for some models with a changing memory parameter. A simulation study shows that our testing procedures have good finite sample properties and turn out to be more powerful than the KPSS-based tests (see Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin, 1992) considered in some previous works.","[Lavancier, Frederic; Philippe, Anne] Univ Nantes, F-44035 Nantes, France; [Leipus, Remigijus; Surgailis, Donatas] Vilnius Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Nantes Universite; Vilnius University,"Leipus, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",remigijus.leipus@mif.vu.it,,,Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-11155],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),The second and fourth authors are supported by a grant (No. MIP-11155) from the Research Council of Lithuania.

First, we consider a stochastic volatility model comprising both a level shift and a short-memory component, with the former modelled as a compound binomial process and the latter as an AR(1). Next, we adopt a Bayesian approach for inference and develop algorithms to obtain posterior distributions of the parameters and the two latent components. Then, we apply the model to daily S&P 500 and NASDAQ returns over the period 1980.1-2010.12. The results show that although the occurrence of a level shift is rare, about once every 2 years, this component clearly contributes most to the variation in the volatility. The half-life of a typical shock from the AR(1) component is short, on average between 9 and 15 days. Interestingly, isolating the level shift component from the overall volatility reveals a stronger relationship between volatility and business cycle movements. Although the paper focuses on daily index returns, the methods developed can potentially be used to study the low-frequency variation in realized volatility or the volatility of other financial or macroeconomic variables.","[Qu, Zhongjun; Perron, Pierre] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Qu, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",qu@bu.edu; perron@bu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-0649350],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We are grateful to Adam McCloskey for detailed comments and to the co-editor Jianqing Fan and two anonymous referees for constructive comments and suggestions.

The excess return for a risky bond is measured by the spread between the expected yield and the risk-free rate. Similarly, the risk can be expressed in the form of a default spread, measuring the difference between the yield when no default occurs and the expected yield. For zero-coupon bonds and for actual market data, the default spread is proportional to the probability of default per year. The analysis of market data shows that the yield spread scales as the square root of the default spread. This relation expresses the risk premium over the risk-free rate that the bond market offers, similarly to the risk premium for equities. With these measures for risk and return, an optimal bond allocation scheme can be built following a mean/variance utility function. Straightforward computations allow us to obtain the optimal portfolio, depending on a pre-set risk-aversion level. As for equities, the optimal portfolio is a linear combination of one risk-free bond and a risky portfolio. Using the scaling law for the default spread allows us to obtain simple expressions for the value, yield and risk of the optimal portfolio.","Consulting Financial Res, CH-1228 Saconnex Darve, Switzerland",,"Zumbach, G (通讯作者)，Consulting Financial Res, Ch Charles Baudouin 8, CH-1228 Saconnex Darve, Switzerland.",gilles.zumbach@bluewin.ch,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In particular, a scarcity function is introduced to allow important deviations of the spot price from the marginal fuel price, producing price spikes. We focus on pricing and hedging electricity derivatives. The hedging instruments are forward contracts on fuels and electricity. The presence of production capacities and electricity demand makes such a market incomplete. We follow a local risk minimization approach to price and hedge energy derivatives. Despite the richness of information included in the spot model, we obtain closed-form formulae for futures prices and semiexplicit formulae for spread options and European options on electricity forward contracts. An analysis of the electricity price risk premium is provided showing the contribution of demand and capacity to the futures prices. We show that when far from delivery, electricity futures behave like a basket of futures on fuels.","[Campi, Luciano] Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Langrene, Nicolas] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, LPMA, UMR 7599, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI); Sorbonne Universite,"Campi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",campi@ceremade.dauphine.fr,"Langrené, Nicolas/AAA-9790-2019; Campi, Luciano/L-4062-2016","Langrené, Nicolas/0000-0001-7601-4618; Campi, Luciano/0000-0002-3956-6795",EDF; CACIB; CDC,EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); CACIB; CDC(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA),"The authors thank the Finance and Sustainable Development Chair sponsored by EDF, CACIB, and CDC for their support.",,38,30,35,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Given the insurance contract structure, we aggregate the balance of individual policy accounts, and derive an approximating Gaussian process with computable correlation structure. The methodology is borrowed from heavy traffic theory in the literature of many-server queues, and involves the so-called fluid and diffusion approximations. Our framework is different from the individual risk model in that it takes into account the time dimension and the specific policy structure including the premium payments. It is also different from classical risk theory in that it builds the risk process from micro-level contracts and parameters instead of assuming aggregated claim and premium processes outright. As a result, our approximating process behaves differently depending on the issued contract structure. We also illustrate the flexibility of our approach by formulating a finite-horizon ruin problem that incorporates actuarial reserve in the consideration. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A procedural value is determined by an underlying procedure of sharing marginal contributions to coalitions formed by players joining in random order. We consider procedures under which players can only share their marginal contributions with their predecessors in the ordering, and study the set of all resulting values. The most prominent procedural value is, of course, the Shapley value obtaining under the simplest procedure of every player just retaining his entire marginal contribution. But different sharing rules lead to other interesting values, including the egalitarian solution and the Nowak and Radzik solidarity value. All procedural values are efficient, symmetric and linear. Moreover, it is shown that these properties together with two very natural monotonicity postulates characterize the class of procedural values. Some possible modifications and generalizations are also discussed. In particular, it is shown that dropping one of monotonicity axioms is equivalent to allowing for sharing marginal contributions with both predecessors and successors in the ordering.","Inst Podstaw Informatyki PAN, PL-01248 Warsaw, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Malawski, M (通讯作者)，Inst Podstaw Informatyki PAN, Jana Kazimierza 5, PL-01248 Warsaw, Poland.",malawski@ipipan.waw.pl,"Malawski, Marcin/N-7576-2019","Malawski, Marcin/0000-0002-0503-5072",,,,,17,37,41,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

To appropriately assess chemotherapy agents in an economic evaluation, ADE-related parameters such as the incidence, (dis)utility and cost of ADEs should be reflected within the model parameters. To date, there has been no systematic summary of the existing literature that quantifies the utilities of ADEs due to healthcare interventions in general and chemotherapy treatments in particular. Objective This review aimed to summarize the current evidence base of reported utility values for chemotherapy-related ADEs. Methods A structured electronic search combining terms for utility, utility valuation methods and generic terms for cancer treatment was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE in June 2011. Inclusion criteria were: (1) elicitation of utility values for chemotherapy-related ADEs and (2) primary data. Two reviewers identified studies and extracted data independently. Any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. Results Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria from the 853 abstracts initially identified, collectively reporting 218 utility values for chemotherapy-related ADEs. All 18 studies used short descriptions (vignettes) to obtain the utility values, with nine studies presenting the vignettes used in the valuation exercises. Of the 218 utility values, 178 were elicited using standard gamble (SG) or time trade-off (TTO) approaches, while 40 were elicited using visual analogue scales (VAS). There were 169 utility values of specific chemotherapy-related ADEs (with the top ten being anaemia [34 values], nausea and/or vomiting [32 values], neuropathy [21 values], neutropenia [12 values], diarrhoea [12 values], stomatitis [10 values], fatigue [8 values], alopecia [7 values], hand-foot syndrome [5 values] and skin reaction [5 values]) and 49 of non-specific chemotherapy-related adverse events. In most cases, it was difficult to directly compare the utility values as various definitions and study-specific vignettes were used for the ADEs of interest. Limitations This review was designed to provide an overall description of existing literature reporting utility values for chemotherapy-related ADEs. The findings were not exhaustive and were limited to publications that could be identified using the search strategy employed and those reported in the English language. Conclusions This review identified wide ranges in the utility values reported for broad categories of specific chemotherapy-related ADEs. There were difficulties in comparing the values directly as various study-specific definitions were used for these ADEs and most studies did not make the vignettes used in the valuation exercises available. It is recommended that a basic minimum requirement be developed for the transparent reporting of study designs eliciting utility values, incorporating key criteria such as reporting how the vignettes were developed and presenting the vignettes used in the valuation tasks as well as valuing and reporting the utility values of the ADE-free base states. It is also recommended, in the future, for studies valuing the utilities of chemotherapy-related ADEs to define the ADEs according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) definitions for chemotherapy-related ADEs as the use of the same definition across studies would ease the comparison and selection of utility values and make the overall inclusion of adverse events within economic models of chemotherapy agents much more straightforward.","[Shabaruddin, Fatiha H.] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Pharm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Chen, Li-Chia; Elliott, Rachel A.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Pharm, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Universiti Malaya; University of Nottingham; University of Manchester,"Payne, K (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",katherine.payne@manchester.ac.uk,"Chen, Li-Chia/C-5950-2009; Elliott, Rachel/P-5894-2018; Shabaruddin, Fatiha/I-5327-2015; Payne, Katherine/AAJ-3728-2020","Elliott, Rachel/0000-0002-3650-0168; Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350; Chen, Li-Chia/0000-0002-6158-6645",Research Council UK (RCUK),Research Council UK (RCUK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"KP is part funded by a Research Council UK (RCUK) Academic Fellowship.

Standard multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models, however, provide estimates of volatilities and correlations based only on the direct transmission of shocks across assets. As such, spillover effects via an intermediary asset or market are not considered. In this article, a multivariate GARCH model is constructed that provides estimates of volatilities and correlations based on both directly and indirectly transmitted shocks. The model is applied to exchange rate and equity returns data. The results suggest that if a spillover component is observed in the data, the spillover augmented models provide significantly different volatility estimates compared to standard multivariate GARCH models.","[Chua, Chew Lian] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, KPMG, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Chua, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, KPMG, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",mchua@unimelb.edu.au,"Tsiaplias, Sarantis/R-3006-2019","Chua, Chew/0000-0003-3201-9497; Tsiaplias, Sarantis/0000-0001-6728-2418",University of Melbourne Faculty of Economics and Commerce research grant; Australian Discovery Grant [DP087729],University of Melbourne Faculty of Economics and Commerce research grant; Australian Discovery Grant(Australian Research Council),Sarantis Tsiaplias acknowledges the support of a University of Melbourne Faculty of Economics and Commerce research grant.
