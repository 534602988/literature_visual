However the reliance on repeated cross-sectional analysis for this purpose prevents both the appropriate specification of the health function as a dynamic model and the identification of important determinants of the transition processes underlying IRHI changes such as those relating to mortality. This paper overcomes these limitations by developing alternative longitudinal procedures to analyse the role of health determinants in driving changes in IRHI through both morbidity changes and mortality, with our dynamic modelling framework also serving to identify their contribution to long-run or structural IRHI. The approach is illustrated by an empirical analysis of the causes of the increase in IRHI in Great Britain between 1999 and 2004. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Disease prognosis, beneficial treatment response, and susceptibility to adverse drug effects are often intimately tied to individual biology. Clinical and genetic biomarkers applied individually or in concert are increasingly used to stratify patient populations in terms of prognosis, therapeutic benefit, or safety. As a result, clinical trialists are challenged to design studies that reflect these determinants of outcome, to optimize the patient's eventual clinical course both in the trial and in actual practice. These designs are informed both by preclinical studies and by real-world research that can establish proof of concept for a novel biomarker and provide a basic understanding of the relationship between biomarker and clinical outcome. As clinical and real world studies unfold, a deeper understanding of the nature of the biomarker and its potential uses in drug development is gained. Specifically, one can eventually define the biomarker as prognostic (i.e., predicts disease progression), predictive (predicts treatment response or adverse outcome(s)), or exhibiting both prognostic and predictive properties. One must further validate the performance of these emerging biomarkers, again in both the trial and real-world environments. the eventual adoption of the biomarker as a useful pharmacodiagnostic test is premised upon this early translational research. In this article, the development and validation of predictive and prognostic biomarkers is discussed by using selected examples that highlight factors contributing to the valuation of biomarkers and their application to personalized medicine in the real world.","[Burns, Leah C.; Orsini, Lucinda] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [L'Italien, Gilbert] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA",Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Burns, LC (通讯作者)，Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Route 206, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",leah.burns@bms.com,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16.0,6.0,,S,,,S16,S19,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.007,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CS,24034307.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325467800004,0

We study such contests assuming players have private information. We identify a general class of imperfectly discriminating contests for which findings by Athey (2001) imply the existence of a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in monotone pure strategies. The main assumptions are that a player's valuation of winning is increasing in the signal he observes and that a player's probability of winning is continuous in the efforts of all players as well as increasing in his own effort.

Methods: Medicare enrollees diagnosed with primary HCC from 2000 to 2007, ever treated with TACE, but not transplant/resection, followed through 2009 by using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results Program and linked Medicare databases. Cumulative all-cause/HCC-related survival was estimated by using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models stratified by the total number of TACE treatments. Multivariate weighted Cox regressions estimated the average risk of mortality faced with nonproportional hazards. Lin's inverse probability-weighted least squares regression method estimated cumulative Medicare expenditures adjusted for censoring and covariates. Results: Of 1228 patients, 34% were stage 1, 16% stage 2, 19% stage 3, 6% stage 4, and 26% unstaged. About 44% were aged 65 to 75 years, 69% were men, and 72% were Caucasian. Over half (57%) of the patients received one course, 24% two, 11% three, and 8% four courses of TACE. One-course patients incurred an average $74,788 (95% confidence interval [CI] $71,890- $77,686),two-course patients $101,126 (95% CI $94,395-$107,856), three-course patients $111,776 (95% CI $101,931-$121,621), and fourplus-course patients $148,878 (95% CI $136,346-$161,409). One-course patients lived (all-cause) an average 1.86 (95% CI 1.82-1.90), two-course patients 2.09 (95% CI 2.05-2.13), three-course patients 2.81 (95% CI 2.66-2.97), and four-plus-course patients 3.06 (95% CI 2.953.18) years after diagnosis. Average risk of all-cause mortality was not significantly different between one/two courses or three/four-plus courses. Conclusions: Cumulative Medicare expenditures nearly doubled from one-course to four-plus-course patients. On average, four-plus-course patients lived over one more year than did one-course patients. Physician/patient decisions should be balanced with consideration of efficient use of limited resources, but payer's intervention in physician discretion may not be important in this setting.","[Breunig, Ian M.; Shaya, Fadia T.; Chirikov, Viktor V.; Mullins, C.

The reviewing activity associated with model development should be transparent and reproducible but can result in a tension between being both timely and systematic. Little procedural guidance exists in this area. The purpose of this article was to provide guidance, informed by focus groups, on what might constitute a systematic and transparent approach to reviewing information to populate model parameters. Methods: A focus group series was held with HTA experts in the United Kingdom including systematic reviewers, information specialists, and health economic modelers to explore these issues. Framework analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data elicited during focus groups. Results: Suggestions included the use of rapid reviewing methods and the need to consider the trade-off between relevance and quality. The need for transparency in the reporting of review methods was emphasized. It was suggested that additional attention should be given to the reporting of parameters deemed to be more important to the model or where the preferred decision regarding the choice of evidence is equivocal. Discussion: These recommendations form part of a Technical Support Document produced for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Decision Support Unit in the United Kingdom. It is intended that these recommendations will help to ensure a more systematic, transparent, and reproducible process for the review of model parameters within HTA.","[Kaltenthaler, Eva; Tappenden, Paul; Paisley, Suzy] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Kaltenthaler, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",e.kaltenthaler@sheffield.ac.uk,,,NICE Decision Support,NICE Decision Support,Source of financial support: Funding for this work was received from the NICE Decision Support,,35,10,10,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2013,16.0,5.0,,,,,830,836,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.04.009,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CL,23947977.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325466600017,0

The reform is shown to affect women, the elderly, and immigrants the most.

We focus on the identification of the non-pecuniary component, which is key to disentangling the relative importance of monetary incentives versus preferences in the context of sorting across sectors. By making the most of the structure of the selection equation, we show that this component is point identified from the knowledge of the covariate effects on earnings, as soon as one covariate is continuous. Notably, and in contrast to most results on the identification of Roy models, this implies that identification can be achieved without any exclusion restriction nor large support condition on the covariates. As a by-product, bounds are obtained on the distribution of the ex ante monetary returns. We propose a three-stage semiparametric estimation procedure for this model, which yields root-n consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. Finally, we apply our results to the educational context, by providing new evidence from French data that non-pecuniary factors are a key determinant of higher education attendance decisions.

The data are assumed to contain a large number of cross-sectional units repeatedly observed over a fixed number of time periods. The model has a feature of the fixed-effects model in that the effects are assumed to be correlated with the regressors. The unobservable individual effects are assumed to have a factor structure. For consistent estimation of the model, it is important to estimate the true number of individual effects. We propose a generalized methods of moments procedure by which both the number of individual effects and the regression coefficients can be consistently estimated. Some important identification issues are also discussed. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed methods produce reliable estimates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The barter contractual approach was developed in Marakulin (2003, 2011) for exchange economies: it is now modified and extended to the production economy. This includes hereby the introduction of a production contract and the adoption of known earlier notions: a web of contracts, coalitional domination for webs, a partial breaking of contracts, and so on. Thus specific notions of properly contractual and fuzzy contractual allocations for an economy with public goods are introduced and their equivalence with Lindahl equilibria is stated. These theorems can be interpreted as a new way of perfect competition presentation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Marakulin, V.

Both reforms effectively increased the cost of school meals for one group (the treated), leaving another unaffected (the controls). I find strong evidence of crowd out: the reforms reduced school meal take-up among the treated by 20-30 percentage points, with no difference among the controls. I then examine whether this affected children's body weights, using a large, unique, longitudinal dataset of primary school children from 1972 to 1994. The findings show no evidence of any effects on child body weight. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In these states, individuals under the age of 21 are issued licenses that are vertically oriented, whereas licenses for individuals 21 and older retain a traditional horizontal shape. This paper examines the effect of this design change on underage alcohol and tobacco use. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we find a reduction in drinking and smoking for 16 year olds. These results are upheld in a triple difference model that uses a within state control group of teens that did not receive a vertical license to control for state-specific unobserved factors. Interestingly, we find that the effects of the design change are concentrated in the 1-2 years after a state begins issuing vertical licenses. We consider various explanations for our findings: teen learning, the availability of false identification, and changes in retailer behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Methods from a recent actuarial study of medical errors were used to identify medical injuries. A visit qualified as an injury visit if at least 1 of 97 injury groupings occurred at that visit, and the percentage of injuries caused by medical error was estimated. Visits with more than four injuries were removed from the population to avoid overestimation of cost. Population estimates were extrapolated from the Premier hospital database to all US acute care hospitals. Results: There were an estimated 161,655 medical errors in 2008 and 170,201 medical errors in 2009. Extrapolated to the entire US population, there were more than 4 million unique injury visits containing more than 1 million unique medical errors each year. This analysis estimated that the total annual cost of measurable medical errors in the United States was $985 million in 2008 and just over $1 billion in 2009. The median cost per error to hospitals was $892 for 2008 and rose to $939 in 2009. Nearly one third of all medical injuries were due to error in each year. Conclusions: Medical errors directly impact patient outcomes and hospitals' profitability, especially since 2008 when Medicare stopped reimbursing hospitals for care related to certain preventable medical errors. Hospitals must rigorously analyze causes of medical errors and implement comprehensive preventative programs to reduce their occurrence as the financial burden of medical errors shifts to hospitals.","[David, Guy] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gunnarsson, Candace L.; Waters, Heidi C.] S2 Stat Solut Inc, Cincinnati, OH 45241 USA; [Horblyuk, Ruslan] GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI USA; [Kaplan, Harold S.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, New York, NY USA",University of Pennsylvania; S2 Analytical Solutions; General Electric; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Gunnarsson, CL (通讯作者)，S2 Stat Solut Inc, 11176 Main St, Cincinnati, OH 45241 USA.",candaceg@s2stats.com,"Waters, Heidi/AAA-5645-2020","Waters, Heidi/0000-0002-5671-3558",GE Healthcare,GE Healthcare(General ElectricGE Healthcare),GE Healthcare funded this study.,,12,39,65,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2013,16.0,2.0,,,,,305,310,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.11.010,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,144AC,23538182.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318910400010,0

For privately insured consumers, cost sharing was abolished, whereas those socially insured never faced cost sharing. The separate remuneration systems for socially insured consumers (capitation) and privately insured consumers (fee-for-service) changed to a combined system of capitation and fee-for-service for both groups. Our first hypothesis was that privately insured consumers had a higher increase in patient-initiated GP contact rates compared with socially insured consumers. Our second hypothesis was that socially insured consumers had a higher increase in physician-initiated contact rates. Data were used from electronic medical records from 32 GP-practices and 35336 consumers in 20052007. A difference-in-differences approach was applied to study the effect of changes in cost sharing and remuneration system on contact rates. Abolition of cost sharing led to a higher increase in patient-initiated utilisation for privately insured consumers in persons aged 65 and older. Introduction of fee-for-service for socially insured consumers led to a higher increase in physician-initiated utilisation. This was most apparent in persons aged 25 to 54. Differences in the trend in physician-initiated utilisation point to an effect of supplier-induced demand. Differences in patient-initiated utilisation indicate limited evidence for moral hazard.

Functions of theoretical quantiles, which depend on the parameters of the assumed probability law, are matched with the sample counterparts, which depend on the observations. Since the theoretical quantiles may not be available analytically, the optimization is based on simulations. We illustrate the method with the estimation of astable distributions. A thorough Monte Carlo study and an illustration to 22 financial indexes show the usefulness of MSQ. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to substitutions that may arise with other beverages, we account for substitutions between SSBs and 12 major food categories. Our main findings are that the tax would result in a decrease in store-bought energy of 24.3 kcal per day per person, which would translate into an average weight loss of 1.6 pounds during the first year and a cumulated weight loss of 2.9 pounds in the long run. We do not find evidence of substitution to sugary foods and show that complementary foods could contribute to decreasing energy purchases.

It has already become an international trend that companies assume social responsibility. Therefore, it will guide companies through the implementation of appropriate corporate social responsibility to enhance their brand influence if we can make a research on the specific impact of corporate social responsibility on corporate brand construction. Corporate social responsibility is one hot topic that has been studied since the 20th century by many subjects such as economics, management science, law, sociology, philosophy and so on. Meanwhile, the social responsibility requirement form international community has turned into a concrete action from a call. It has become an irresistible international trend that companies shall undertake their social responsibilities, which is extensively concerned in the various circles of society. However, being different with western companies that actively promote the corporate social responsibility, Chinese companies always undertake it without voluntary. As a hot topic of theoretical research, the corporate brand, its effect in the social competition is drawing more and more attention. Therefore, this paper makes a research on the impact of corporate social responsibility on corporate brand and its entry point is how to promote the company to assume social responsibility.

We provide an evolutionary foundation for this phenomenon by showing that learning by reinforcement can lead to probability matching and, if the learning occurs sufficiently slowly, probability matching does not only occur in choice frequencies but also in choice probabilities. Our results are completed by proving that there exists no quasi-linear reinforcement learning specification such that the behavior is optimal for all environments where counterfactuals are observed.

We show that the Markov-switching mixture model dominates both individual models and improves the fit considerably. Our estimation indicates that the DSGE model plays an important role only in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. We show how to use the mixture model as a data filter for estimation of the DSGE model when the BVAR model is not identified. Moreover, we show how to compute the impulse responses to the same type of shock shared by the DSGE and BVAR models when the shock is identified in the BVAR model.

The results suggest that the copper boom substantially reduced rates of transactional sex and multiple partnerships in copper mining cities.

The objective of this study was to review applied economic evaluations to identify the methods used for, and implications of, including informal care in practice. Methods: Searches of key databases were conducted to identify all full economic evaluations incorporating costs or outcomes relating to informal care. Information was extracted by using a standard template from all studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Results: Thirty economic evaluations were identified that included informal care. Twenty-five of these studies costed carers' time input and 17 measured outcomes for carers. The reported cost-effectiveness of interventions was altered by including informal care, in some cases changing the key conclusions for health care funding. Conclusions: Theory and methods development around informal care are yet to significantly permeate the applied literature; however, the results suggest that some funding priorities may change if they were to do so. The development of 1) a reference case for including informal care; 2) sensitivity analysis for contentious issues; and 3) a statement for the reason for excluding informal care, if this is deemed appropriate, may help to improve the way that informal care is included in economic evaluations in the future.","[Goodrich, Kacey; Kaambwa, Billingsley; Al-Janabi, Hareth] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Sch Hlth & Populat Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Al-Janabi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Sch Hlth & Populat Sci, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",h.aljanabi@bham.ac.uk,,"KAAMBWA, BILLINGSLEY/0000-0002-2128-3404; Al-Janabi, Hareth/0000-0002-3691-8310",MRC [G1002334] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G1002334] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G1002334] Funding Source: Medline,MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,71,101,105,3,37,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15.0,6.0,,,,,975,981,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.05.009,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999150.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800026,0

Enzyme replacement therapies for diseases of inherited metabolic enzyme deficiency provide an example of this dilemma. The Ontario Public Drug Programs convened the Drugs for Rare Diseases Working Group to develop a policy for assessing these drugs. Methods: The Drugs for Rare Diseases Working Group developed terms of reference expecting that the ideal policy product would be transparent and consistent and address unique aspects of the treatment of a specific rare condition while being adaptable to other dissimilar conditions. The perspective was that of a public payer addressing requests for funding generated for a specific drug, and included respect for the principles of accountability for reasonableness of Daniels and Sabin. Results: A seven-step framework was developed and tested by using the case study of idursulfase for mucopolysaccharidosis II (Hunter disease). Estimation of clinical effectiveness was done by using decision modeling. The model developed informed funding recommendations and ultimately led to an agreement with the manufacturer allowing funding of idursulfase in Ontario. Conclusions: This policy framework attempts to address the policy challenges of funding drugs for rare diseases. The framework will be used to assess other drugs in future and will inevitably require modification with experience. It is hoped that it may be of value to other policymakers.","[Winquist, Eric; Martin, Janet] Univ Western Ontario, London Hlth Sci Ctr, London, ON N6A 4L6, Canada; [Winquist, Eric; Martin, Janet] Univ Western Ontario, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON N6A 4L6, Canada; [Bell, Chaim M.] St Michaels Hosp, Keenan Res Ctr, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; [Bell, Chaim M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bell, Chaim M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Clarke, Joe T.

The quality measure used is the proportion of residents who are using antipsychotic medication. Although the changing case-mix of nursing home residents accounts for some of the increase in the use of antipsychotics, we find that the use of antipsychotics by nursing homes is responsive to state regulatory enforcement in a manner consistent with the multitasking incentive problem. Specifically, the effect of the regulations is dependent on the degree of complementarity between the regulatory deficiency and the use of antipsychotics.

The proposed tests are of the Vuong-type (Vuong, 1989; Rivers and Vuong, 2002). In our framework, the econometrician selects values for model's parameters in order to match some characteristics of data with those implied by the theoretical model. We assume that all competing models are misspecified, and suggest a test for the null hypothesis that they provide equivalent fit to data characteristics, against the alternative that one of the models is a better approximation. We consider both nested and non-nested cases. We also relax the dependence of models' ranking on the choice of a weight matrix by suggesting averaged and sup-norm procedures. The methods are illustrated by comparing the cash-in-advance and portfolio adjustment cost models in their ability to match the impulse responses of output and inflation to money growth shocks.

Researchers are typically expected to identify and combine available data to inform the estimation of model parameters for a particular decision problem. The absence of clear guidelines on what data can be used and how to effectively synthesize this evidence base under different scenarios inevitably leads to different approaches being used by different modelers. Objectives: The aim of this article is to produce a taxonomy that can help modelers identify the most appropriate methods to use when synthesizing the available data for a given model parameter. Methods: This article developed a taxonomy based on possible scenarios faced by the analyst when dealing with the available evidence. While mainly focusing on clinical effectiveness parameters, this article also discusses strategies relevant to other key input parameters in any economic model (i.e., disease natural history, resource use/costs, and preferences). Results: The taxonomy categorizes the evidence base for health economic modeling according to whether 1) single or multiple data sources are available, 2) individual or aggregate data are available (or both), or 3) individual or multiple decision model parameters are to be estimated from the data. References to examples of the key methodological developments for each entry in the taxonomy together with citations to where such methods have been used in practice are provided throughout. Conclusions: The use of the taxonomy developed in this article hopes to improve the quality of the synthesis of evidence informing decision models by bringing to the attention of health economics modelers recent methodological developments in this field.","[Saramago, Pedro; Manca, Andrea] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Sutton, Alex J.] Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England",University of York - UK; University of Leicester,"Saramago, P (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",pedro.saramago@york.ac.uk,,"Saramago Goncalves, Pedro Rafael/0000-0001-9063-8590; Sutton, Alexander/0000-0002-8934-9940",Medical Research Council Capacity Building Grant [G0800139]; Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/61448/2009]; NIHR [CDF-2009-02-21]; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [CDF-2009-02-21] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [CDF-2009-02-21] Funding Source: researchfish; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/61448/2009] Funding Source: FCT,Medical Research Council Capacity Building Grant; Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"Pedro Saramago was funded through a Medical Research Council Capacity Building Grant (grant number G0800139) and the Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (grant number SFRH/BD/61448/2009).

We consider both heterogeneous and homogeneous regression relationships when both the time and cross-section dimensions are large. We propose sieve estimators for the nonparametric regression functions by extending Pesaran's (2006) common correlated effect (CCE) estimator to our semiparametric framework. Asymptotic normal distributions for the proposed estimators are derived and asymptotic variance estimators are provided. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that our estimators perform well in finite samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Of the labels reviewed, 30% included PROs. Our study aimed to build on this work by describing the current state of PRO label claims granted for new molecular entities (and biologic license applications since February 2006 after the release of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft PRO guidance. Methods: All new molecular entities and biologic license applications approved by the FDA from January 2006 through December 2010 were identified by using the Web page of the FDA Drug Approval Reports. For all identified products, drug approval packages and approved product labels were reviewed to identify PRO endpoint status and to determine the number and type of PRO claims. Results: Of the 116 products identified, 28 (24%) were granted PRO claims; 24 (86%) were for symptoms, and, of these, 9 (38%) claims were pain related. Of the 28 products with PRO claims, a PRO was a primary endpoint for 20 (71%), all symptom related. Conclusions: The FDA continues to approve PRO claims, with 24% of new molecular entities and biologic license applications being granted. Successful PRO label claims over the past 5 years have generally supported treatment benefit for symptoms specified as primary endpoints.","[Gnanasakthy, Ari] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ 07936 USA; [Mordin, Margaret; Clark, Marci; DeMuro, Carla; Fehnel, Sheri; Copley-Merriman, Catherine] RTI Hlth Solut, Durham, NC USA",Novartis; Research Triangle Institute,"Gnanasakthy, A (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut, 1 Hlth Plaza, E Hanover, NJ 07936 USA.",ari.gnanasakthy@novartis.com,,"Fehnel, Sheri/0000-0001-8568-0102; Gnanasakthy, Ari/0000-0001-9176-3983; Mordin, Margaret/0000-0002-6048-0275; Copley-Merriman, Catherine/0000-0002-8032-7219",Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(Novartis),This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.,,18,85,88,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2012,15.0,3.0,,,,,437,442,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.032,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,941CN,22583453.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303940600006,0

Uncertain parameters are assigned probability distributions and analyses performed by Monte Carlo simulation. Correlations between input parameters are rarely accounted for despite recommendations from several guidelines. By outlining theoretical reasons for including correlations and showing numerous examples of existing correlations, we appeal to the analyst to consider input dependencies. Our objective is to review the available methods to do so, give technical details on implementation and show, by using examples of published studies, the effect input correlations have on model outputs. Methods: A hierarchy of methods for dealing with correlations in Monte Carlo simulation is presented and used. The choice of method depends on the amount of information available on dependency and consists of functional modeling, joint distributions/copulas, and coupling of marginal distributions. Results: We induced input correlation with various methods and showed that in most cases the choice of optimal decision remained the same as in the independent scenario. There was, however, a significant change in the value of further information because of inducing input correlations. The results were similar for various dependency structures and were mainly a function of the strength of correlation, as measured by the linear correlation coefficient. Conclusion: Probabilistic uncertainty analysis reflects joint uncertainty across input parameters only when dependence among input parameters is accounted for.","[Naversnik, Klemen] Lek Pharmaceut DD, Sandoz Dev Ctr Ljubljana, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Rojnik, Klemen] Roche DOO Farmacevtska Druzba, Ljubljana, Slovenia",Novartis; Sandoz; Roche Holding,"Naversnik, K (通讯作者)，Lek Pharmaceut DD, Sandoz Dev Ctr Ljubljana, Verovskova 57, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",klemen.naversnik@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,14,18,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2012,15.0,3.0,,,,,540,549,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.12.008,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,941CN,22583465.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303940600018,0

Method: The main public pharmaceutical cost-containment policy measures including reducing the ex-factory price of drugs, pharmacy dispensing fees and community drug scheme coverage, and increasing patient copayments are outlined along with the resulting savings. We quantify the cost implications of a new policy that restricts the entitlement to free prescription drugs of persons older than 70 years and propose an alternative option-based policy that reduces the total cost to both the state and the patient. Results: This set of policy measures reduced public spending on com-munity drugs by an estimated (sic)380m in 2011. The policy restricting free prescription drugs for persons older than 70 years, though effective in reducing public cost, increased the total cost of the drugs supplied. The policy-induced cost increase stems from a fees anomaly between the two main community drugs schemes which is circumvented by our alternative option-based policy. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for policymakers, even when absorbed with reducing cost, to design cost-containment policies that are both fiscally and economically sustainable.","[Walshe, Valerie] Hlth Serv Execut, Aras Slainte, Cork, Ireland; [Kenneally, Martin] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Ctr Policy Studies, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Walshe, V (通讯作者)，Hlth Serv Execut, Aras Slainte, Floor 3,Wilton Rd, Cork, Ireland.",Valerie.walshe@hse.ie,,,,,,,37,7,8,2,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2012,15.0,2.0,,,,,389,393,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.10.007,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,914DZ,22433772.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301930600022,0

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of escitalopram versus generic venlafaxine extended-release (XR) in MDD, accounting for the full clinical profile of each, adopting the Swedish societal perspective, and identifying major cost drivers. Methods: Cost-effectiveness of escitalopram versus venlafaxine XR was analyzed over a 6-month time frame, on the basis of a decision tree, for patients with MDD seeking primary care treatment in Sweden. Effectiveness outcomes for the model were quality-adjusted life-years and probability of sustained remission after acute treatment (first 8 weeks) and sustained for 6 months. Cost outcomes included direct treatment costs and indirect costs associated with sick leave. Results: Compared with generic venlafaxine XR, escitalopram was less costly and more effective in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (expected gain 0.00865) and expected 6-month sustained remission probability (incremental gain 0.0374). The better tolerability profile of escitalopram contributed to higher expected quality-adjusted life-years and lower health-care resource utilization in terms of pharmacological treatment of adverse events (though only a minor component of treatment costs). Expected per-patient saving was (sic)169.15 for escitalopram versus venlafaxine. Cost from sick leave constituted about 85% of total costs. Conclusions: Escitalopram was estimated as more effective and cost saving than generic venlafaxine XR in first-line MDD treatment in Sweden, driven by the effectiveness and tolerability advantages of escitalopram. The study findings are robust and in line with similar pharmacoeconomic analyses.","[Danchenko, Natalya; Marteau, Florence] Lundbeck SAS, F-92445 Issy Les Moulineaux, France; [Nordstrom, Goran] Psykiatriska kliniken, Hedvagen Trelleborg, Sweden; [Despiegel, Nicolas] i3 Innovus, Nanterre, France",Lundbeck Corporation; Lundbeck Corporation - France; i3 Innovus,"Danchenko, N (通讯作者)，Lundbeck SAS, 37-45 Quai President Roosevelt, F-92445 Issy Les Moulineaux, France.",NADO@Lundbeck.com,,,Lundbeck SAS,Lundbeck SAS(Lundbeck Corporation),"This study was supported by Lundbeck SAS.

Empirical evidence from the market for angioplasty in the Netherlands,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hospital demand; Patient choice; Quality ratings; Quality competition,REPORT CARDS; MODELS; COMPETITION; SURGEONS,"A necessary condition for competition to promote quality in hospital markets is that patients are sensitive to differences in hospital quality. In this paper we examine the relationship between hospital quality, as measured by publicly available quality ratings, and patient hospital choice for angioplasty using individual claims data from a large health insurer. We find that Dutch patients have a high propensity to choose hospitals with a good reputation, both overall and for cardiology, and a low readmission rate after treatment for heart failure. Relative to a mean readmission rate of 8.5% we find that a 1%-point lower readmission rate is associated with a 12% increase in hospital demand. Since readmission rates are not adjusted for case-mix they may not provide a correct signal of hospital quality. Insofar patients base their hospital choice on such imperfect quality information, this may result in suboptimal choices and risk selection by hospitals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This formulation accommodates the choice and count in a single random utility framework with desirable theoretical properties. Individual heterogeneity is introduced through a random coefficient scheme with a flexible semiparametric distribution. We deal with the analytical intractability of the resulting mixture by recasting the model as an embedding of infinite sequences of scaled moments of the mixing distribution, and newly derive their cumulant representations along with bounds on their rate of numerical convergence. We further develop an efficient recursive algorithm for fast evaluation of the model likelihood within a Bayesian Gibbs sampling scheme. We apply our model to a recent household panel of supermarket visit counts. We estimate the nonparametric density of three key variables of interest - price, driving distance, and their interaction - while controlling for a range of consumer demographic characteristics. We use this econometric framework to assess the opportunity cost of time and analyze the interaction between store-choice, trip frequency, search intensity, and household and store characteristics. We also conduct a counterfactual welfare experiment and compute the compensating variation for a 10%-30% increase in Walmart prices. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

We use this exogenous attitude change to estimate the causal impact of increased discrimination on a range of objective and subjective health outcomes. The difference-in-differences estimates indicate that discrimination worsens blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI and self-assessed general health. Thus, discrimination is a potentially important determinant of the large racial and ethnic health gaps observed in many countries. We also investigate the pathways through which discrimination impacts upon health, and find that discrimination has a negative effect on employment, perceived social support, and health-producing behaviours. Crucially, our results hold for different control groups and model specifications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

S. health-care system, and chemotherapy is an important contributor to cancer costs. This article examines the differences between breast cancer patients who received chemotherapy and those who did not in costs and survival by age, treatment, and axillary node status. Methods: We studied a cohort of 23,110 node-positive and 31,572 node-negative women aged 65 years and older diagnosed with incident American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 2002, using Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data. Total treatment costs and costs associated with the use of chemotherapy were estimated by using the phase-of-care approach. The phase-specific costs were combined to estimate total Medicare payments for cancer care from diagnosis to death. Cox proportional hazard ratio of mortality was used to determine the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy after adjusting for selected patient and tumor characteristics. We used propensity scores to minimize the bias associated with the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Results: Regression-adjusted difference in the average lifetime cost estimates for all node-positive patients receiving chemotherapy was approximately $ 2438 and was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than for patients not receiving chemotherapy. Mortality was significantly lower in node-positive and node-negative women aged 65 to 74 years receiving chemotherapy. Conclusions: Decision makers can use cost and effectiveness estimates from this study to assess the relative value of chemotherapy in different age groups.","[Sail, Kavita R.; Franzini, Luisa; Lairson, David R.; Du, Xianglin L.] Univ Texas Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sail, Kavita R.] McKesson Specialty Hlth, The Woodlands, TX USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; McKesson Corporation,"Franzini, L (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, 1200 Pressler Dr, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",Luisa.Franzini@uth.tmc.edu,,,"Susan G.

Although many fields of studies including epidemiology, sociology, and psychology try to identify determinants for medical nonpersistence, comprehensive research to explain medical nonpersistence from an economics perspective is rather scarce. Objectives: The aim of the study was to develop a conceptual framework that augments standard economic choice theory with psychological concepts of behavioral economics to understand how patients preferences for discontinuing with therapy arise over the course of the medical treatment. The availability of such a framework allows the targeted design of mechanisms for intervention strategies. Methods: Our conceptual framework models the patient as an active economic agent who evaluates the benefits and costs for continuing with therapy. We argue that a combination of loss aversion and mental accounting operations explains why patients discontinue with therapy at a specific point in time. We designed a randomized laboratory economic experiment with a student subject pool to investigate the behavioral predictions. Results: Subjects continue with therapy as long as experienced utility losses have to be compensated. As soon as previous losses are evened out, subjects perceive the marginal benefit of persistence lower than in the beginning of the treatment Consequently, subjects start to discontinue with therapy. Conclusions: Our results highlight that concepts of behavioral economics capture the dynamic structure of medical nonpersistence better than does standard economic choice theory. We recommend that behavioral economics should be a mandatory part of the development of possible intervention strategies aimed at improving patients' compliance and persistence behavior.","[Djawadi, Behnud Mir; Fahr, Rene] Univ Paderborn, Dept Management, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Turk, Florian] GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Brentford, Middx, England",University of Paderborn; GlaxoSmithKline,"Djawadi, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Paderborn, Dept Management, Warburger St 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",behnud.djawadi@wiwi.uni-paderborn.de,,"Fahr, Rene/0000-0002-0304-6675","Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland","Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland","Funding for this research was provided by Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.",,64,8,8,2,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2014,17.0,8.0,,,,,814,822,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.08.2669,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AX4RC,25498776.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346918100007,0

We first introduce two fairness requirements to accommodate different demands across agents. We show that each of these requirements is incompatible with stochastic dominance efficiency (henceforth, we use the prefix sd for stochastic dominance) and weak sd-strategy-proofness, unless all agents have unitary demands. We next introduce a new incentive requirement which we call limited invariance. We explore implications of these requirements in combination of consistency or converse consistency. Our main result is that the generalized serial rule, which we propose as an adaptation of the serial rule to our setting, is the only rule satisfying sd-efficiency, the sd proportional-division lower-bound, limited invariance, and consistency. Uniqueness persists if we replace the sd proportional-division lower-bound by sd normalized-no-envy, or consistency by converse consistency, or both. The serial rule in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) is characterized as a special case of our generalized serial rule. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

They confuse my confined summaries with some unknown wider purpose. Second, they claim I failed to qualify the conclusions with regard to 'the wider evidence-base on price and alcohol related harms'. Third, they opine that my conclusions must be qualified due to 'known methodological problems'. The basis for LHS's claims rests largely on their interpretation of other parts of the alcohol-price literature-the purported evidence base. Consequently, my reply also involves critical judgments about this literature. None of the claims by LHS are supported by closer examination of my paper; a critical reading of the alcohol-price literature; and my supporting research on heavy drinking patterns (Nelson 2013b, 2014b) and price responsiveness generally (Nelson 2013c, 2013d, 2014a).","Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Nelson, JP (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jpn@psu.edu,,,"International Center for Alcohol Policies, Washington, DC","International Center for Alcohol Policies, Washington, DC","Research support for my initial review was provided in part by the International Center for Alcohol Policies, Washington, DC, a not-for-profit organization, supported by major producers of beverage alcohol.",,17,1,1,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,OCT,2014,23.0,10.0,,,,,1284,1286,,10.1002/hec.3099,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AQ6IZ,25139827.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342915900007,0

The important result of Santos and Woodford (1997) says that price bubbles cannot exist in equilibrium in the standard dynamic asset pricing model with rational agents facing borrowing constraints as long as assets are in strictly positive supply and the present value of total future resources is finite. This paper explores the possibility of asset price bubbles under endogenous debt constraints induced by limited enforcement of debt repayment. Equilibria with endogenous debt constraints are prone to have infinite present value of total resources. We show that asset price bubbles are likely to exist in such equilibria. Further, we demonstrate that there always exist equilibria with price bubbles on assets in zero supply.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Werner, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",jwerner@umn.edu,,,,,,,28,7,8,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0304-4068,,,J MATH ECON,J.

First, individuals are invited to take a noninvasive screening test, and, second, in the case of a positive screening test result, they are advised to undergo a more invasive follow-up test. The objective of this study was to investigate how much individuals participation decision in noninvasive screening is affected by the presence or absence of detailed information about invasive follow-up testing and how this effect varies over screening tests. Methods: We used a labeled discrete choice experiment of three noninvasive colorectal cancer screening types with two versions that did or did not present respondents with detailed information about the possible invasive follow-up test (i.e., colonoscopy) and its procedure. We used data from 631 Dutch respondents aged 55 to 75 years. Each respondent received only one of the two versions (N = 310 for the invasive follow-up test information specification version, and N = 321 for the no-information specification version). Results: Mixed logit model results show that detailed information about the invasive follow-up test negatively affects screening participation decisions. This effect can be explained mainly by a decrease in choice shares for the most preferred screening test (a combined stool and blood sample test). Choice share simulations based on the discrete choice experiment indicated that presenting invasive follow-up test information decreases screening participation by 4.79% Conclusions: Detailed information about the invasive follow-up test has a negative effect on individuals' screening participation decisions in noninvasive colorectal cancer screening campaigns. This result poses new challenges for policymakers who aim not only to increase uptake but also to provide full disclosure to potential screening participants.","[Benning, Tim M.; Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Benning, Tim M.] Tilburg Univ, CentERdata, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Dellaert, Benedict G.

Individual RUGs account for differences in the intensity of care provided, but there exists significant regional variation in the payments SNFs receive from Medicare due to the use of geographic adjustment factors. This paper is the first to use this geographic variation in the generosity of Medicare reimbursement to empirically test if SNFs respond to payment differences between RUG categories. The results are highly suggestive that SNFs upcode patients by providing additional therapy minutes to increase revenue, whereas we find no evidence of upcoding related to patient functionality scores. Simulating how different payment differentials affect RUG selection, we predict that reducing the financial incentive to upcode could result in significant savings to Medicare.

If Pareto is replaced by Gaussian, then one can consider fractional Brownian motion whose increments, called fractional Gaussian noise, exhibit long-range dependence. There are many extensions of that process in the infinite variance stable case. Log-fractional stable noise (log-FSN) is a particularly interesting one. It is a stationary mean-zero stable process with infinite variance, parametrized by a tail index alpha between 1 and 2, and hence with heavy tails. The lower the value of alpha, the heavier the tail of the marginal distributions. The fact that alpha is less than 2 renders the variance infinite. Thus dependence between past and future cannot be measured using the correlation. There are other dependence measures that one can use, for instance the codifference or the covariation. Since log-FSN is a moving average and hence mixing, these dependence measures converge to zero as the lags between past and future become very large. The codifference, in particular, decreases to zero like a power function as the lag goes to infinity. Two parameters play an important role: (a) the value of the exponent, which depends on alpha and measures the speed of the decay; (b) a multiplicative constant of asymptoticity c which depends also on alpha. In this paper, it is shown that for symmetric alpha-stable log-FSN, the constant c is positive and that the rate of decay of the codifference is such that one has long-range dependence. It is also proved that the same conclusion holds for the second measure of dependence, the covariation, which converges to zero with the same intensity and with a constant of asymptoticity which is positive as well.

Methods: The study sample was drawn from five cities in China: Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Chengdu, and Nanjing, using a quota sampling method. Utility values for a subset of 97 health states defined by the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system were directly elicited from the study sample using a modified Measurement and Valuation of Health protocol, with each respondent valuing 13 of the health states. The utility values for all 243 EQ-5D-3L health states were estimated on the basis of econometric models at both individual and aggregate levels. Various linear regression models using different model specifications were examined to determine the best model using predefined model selection criteria. Results: The N3 model based on ordinary least square regression at the aggregate level yielded the best model fit, with a mean absolute error of 0.020, 7 and 0 states for which prediction errors were greater than 0.05 and 0.10, respectively, in absolute magnitude. This model passed tests for model misspecification (F = 2.7; P = 0.0509, Ramsey Regression Equation Specification Error Test), heteroskedasticity (chi(2) = 0.97; P = 0.3254, Breusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg test), and normality of the residuals (chi(2) = 1.285; P = 0.5259, Jarque-Bera test). The range of the predicted values (-0.149 to 0.887) was similar to those estimated in other countries. Conclusions: The study successfully developed Chinese utility values for EQ-5D-3L health states using the time trade-off method. It is the first attempt ever to develop a standardized instrument for quantifying quality-adjusted life-years in China.","[Liu, Gordon G.] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hongyan] Guiyang Med Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Management, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Li, Minghui] Univ S Carolina, South Carolina Coll Pharm, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Gao, Chen] Novo Nordisk China Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Luo, Nan] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore 117597, Singapore",Peking University; Guizhou Medical University; Medical University of South Carolina; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Novo Nordisk; National University of Singapore,"Luo, N (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, 16 Med Dr,Block MD3, Singapore 117597, Singapore.",nan_luo@nuhs.edu.sg,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273015]; Guangzhou (China) Pharmaceuticals Corporation,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangzhou (China) Pharmaceuticals Corporation,The research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no.71273015) and a research grant from Guangzhou (China) Pharmaceuticals Corporation.,,28,228,275,18,125,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2014,17.0,5.0,,,,,597,604,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.05.007,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1PE,25128053.0,hybrid,Y,N,2024-03-09,WOS:000341084700014,0

Our analysis begins with a standard welfare economic model of healthcare resource allocation. We show how - under the assumption that the healthcare projects under consideration have a small impact on individual health - the problem can be reformulated as one of finding a particular subset of the class of efficient solutions to an implied multicriteria optimisation problem. Algorithms for finding such solutions are readily available, and we demonstrate our approach through a worked example of treatment for clinical depression. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We propose an estimation procedure based on the importance sampling technique. In particular, a sequence of conditional importance densities is derived which integrates out all random effects from the joint distribution of endogenous variables. We disentangle the integration over both the cross-section and the time series dimensions. The estimation method facilitates the modeling of large panels in both dimensions. We evaluate the method in an extended Monte Carlo study for dynamic panel data models with observations from different non-Gaussian distributions. We finally present three empirical illustrations for (i) union choice of young males using a Binary panel, (ii) crime rates of families using a Binomial panel and (iii) economic growth modeling using a Student's t panel.

J,"Can, B",,,,"Can, Burak",,,Weighted distances between preferences,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Strict preferences; Rankings; Kemeny distance; Ideological distance,,"Individual disagreements are assumed to be reflected in the preferences. Distance functions, e.g., the well-known Kemeny (1959) metric, are used to measure these disagreements. However, a disagreement on how to rank the top two alternatives may be perceived more (or less) than a disagreement on how to rank the bottom two alternatives. We propose two conditions on functions which characterize a class of weighted semi-metric functions. This class of semi-metrics allows to quantify disagreements according to where they occur in preferences. It turns out one of these functions, the path minimizing function, is the only metric which generalizes the Kemeny metric. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This need to make assumptions, the complexity of the resulting framework, the technical knowledge required, as well as funding by interested parties have led many decision makers to distrust the results of models. To assist stakeholders reviewing a model's report, questions pertaining to the credibility of a model were developed. Because credibility is insufficient, questions regarding relevance of the model results were also created. The questions are formulated such that they are readily answered and they are supplemented by helper questions that provide additional detail. Some responses indicate strongly that a model should not be used for decision making these trigger a fatal flaw indicator. It is hoped that the use of this questionnaire, along with the three others in the series, will help disseminate what to look for in comparative effectiveness evidence, improve practices by researchers supplying these data, and ultimately facilitate their use by health care decision makers.","[Caro, J.

Simon's version is satisficing. Another, attributable to Luce, is maximization to within a threshold of discrimination. Framed as conditions on a choice function, each with weak and strong variants, the two versions of bounded rationality have been shown to be equivalent, weak variant to weak variant, strong to strong. A finding of this paper is that, unlike classical rationality, bounded rationality does not depend on (or vary in strength with) the ordering properties of the underlying preference relation. Weak bounded rationality has been shown to be equivalent to a simple relaxation of Chernoffs Axiom, got by changing every x epsilon C(X) to some x epsilon C(X). Another finding of this paper is that exactly the same change turns the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference into an equivalent of strong bounded rationality.

Separately evaluating the likelihood contribution of each subgame-perfect equilibrium that generates the observed outcome allows the use of the GHK simulator, a widely used importance-sampling probit simulator.

Methods: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study using data from Clinical Research Practice Data link was conducted. Adults with incident prescription of an AD (index date) between January 1, 2006, and June 30, 2010, and with a diagnosis of GAD within the 2 months preceding or following the index date were included. Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were excluded. Results: A total of 29,131 patients with GAD were included in the analysis. Their mean age was 48.5 +/- 15.5 years, and two thirds were women. GAD-licensed ADs (i.e., escitalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine XR, and duloxetine) represented only 12.5% of the index All prescriptions. At least one anxiolytic was prescribed for 23.5% of the patients. Only 33.2% of the patients continued index AD treatment over the study period. Discontinuation occurred for 46.0% of the patients, after a mean of 3.7 months of treatment The health care costs were 338.4 per patient in the 6 months before the index date and 984.6 in the 9 months after the index date. Psychiatric hospitalization (relative risk = 4.18; 95% Cl 3.53-4.96; P < 0.001) and duloxetine as index treatment (relative risk = 1.85; 95% Cl 1.30-2.63; P < 0.001) were the main determinants of increased costs for these patients. Conclusions: The significant rate of AD discontinuation and associated treatment duration indicate unmet needs among patients with GAD.

Recent developments in the count data literature make it possible to relax commonly imposed assumptions of these models. On the basis of these findings, two extensions of hurdle models that make popular specifications more flexible are developed. Both extensions nest the models that have been used so far, so they can be tested by appropriate parametric restrictions. An example from health economics illustrates the relevance of both model extensions.

Moreover, we show that our epistemic conditions do not require nor imply mutual belief of rationality.

We test this prediction in the context of the market for private health insurance in Australia. Despite a universal public system that provides comprehensive coverage for inpatient and outpatient care, roughly half of the adult population also carries private health insurance, the main benefit of which is more timely access to elective hospital treatment. Like several studies on different types of insurance in other countries, we find no support for the positive correlation hypothesis. Because strict underwriting regulations create strong information asymmetries, this result suggests the importance of multi-dimensional private information. Additional analyses suggest that the advantageous selection observed in this market is driven by the effect of risk aversion, the ability to make complex financial decisions and income.

Several studies suggest that PI laws curb risky sexual behavior because teens realize that they would be compelled to discuss a subsequent pregnancy with a parent. We show that prior evidence based on gonorrhea rates overlooked the frequent under-reporting of gonorrhea by race and ethnicity, and present new evidence on the effects of PI laws using more current data on the prevalence of gonorrhea and data that are novel to this literature (i.e., chlamydia rates and data disaggregated by year of age). We improve the credibility of our estimates over those in the existing literature using an event-study design in addition to standard difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) models. Our findings consistently suggest no association between PI laws and rates of sexually transmitted infections or measures of sexual behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: The purpose of the current task force report is to recommend good practices for pediatric PRO research that is conducted to inform regulatory decision making and support claims made in medical product labeling. The recommendations are based on the consensus of an interdisciplinary group of researchers who were assembled for a task force associated with the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR). In those areas in which supporting evidence is limited or in which general principles may not apply to every situation, this task force report identifies factors to consider when making decisions about the design and use of pediatric PRO instruments, while highlighting issues that require further research. Good Research Practices: Five good research practices are discussed: 1) Consider developmental differences and determine age-based criteria for PRO administration: Four age groups are discussed on the basis of previous research (<5 years old, 5-7 years, 8-11 years, and 12-18 years). These age groups are recommended as a starting point when making decisions, but they will not fit all PRO instruments or the developmental stage of every child. Specific age ranges should be determined individually for each population and PRO instrument. 2) Establish content validity of pediatric PRO instruments: This section discusses the advantages of using children as content experts, as well as strategies for concept elicitation and cognitive interviews with children. 3) Determine whether an informant-reported outcome instrument is necessary: The distinction between two types of informant-reported measures (proxy vs. observational) is discussed, and recommendations are provided. 4) Ensure that the instrument is designed and formatted appropriately for the target age group. Factors to consider include health-related vocabulary, reading level, response scales, recall period, length of instrument, pictorial representations, formatting details, administration approaches, and electronic data collection (ePRO). 5) Consider cross-cultural issues. Conclusions: Additional research is needed to provide methodological guidance for future studies, especially for studies involving young children and parents' observational reports. As PRO data are increasingly used to support pediatric labeling claims, there will be more information regarding the standards by which these instruments will be judged. The use of PRO instruments in clinical trials and regulatory submissions will help ensure that children's experience of disease and treatment are accurately represented and considered in regulatory decisions.","[Matza, Louis S.] United BioSource Corp, Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Patrick, Donald L.] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Riley, Anne W.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Alexander, John J.] US FDA, Div Antiinfect Prod, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Rajmil, Luis] IMIM Hosp del Mar, Med Res Inst, Barcelona, Spain; [Rajmil, Luis] Catalan Agcy Hlth Informat Assessment & Qual, Barcelona, Spain; [Pleil, Andreas M.] Pfizer Inc, Pfizer Global Pharmaceut, San Diego, CA USA; [Bullinger, Monika] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Med Psychol, Hamburg, Germany",United Biosource Corporation; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Hospital del Mar; Pfizer; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf,"Matza, LS (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",louis.matza@unitedbiosource.com,"Alexander, John D/E-2220-2014; Alexander, John/GVS-7271-2022; Patrick, Donald/Y-2460-2019","Patrick, Donald/0000-0003-0756-0492; Rajmil, Luis/0000-0002-6625-0649",,,,,146,293,304,2,39,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16.0,4.0,,,,,461,479,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.04.004,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796280.0,hybrid,Y,N,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900005,0

While women live longer than men, elderly women incur higher out-of-pocket medical spending than men at each age. In this paper, we examine whether differences in marital status and living arrangements can explain this difference. We find that out-of-pocket medical spending is approximately 24 percent higher when an individual becomes widowed, a large portion of which is spending on nursing homes. Our results suggest a substantial role of living arrangements in out-of-pocket medical spending. Our estimates combined with differences in rates of widowhood across gender suggest that marital status can explain about one third of the gender difference in total out-of-pocket medical spending, leaving a large portion unexplained. On the other hand, gender differences in widowhood more than explain the observed gender difference in out-of-pocket spending on nursing homes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate both analytically and by means of Monte Carlo simulations the properties of the QML estimators for rho. The RE(Q)MLE for rho is asymptotically at least as robust to individual heterogeneity and, when the data are i.i.d. and normal, at least as efficient as the FE(Q)MLE for rho. Furthermore, the QML estimators for rho only suffer from a 'weak moment conditions' problem when rho is close to one if the cross-sectional average of the variances of the errors is (almost) constant over time, e.g. under time-series homoskedasticity. However, in this case the QML estimators for rho are still consistent when rho is local to or equal to one although they converge to a non-normal possibly asymmetric distribution at a rate that is lower than N-1/2 but at least N-1/4. Finally, we study the finite sample properties of two types of estimators for the standard errors of the QML estimators for rho, and the bounds of QML based confidence intervals for rho.

Recent medical advancements have improved survival but have also increased costs. Our lack of understanding on the relationship between disease severity and lifetime health care costs is a major impediment to the timely economic assessment of new treatments. Methods: Using data from three waves of the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Australia Data Registry, we estimate the annual costs of CF care by age and health state. We define health states on the basis of annual lung-function scores and patient's organ transplant status. We exploit the longitudinal nature of the data to model disease progression, and we use this to estimate lifetime health care costs. Results: The mean annual health care cost for treating CF is US $15,571. Costs for patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease are US $10,151, US $25,647, and US $33,691, respectively. Lifetime health care costs are approximately US $306,332 (3.5% discount rate). The majority of costs are accounted for by hospital inpatients (58%), followed by pharmaceuticals (29%), medical services (10%), complications (2%), and diagnostic tests (1%). Conclusions: Our study is the first of its kind using the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Data Registry, and demonstrates the utility of longitudinal registry data for the purpose of economic analysis. Our results can be used as an input to future economic evaluations by providing analysts with a better understanding of the long-term cost impact when new treatments are developed.","[van Gool, Kees; Norman, Richard; Hall, Jane] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Delatycki, Martin B.] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Bruce Lefroy Ctr Genet Hlth Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Massie, John] Royal Childrens Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; Murdoch Children's Research Institute; Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne,"van Gool, K (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",kees.vangool@chere.uts.edu.au,"Norman, Richard P/B-4290-2009; Hall, Jane P/I-3469-2014; Delatycki, Martin B/A-5409-2013; van Gool, Kees/JXW-8446-2024","van Gool, Kees/0000-0002-1424-9304; Norman, Richard/0000-0002-3112-3893; Hall, Jane/0000-0002-2191-0543",Australian Cystic Fibrosis Research Trust; National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research Capacity Building Grant [571926],Australian Cystic Fibrosis Research Trust; National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research Capacity Building Grant,Funding was provided by a research grant from Australian Cystic Fibrosis Research Trust and a National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research Capacity Building Grant (grant no. 571926).2.96,,33,63,76,0,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2013,16.0,2.0,,,,,345,355,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.12.003,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,144AC,23538187.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318910400015,0

We identify a class of two-way communication mechanisms which mirror those considered in the single principal analysis of Myerson (1982). In such mechanisms, every agent truthfully reveals her type to all principals, and obeys the private recommendations she receives from each of them. We show that there is a rationale in restricting attention to this class of mechanisms: if principals use these mechanisms, there is no unilateral incentive to deviate towards more sophisticated ones. We develop three examples to analyze possible extensions and limits of our approach. The first two examples show that the restriction to direct and incentive compatible mechanisms is not sufficient to provide a complete characterization of all pure strategy equilibria. The third one shows that private recommendations play a fundamental role in competing mechanism games, suggesting that one cannot safely restrict to one-sided communication mechanisms.

We first consider a decision-maker facing prospects which cost c(a) and with distributions of returns y that depend on a. The decision problem is shown to be concave if the primitive of the cdf of returns is jointly convex in a and y, a condition we call Concavity of the Cumulative Quantile (CCQ) and which is satisfied by many common distributions. Next we apply CCQ to the distribution of outcomes (or their likelihood-ratio transforms) in the principal-agent problem and derive restrictions on the utility function that validate the first-order approach. We also discuss another condition, log-convexity of the distribution, and show that it allows binding limited liability constraints, which CCQ does not. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Observations are divided by pairwise groups and bivariate normal distributions are specified within each group. Partial maximum likelihood estimators are introduced and they are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal under some regularity conditions. Consistent covariance matrix estimators are also provided. Estimates of average partial effects can also be obtained once we characterize the conditional distribution of the latent error. Finally, a simulation study shows the advantages of our new estimation procedure in this setting. Our proposed partial maximum likelihood estimators are shown to be more efficient than the generalized method of moments counterparts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our estimates from the 1996 and 2001 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) show that the mean (median) duration of employment spells for the same direct care employer is only 9.7 (5.0) months. We find that fewer than one-third of direct care workers leave a job to take another job in the direct care field. There is also little indication of upward mobility in the health sector; direct care workers are approximately equally likely to transition to working as Registered Nurses as they are to working in household service jobs. Additionally, the rate at which spells end in work-limiting disability (5.4%) is very high compared with rates in similar occupations. We estimate duration models of direct care job spell length and find that, after correcting for the endogenous relationship between wages and tenure, wages appear to have a modest effect in preventing turnover; this effect is concentrated among the shortest spells.

Recent Canadian research by Cremieux et al. concludes that there is a strong statistical relationship between pharmaceutical spending and health outcomes (Health Econ. 2005a; 14: 117, Health Econ. 2005b; 14(2): 107116). This paper takes a second look at pharmaceutical spending as determinants of health outcomes in Canada. In doing so, it examines the robustness of the findings of Cremieux et al. by considering the appropriateness of the data used and statistical approach utilized. Particular attention is given to the potential for non-stationarity and spurious regression, issues related to unit heterogeneity and the choice of estimators. In contrast with earlier findings, on the whole, no discernable relationship between spending on private or public pharmaceutical products and infant mortality or life expectancy at 65 is observed.

This letter illustrates the derivation of population norms for the SF-6D in the United Kingdom. It uses a sample of 22,166 respondents from the 2010 wave of the study Understanding Society. Understanding Society is a national representative sample of British citizens. The survey of this study contains the SF-12. It is possible to derive health state utilities from the SF-12 (and from the SF-36) using a relatively new instrument, the SF-6D. The SF-12 and the SF-36 belong to the most widely used generic health-related quality of life measures. Mean SF-6D utility scores for males and females are 0.81 and 0.79, respectively. Especially the older age categories have lower utility scores. The younger age categories have slightly higher utility scores. From a list of 17 conditions, people with congestive heart failure had the lowest (0.60) and people with diabetes the highest (0.76) SF-6D scores. This letter encourages the health economics research community to derive SF-6D population norms to inform policy.

An individual in the population either supports the insurgents or the government depending upon his attitude and the actions taken by each side. We focus on the effect of insurgency actions: benefits, impositions, and coercion. While benefits and impositions are applied uniformly throughout, the insurgents intend to only coerce those actively providing information to the government. However, due to the fog of war, which may lead to limited situational awareness, the insurgents may mistakenly coerce their own supporters and potentially drive them to aid the government. We examine how popular behavior varies under different situational awareness scenarios. When the insurgents have little situational awareness, they should take few coercive actions. This implies that the government will be able to foster intelligence sources within the population. If the insurgents have perfect situational awareness, tipping points may occur that result in a significant reduction in active support for the government. In this case the government should take actions to decrease the coercing effectiveness of the insurgents and increase incentives to the population so they continue to provide information.

Following Becker and Mulligan (1997), we assume that the household's subjective discount rate decreases with its investment for patience. Furthermore, we extend the baseline setting by positing that the subjective discount rate depends on the average level of investment for patience in the economy (investment externalities) as well. Under these assumptions and the specification of each function, we show that equilibrium indeterminacy does not arise if investment externalities do not exist, while it can be observed in the presence of investment externalities.

It uses a behavioural model to estimate the impact on preventive care utilization outcomes for children younger than 3 years. It validates the model with the results of the experiment and then simulates two alternate policy scenarios.

Using Florida outpatient discharge data, we study the effect of OPPS on hospital outpatient volume. We find that on average Medicare rate cuts either decreased or had no significant effect on Medicare volume, but increased private fee-for-service (FFS) volume. We also find that responses vary with the hospital's exposure to Medicare payment changes, where exposure is measured as the baseline Medicare patient share. Compared to less exposed hospitals, highly exposed hospitals responded with larger increases in private FFS volume and with smaller decreases (in some cases, even increases) in Medicare volume when payment rates fell.

Conceptualizing a decision problem in terms of a set of (health) states and transitions among these states, state-transition modeling is one of the most widespread modeling techniques in clinical decision analysis, health technology assessment, and health-economic evaluation. State-transition models have been used in many different populations and diseases, and their applications range from personalized health care strategies to public health programs. Most frequently, state-transition models are used in the evaluation of risk factor interventions, screening, diagnostic procedures, treatment strategies, and disease management programs. The goal of this article was to provide consensus-based guidelines for the application of state-transition models in the context of health care. We structured the best practice recommendations in the following sections: choice of model type (cohort vs. individual-level model), model structure, model parameters, analysis, reporting, and communication. In each of these sections, we give a brief description, address the issues that are of particular relevance to the application of state-transition models, give specific examples from the literature, and provide best practice recommendations for state-transition modeling. These recommendations are directed both to modelers and to users of modeling results such as clinicians, clinical guideline developers, manufacturers, or policymakers.","[Siebert, Uwe] UMIT Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth & Hlth Technol Assessment, Eduard Wallnoefer Ctr 1, A-6060 Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Siebert, Uwe; Jahn, Beate] Oncotyrol Ctr Personalized Canc Med, Innsbruck, Austria; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Alagoz, Oguzhan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI USA; [Alagoz, Oguzhan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Bayoumi, Ahmed M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bayoumi, Ahmed M.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bayoumi, Ahmed M.] St Michaels Hosp, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada; [Owens, Douglas K.] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cohen, David J.] Univ Missouri, Kansas City Sch Med, St Lukes Mid Amer Heart Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Kuntz, Karen M.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN USA","UMIT - Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics & Technology GmbH; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Methods: The research reported in this article involved a case study of the Jordan Rational Drug List. Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews with decision makers and analysis of secondary documentary sources. The case study was supplemented by additional interviews with a small number of Jordanian academics involved in the production of economic evaluation. Results: The research found that there was no formal requirement for cost-effectiveness information submitted as part of the decision-making process for the inclusion of new technologies on the Jordan Rational Drug List. Both decision makers and academics suggested that economic evidence was not influential in formulary decisions. This is unusual for national formulary bodies. The study identified a number of barriers that prevent substantive and routine use of economic evaluation. While some of these echo findings of previous studies, others-notably the extent to which the sectional interests of clinical groups and commercial (pharmaceutical) industry exert undue influence over decision making-more obviously result from the specific Jordanian context. Conclusions: Economic evaluation was not found to be influential in the Jordan Rational Drug List. Recommendations for improvement include enhancing capacity in relation to generating, accessing, and/or applying health economic analysis to priority setting decisions. There is a further need to incentivize the use of economic evaluation, and this requires that organizational and structural impediments be removed.","[Lafi, Rania; Robinson, Suzanne; Williams, Iestyn] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Serv Management Ctr, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Lafi, R (通讯作者)，POB 1904, Amman 11910, Jordan.",rania.lafi@gmail.com,"Embrett, Mark G./H-4466-2014; Williams, Iestyn/AAH-6405-2021; Robinson, Suzanne/B-6604-2013","Embrett, Mark G./0000-0002-3969-0219; Williams, Iestyn/0000-0002-9462-9488; Robinson, Suzanne/0000-0001-5703-6475",,,,,36,8,8,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15.0,5.0,,,,,771,776,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.04.006,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867788.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100022,0

The main objective of this study was to compare and contrast the application of adult and adolescent scoring algorithms for the CHU-9D and AQOL-6D in valuing the health of a community-based sample of adolescents. Methods: A Web-based survey including the CHU-9D and the AQOL-6D was developed for administration to adolescents, aged 11 to 17 years, residing in Australia (n - 500). Individual responses to both instruments were converted to values by using first the adult and second the adolescent scoring algorithms pertaining to each instrument. Results: Both the AQOL-6D and the CHU-9D discriminated well according to health status and the presence of long-standing illness regardless of the scoring algorithm. Within each instrument, however, important discrepancies were found in that employment of the adolescent algorithm was found to result in consistently lower mean health state values for the CHU-9D but consistently higher mean health state values for the AQOL-6D relative to the employment of their respective adult algorithms and these differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The differences in adolescent and adult values for identical health states are more profound for the CHU-9D and ultimately may be significant enough to have an impact on health care policy. It is important to note that there are important differences between the CHU-9D instrument and the AQOL-6D instrument that may also have a significant impact on the valuations obtained.","[Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Repatriat Gen Hosp, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Stevens, Katherine; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Flynn, Terry] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Study Choice, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Sawyer, Michael G.] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Paediat, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; University of Sheffield; University of Technology Sydney; University of Adelaide,"Ratcliffe, J (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Repatriat Gen Hosp, A Block Level 1,Daws Rd, Daw Pk, SA 5041, Australia.",julie.ratcliffe@flinders.edu.au,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017; Stevens, Katherine/E-4679-2010","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988; Stevens, Katherine/0000-0002-9018-6413",Flinders University; Australian NHMRC [1021899],Flinders University; Australian NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),This study was supported by a Flinders University seeding grant and an Australian NHMRC Project Grant 1021899 entitled 'Adolescent values for the economic evaluation of adolescent health care treatment and preventive programs.',,35,44,45,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15.0,5.0,,,,,730,736,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.04.005,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867783.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100017,0

In other setups, we estimate rather an input (or cost) frontier, the minimal level of the input (cost) attainable for a given set of outputs (goods or services produced). In both cases the problem can be viewed as estimating a surface under shape constraints (monotonicity,...). In this paper we derive the theory of an estimator of the frontier having an asymptotic normal distribution. It is based on the order-m partial frontier where we let the order m to converge to infinity when n -> infinity but at a slow rate. The final estimator is then corrected for its inherent bias. We thus can view our estimator as a regularized frontier. In addition, the estimator is more robust to extreme values and outliers than the usual nonparametric frontier estimators, like FDH and than the unregularized order-m estimator of Cazals et al. (2002) converging to the frontier with a Weibull distribution if m(n) -> infinity fast enough when n -> infinity. The performances of our estimators are evaluated in finite samples and compared to other estimators through some Monte-Carlo experiments, showing a better behavior (in terms of robustness, bias, MSE and achieved coverage of the resulting confidence intervals). The practical implementation and the robustness properties are illustrated through simulated data sets but also with a real data set. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we study how to tell apart large shifts in equilibrium prices from noise using high frequency data. We propose a new nonparametric test which allows us to asymptotically remove the noise from observable price data and to discover jumps in fundamental asset values. We provide its asymptotic distribution to decide when such jumps occur. In finite samples, our test offers reasonable power for distinguishing between noise and jumps. Empirical evidence indicates that it is necessary to incorporate the presence of jumps in equilibrium prices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While many payers are prepared to pay high prices if they represent good value for money, they first need to feel assured that the value for money estimates are robust. Insofar as new medicines enter the market with limited and uncertain data relating to their performance in normal clinical practice, the value for money case for some medicines may well be driven largely by assumptions than by empirical evidence. The concern to manufacturers is that payers respond to this uncertainty by listing the product at a lower price (which may not satisfy the producer) or not listing the product until more evidence is available (which may not satisfy clinicians and patients). Is there a solution that will satisfy all key stakeholders? Will clinicians and patients continue to have timely access to new medicines and will payers have sustainable reimbursement systems? Will the industry continue to be rewarded with high prices for new medicines so long as they represent good value for money? In 2011, the Australian Government introduced a managed entry scheme whereby the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will recommend the listing of a new medicine at a price justified by the existing evidence, pending the availability of more conclusive evidence of cost-effectiveness to support its continued listing at a higher price. This commentary examines the Australian Government's managed entry scheme and issues that are likely to arise from its implementation.","[Sullivan, Sean D.] Univ Washington, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Wonder, M (通讯作者)，POB 470, Cronulla, NSW 2230, Australia.",mwonder@optusnet.com.au,,,,,,,17,16,17,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2012,15.0,3.0,,,,,586,590,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.004,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,941CN,22583471.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303940600024,0

Methods: A systematic review was performed by using the MEDLINE database and reference lists from previous reviews. On the basis of predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, we identified relevant studies published since January 2006. Articles included for the review were assessed for their methodological quality and results. Results: The literature search resulted in 24 analyses, 14 of them using a fixed-threshold approach and 10 using a variable-threshold approach. On average, 70% of the criteria for methodological quality were fulfilled, but almost half of the analyses did not include medication adherence in the base case. The results of variable-threshold strategies were more homogeneous and showed more favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared with those based on a fixed threshold with bone mineral density. For analyses with fixed thresholds, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied from (sic)80,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in women aged 55 years to cost saving in women aged 80 years. For analyses with variable thresholds, the range was (sic)47,000 to cost savings. Conclusions: Risk assessment using variable thresholds appears to be more cost-effective than selecting high-risk individuals by fixed thresholds. Although the overall quality of the studies was fairly good, future economic analyses should further improve their methods, particularly in terms of including more fracture types, incorporating medication adherence, and including or discussing unrelated costs during added life-years.","[Mueller, Dirk; Pulm, Jannis] Univ Cologne, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Gandjour, Afschin] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Dept Management, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Cologne; Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Mueller, D (通讯作者)，Gleueler St 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",dirk.mueller@uk-koeln.de,"Gandjour, Afschin/I-8963-2019",,,,,,83,18,19,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2012,15.0,2.0,,,,,284,298,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.030,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,914DZ,22433760.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301930600010,0

Methods: The protocol-led literature review included database searching (e. g., Medline, ISI Science Citation Index) and manual searching to retrieve studies focused on measures of HRQOL, health status, or well-being addressed to children and adolescents. Country-specific filters were applied to identify studies carried out in the participating countries. The characteristics of the instruments and type of studies were analyzed. Descriptive characteristics and psychometric properties were analyzed following the guidelines of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medical Outcomes Trust. Results: Ninety-nine documents were included. Thirty-one questionnaires were identified, 24 instruments were adapted, and the psychometric properties of 20 HRQOL instruments were reported in the study period. There was substantial variability in the number and character- istics of the dimensions included. Reliability was generally acceptable, and the majority of instruments provided data on internal consistency (n = 18) and, to a lesser extent, on test-retest reliability (n = 12). Nearly all studies reported construct validity, but only four analyzed sensitivity to change. Conclusions: There is a scarcity of instruments to measure HRQOL of children and adolescents in the countries analyzed. Certain psychometric characteristics have been reasonably well tested, but others, most notably sensitivity to change, have not been tested in most instruments. Extension of this study to other Latin American countries would help to further identify gaps in this area and promote the use of HRQOL measurement in children and adolescents in Spanish-speaking cultures.","[Rajmil, Luis] Hosp Mar, IMIM Inst Recerca, Hlth Serv Res Unit, URSS, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Rajmil, Luis] Catalan Agcy Hlth Informat Assessment & Qual, Barcelona, Spain; [Rajmil, Luis] CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ, Madrid, Spain; [Roizen, Mariana] Hosp Garrahan, Comm Qual Life Bone Marrow Transplant, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Urzua, Alfonso] Univ Catolica Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; [Hidalgo-Rasmussen, Carlos] Univ Guadalajara, S Univ Ctr CUsur, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico; [Fernandez, Gabriela; Dapueto, Juan Jose] Univ Republica, Fac Med, Dept Psicol Med, Montevideo, Uruguay","Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Hospital del Mar; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; University of Buenos Aires; Hospital de Pediatria Doctor Juan Garrahan; Universidad Catolica del Norte; Universidad de Guadalajara; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Rajmil, L (通讯作者)，Hosp Mar, IMIM Inst Recerca, Hlth Serv Res Unit, URSS, Parc Salut Mar,Barcelona Biomed Res Pk,Off 138-03, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",lrajmil@imim.es,"de Guadalajara, Universidad/L-3565-2019; Alonso, Jordi/A-5514-2010; Urzúa, Alfonso/A-1208-2012","de Guadalajara, Universidad/0000-0002-5287-2076; Alonso, Jordi/0000-0001-8627-9636; Urzúa, Alfonso/0000-0002-0882-2194; Dapueto, Juan/0000-0002-0072-0636; Rajmil, Luis/0000-0002-6625-0649",,,,,112,31,36,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2012,15.0,2.0,,,,,312,322,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.028,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,914DZ,22433763.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301930600013,0

A secondary objective is to identify whether differences in seven modeling characteristics are related to differences in outcome of these cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed full economic evaluations of endocrine treatments of early breast cancer published in the English language between 2000 and December 2010. Information from these publications was abstracted regarding outcome, quality, and modeling methods. Results: We identified 20 economic evaluations comprising 5 different endocrine therapeutic strategies, which are all assessed more then once. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the reported outcomes varied widely for identical therapies. For anastrazole compared to tamoxifen, incremental life-years gained even ranged from 0.16 to 0.550 with an ICER ranging from (sic)3,958 to (sic)75,331. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained ranged from 0.092 to 0.378 with a cost per QALY gained varying from (sic)3,696 to (sic)120,265. These large differences in outcome were related to different modeling methods, with differences in time horizon and use of a carryover effect as most prominent causes. Conclusion: Despite similar comparators and logical differences due to transferability issues, the outcomes of the included studies varied widely. To increase comparability and transparency of pharmacoeconomic evaluations, standardization of modeling methods for different therapeutic groups/diseases and the availability of a detailed and complete description of the model used in the evaluation is advocated.

According to this need, a Drug Expenditure Rationalization Plan (DERP) was enacted in late 2006, and a reevaluation project to delist drugs started in 2007 as one part of the DERP. Method: This article follows the process of the delisting policy in Korea. It addresses the history of the policy implementation and its changes, content, and impact and suggests a more reasonable policy direction, thereby setting a helpful example for other countries. Results: After a pilot reevaluation and the subsequent evaluation of a hypertension drug, the DERP fell into arrears as regards its original time line mainly because of the difficulties in developing methodologies and the government's inexperience in managing a megascale reevaluation project. The confusion and conflicts during the evaluation became a major burden on the government and society. Finally, the government changed the framework of the delisting policy from reevaluation based on cost-effectiveness to across-the-board price reductions aiming at the quick attainment of financial savings and minimizing conflict between the government and stakeholders. Conclusions: The government should lead the project with a more consistent and sustainable assessment framework of cost-effectiveness as the tool for the rational allocation of health resources, providing strong leadership and political will and a far-sighted view rather than focusing on compromise with special interest groups. In addition, development of more practical and multidimensional evaluation methodology is needed.","[Lee, Hwayoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jinhyun] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Nursing, Res Inst Nursing Sci, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, J (通讯作者)，28 Yeongun Dong, Seoul 110744, South Korea.",jinhyun@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Jae Hyuk/W-5616-2018","Lee, Hwa-Young/0000-0003-2591-1436",,,,,22,3,4,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15.0,1.0,,,,,204,212,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.08.1738,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GU,22264990.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299318500025,0

If the reimbursement by the purchaser includes both a variable (per patient) and a lump-sum component, efficiency can be ensured both in the timing of adoption (dynamic) and the intensity of use of the technology (static). If the second instrument is unavailable, a trade-off may emerge between static and dynamic efficiency. In this context, we also discuss how the regulator could use control of the level of uncertainty faced by the provider as an instrument to mitigate the trade-off between static and dynamic efficiency. Finally, we calibrate the model to study a specific technology and estimate the cost of a regulatory failure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We obtained individual patient data on health status (EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire) and secondary cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, amputation, extracranial bleeding, and reinterventions) observed during 12 to 36 months of follow-up. Data originated from five completed clinical trials on revascularization in coronary heart disease (n = 2593) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD; n = 1379). We used linear mixed-effects modeling to estimate the acute impact of the initial secondary event and the health status before and after the event. Results: A total of 1595 patients had at least one secondary event. Loss of health status just before the event ranged from 0.36 utility score for amputation in women with PAD to zero for cerebrovascular accident in men with PAD. In patients with coronary heart disease, pre-event health status loss ranged from 0.34 for extracranial bleeding in women to 0.10 for myocardial infarction in women. The acute impact of secondary events ranged from minor deterioration for cerebrovascular accident (-0.03) to improvement after all other events, ranging from +0.01 for occlusion to +0.22 for amputation. Women had significantly lower pre-event scores than did men: -0.04 to -0.10 in coronary heart disease and -0.04 to -0.27 in PAD. Older patients had mostly large but insignificantly lower pre-event scores than did younger patients (range +0.04 to -0.67). Conclusions: Secondary events after revascularization in patients with cardiovascular disease are associated with health status loss before the event, while acute impact of the events was mostly small.","[van Stel, Henk F.; Buskens, Erik] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Julius Ctr Hlth Sci & Primary Care, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands; [Busschbach, Jan J.

The following research questions were formulated: how significant is compensatory grant for rural communes from the viewpoint of their income and current expenses, should its present beneficiaries receive funds from the viewpoint of their development level as a criterion for awarding grants, what financial effects might the modification of the list of beneficiaries cause. A division of communes into four groups in terms of the designated development level and four groups in terms of income level per resident was used for the analysis. The analysis of the basic taxable income ratio per capita in the period 2009-2011 demonstrates the presence of significant and permanent differences between individual Polish regions. The largest number of communes with high BTI ratio per capita occurs in western Poland. Based on the research it can be stated that compensatory grant significantly contributes to the balancing of current expenses with current income, in particular in communes in eastern Polish voivodeships. The self-financing ratios adjusted by grant are obtained mainly by communes with a high development level. The number of these communes was not affected by the financial effects of the 2008-2010 crisis. With the assumed division of communes into three groups with diverse granting level, it can be stated that grant liquidation for developed communes would concern merely 5.5% of the entire compensatory grant for rural communes in 2011. At the same time, it needs to be observed that this would mean disturbing the financial sustainability of certain communes. The greatest decrease in income per resident would be experienced by communes in the Lower Silesian, Masovian, Greater Poland and Silesian voivodeships. Based on the conducted research, it must be stated that accounting for the development level of communes while building a new funds redistribution model brings along the necessity to pay attention to ensuring budget stability in the communes which, as a result of grant restriction, might lose the self-financing capacity and face a current deficit.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ Sci, Komandorska St 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Olejniczak, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ Sci, Komandorska St 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",jaroslaw.olejniczak@ue.wroc.pl,"Olejniczak, Jarosław/F-7780-2014","Olejniczak, Jarosław/0000-0003-2028-8446",,,,,6,3,3,0,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6257-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,541,548,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6257-2013-68,0.0,,,8,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358519700069,0

The main goal of our paper is to present how changes in financial ratios can be utilized in models predicting corporate financial distress.

Cooperation between NGOs and public administrations and support provided to NGOs from public budgets takes place at the regional level as well. At the regional level, as at the national level, the relationship is usually conceptually grounded. However, what is the situation like at the municipal level? Is it necessary to formalize the relationship between public administration and NGOs at the municipal level? Do the motives for support provided to NGOs at the municipal level differ from those at higher levels of public administration? What forms does the support of NGOs take at the local level? These questions are answered in the paper through a representative survey, which was conducted in 2012 with respondents from the municipal offices in the Czech Republic, and through an analysis of secondary data sources. The research results show a high degree of cooperation between municipalities and NGOs, a high level of indirect support to NGOs at the municipal level, and concurrently a low level of formalization and a legal documentation confirming such relationships. Support to NGOs is implemented informally.","Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Prouzová, Z (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",Zuzana.Prouzova@econ.muni.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6257-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,557,562,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6257-2013-70,0.0,,,6,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358519700071,0

Using of DEA method in the form of efficiency and super efficiency model seems to be convenient because there is not only one factor evaluated, but a set of different factors that determine the level of regional competitiveness.

The objective of it was a flourishing life or the Good Life. In the paper it is argued that economy as one of the social institutions, should serve the society instead to control it by means of market. All institutions are humanly devised for human purposes, and each of them can't be outside human control, as it is practice in the case of current market economy.

Taking into account the local conditions in the provision of public services and the implementation of the decentralization processes in general allow more intensive consideration of citizen's needs. The paper examines the relationship between financial indicators representing the financial autonomy of local governments and the subjective perception of the quality of public services by citizens, with respect to the assumption that local governments with a higher proportion of expenditures covered by revenues from their own taxes exhibit more effective behaviour in the provision of public services. Using econometric modeling, the paper examines factors that satisfy the demand of citizens for quality public services. The results of the models suggest that the satisfaction with the quality of public services is increasing with the growing economic level of the municipality and with increasing spending on public services by local governments.","Tech Univ Kosice, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Fac Econ, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Cernáková, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",veronika.cernakova@tuke.sk,"Ďuricová, Veronika/AAB-5492-2020","Ďuricová, Veronika/0000-0003-2285-7550",,,,,15,3,3,0,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6257-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,436,443,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6257-2013-54,0.0,,,8,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358519700055,0

Because more timely information is required by policy makers, Eurostat has the intention of shortening the publication delay to 30 days. Due to the fact that the traditional approach to GDP estimates compilation in the Czech Republic does not allow to meet this requirement, it is necessary to develop a new methodology for such estimates. The paper focuses on the most important part of GDP, which is represented by gross value added in sectors of non-financial corporations and households. Results of short-term business statistics are available sufficiently timely and therefore they could serve as a proxy for gross value added. Monthly statistical surveys in industry, construction and selected branches of market services are used in the analysis. Methodological approach is based on the co-integration principles, which lead to the Error Correction Model. The goal of the paper is to present experimental flash estimates of gross value added for all quarters of 2013 and their comparison with subsequently released traditional estimates.","Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Siroky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",michal.siroky@czso.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCŁAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",,,978-83-7695-421-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,239,248,,,,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9JN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356491900026,0

The original method of evaluation is based on the selected factors representing key areas of SEQ (social, demographic, urban, infrastructure and environmental area). On this basis the MEC regions were divided into three groups: regions with progressive, standard and regressive SEQ. The NUTS 3 values were then obtained by aggregation of micro-regional values weighted by relevant population. It can be stated that territorial distribution of the SEQ values is characterized by relatively low level of differentiation and further a tendency to decreasing of these values towards to the borders of NUTS 3 regions has been also demonstrated. Overall, it can be concluded that poor SEQ reduces residential and investment attractiveness of the regions and hence long-term sustainability of their development.","Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Viturka, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41 a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",viturka@econ.muni.cz,,,,,,,21,12,12,0,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6257-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,65,71,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6257-2013-7,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358519700008,0

To show their role and importance in rural development we present theoretical and empirical approach to the rural third sector. The paper is based on a new economic theory of the third sector, the rurality theory. This theory was formulated by Vladislav Valentinov and assumes that the existence of the third sector is caused by the limitations of for-profit firms' ability to satisfy human needs. The argument to their limitations is characteristics of rural areas and the resulting rurality specific costs. Thus, the rurality theory's general hypothesis is that the rurality-specific transaction cost gives rise to the emergence of rural third sector organizations. There is some empirical evidence from different countries (e.g. USA and Belgium) either confirming or refuting the rural-urban distinction as a determinant of the third sector's role in rural development.

In particular, the identification of micro-regional centres not fulfilling their central functions (especially the working and further educational functions) was carried out. For experimental modelling of interactions was used the theoretical concept of marginal rate of mobility of production resources. Corresponding case study was focused on evaluation of the marginal rate of the mobility of workforce within the catchment area of regional capital town Brno, which has been defined by the municipalities included in the integrated transport system of the South Moravian region. These municipalities were divided to seven distance zones and consequently marginal mobility rate has been calculated according to expected potential revenue increase with assumption of job commuting to Brno.","[Viturka, Milan; Paril, Vilem] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Viturka, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41 a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",viturka@econ.muni.cz; vilem@mail.muni.cz,"Paril, Vilem/A-5681-2018; Pařil, Vilém/JKJ-2883-2023; Pařil, Vilém/AAT-6280-2021","Paril, Vilem/0000-0001-9623-1935; Pařil, Vilém/0000-0001-9623-1935;",,,,,10,3,3,0,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6257-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,102,108,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6257-2013-12,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358519700013,0

However, upon asking, many of the morning session students are actually working part-time. It is hypothesized that properly managed part-time jobs would have a positive effect for the students, in terms of job preparation and value adding experiences. In light of these issues, the current study shall seek to determine the key factors that students consider while looking for a part-time job. Furthermore, the study also seeks to determine the practical effects of having part-time job while still studying. A survey was developed and administered to 450 college students in a Technical and Vocational University in Taiwan. Statistical analysis shows that students' part-time job selection is much dependent on two key factors, namely: Job matches my future and Job is able to help my future career.

Such problems are connected to its location, realisation and operation of such facilities that might have important impact on both quality of life, landscape character and spatial relations within municipality. This contribution deals with socio-spatial aspects of renewable sources of energy with focus on anaerobic digestion plants and their acceptance by population on local level. This problem is discussed on example of the Czech Republic and is focused on factors that influence level of acceptance of this type of renewable sources of energy. As case study anaerobic digestion plant in Stonava municipality (Moravian-Silesian Region) was chosen where questionnaire survey with local population was carried out. Also parameters of Stonava anaerobic digestion plant are being analysed from the point view of its inputs, outputs, its use, planning process, incentives and operation of this facility. Attention has been primarily paid to consequences of coexistence of rural population and anaerobic digestion plant.","[Martinat, Stanislav; Melnikova, Veronika] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic; [Dvorak, Petr] Acad Sci CR, Dept Environm Geog, Inst Geon, Ostrava 70800, Czech Republic; [Klusacek, Petr] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Reg Dev & Publ Adm, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Brno 62800, Czech Republic; [Navratil, Josef] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Biol Disciplines, Fac Agr, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Van der Horst, Dan] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Silesian University Opava; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geonics of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Mendel University in Brno; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; University of Birmingham,"Martinát, S (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",martinat@opf.slu.cz; dvorak@geonika.cz; petr.klusacek@mendelu.cz; josefnav@gmail.com; d.vanderhorst@bham.ac.uk,"Dvořák, Petr/G-3423-2014; Navratil, Josef/D-3315-2009; van der Horst, Dan/AGN-5512-2022; Martinat, Stanislav/H-9974-2013; Dvořák, Petr/ACP-5325-2022; Klusacek, Petr/B-9253-2012","Dvořák, Petr/0000-0001-7966-9775; Navratil, Josef/0000-0002-4600-1012; Martinat, Stanislav/0000-0003-4060-2009; Dvořák, Petr/0000-0001-7966-9775; Klusacek, Petr/0000-0001-9391-1126",,,,,26,2,2,0,8,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6257-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,287,296,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6257-2013-35,0.0,,,10,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZJ,,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358519700036,0

The objective of this paper was to analyze selected determinants of the enterprises and to define approaches towards selected issues of their management. Delphi method, based on reaching consensus of experts from the theory and practice, was the key method used in the study. The analysis proved that the enterprises have usually a form of ltd. and they are mainly oriented on the municipal property management and commercial activities, not connected to the self-government competencies. Preferably this will change in the future. Municipalities usually own 100% of ltd. enterprises and this trend should be preserved. Almost one third of the enterprises reached a loss, what lead to the conclusion that these enterprises need to be either liquidated or transformed. Especially those enterprises oriented on self-government competencies pay a share on their profit to the municipal budgets, while the members of municipal council should adopt the decision about profit. 64% of enterprises are linked to the municipal budgets by the supplier relations, while prices for the provided services should be based on the real costs and, additionally, beneficial for both parts. Implementation of the approaches should lead to the more effective management of these enterprises.","[Bumbalova, Monika; Balazova, Eva] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Publ Adm, Fac European Studies & Reg Dev, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Bumbalová, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Publ Adm, Fac European Studies & Reg Dev, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",monika.bumbalova@uniag.sk; eva.balazova@uniag.sk,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6840-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,504,510,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6840-2014-64,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536900065,0

Fulfilling the aim of improving the quality of life of its inhabitants while securing sustainable development means to reach such development parameters of the local municipality that improve its competitiveness in respecting public interests of citizens and state. This status has its determinants: scope in endogenous development concepts (new public management, good governance, local economic development) and factors supporting its outcomes (limits and stimuli).

However, if we examine the evolution of mortality during the human life, we find out that the mortality throughout the human life is changing. But it is important to know that mortality of the oldest persons has a different character. Due to a smaller number of living persons at the highest age, mortality of these persons should be adjusted because of eliminating the systematic and random errors. We can use for it some of the available models which are used for the leveling of mortality curve at the highest ages. The aim of this paper is to analyze the differences in the life expectancy at the highest ages, which are obtained from the application of selected models.

The tendency of creative firms to concentrate in cities has been verified in numerous studies. However in recent years, controversial ideas have been emerging that rural areas also possess specific localisation factors, which create conditions for the development of creative clusters. Article examines whether there are such creative clusters in Slovakia and analyses their dynamic. A standard method of identifying spatial clusters of economic activities (location quotient) was used to identify potential creative clusters in rural areas, where methods of social network analysis were applied in a case study to analyse inner dynamic of the identified cluster. As we found, there are rural areas in which specific creative industries concentrate. The economic base of creative cluster being analysed in the aforementioned case study is comprised of music, visual and performing art industry and crafts industry, while publishing, video, film and photography and advertising constitute supporting industries in relation to the core creative industries in the creative cluster. Together they form a highly cohesive cluster along with other relevant institutions, which proved to be mainly local governments, non-profit organizations and associations and institutions of education.

A total of 682 or 92.78% were collected, wherein 628 are valid returns. Using the statistical analysis, descriptive statistics, Pearson's product-moment correlation, and multiple regressions are accomplished. Results show that overall students'involvement of college experiences is quite low; while, interaction between peers scored the highest. In addition, results also show that the overall college students' learning attainments are moderately high; while, intimate relationships scored the highest. Lastly, results show that there exists a positive correlation between college students' involvement of college experiences and learning attainments; while interaction between peers and service learning activities shows the strongest predictive factors.","[Lin, Mei-Chin] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Grad Sch Educ Leadership & Dev, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Ting, Cheng-Fen] Bur Educ, New Taipei City, Taiwan",Fu Jen Catholic University,"Lin, MC (通讯作者)，Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Grad Sch Educ Leadership & Dev, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",041463@mail.fju.edu.tw; ballfish26@hotmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,2,7,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2339-5125,,978-981-07-5945-2,ADV PUB ENV OCCUP H,,,2014,5.0,,,,,,35,40,,10.5729/apeoh.vol5.35,0.0,,,6,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Psychology; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC8LQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000355829600007,0

Attempts of constructing the composite indicators for the Czech economy have been based mostly on the OECD methodology. This approach compares the cyclical component of the individual time series with the cycle of the reference time series ( usually GDP or industrial production index) and selects only those with the strongest dependencies. The relationship evaluation should be based on the average lead or lag times between the turning points, cross correlations and number of extra and missing cycles. Usually only cross correlations are used in the Czech business cycle analyses as they are easy to compute. However, they should be used only in the combination with the other criteria. This paper describes the problem of dating the business cycle which enables track and the proper analysis of the turning points. The classic non-parametric algorithm is illustrated with dating selected economic indicators and the results are compared with a simplified method that uses only the cross correlations.","Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Vraná, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",lenka.vrana@vse.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCŁAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",,,978-83-7695-421-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,277,283,,,,,,7,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9JN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356491900030,0

There is a wide range of analyses of this phenomenon, especially of its rate and duration, from different points of view in economic or statistical literature. In this contribution the probability distribution of unemployment duration in the Czech Republic is analysed. The model of finite mixtures of probability distributions is used to model the distribution of unemployment duration and to describe (and quantify) differences of its distribution in subgroups of the unemployed given by factor explanatory variables gender (with two levels) and education (with three levels). The impact of the choice of component probability distributions on the estimates of survival and hazard functions and the estimates of population characteristics of location and variability based on quantiles is treated. Data from Labour Force Sample Survey performed quarterly by the Czech Statistical Office are used in order to find maximum likelihood estimates of component parameters in subpopulations and mixing proportions.

However, in last years this approach has been criticised because of the heavy tails of empirical data distributions which contradict the normality. The researchers have tried to overcome this problem creating models based on the so called jump-diffusion processes. Unfortunately, it has not helped either because the empirical data distributions, even after extraction of jumps, had significantly higher kurtosis than in the normal case. In this paper we consider the normality of the average net freight tics from the s.c. Shanghai indeces and from one of the leading shipping lines and we have found out that also in this instance the empirical distributions differ from the gaussian one. But they are usually virtually normal except for only few large outliers. Therefore we applied the so-called threshold method for the identification of outliers and decided to treat them as jumps. It turned out that for remaining data the normality had been confirmed by all basic statistical tests, where even in the worst case the p-value had exceeded 10%. Besides, the net freight tics were symetrical and centralized. This result opens the way for a proper application of gaussian models for the net freight behavior. Such models, similarly to the case of the financial market, could be used for predicting purposes and for the construction of hedging tools.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Inst Appl Math, Chair Stat, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Gardon, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Inst Appl Math, Chair Stat, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",Albert.Gardon@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCŁAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",,,978-83-7695-421-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,95,103,,,,,,9,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9JN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356491900010,0

Its goal is development of territory, the utilization of territorial market potential in order to improve the quality of life of local people, creation of sustainable living environment at the high qualitative level with the economic and social growth potential. The territorial development has been in the past influenced by several ideological streams and they have influenced the view on marketing of territories. Some approaches were based on the so called, neoclassical approach to the marketing strategies formation, which were based on the traditional marketing (by using of marketing mix of territory). However, there also exist new approaches to marketing of territories, which are focused on a supplier and his/her preferences, loyalty, and these approaches influence positively a territory in the long-term perspective. In the past, there existed opinions that marketing of territories is non-effective, but these ideas are overcome. This opinion is valid especially in the time of crisis, which could be economic crisis or other type of crisis (man made or inflicted). Our goal is to disconfirm this opinion and to point out at the necessity of territorial marketing especially during the period of economic stagnation or specific crisis in order to improve territorial competitiveness.

In this paper are defined theoretical results of research, specified methodological approach of using cluster analysis, in examining of regional differences and finding similar regions and common characteristics of these regions, which may serve as a basis for deciding for the most efficient allocation of financial resources for regional policy, not only of the EU. The objective of this paper is to identify on the basis of cluster analysis through selected macroeconomic variables of regional clusters of NUTS 2 regions, which are most similar to each other within the cluster, while the individual clusters from each other as much different. The output is a proposal for an alternative approach in the assessment of inter-regional disparities, which takes into account not only gross domestic product, but also other, important regional macroeconomic indicators, creating groups, clusters of regions with similar characteristics and therefore with similar problems and causes of their socio-economic backwardness. So identified clusters could be suitably selected objects of the instruments of regional policy of the EU. This could contribute to a higher efficiency of government intervention in this area and to accelerate convergence for the least developed regions of the EU average.","[Koziak, Radoslav; Suchy, Michal] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystr, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia; [Kascakova, Alena; Nedelova, Gabriela] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystr, Fac Econ, Dept Quant Methods & Informat Syst, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Koziak, R (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystr, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",radoslav.koziak@umb.sk; michal.suchy@umb.sk; alena.kascakova@umb.sk; gabriela.nedelova@umb.sk,"Kožiak, Radoslav/AAA-9190-2021","Kožiak, Radoslav/0000-0003-0888-7980",,,,,7,9,9,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-6840-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,37,44,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-6840-2014-3,0.0,,,8,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536900004,0
