Our results suggest that the limits to financial integration are less tight than the static picture of firm-bank relationships implies. Even though foreign banks are more likely to engage large and foreign-owned firms, after an acquisition, a bank is 20% less likely to terminate a relationship with a firm if the acquirer is foreign rather than domestic. Most importantly, within a credit market, firms appear to have the same access to financial loans and ability to invest whether they borrow from a foreign bank or not, while foreign banks benefit all firms by indirectly enhancing credit access.

To that end, we use time diary information from Spain, a country with a low level of women's participation in the labour market (Spanish Time Use Survey (STUS), 2002-2003). We find that self-employed mothers devote less time to market work, and more time to tertiary (e. g. sleeping, eating) and leisure activities, than employed mothers in a working day. We also find differences between employed and self-employed mothers in the timing of market work, child care and housework throughout the day, and we find complementarities between the timing of market work of working mothers and the timing of child care of their male partners. Our results on timing are consistent with the hypothesis that self-employment stands as a possible way for mothers to have greater control over the timing of work (flexible hours), and that they may therefore be able to work odd shifts, when the spouse is available to care for the children.","[Ignacio Gimenez-Nadal, Jose; Alberto Molina, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Fac Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Alberto Molina, Jose] Inst Study, Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Ortega, Raquel] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Business Adm, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Zaragoza,"Gimenez-Nadal, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Fac Econ, C Gran Via 2,3rd Floor, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",ngimenez@unizar.es,"Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/H-4276-2015; Molina, Jose Alberto/H-1676-2015; Ortega, Raquel/ADX-2812-2022","Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-1610-5451; Molina, Jose Alberto/0000-0002-9437-4606;",,,,,54,46,51,2,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The attention of this article is paid only to the business (wage) sphere (the subdivision MLSA). In terms of labour cost the average gross wage, the median of gross wage, the average hourly wage, median hourly wages, average hourly wages of men and women are analysed for individual regions. Furthermore, in both periods is observed proportion of workers with below average labour costs. Unemployment is analysed in this paper too.

This paper shows that the long-run market outcome is informationally efficient, as long as in every period there is a positive probability that entering traders are more conservative than their predecessors. Conservative traders are those who correctly predict the spot price with a positive probability, and more importantly, who in their mistakes err on the side of caution, and rarely overpredict the spot price as buyers, and underpredict the spot price as sellers. This result does not require entry of traders with better information than their predecessors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Our difference-in-differences estimates show that the reform was successful in improving labor-market participation and in increasing the earnings of lone mothers.

In 2011, some significant changes in development tendencies occurred: the price level growth revived, the public finance balance improved and the employment growth was observed after a longer period. The impacts of debt crisis and the pessimism connected with it were at the time not as negative as expected earlier.

For the policy makers it will be important, in addition to the stabilization and public finance consolidation, to restore the confidence of economic agents in the economy.","[Morvay, Karol; Okali, Ivan; Gabrielova, Herta; Hvozdikova, Veronika; Sikulova, Ivana; Frank, Karol; Jeck, Tomas] Ekon Ustav SAV, Bratislava 81105 1, Slovakia",Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Morvay, K (通讯作者)，Ekon Ustav SAV, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105 1, Slovakia.",karol.morvay@savba.sk; ivan.okali@savba.sk; herta.gabrielova@savba.sk; veronika.hvozdikova@savba.sk; ivana.sikulova@savba.sk; karol.frank@savba.sk; tomas.jeck@savba.sk,"Jeck, Tomas/AAG-4380-2019; Hvozdíková, Veronika/HOF-1935-2023; Frank, Karol/P-5074-2015","Jeck, Tomas/0000-0001-5030-9629; Hvozdíková, Veronika/0009-0005-8339-8556; Frank, Karol/0000-0001-6435-6258; Morvay, Karol/0000-0001-5790-9694",,,,,58,1,1,0,9,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Firms choose capacity followed by prices. If the benefits of capacity investment in a given sector are below a threshold level, the sector exhibits Bertrand behavior, otherwise it exhibits Cournot behavior. By endogenizing the threshold parameter in general equilibrium, we show how exogenous shocks such as globalization and technological change alter the mix of sectors between more and less competitive, or Bertrand and Cournot, and affect the relative wages of skilled and unskilled workers, even in a North-North model with identical countries.

We explore whether two of the personality factors put forward by Bowles et al. (2001) as likely to be incentive enhancing in the employer-employee relationship can explain the difference in wages for women and men. These are (1) personal self efficacy (Locus of Control (LoC)) and (2) time preference. We also study the role of the so called Big Five personality traits (extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, openness intellect and conscientiousness), which have been associated with earnings in several recent studies. Using a sample of Dutch employees, we found that 11.5% of the observed gender wage gap could be ascribed to differences in the personality trait scores (mainly in agreeableness and intellect), while less than 0.5% could be ascribed to gender differences in the returns to the traits. The addition of personality traits to a traditional human capital model reduces the unexplained part of the gender wage gap from 75.2% to 62.7%. We therefore conclude that these traits represent a valuable addition to the model.","[Pons, Empar] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ, Fac Econ, Valencia, Spain; [Nyhus, Ellen K.] Univ Agder, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Kristiansand, Norway",University of Valencia; University of Agder,"Pons, E (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Econ, Fac Econ, Valencia, Spain.",amparo.pons@uv.es,,"Nyhus, Ellen Katrine/0000-0002-0764-3274",,,,,62,41,50,1,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Unlucky graduates suffer persistent earnings declines lasting ten years. They start to work for lower paying employers, and then partly recover through a gradual process of mobility toward better firms. We document that more advantaged graduates suffer less from graduating in recessions because they switch to better firms quickly, while earnings of less advantaged graduates can be permanently affected by cyclical downgrading.","[Oreopoulos, Philip] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3G6, Canada; [von Wachter, Till] Natl Bur Econ Res, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [von Wachter, Till] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10025 USA; [von Wachter, Till] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Heisz, Andrew] STAT Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada",University of Toronto; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Statistics Canada,"Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, 150 St George St,Suite 311, Toronto, ON M5S 3G6, Canada.",philip.oreopoulos@utoronto.ca; vw2112@columbia.edu; Andrew.Heisz@statcan.gc.ca,,,,,,,72,431,549,3,96,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

This study addresses this issue by applying a structural decomposition analysis to input-output (I-O) data. We employ two extended I-O tables that distinguish processing trade from ordinary exports. The contribution of exports to the value-added growth from 2002 to 2007 is found to be overestimated by 32% when standard I-O tables are used rather than the extended I-O tables. Even more strikingly, the value-added growth that may be attributed to the exports of 'high-tech' telecommunication products is overestimated by no less than 63%. A serious overestimation of the contribution to income growth of certain products (such as high-tech products) sends out misleading signals to policymakers. When measured correctly, the true contribution appears to be substantially smaller than is generally believed to be.","[Pei, Jiansuo] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Oosterhaven, Jan; Dietzenbacher, Erik] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands",University of International Business & Economics; University of Groningen,"Pei, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jspei@amss.ac.cn,"Dietzenbacher, Erik/AAK-6681-2021; Oosterhaven, Jan/ABA-1136-2021","Pei, Jiansuo/0000-0003-4360-8705; Dietzenbacher, Erik/0000-0001-8874-4175",,,,,38,23,25,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The latter applies to the process of getting autonomy or even dominance of the financial sector over the real sector. Financialisation implies that financial markets and their establishment acquire a growing influence on economic policy and practical results. Alongside with the discussion on the meaning of financialisation, the paper offers considerations about its historical background and contemporary displays. Also, the financialisation in the context of state policy and its effects on the social welfare are analysed.

The transformation includes extensive consolidation, very rapid institutional and organizational change, and progressive modernization of the procurement system. In this article we examine the economics of these system-wide changes. We argue that the steps of conceptualizing and empirically researching this transformation-its patterns and trends, determinants, and impacts on farms and processing small and micro enterprises-are still in their infancy because of (a) remaining limitations on data suitable for formal modeling and hypothesis testing and (b) the sheer complexity of food system-related decisions that need to be modeled and understood.

Although developments in spatial econometrics have provided regional convergence studies with highly effective tools to explicitly consider spatial dependence and heterogeneity, there has as yet been no significant research on Japan's economic disparity using spatial econometrics. Moreover, most conventional regional convergence studies on Japan study the post-war high economic growth period before the economic bubble. Hence, the objective of this study is to analyze regional income disparities in Japan in the period after the bubble burst. We use the Bayesian spatial Durbin model, which can consider both spatial dependence and heterogeneity. The data used in this research are annual data collected at the municipality level during 1989-2007. To the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted to analyze Japan's regional income disparities at the municipality level, though some research has been done at the prefecture level. First, the study suggests that sigma-convergence does not hold whether or not spatial dependence is considered. Second, it analyzes regional income convergence by applying the simplified Bayesian spatial Durbin model to the beta-convergence approach. The results show that beta-convergence holds over 1990-2007.

In the model, a firm can choose between patenting and maintaining secrecy to protect a successful innovation. I consider a legal environment characterized by imperfect patent protection and no prior user rights. Thus, patenting grants probabilistic protection, and secrecy is effectively maintained until rivals innovate. I show that (1) firms that innovate early are more inclined to choose secrecy, whereas firms that innovate late have a stronger tendency to patent; (2) the incentives to patent increase with the innovation arrival rate; and (3) an increase in the number of firms may cause patenting to occur earlier or later, depending on the strength of patent protection. The socially optimal level of patent protection, which balances the trade-off between the provision of patenting incentives and the avoidance of deadweight loss caused by a monopoly, is lower with a higher innovation arrival rate or a larger number of firms.

The network determines employment, which workers may influence by engaging in social activities. The network parameters play an important role in determining the economy's employment level and the optimal income tax. The optimal labor income tax depends on both the traditional intensive margin of labor supply and a new extensive margin that depends on the structure of the social network. Social activities that promote social connections are instrumental to acquiring job information; taxation thus discourages both social activities and labor supply, reducing employment. Labor taxes vary positively with labor supply and negatively with employment. When networking is absent, taxes are higher and the economy's employment rate is lower. The optimal capital tax rate is zero, independent of labor market frictions. Social networking reduces job search frictions and is welfare-enhancing.","[Arbex, Marcelo] Univ Windsor, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [O'Dea, Dennis] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Windsor; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Arbex, M (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",arbex@uwindsor.ca,"Arbex, Marcelo/ABC-2901-2020","ARBEX, MARCELO/0000-0002-5506-2669",,,,,39,4,4,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The approach of combining five of the leading forecasting models with equal weights dominates the strategy of selecting one model and using it for all horizons up to two years. Even more accurate forecasts, however, are obtained when allowing the forecast combinations to vary across forecast horizons. While the latter approach is not always more accurate than selecting the single most accurate forecasting model by horizon, its accuracy can be shown to be much more stable over time. The MSPE of real-time pooled forecasts is between 3% and 29% lower than that of the no-change forecast and its directional accuracy as high as 73%. Our results are robust to alternative oil price measures and apply to monthly as well as quarterly forecasts. We illustrate how forecast pooling may be used to produce real-time forecasts of the real and the nominal price of oil in a format consistent with that employed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration in releasing its short-term oil price forecasts, and we compare these forecasts during key historical episodes.

To provide the first study of its kind for China, this paper builds an integrated assessment framework based on a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. We find China's air pollution (PM2.5, ozone, and coarse particles ranging from 2.5 to 10 mu m) to be a staggering threat to human health, economy and residential welfare. Furthermore, there is empirical evidence for much more importance of the PM2.5 issue. In addition, we investigate the impacts of alternative personal vehicle transportation policies. In terms of gross benefits, the results indicate that the total substitution of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) for the existing personal internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) would be more beneficial to national air quality and human health than the combination of stringent fuel economy and emission standards for ICEVs, even in the Chinese case of coal-heavy electric grids.

Trade unions were conceived of as politico-economic organizations whose members were motivated by relative comparisons, and also were concerned with issues of equity and justice. In the post-war period, there was a major theoretical and methodological shift toward the idea of unions as optimizing economic units with well-defined objective functions, which are optimized subject to purely economic constraints. This conceptual transformation took place mainly through the Dunlop -Ross debate, in which John Dunlop conceived of unions as analogous to business firms, as opposed to Arthur Ross's institutional and political approach. However, after decades of analytical developments, the current state of trade union theory has not produced very impressive theoretical results. We trace the historical development of the economic analysis of trade unions from a methodological perspective. We also examine the methodological reasons for the dominance of Dunlop's approach, and the current state of - and the contemporary criticism toward - the established theory. Furthermore, we discuss the contemporary efforts to build a more comprehensive approach to trade union theory and trade union objectives, also incorporating Ross's institutional and political insights.","[Drakopoulos, Stavros] Univ Athens, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, GR-10679 Athens, Greece; [Katselidis, Ioannis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Drakopoulos, S (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, GR-10679 Athens, Greece.",,"Drakopoulos, Stavros A./H-5089-2019","Drakopoulos, Stavros A./0000-0001-9884-9261",,,,,84,4,4,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

From a theoretical point of view, the tax responsiveness of firms crucially depends on this distinction. Empirically, however, a firm's ability to avoid profit taxes is inherently unobservable to the researcher. To address this problem, we use a finite mixture modeling approach which allows us to distinguish avoiders from non-avoiders stochastically from a mixture of distributions of the two types of firms. Using panel data on the universe of foreign affiliates of German multinational firms over the years 1999-2010, we find that investments of tax avoiders do not respond to host-county profit taxes at all, while those of non-avoiders do. About 11% of the affiliates are estimated to be able to avoid taxes. These investments account for about 58% of the stock of foreign fixed assets held by German multinational firms abroad. A one-percentage-point increase in the statutory corporate profit tax rate of a host country is found to reduce the fixed assets of non-avoiders in that host country by 0.81%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

How agents form expectations is therefore of central interest to economists. This paper reviews three competing theories and then provides empirical evidence about what elements make up an agent's expectation about an outcome that is person-specific, susceptible to influence by the agent's own actions, and fairly well predictable on the basis of historical precedent. We examine repeated cross-sections of hundreds of undergraduate students' expectations at mid-semester of their own final course grades at two Australian universities. Data on actual and expected grades are exploited, as well as demographic and psychological information, course information, and data on students' academic background, effort levels, happiness, and historical progress at university prior to expectation formation. Results indicate that a simple rational expectations model of expectation formation provides a poorer fit to the data than a utility model involving either direct utility benefits from expectations, or a psychological need to hold high expectations.

Capital was seen by Hahn as the result of credit creation and not of saving. Over time Hahn moderated some exaggerations of the first two editions of The Economic Theory of Bank Credit, such as the idea of a permanent boom.

Estimation and inference are conducted using identification-robust methods to address the concern that NKPC models are generally weakly identified. Applications using Canadian data show that all the considered versions of the NKPC have a forecasting performance that comfortably exceeds that of a random walk equation, and moreover, that some NKPC versions also significantly outperform forecasts from conventional time series models.

We introduce the concept of the entry invoking behavior of a potential entrant. By entry invoking behavior, we mean the entrant's offer of a higher input price than his first best price under full information to convey the information that his entry benefits the incumbent as well. A high price signals a low cost of the entrant and accordingly a high profit of the integrated firm in a separating equilibrium. In a separating equilibrium, only the efficient (low-type) entrant enters the market, although some efficiency loss in signaling may be incurred. This signaling consideration casts a doubt on the efficiency of the retail-minus access price regulation. We also discuss the possibility of inefficient entry in a pooling equilibrium.","[Kim, Jeong-Yoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Kang, Sawoong] Handong Global Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Heunghae Eup 791708, Gyung Buk, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Handong Global University,"Kim, JY (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Hoegi Dong, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",jyookim@khu.ac.kr; swkang@handong.edu,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

In our model, consumers discount future payments while firms receive a steady-state flow of revenues from selling the durable and consumable goods. As a result, there are potential gains from deferring consumers' payments to the future. We show that when firms commit to constant prices and consumer lock-in is possible, firms choose pricing consistent with the practice in monopoly and competition.

Latest census data (2011) show that the child sex ratios (females per 1,000 males) have decreased compared to data from the last five decades. Increasing son preference and neglect of daughters is occurring in many states in India, despite the advances made in education, literacy, healthcare, and income attainment. A skewed sex ratio and shortage of girls is detrimental to the health and welfare of women, as well as to the human development of India.

As we argue, there are few academics who offer a theoretical framework capable of robustly evaluating the current trajectory of U.S. economic development with the depth of Furtado. Through his analytical lens, and with some help from John Maynard Keynes, we examine the present reality, as well as the more remote economic history of the US.

Adding implementation delays to an otherwise standard endogenous growth model with expanding product variety, the equilibrium path admits a Hopf bifurcation where consumption, R&D and output permanently fluctuate. This mechanism is quantitatively consistent with the observed medium-term movements of US aggregate output. In this framework, an optimal allocation may be restored at equilibrium by the mean of a procyclical subsidy, needed to generate additional consumption smoothing Finally, a procyclical R&D subsidy rate designed to half consumption fluctuations will increase the growth rate from 2.4% to 3.4% with a 9.6% (compensation equivalent) increase in welfare.

Recently, researchers have been surprised to find a negative relation between this measure and economic growth. This paper has three aims. First, Schumpeter sharply distinguished between the volume of credit financing development and the (typically larger) volume of the 'secondary wave' of credit financing consumption, over-investment and speculation, which follows the 'primary wave' of credit financing innovations. Combined with circuit theory, this helps explain the growth and the effects of credit/GDP ratios in our time. Second, it is shown that an increase in the credit/GDP ratio is due to an increase in 'secondary wave' credit, not productive credit; and since credit is debt, growth in the credit/GDP ratio is negative, not positive for economic development. Third, five contemporary ways in which the use of credit for consumption, financial investment and speculation has been institutionalized are discussed. The message of this paper is that, as Schumpeter wrote, distinction between debts according to purpose, however difficult to carry out, is always relevant to diagnosis and may be relevant to preventive policy.","Univ Groningen, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Bezemer, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",d.j.bezemer@rug.nl,,,,,,,47,26,31,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Tourism services, as a comprehensive undertaking with multiple objectives, contribute greatly to the foreign exchange earnings of the country. Specifically, international hotels, which provide accommodation, catering, shopping, socializing, committee rooms and recreation, play a crucial role in the tourism industry. The current study adopted the Delphi method and offered an anonymous channel for conveying opinions. After repetitive consultations, summarizations and revisions, the analytic network process (ANP) principles for the study were finally constructed. The subjects of the study were clients of international tourist hotels in the Taipei area. In total, 250 questionnaires were distributed, and 176 valid questionnaires were collected, at a questionnaire response rate of 70%. As the results demonstrated, the most significant dimension was Responsiveness (weight = 0.238): which accounted for 23.8% of the overall weights. Other dimensions were also important: Assurance (weight = 0.217), Reliability (weight = 0.205), Empathy (weight = 0.183), and Tangibles (weight = 0.157). The research results showed that Responsiveness was of the greatest importance for service quality in international tourist hotels. The data compiled from the overall weights of evaluation indicators of the service quality for the international hotels showed that, among the 16 evaluation indicators, the top five indexes were ranked, based on importance, as follows: service willingness, expertise, responsiveness, reliability, and cordiality.","Taiwan Shoufu Univ, Dept Tourism Management, Tainan, Taiwan",,"Chang, WY (通讯作者)，Taiwan Shoufu Univ, Dept Tourism Management, Tainan, Taiwan.",nico12300529@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,19,2,4,1,21,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

With little written on these earlier capital controversies, one purpose of this article is to fill in the historical record by providing a capital-specific examination of Veblen's attacks and Clark's and Fisher's responses. The second purpose is to explore the unique connections between the Veblen/Clark/Fisher and the Cambridge capital controversies by focussing on three authors: Veblen, Robinson and Harcourt. These controversies shared clashes of fundamentally different visions of economic life, as well as differences regarding the historical contextualisation of the meaning of capital and the role of social institutions. The adequacy of equilibrium analysis and ideology also play more complex roles compared to other capital controversies conducted within a largely shared vision.","York Univ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Cohen, AJ (通讯作者)，York Univ, Vari Hall, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",avicohen@yorku.ca,,,,,,,81,10,10,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This paper provides a rationale for central place theory via a dynamic programming formulation of the social planner's problem of city hierarchy. We show that there must be one and only one immediate smaller city between two neighboring larger-sized cities in any optimal solution. If the fixed cost of setting up a city is a power function, then the immediate smaller city will be located in the middle, confirming the locational pattern suggested by Christaller [4].

Three different types of assets are considered: risky assets, ambiguous assets and assets where the fundamental value distribution can be learned by repeated sampling of realizations. We show that market prices for skewed assets initially differ from those of non-skewed assets for risky as well as for ambiguous assets. Because of learning, the difference in market prices mostly disappears towards the end of trading. When fundamentals are learned by experience sampling, prices of all assets, irrespective of skewness, are very efficient from the beginning. Thus, when probabilities are not described but experienced, subjects are better able to estimate the fundamental value of an asset. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Push factors include the economic performance of the emigrating country, whereas the pull factors include performance in the destination country. The latter include gross domestic product, job creation, the unemployment rate, education level, and wage rate. This paper examines the determinants of immigration from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-3, namely Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, into Malaysia. The analysis is based on panel data of 1990-2008 using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach. The results show that the main determinants of this migration flow are the real wage ratio among the ASEAN-3 and Malaysia, the unemployment rate in the source countries, and the real exchange rate ratio between the ASEAN-3 and Malaysia.","[Jajri, Idris] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Ismail, Rahmah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Jajri, I (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",ibjajri@um.edu.my; rahis@ukm.edu.my,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

A joint modeling of poverty and non-poverty spells controlling for unobserved heterogeneity is applied within each window in order to uncover how poverty experiences of individuals with different socio-economic characteristics have evolved over time. The results indicate that poverty has become more persistent and recurrent in Germany since the beginning of the 1990s. Individuals living in households whose head is a citizen from a European Union country, or has general or vocational training, partially improved their situation over time whereas those over 55 years old, households with a disabled or uneducated head, and single parent households became more prone to poverty.","[Kyzyma, Iryna] CEPS INSTEAD, LU-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Kyzyma, Iryna] Bremen Int Grad Sch Social Sci, Bremen, Germany",,"Kyzyma, I (通讯作者)，CEPS INSTEAD, 3 Ave Fonte, LU-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",iryna.kyzyma@ceps.lu,,,,,,,42,3,4,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

It is usually suggested that FLFP rises whenever trade expands those sectors which use female labor intensively. This paper develops a theoretical model to argue that, quite surprisingly, the opposite effects can occur. Distinguishing between female intensive sectors (FIS) and male intensive sectors (MIS), we show that FLFP may actually fall if trade expands EIS. When FIS are capital intensive, trade integration of a capital-abundant economy expands FIS and contracts MIS. Consequently, male workers migrate from MIS to FIS, diluting the capital-labor ratio in the FIS. Under a high complementarity between capital and female labor, the marginal productivity of women drops more than that of men. Thus, the gender wage gap widens and FLFP falls. Employment patterns in the U.S. following NAFTA are broadly consistent with our theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Angel investors typically invest at an earlier stage of growth and provide more business guidance than venture capital providers. Therefore, angel investors are the key players in generating high-growth companies, essential to regional economic development. As a result, they have attracted the attention of policy makers. Thus, this research attempted to improve the conception of decision-making criteria used by the BAs for investment, and reports the findings of an exploratory project that analysed the Malaysian BAs' decision-making process. A hierarchy of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model based on fuzzy sets theory and VIKOR (in Serbian: Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method were proposed in order to look into the decision making process. For this reason, 5 main criteria and 29 sub criteria were developed to be evaluated by 5 well-known BAs to assess and rate the criteria and alternatives using fuzzy linguistic variables.

Theory points to the importance of controlling for the non-linearity of the utility function of individuals, since the discount rate is defined over time-dated utility flows and not flows of money. It also points to a menagerie of functional forms to characterize different types of non-constant discounting behavior. The implied experimental design calls for individuals to undertake several tasks to allow us to identify these models, and to several treatments such as multiple horizons and the effect of allowing for a front end delay on earlier payments. The implied econometrics calls for structural estimation of the theoretical models, allowing for joint estimation of utility functions and discounting functions. Using data collected from a representative sample of 413 adult Danes in 2009, we draw surprising conclusions. Assuming an exponential discounting model we estimate discount rates to be 9% on average. We find no evidence to support quasi-hyperbolic discounting or fixed cost discounting, and only modest evidence to support other specifications of non-constant discounting. Furthermore, the evidence for non-constant discounting, while statistically significant, is not economically significant in terms of the size of the estimated discount rates. We undertake extensive robustness checks on these findings, including a detailed review of the previous, comparable literature. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, several economic and social shocks, as income inequality, were considered in the analysis. Based on the Brazilian data from 2004 to 2010, and taking into account the effects of shocks on variables which are essential to the public debt and the social security deficit, two sets of GMM models were considered. Furthermore, with the objective of testing the results, a GMM system model was built. The findings confirmed that the social security deficit significantly contributes to an increase in the public debt. Regarding the effects on social security, it was observed that an increase in the level of formality in the economy reduces the deficit. In contrast, a reduction in income inequality, real increase in the minimum wage, and increase in health benefits imply an increase in the social security deficit. Therefore, these variables play a crucial role in the search for an efficient social security management system and cannot be overlooked in ensuring fiscal sustainability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Media bias is greater and state ownership of the media more likely when the government has a particular interest in mobilizing citizens to take actions that further some political objective but are not necessarily in citizens' individual best interest; however, the distinction between state and private media is smaller.

Media bias in state and private media markets diverge as governments become more democratic, whereas media bias in democracies and autocracies converge as positive externalities from mobilization increase.

The demand side is modeled along the Keynesian lines while the supply side is modeled as per neoclassical theory of production. This framework allows analyzing the effects of investment in human capital on supply side variables (like labor, physical and human capital) and demand side variables (like consumption and investment) at the same time. The model has small forecasting horizon in which three alternative scenarios regarding government spending on education are evaluated from 2012 to 2016. The model shows that the link between human capital and labor market is weak however a change in education spending affects output through enhancing productivity and through multiplier-accelerator principle. Though the model is small in size and forecasting horizon, it can help in evaluating the future paths of key macroeconomic variables associated with education spending. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that nationality serves as a coordination device if common nationality is the only piece of information available to the subjects.

While new in judgment aggregation theory, this perspective is familiar in a different body of literature about voting between two alternatives where voters' disagreements stem from conflicts of information rather than of interest. Combining the two bodies of literature, we consider a simple judgment aggregation problem and model the private information underlying voters' judgments. Assuming that voters share a preference for true collective judgments, we analyze the resulting strategic incentives and determine which voting rules efficiently use all private information. We find that in certain, but not all cases a quota rule should be used, which decides on each issue according to whether the proportion of 'yes' votes exceeds a particular quota.

This paper makes the case for implementing this directly through policy to close the global coal industry. Coal is singled out because of its high emissions intensity, low rents per unit value, local environmental costs, and sheer scale. Direct supply policy-the sequenced closure of coal mines-may lead to less policy leakage (across countries and time) than other policies based on demand or price management. It also has the advantage of involving relatively few players and leading to clear-cut and observable outcomes. Appropriately sequenced closure of the world coal industry could, we suggest, create the moral force needed to mobilize collective international action.","[Collier, Paul] Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England; [Venables, Anthony J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Collier, P (通讯作者)，Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England.",paul.collier@bsg.ox.ac.uk; tony.venables@economics.ox.ac.uk,"venables, anthony/JDW-7805-2023","venables, anthony/0000-0003-0251-7479",,,,,28,62,63,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

J,"Davis, K",,,,"Davis, Kevin",,,The Debt Maturity Issue in Access Pricing,ECONOMIC RECORD,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"There has been substantial debate and disagreement over the appropriate debt maturity used in determining the cost of debt for use in access pricing decisions in Australia. Some regulators have used a debt maturity corresponding to the length of the regulatory reset period (typically five years). Others have used a longer maturity based on the argument that the assets being financed are long-lived. In this article it is demonstrated that under the current Australian approach, to meet the objectives of access pricing, the assumed debt maturity should be set equal to the term of the regulatory reset period. Whether practical debt management difficulties for access providers suggest that an alternative approach, placing more emphasis on their actual debt costs (as occurs in some other jurisdictions) should be considered, is also discussed.","[Davis, Kevin] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Davis, Kevin] Australian Ctr Financial Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Davis, Kevin] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",University of Melbourne; Monash University,"Davis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",kevin.davis@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Electoral outcomes of Mexico's certification program,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Land reform; Property rights; Voting; Mexico,DETERMINANTS; ECONOMY,"What is the impact on voting behavior of strengthening property rights over agricultural land? To answer this question, we use the 14-year nationwide rollout of Mexico's land certification program (Procede) and match affected communities (ejidos) before and after the change in property rights with voting outcomes in corresponding electoral sections across six federal election cycles. We find that, in accordance with the investor class theory, granting complete property rights induced a conservative shift toward the pro-market party equal to 6.8 percent of its average share of votes over the period. This shift was strongest where vested interests created larger expected benefits from market-oriented policies as opposed to public-transfer policies. We also find that beneficiaries failed to reciprocate through votes for the benefactor party. We conclude that, in the Mexican experience, engaging in a land reform that strengthened individual property rights over agricultural land was politically advantageous for the right-wing party.

Under the suggested framework, the representative agent adopts, at some initial date, an optimal behavior that shapes her consumption trajectory over time. This agent desires to take a constant discount rate to approach the optimization problem, but bounded rationality, under the form of a present bias, deviates the individual from the intended goal. As a result, decreasing impatience will end up dominating the agent's behavior. The individual will not be aware of her own time inconsistency and, therefore, she will not revise her plans as time elapses, what makes the problem relatively simple to address from a computational point of view. The general discounting framework is used to approach a standard optimal growth model in discrete time. Transitional dynamics and stability properties of the corresponding dynamic setup are studied.

Given a situation where players with different waiting costs have to form a queue in order to be served, they firstly compete with each other for a specific position in the queue. Then, the winner can decide to take up the position or sell it to the others. In the former case, the rest of the players will proceed to compete for the remaining positions in the same manner; whereas for the latter case the seller can propose a queue with corresponding payments to the others which can be accepted or rejected. In this paper we show that, when the players are competing for the first position in the queue, then the subgame perfect equilibrium outcome of the corresponding mechanism coincides with the well-known maximal transfer rule, while an efficient queue is always formed in equilibrium. We also argue that changing the mechanism so that the players compete for the last position implements the minimal transfer rule. The analysis discovers a striking relationship between pessimism and optimism in this type of decision making. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We compare different rule-based contribution schemes where agents can first suggest a minimum provision level of the public good, before the smallest common denominator is implemented. We find that rule-based contribution schemes significantly increase payoff levels relative to the VCM, while significant differences exist between the rules. Importantly, the equal-payoff rule maximizes payoffs for all player types. This also holds relative to a scheme where different types of players separately can determine their minimum contribution levels.

They rank among the highest in the world in terms of income per capita, as well as most other economic and social outcomes. The economic and social success of Scandinavia poses important questions for economics and for those arguing against large redistribution based on its supposedly detrimental effect on economic growth and welfare. How can Scandinavian countries raise large amounts of tax revenue for redistribution and social insurance while maintaining some of the strongest economic outcomes in the world? Combining micro and macro evidence, this paper identifies three policies that can help explain this apparent anomaly: the coverage of third-party information reporting (ensuring a low level of tax evasion), the broadness of tax bases (ensuring a low level of tax avoidance), and the strong subsidization of goods that are complementary to working (ensuring a high level of labor force participation). The paper also presents descriptive evidence on a variety of social and cultural indicators that may help in explaining the economic and social success of Scandinavia.","London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kleven, HJ (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England.",h.j.kleven@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,80,88,2,31,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Nevertheless, trade will be mutually welfare-improving under relatively mild conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The consequences of bank credit for firms or households are further analysed within the context of the national accounts, and it is shown that one does not need a redefinition of aggregate demand and aggregate supply, in contrast to what is proposed by Keen.","Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Lavoie, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,,,,,,30,8,8,0,9,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

For a product of primary interest, we estimate its probability to be chosen as the best one out of all the data, and also conditionally to each product's presence or absence. For a given product, each other one behaves as a catalyzer or inhibitor of the choice. Constructing the entire matrix of such relations for all the products, we compare its symmetrical elements for each pair of products. It shows which pairs of products are mutually synergic, or complementary, so their chances to be chosen as the best ones are higher in the presence of each other. In other cases, the products can be of negative impact on one another, so one is a cannibalizer of another; or both products suppress each other.

His strategy is to choose a transition rule from state to state, and an action rule, which is a map from each memory state to the set of actions. We show that the equilibrium transition rule involves randomization only in the intermediate memory states. Such randomization, or less frequent updating, is interpreted as a way of testing the opponent, which generates inertia in the player's behavior and is the main short-run bias in information processing exhibited by the bounded memory player.

Guilds provided an organizational mechanism for groups of businessmen to negotiate with political elites for exclusive legal privileges that allowed them to reap monopoly rents. Guild members then used their guilds to redirect a share of these rents to political elites in return for support and enforcement. In short, guilds enabled their members and political elites to negotiate a way of extracting rents in the manufacturing and commercial sectors, rents that neither party could have extracted on its own. First, I provide an overview of where and when European guilds arose, what occupations they encompassed, how large they were, and how they varied across time and space. I then examine how guild activities affected market competition, commercial security, contract enforcement, product quality, human capital, and technological innovation. The historical findings on guilds provide strong support for the view that institutions arise and survive for centuries not because they are efficient but because they serve the distributional interests of powerful groups.","Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Ogilvie, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England.",sco2@econ.cam.ac.uk,"Ogilvie, Sheilagh C/J-6693-2012","Ogilvie, Sheilagh/0000-0001-8807-3826",,,,,103,83,94,3,20,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

While recent studies show that the NKPC holds for the pre-currency crisis period, the empirical evidence is inconclusive for the post-crisis period. Has globalization increased the role of global factors relative to domestic factors? Can labor income share still serve as a good measure of real marginal cost following the structural break? To address these issues for the post-crisis period, we use two types of open NKPC: the relative prices model and the incomplete pass-through model. The estimation of both models indicates that the forward-looking behavior is important, and its role is reinforced in an open economy specification. Both NKPC models also show that the external factors are more relevant inflation drivers than the domestic factors.","[Piao, Jishi] Yanbian Univ, Dept Econ, Yanji, Jilin Prov, Peoples R China; [Joo, Sangyong] Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 143701, South Korea",Yanbian University; Konkuk University,"Joo, S (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Hwayang Dong, Seoul 143701, South Korea.",piaojs@ybu.edu.cn; joosy@konkuk.ac.kr,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

It reviews empirical literature about gender differences in behavioural, experimental and neuro-economics as well as in other fields of behavioural research. It discusses gender differences along three dimensions of financial behaviour: risk aversion and response to uncertainty, ethics and moral attitudes, and leadership. The article argues that gender stereotypes are influential in finance, constraining women to achieve top positions in banking and sustaining a strong masculine culture. At the same time the analysis indicates that the few women who make it to the top tend to perform on average better than men, in particular under uncertainty. This is explained by a combination of gender beliefs, gender stereotypes, gender identity and flexible biological processes. Although further research is necessary, the existing empirical literature would support a plea for having more rather than fewer women in financial trade, risk management and at the top of the financial sector.","[van Staveren, Irene] Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"van Staveren, I (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, POB 29776, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands.",Staveren@iss.nl,,"van Staveren, Irene/0000-0001-7548-6795",,,,,80,56,61,3,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

When child mortality falls from lower prevalence, as it did in western Europe, labor productivity improves, fertility falls and the economy prospers. When it falls mainly from better cures, as it has in sub-Saharan Africa, survivors are less healthy and there is little economic growth. The model can quantitatively explain sub-Saharan Africa's experience.

We estimate the effects of market integration and economic policy coordination on bilateral business cycle correlations over the period 1995-2012 using a simultaneous equations model that takes into accounts both the endogenous relationships and unveils direct and indirect effects. The results suggest that (1) trade and FDI have a pronounced positive effect on BCS, particularly between incumbent and new EU members. (2) Rising specialization does not decouple business cycles. (3) The decline of income disparities in EU27 contributes to BCS, as converging countries develop stronger trade and FDI linkages.

(5) The same argument holds true for exchange rate fluctuations that hinder BCS, particularly in EU15.

On the other hand, only few studies consider labour demand characteristics and technological change. In this paper we analyse the influence of both demand and supply factors on educational mismatch in a set of 10 European countries. Our hypothesis, confirmed by results obtained using ordered probit model with sample selection, is that demand factors generally play a major role in reducing educational mismatch in technologically more advanced countries, whereas supply factors are more important in countries that are lagging behind in the international division of labour. At the same time, important cross-country and gender differences have been identified in how the demand/supply factors operate.

I show that a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty and uncertainty attitude changes this picture fundamentally. The illustration of this result relies on the discount rate, which is the crucial determinant in balancing immediate costs against future benefits, and the single most important determinant of optimal mitigation policies in the integrated assessment of climate change. First, the paper removes an implicit assumption of (intertemporal or intrinsic) risk neutrality from the standard economic model. Second, the paper introduces aversion to non-risk uncertainty (ambiguity). I show a close formal similarity between the model of intertemporal risk aversion, which is a reformulation of the widespread Epstein-Zin-Weil model, and a recent model of smooth ambiguity aversion. I merge the models, achieving a threefold disentanglement between risk aversion, ambiguity aversion, and the propensity to smooth consumption over time.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Traeger, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",traeger@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,68,38,40,2,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

While entry incurs a higher fixed cost, licensed production is of lower quality. If the patent-holder does not work its patent locally, the South is free to use CL The threat of CL ensures that consumers have access to (a lower quality version of) the patented good when the patent-holder chooses not to work its patent locally; improves the terms at which VL occurs; can cause the patent-holder to switch from VL to entry; and can delay consumer access when CL replaces VL or entry.

The reason is an interaction between job creation costs and an agency problem. The agency problem triggers separations during economic downturns even though both the employer and the worker would be better off if the job was not discontinued, that is, affected jobs have strictly positive surplus values. Similarly, booms make it possible for more jobs to overcome the agency problem. These effects do not offset each other, because business cycles reduce the expected job duration for these jobs. With positive job creation costs, business cycles then reduce the creation of valuable jobs and lower average activity levels. Considering a wide range of parameter values, we find estimates for the cost of business cycles ranging from 2.03% to 12.7% of gross domestic product.","[Den Haan, Wouter J.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Macroecon, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Den Haan, Wouter J.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Den Haan, Wouter J.] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Sedlacek, Petr] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Bonn,"Den Haan, WJ (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Macroecon, London WC2A 2AE, England.",wjdenhaan@gmail.com; sedlacek@uni-bonn.de,,"Sedlacek, Petr/0009-0004-1421-5843",ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,28,2,2,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

We use the introduction of the Acid Rain Program in the U.S. as a case study. The theory predicts that owners of coal deposits, expecting future sales to decline, would supply more of their resource between the announcement of the Acid Rain Program and its implementation; moreover, the incentive to increase supply would be stronger for owners of high-sulfur coal. This would, all else equal, induce an increase in sulfur dioxide emissions. Using data on prices, heat input and sulfur content of coal delivered to U.S. power plants, we find strong evidence of a price decrease and of an increase in the sulfur premium, some indication that the amount of coal used might have increased, and no evidence of fuel-switching towards higher-sulfur coal. Overall, our evidence suggests that while the mechanism indicated by the theory might be at work, market conditions and concurrent regulation largely prevented a green paradox from arising. These results have implications for the design of climate policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We decompose LLP into discretionary and non-discretionary components to test for differential valuations in the two banking sectors. We use alternative criteria to define the components of LLP in banks: loan quality/size and earnings management/manipulation incentives. We employ a price-level valuation model estimated using two-stage analyses. We find that LLP has positive value relevance to investors in both banking sectors. Investors in Islamic banks price the discretionary component relatively lower than their conventional counterparts. We attribute this result to differences in product and governance structures as well as to the religious perception of Islamic banking. In both banking sectors, investors construe an increase in the non-discretionary component as irrelevant valuation information.

This paper discusses how the structure of the pension plan affects the union's ability and willingness to sacrifice returns to promote union goals. Using panel data on over 38,000 pension plans drawn from IRS Form 5500 filings between 1988 and 2008, we find the lowest performing plans are unionized multi-employer plans.

In the early 1990s, the South African Old Age Pension was expanded to cover most black South Africans above a sex-specific age cut-off resulting in a substantial increase in the income of older South Africans and potentially their say in the economic decisions of their families. Beneficiaries of the program are more likely to coreside with adults who have less human capital as measured by height and education. Since height and education are fixed for adults, this cannot be an effect of the pension income but reflects selective changes in living arrangements resulting from the pension.

The main contribution to this expansion was the rapid accumulation of the central bank's foreign assets, as a result of foreign exchange market intervention. In this paper, we examine the possible international transmission of this expansion by analyzing monthly data for China and 15 other countries over the period 2000-2012. Impulse response analysis based on vector autoregression modeling suggests that the PBoC's balance sheet expansion has greater impacts on developing than on developed countries. So far the influences appear to be dominated by trade channels instead of financial channels, possibly due to China's capital account controls. However, the impacts of the PBoC's balance sheet expansion on other countries' interest rates, exchange rates, and stock market prices could strengthen significantly in the coming years as China's economic scale grows and its capital account opens up.","[Huang, Yiping; Xie, Peichu] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiao] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Peking University; Australian National University,"Huang, YP (通讯作者)，5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yhuang@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"Huang, Yi-Ping/GQZ-6811-2022; Yang, Jie/JDM-6213-2023","Yang, Jie/0000-0002-3941-0053",,,,,43,6,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

The second part studies the empirical performance of the indices for a panel of Ukrainian manufacturing firms. This study offers a new approach to measuring profit elasticity that relies on structural estimation of a production function. The estimation methodology retrieves a productivity index that is adjusted to imperfect competition. The proposed method of measuring profit elasticity is found to be robust to frictions, but the PCM and traditional profit elasticity are biased, especially when the intensity of competition is low. Empirical findings show that competition exhibits a significantly positive correlation with aggregate productivity performance, while its impact on firm productivity is nonlinear.","Inst Natl Stat & Etud Econ STATEC, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Kilinç, U (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Stat & Etud Econ STATEC, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",umut.kilinc@statec.etat.lu,,,,,,,46,2,2,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

We show that a government concerned with the credit rating of its debt should put different discount rates on these two aspects. The credit rating reflects the probability of default on the government's debt and thus affects its financing costs. Monetary revenues, which can be used in financial distress to repay debt, improve the credit rating and thus carry an additional credit-market value compared to social benefits. However, informational problems dynamic inconsistency and adverse selection - push the government to an excessive emphasis on social benefits, ignoring the external effect of monetary revenue on debtholders. Since the credit market anticipates this, the government's credit rating is adversely affected and it is thus unable to extract the full potential value of the projects. Privatization can sometimes alleviate these problems; However, the option to privatize has complex effects on the market's assessment of projects that remain in government's hands and thus might sometimes be harmful.

Using micro-level data on consumer purchases of hybrid and non-hybrid vehicles from National Household Travel Survey 2009, this paper formulates a mixed logit model of consumers' vehicle choices. Parameter estimates are then used to evaluate consumers' willingness to pay for hybrids. Results suggest that households' willingness to pay for hybrids ranges from $963 to $1718 for different income groups, which is significantly lower than the average price premium (over $5000) of hybrid vehicles, even when taking the fuel costs savings of hybrid vehicles into consideration. The differences reveal that although the market has shown increasing interest in hybrid vehicles, consumers' valuation of the hybrid feature is still not high enough to compensate for the price premium when they make new purchases. Policy simulations are conducted to examine the effects of raising federal tax incentives on the purchase of hybrid vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is known that, if the payments that were previously agreed (with each of the remaining agents) are renegotiated in case any bilateral negotiation permanently breaks down, then the Shapley value is the unique efficient and individual rational outcome consistent with bilateral Nash bargaining. Here we show that when instead the agreed payments cannot be renegotiated the outcome is also unique but it now coincides with the Nucleolus of an associated bankruptcy problem. We provide a strategic foundation for this outcome. Then we study how such renegotiation affects the principal's payoff according to the properties of the surplus function. We find, for example, that renegotiation benefits the principal when agents are complements and it hurts him when they are substitutes (situations with, respectively, increasing and decreasing marginal contributions).

Our model combines limited tax enforcement with an otherwise standard two-sector neoclassical stochastic growth model. The Bayesian estimation of the model based on Italian data provides evidence in favor of an important underground sector in Italy, with a size that has increased steadily over the whole sample period. We show that this pattern is due to a steady increase in taxation. Fiscal policy experiments suggest that a moderate tax cut, along with a stronger effort in the monitoring process, causes a sizeable reduction in the size of the underground economy and provides a positive stimulus for the regular economy. Both of these effects jointly increase total fiscal revenues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This paper evaluates the effects of these changes by analyzing the efficiency of Chinese banks over the period 1998-2012 using two frontier techniques and comparative analysis. The findings suggest that the performance and technical efficiency of the Big Four banks improved considerably after property rights reform, but this improvement is not sufficient to keep the banks at the production frontier. Tobit regressions confirm that static ownership effects are negative but that the property rights reform has had significant and positive effects on the technical efficiency of state-owned commercial banks. GDP growth and the financial crisis have had positive effects on the efficiency of Chinese banks, which is more significant for joint stock commercial banks than state-owned commercial banks. The results indicate the value of ownership reforms of state-owned asset management companies and insurance companies and the establishment of a countercyclical capital buffer.","[Wang, Qian] Jilin Univ, Chinas Publ Sect Econ Res Ctr, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qian] Jilin Univ, Sch Econ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Feng, Xiaochu] Jilin Univ, Dept Finance, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qian] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Jilin University; Jilin University; Jilin University; Harvard University,"Wang, Q (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Chinas Publ Sect Econ Res Ctr, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",wangqian@jlu.edu.cn,,,,,,,29,8,8,0,42,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2014,22.0,4,,,,,1,20,,,,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AN4YU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340596700001,0

The findings of this study also suggest several conspicuous contrasts in the consumption of illegally downloaded music and movie files. Prolific music downloaders typically demonstrate a greater propensity to substitute legal content for pirated materials, while heavy movie downloaders demonstrate a greater willingness to pay for legal alternatives and are deterred to a greater extent by an awareness of negative effects of piracy upon the movie industry.

To enhance comparability, the IMF's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition, which some countries have already implemented and others will implement in the coming years, recommends seven methods for valuation of unlisted FDI. This paper demonstrates that both the valuation method and simple differences in estimation techniques can fundamentally change a country's financial balance sheet. Using Denmark as an illustration, unlisted FDI equity liabilities vary from 22 to 156 percent of GDP when applying different estimation techniques, but just one valuation method, price to earnings. These measurement uncertainties can lead to important misunderstandings and affect policy recommendations, thus pointing to the need for further international harmonization.

This paper examines this question in the context of developing Asia, where many countries implemented fiscal stimulus measures to support domestic demand during the global crisis. Economic conditions normalized after the crisis but growth in Asia has slowed down since. We examine historical data from 10 emerging Asian countries to assess whether countercyclical fiscal policy can support future growth in the region. Our examination is based on identifying shocks by restricting the contemporaneous relation between fiscal and non-fiscal variables. Our most significant and consistent finding is that in developing Asia, tax cuts have a greater countercyclical impact on output than government spending. This implies there is some scope for countercyclical tax adjustments so long as fiscal sustainability is not compromised. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluate in particular the values of both investment and hiring/firing growth and shutdown options not only for the standard Cobb-Douglas production function but also when taking account of the natural upper bound on the output due to the demand level. For this latter purpose, we use results about average of options provided in Shackleton and Wojakowski (2007). As a by-product, we extend the approach of Tserlukevich (2008) by introducing the employment level to analyze in particular the optimality of the financial structure and leverage. Our approach allows us to get a quasi-explicit solution of the optimal firm's value that can be deeply analyzed. Such results can potentially explain the interest for flexible contractual arrangements with capital and labor firm's structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Minsky to construct an index of financial fragility for residential housing in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. In the process, a clear difference is made between financial fragility, bubble, and fraud. The goal is to capture the growing interdependence between debt and asset price on the upside. The index is able to capture the rapid growth of financial fragility in residential housing from the early 2000s and an usually high level of financial fragility from 2004 in the United States. However, the construction of the index reveals that the data available are of limited quantity and quality for the purpose at hand. If the Financial Stability Oversight Council is serious about measuring systemic risk, better data about cash flows and loan underwriting should be collected in order to get an idea of the quality of leverage. This quality is measured by focusing on the means used to service debts instead of ability and willingness to service debt per se (i.e. credit risk).","Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97219 USA",,"Tymoigne, E (通讯作者)，Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97219 USA.",,,,,,,,24,4,5,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We find that inflation persistence tends to be higher in times of high inflation. Since the oil price shocks, inflation persistence has declined both in the United States and the euro area. In most central and eastern European countries, for which our study covers 1993-2012, inflation persistence has also declined, with the main exceptions of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia, where persistence seems to be rather stable. Our findings have implications for the conduct of monetary policy and for a possible membership in the euro area. Among the two time-varying coefficient methods we use, our results favour the flexible least squares smoother over the Kalman smoother.

For this purpose we check expectational errors and estimate the degrees of forward-lookingness and macroeconomic efficiency of consumer inflation expectations. We also test the impact of the recent financial crisis on the formation of these expectations. Our results suggest that capacities of consumers to anticipate future inflation are rather constrained, although their opinions contain some forward-looking elements. Consumers seem to anticipate future inflation to the highest extent in France, Cyprus, the European Monetary Union as a whole, and the Netherlands. There is also a relatively high degree of anticipation in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Slovakia. Consumer inflation expectations in advanced economies display better forecasting properties and higher degrees of forward-lookingness and efficiency than expectations in transition economies. Finally, our results suggest that the global financial crisis has influenced the formation of inflation expectations in both groups of economies.","[Mackiewicz-Lyziak, Joanna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,,,"Mackiewicz-Łyziak, Joanna/ABA-4673-2020","Mackiewicz-Łyziak, Joanna/0000-0002-4545-8221; Lyziak, Tomasz/0000-0002-0488-4259",,,,,32,24,24,0,8,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Our identification strategy relies on exploiting both temporal and spatial variation across birth cohorts to measure children's exposure to the conflict. We find that children from regions more affected by the conflict suffered significant health setbacks compared with children from less affected regions. We further examine possible war impact mechanisms using rich survey data on households' experience of war.

A popular concern is that austerity is self-defeating, because fiscal multipliers can be large. Specifically, a number of recent studies find that multipliers tend to be large during financial crises and/or if monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound. However, public debt crises tend to have an offsetting effect by making multipliers smaller than during normal times. Consequently, while austerity is no cure for all, it is unlikely to be literally self-defeating when sovereign risk is high.","[Mueller, Gernot J.] Univ Bonn, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Müller, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",gernot.mueller@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,38,12,12,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

This paper uses VARMA-AGARCH and DCC-AGARCH models to model volatilities and conditional correlations between emerging market stock prices, copper prices, oil prices and wheat prices. The dynamic conditional correlation model is found to fit the data the best and used to generate dynamic conditional correlations, hedge ratios and optimal portfolio weights. Emerging market stock prices and oil prices display leverage effects where negative residuals tend to increase the variance (conditional volatility) more than positive ones. Correlations between these assets increased considerably after 2008, and have yet to return to their pre 2008 values. On average, oil provides the cheapest hedge for emerging market stock prices while copper is the most expensive but given the variability in the hedge ratios, one should probably not put too much emphasis on average hedge ratios.

We show that private information (i) increases the volatility of both net and gross capital flows, (ii) leads to a high correlation between capital inflows and outflows, (iii) leads to a disconnect of capital flows from observed macro fundamentals and (iv) implies that capital flows contain information about the future macro fundamentals.

Executive Order (EO) 13269, enacted in July of 2002, allowed noncitizens to apply for US citizenship immediately upon joining the military, effectively reducing the waiting time that is required to apply for citizenship from 3 years to 1day. We identify the effect of the policy by using administrative personnel data on the universe of military enlistees between 1999 and 2010 along with a difference-in-differences (DD) strategy that uses accessions amongst citizens as the control group. Overall, we find no effect of the offer of expedited citizenship on total accessions amongst noncitizens. However, this overall null effect masks significant shifts of noncitizen enlistments out of combat intensive services and into safer' services.

The five articles are a selection of papers presented at the 'Workshop on Inequality and Regional Growth and Cohesion' organised by the Regional Quantitative Analysis research group (AQR-IREA) of the University of Barcelona in November 2011. The first two articles, by De Dominicis and by Monastiriotis, focus on the analysis of regional growth and examine the influence of agglomeration and national development, respectively. The article by Ezcurra and Rodriguez-Pose looks instead at how trade openness impacts on within-country regional disparities, while the article by Kyriacou and Roca-Sagales examines in turn how regional disparities impact on the quality of government at the national level. The final article by Sacchi and Salotti examines the impact of different forms of decentralisation on income inequalities at the household level.

First, there is an Internality Dividend from Externality Taxes: aside from reducing externalities, they also offset distortions from underinvestment in energy efficiency. Discrete choice simulations of the auto market suggest that the Internality Dividend could more than double the social welfare gains from a carbon tax at marginal damages. Second, we develop the Internality Targeting Principle: the optimal combination of multiple instruments depends on the average internality of the consumers marginal to each instrument Because consumers who undervalue energy costs are mechanically less responsive to energy taxes, the optimal policy will tend to involve an energy tax below marginal damages coupled with a larger subsidy for energy efficient products. Third, although the exact optimal policy depends on joint distributions of unobservables which would be difficult to estimate, we develop formulas to closely approximate optimal policy and welfare effects based on reduced form sufficient statistics that can be estimated by using field experiments or quasi-experimental variation in product prices and energy costs.

This problem consists of a stochastic model that does not define a single ideal point for cash balance, but an oscillation range between a lower bound, an ideal balance and an upper bound. Thus, this paper proposes the application of GA and PSO to minimize the total cost of cash maintenance, by obtaining the parameters of a cash management policy with three assets (cash and two investments), and using the assumptions presented in literature. Computational experiments were applied in the development and validation of the models.

We have monthly observations on prices charged by the same plant for the same product to buyers in Ireland and the UK, two markets segmented by variable exchange rates. Assuming that relative marginal cost is constant across markets within a plant and a product, this allows us to observe the behaviour of the markup in the UK market relative to the home market. To identify pricing-to-market that goes beyond what is mechanically due to price stickiness, we condition on episodes where prices change. When prices are invoiced in local currency, conditional on prices changing, the ratio of the markup in the foreign market to the markup in the home market increases one-for-one with depreciations of home against foreign currency and decreases one-for-one with appreciations of home against foreign currency, a very particular form of pricing-to-market.","[Fitzgerald, Doireann] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA; [Haller, Stefanie] Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland",Federal Reserve System - USA; University College Dublin,"Fitzgerald, D (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA.",,,,,,,,24,42,49,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We incorporate a financial accelerator mechanism and two types of financial shocks to the external finance premium and net worth in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with shocks to the marginal efficiency of investment, the investment-good price markup, and the rates of neutral and investment-specific technological changes. This model is estimated using eleven US time series that include data on loan, net worth, the loan rate, and the relative price of investment. Our estimation results show that the (non-stationary) neutral and investment-specific technology shocks primarily drive output and investment fluctuations, while the external finance premium shock plays an important role for investment fluctuations.

This RDU assumption can be viewed as a transformation of probabilities depending on the pessimism/optimism of the agent. The results show that pessimism favors the existence of deterministic bubbles, when optimism may promote the existence of stochastic bubbles. Moreover, under pessimism, the RDU assumption may generate multiple bubbly equilibria. The RDU assumption also leads to new conditions ensuring the (absence of) Pareto-optimality of the competitive equilibrium without bubbles. These conditions still govern the existence of bubbles.

The main findings are that the survivor dividend has a strong financial basis which enables the macro contribution rate applied to be the same as the individual credited rate, and that including the survivor dividend in the calculation of the initial pension is not irrelevant because the initial pension could rise by up to 21.84%, depending on the mortality scenario used.","[Boado-Penas, Maria del Carmen] Univ Liverpool, Inst Financial & Actuarial Math, Dept Math Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZL, Merseyside, England; [Vidal-Melia, Carlos] Univ Valencia, Dept Financial Econ & Actuarial Sci, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Liverpool; University of Valencia,"Vidal-Meliá, C (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Financial Econ & Actuarial Sci, Ave Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",carlos.vidal@uv.es,"VIDAL-MELIA, CARLOS/AAH-9010-2020","VIDAL-MELIA, CARLOS/0000-0002-7227-5076; Boado Penas, Carmen/0000-0002-0643-4921",,,,,8,12,13,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In accordance with the nature of the Solow framework, almost all empirical growth studies considered technological progress constant and identical across countries and over time, and hence underemphasized its role. In this study, in order to overcome this weakness, we propose that the Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992) set-up should be replaced by the Solovianized Romer (1990) framework, thus allowing the role of technology to be considered in the empirical analysis. In particular, within this framework, the growth rate of technology varies across economies and over time. We estimate the convergence equation derived from Solovianized Romer model for 31 OECD countries for the period 1980-2008 by applying the system GMM approach. The empirical findings of the model support the conditional convergence hypothesis, but reveal a lower convergence rate than that predicted by the existing literature. As a policy implication, we argue that, investment in R&D and human capital are important determinants of convergence, and in cases where economies are unable to allocate sufficient resources to R&D, policy makers should ease the diffusion of technology (e.g., via FDI or trade) in order to retain a high convergence rate.

Because fertilizers are applied at specific times in the growing season, the concentrations of agrichemicals in water vary seasonally and by cropped area as some Indian states plant predominantly summer crops while others plant winter crops. Our identification strategy exploits the differing timing of the planting seasons across states and differing seasonal prenatal exposure to agrichemicals to identify the impact of agrichemical contamination on various measures of child health. The results indicate that children exposed to higher concentrations of agrichemicals during their first month experience worse health outcomes on a variety of measures; these effects are largest among the most vulnerable groups, particularly the children of uneducated poor women living in rural India.

We measure the responses to public and private signals. We find that, on average, subjects put a larger weight on the public signal. In line with theoretical predictions, as the relative weight of the coordination component in a player's utility increases, players put more weight on the public signal when making their choices. However, the weight is smaller than in equilibrium, which indicates that subjects underestimate the information contained in public signals about other players' beliefs.","[Cornand, Camille] Lyon Univ, GATE CNRS, F-69131 Ecully, France; [Heinemann, Frank] Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Macroecon, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Cornand, C (通讯作者)，Lyon Univ, GATE CNRS, 93 Chemin Mouilles,BP 167, F-69131 Ecully, France.",cornand@gate.cnrs.fr; frank.heinemann@ww.tu-berlin.de,"Cornand, Camille/H-3184-2017",,,,,,30,28,28,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

After addressing basic conditions for institutionalized cooperation, the agency capability of preferential mixing is introduced in order to determine the carrier group of an institution of cooperation. That platform typically assumes a meso-size smaller than the initial arena. Habituation and generalization within and across overlapping platforms then may lead to first contextual trust. This has to be carried over from individual platforms into the larger public of the whole economy to constitute general trust. The practical relevance of this analysis is illustrated through the fact that even superficially similar economies show different socio-economic performance and trajectories.

This paper extends this research by introducing adaptive learning in the model of Krusell and Smith (1998) with uninsurable idiosyncratic risks and aggregate uncertainty. A first contribution of this paper establishes that the equilibrium of this framework is stable under least-squares learning. The second contribution consists of showing that bounded rationality enhances the ability of this model to match the distribution of income in the US. Learning increases significantly the Gini coefficients because of the opposite effects on consumption of the capital-rich and of the capital-poor agent. The third contribution is an empirical exercise that shows that learning can account for increases in the income Gini coefficient of up to 25% in a period of 28 years.

We estimate an intergenerational asset transfer function with various control variables, using a unique micro dataset taken from a survey conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, Cabinet Office. Employing three different models, a Tobit model, an interval regression model and an ordered probit model, to ensure that our results are independent of the specific econometric approach used, we investigate whether asset transfers received are correlated with households' financial strength. We find that higher income households are likely to receive larger asset transfers.

The outcome measure used is not subject to lead-time bias. I control for mean age at diagnosis, the stage distribution of patients at time of diagnosis, and the sex and race of diagnosed patients. Under the assumption that there were no preaEuroEdated factors that drove both innovation and mortality and that there would have been parallel trends in mortality in the absence of innovation, the estimates indicate that there were three major sources of the 13.8% decline of the age-adjusted cancer mortality rate during 2000-2009. Drug innovation and imaging innovation are estimated to have reduced the cancer mortality rate by 8.0 and 4.0%, respectively. The decline in incidence is estimated to have reduced the cancer mortality rate by 1.2%. The social value of the reductions in cancer mortality attributable to medical innovations has been enormous, and much greater than the cost of these innovations.

Based on industrial panel data, the two-step GMM estimation is used to test the impacts of FDI, trade openness, exports, imports and per capita income on CO2 emissions. The results suggest that: (1) China's growing trade surplus is one of the important reasons for the rapidly rising CO2 emissions; (2) large FDI inflows further aggravate China's CO2 emissions; and (3) the industrial sector's per capita income and CO2 emission relationship show inverted-U environmental Kuznets curve.

Building on a novel panel data set including the biggest European utilities from eight EU countries over a period from 1985 to 2010, we find that the overall influence of the European regulatory reform process on R&D investment is ambiguous. The empirical evidence indicates that the approaching liberalization process, i.e., nearing competition, has a dampening effect on R&D spending. Utilities reduce their expenses due to increased uncertainties and additional risks. However, once the market and regulatory framework conditions have been set up and firms have become used to the new situation, higher levels of competition positively influence R&D and former incumbents invest more in order to escape from the competition. Moreover, we find no indication that (ownership) unbundling and incentive regulation directly affect the research expenditures of the utilities. In contrast, the privatization of utilities seems to have strong negative consequences for their amount of R&D spending.","[Schmitt, Stephan] Wik Consult GmbH, D-53604 Bad Honnef, Germany; [Schmitt, Stephan] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Res Inst Regulatory Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Kucsera, Denes] Agenda Austria, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Schmitt, S (通讯作者)，Wik Consult GmbH, Rhoendorfer Str 68, D-53604 Bad Honnef, Germany.",s.schmitt@wik-consult.com,,,,,,,53,6,6,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

We look for the answer through the Bayesian estimation of a two-country New Keynesian model of production fragmentation coveting ten Asian economies, including China. The estimates show that vis-a-vis China, the developed Asia has a more fragmented production structure with higher domestic value-added embodied in intermediates traded with China whereas the developing Asian production chains are equally if not less fragmented with more foreign value-added. We also find that China's expansion made possible by favorable demand and price shocks benefits all Asian neighbors. Expansion driven by total factor productivity improvement, however, lifts the aggregate value-added in the developing Asia but not in the developed Asia, unless the shocks symmetrically originate in both China and the developed Asia. Fixing the regional currencies irrevocably to the U.S. dollar amplifies the effect of China's productivity improvements, although it is nearly irrelevant for responses to other types of shocks: We conclude that production fragmentation and symmetry in shock are the keys to the answers of this question.

On the one hand, hiring decisions are based, as in most organizations, on a candidate's professional qualifications. On the other hand, supranational institutions often aim for broad national representation. Reviewing evidence from the European Central Bank, we show that nationality is indeed relevant for both hiring and decision-making. Specifically, we find a disproportionately narrow spread of national representation in the top management of the ECB. Further, there is evidence for the existence of national networks between adjacent management layers. Finally, monetary policy decisions seem to be linked to national representation in the core business areas of the ECB. Examining a sample of 27 European countries over the period from 1999 to 2008, we estimate Taylor rules for alternative sets of euro area aggregates derived from different weighting schemes of national macroeconomic data. Our results indicate that weights based on national representation in the mid-level management of the ECB's core business areas best describe the central bank's interest-rate setting behavior.

Furthermore, it relates the more disaggregated estimates for 93 two-digit HS product groups to the elasticity of substitution, thereby testing a key hypothesis of heterogenous firm trade theory. The estimates for the period 1996-2011 suggest a trade effect of the euro of some 28%, which has mainly materialized through the intensive margin. A negative net effect of the euro on the extensive margin is found for several product groups, supporting anecdotal evidence that firms have consolidated their product varieties in response to the elimination of exchange rate variability. Finally, the disaggregated estimates are in line with heterogenous firm trade theory models, suggesting that a large elasticity of substitution dampens the effect of a trade cost reduction on the extensive margin and amplifies its effect on the intensive margin.","[Badinger, Harald] WU Vienna, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Turkcan, Kemal] Akdeniz Univ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Badinger, H (通讯作者)，WU Vienna, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",harald.badinger@wu.ac.at,"Türkcan, Kemal/N-3771-2019; Türkcan, Kemal/C-2309-2016","Türkcan, Kemal/0000-0001-9055-7280; Türkcan, Kemal/0000-0001-9055-7280; Badinger, Harald/0000-0002-7238-5136",,,,,32,5,5,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The prison releases are sudden (within one day), very large (up to 35 percent of the entire prison population), and happen nationwide.

Prior research indicates campaigning affects voting decisions but, as with advertising generally, what element of campaigning persuades - the content or its delivery method - is not fully understood. Using a field experiment in a 2010 general election for local office, we identify the mechanism behind one campaign method: candidate door-to-door canvassing. We vary both the method of contact and the information conveyed by campaign materials. We find that voters are persuaded by personal contact with the candidate and that personal contact apparently works by providing a costly signal of quality rather than through social pressure.","[Barton, Jared; Castillo, Marco; Petrie, Ragan] CSU Channel Isl, Camarillo, CA 93012 USA",California State University System; California State University Channel Islands,"Barton, J (通讯作者)，CSU Channel Isl, 1 Univ Dr, Camarillo, CA 93012 USA.",jared.barton@csuci.edu,"Petrie, Ragan/AAQ-2892-2021","Petrie, Ragan/0000-0002-9101-1666; Castillo, Marco/0000-0003-0756-7184",,,,,46,27,31,1,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

We argue that to assess their appropriateness and facilitate their implementation it is necessary to develop statistical indicators of the distribution of returns. When starting a higher education programme, the return on a particular degree is uncertain, and risk-adverse students or those from low-income families may be reluctant to enrol if this means taking out a loan. These statistical indicators would therefore be natural inputs of cost-sharing policies intended to preserve the individual economic incentives to go to university and simultaneously provide an insurance role. We present a dynamic microsimulation model of individual lifetime educational output in the French labour market which uses econometric modelling of individual wages, labour market transitions, social security contributions and benefits. It relies largely on labour force survey data and mortality tables. In the standard internal rate of return framework, the model is used to compute the distribution of returns to higher education, for a given generation. The results show that the percentage of negative returns is close to 3.5%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To examine the economic consequences of fertility and mortality changes in a common framework, we incorporate realistic demographic features into a continuous-time overlapping-generations model with childhood, adulthood and retirement stages. Using parameter values appropriate for industrial countries (such as the USA), we find that a fertility increase and a mortality decline, while both causing a rise in the population growth rate, have opposite effects on capital accumulation. We also consider simultaneous fertility and mortality changes, and find that the effect on capital accumulation of a mortality change dominates that of a fertility change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, a 10 percentage point decrease in tariffs reduces the wage premium by 1.01%, whereas a 10% increase in TFP raise wage premium by 1.6%.

This growth has been associated with extensive deforestation, with biofuels often named as the principal driver. However, other drivers have been less examined; in particular, restrictions on genetically modified food in Europe and on trans fats in many developed countries have led food companies to switch to using palm oil in production. This article uses a price analysis to examine the drivers of palm oil production growth during the 1980-2010 boom. Soya bean oil is used in the analysis as the leading vegetable oil, while crude oil represents the energy market; the prices of these oils, along with palm oil, are tested in vector autoregression (VAR) and vector error correction models. The two models consistently find that palm oil prices do not appear to respond to short-run fluctuations in crude oil prices. Rather, they are a function of lagged palm oil prices and current and lagged soya bean oil prices. Overall, the results indicate that while palm and soya bean oil markets have a potentially significant relationship, the crude oil market does not appear to have been an important driver of the palm oil boom.","[Sanders, D.

We also test the impacts of research and development (R&D) spending on firm profitability and returns. Our results show that lead firms and component suppliers capture higher gross profits from their R&D spending, compared to contract manufacturers. However, contract manufacturers have higher return on equity. Component suppliers' return to R&D as measured by return on equity is lower than contract manufacturers. These findings suggest that component suppliers capture higher profits as lead firms do, but the cost of R&D for component suppliers is so high that their returns on investment are not as great as contract manufacturers.

Firms pay their factors of production in advance, which requires borrowing at the beginning of the period. Borrowing, in turn, is constrained by the value of collateral that they own at the beginning of the period, leading to inefficiently low amounts of capital and labor. In this environment, the optimal capital-income tax in the steady state is non zero. Specifically, the quantitative analyses show that the capital-income tax is negative and, therefore, the distortions stemming from the credit friction are offset by subsidizing capital. However, when the government cannot distinguish between capital- income and profits, the capital-income tax is positive as the government levies the same tax rate on both sources of income. These results stand in contrast to the celebrated result of zero capital-income taxation of Judd (Judd, K. 1985. Redistributive Taxation in a Simple Perfect Foresight Model.

Regions with abundant labour such as South Asia require significant improvements in the diffusion of ICT to achieve higher productivity for their labour, which in turn can increase the pace of economic growth. In this context, the objective of this study is to investigate whether ICT could be used to improve labour productivity for countries in South Asia. This study first investigates the general status of diffusion of ICT among South Asian countries. The initial results based on descriptive statistics indicate that there is a significant gap among the South Asian countries, with Maldives having the highest ICT facilities. Second, using robust panel data methodologies, this study concludes that South Asia's drive for higher productivity of its abundant labour force can substantially be improved in the long-run by increasing diffusion of ICT in the presence of trade openness as well as domestic capital formulation.","[Al Mamun, Md.] La Trobe Univ, Dept Finance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Al Mamun, Md.] East West Univ, Dept Business Adm, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Wickremasinghe, Guneratne B.] Victoria Univ, Coll Business, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Wickremasinghe, Guneratne B.] Victoria Univ, Ctr Strateg Econ Studies, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",La Trobe University; East West University Bangladesh; Victoria University; Victoria University,"Wickremasinghe, GB (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Coll Business, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",guneratne.wickremasinghe@vu.edu.au,"Wickremasinghe, Guneratne B/B-5180-2018; Wickremasinghe, Guneratne/D-9092-2012","Al Mamun, Md/0000-0002-6540-9195",,,,,86,3,6,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Firms and workers may have heterogeneous preferences over matches on the other side, and the model allows for both uniform and personalized wages or contracts. To make the model tractable, I use the Azevedo and Leshno (2013) framework, in which a finite number of firms is matched to a continuum of workers. In equilibrium, even if wages are exogenous and fixed, firms have incentives to strategically reduce their capacity, to increase the quality of their worker pool. The intensity of incentives to reduce capacity is given by a simple formula, analogous to the classic Cournot model, but depends on different moments of the distribution of preferences. I compare markets with uniform and personalized wages. For fixed quantities, markets with personalized wages always yield higher efficiency than markets with uniform wages, but may be less efficient if firms reduce capacity to avoid bidding too much for star workers.

First, we develop a theoretical model that determines the equilibrium debt level, probability of default and sovereign spread and draw empirical implications. We then employ a Structural Vector Autoregression (WAR) model to investigate empirically how the spread of sovereign debt is influenced over time by both external and domestic factors. The empirical results show that variations in sovereign spreads are mainly driven by external shocks, with the term structure of US interest rate and the global risk aversion having the most important role. The findings also indicate that shocks from the US have a direct effect on sovereign spread and an indirect effect via domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. Finally, the evidence produced validates the presence of some response patterns of sovereign spread to the external shocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the empirical section, an application is provided to model the daily returns in WTI crude oil prices considering the regime shifts the crude oil prices were subject to during history. Models are evaluated in terms of their out-of-sample forecasting capabilities with equal forecast accuracy tests and also in terms of various error criteria. The results suggest that volatility clustering, asymmetry and nonlinearity characteristics are modeled more efficiently as compared to their single regime variants, such as the GARCH, FIGARCH and FIAPGARCH models.

This article seeks to quantify these possible savings in the low-cost model compared to traditional companies using a database of 37226 passengers and methodology based on statistical causal inference and the generalized ordered logit model. The results show that LCC passengers are less likely to experience delays of 2hours or less, although the likelihood that they will have to endure long delays of over 3hours increases by almost 7.5%. Compared to the greater efficiency of LCCs in the daily movement of passengers averting the most common delays of up to 2hours, the intensive use of their airplanes results in their lesser ability to respond to unforeseen eventualities with no on-the-spot solution. The little cover that LCCs provide for delays is a strong incentive for their passengers to take out or extend their travel insurance, while airport F&B concessions can benefit from these longer waiting times.","[Castillo-Manzano, Jose I.; Lopez-Valpuesta, Lourdes] Univ Seville, Appl Econ & Management Res Grp, Seville 41018, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Castillo-Manzano, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Appl Econ & Management Res Grp, Seville 41018, Spain.",jignacio@us.es,"Castillo-Manzano, Jose I./F-8859-2015; Lopez Valpuesta, Lourdes Soledad/G-2322-2015","Castillo-Manzano, Jose I./0000-0003-4154-1500; Lopez Valpuesta, Lourdes Soledad/0000-0003-1808-1032",,,,,7,6,7,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We first estimate the cost and profit efficiency of the sample of listed banks using the non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. We then test both variables for co-integration and estimate the panel vector error-correction model to examine the long and short-term relationship between a bank's efficiency and stock returns. The results show that a bank's stock returns prices are co-integrated with both cost and profit efficiency, suggesting a long-term relationship between the two. The results also indicate the superiority of profit efficiency relative to cost efficiency in predicting stock returns in the ASEAN countries. Overall, we conclude both cost and profit efficiency contains useful information for shareholders who wish to explain bank stock returns.","[Chan, Sok-Gee] Univ Malaysia, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Bandar, Selangor, Malaysia; [Karim, Mohd Zaini Abd] Univ Utara Malaysia, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch Business, Kedah, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Chan, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Bandar, Selangor, Malaysia.",,"Chan, Sok-Gee/B-8349-2010",,,,,,27,3,3,0,13,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Seasonality and volatility are important features of tourism data, which makes it a particularly favourable context in which to compare the forecasting performance of linear models to that of nonlinear alternative approaches. Pre-processed official statistical data of overnight stays and tourist arrivals from all the different countries of origin to Catalonia from 2001 to 2009 is used in the study. When comparing the forecasting accuracy of the different techniques for different time horizons, autoregressive integrated moving average models outperform self-exciting threshold autoregressions and artificial neural network models, especially for shorter horizons. These results suggest that the there is a trade-off between the degree of pre-processing and the accuracy of the forecasts obtained with neural networks, which are more suitable in the presence of nonlinearity in the data. In spite of the significant differences between countries, which can be explained by different patterns of consumer behaviour, we also find that forecasts of tourist arrivals are more accurate than forecasts of overnight stays.

An equilibrium is stable whenever it is the unique outcome consistent with these assumptions. This is a strong stability criterion as it relies on noassumption of prior knowledge of others' expectations. This review presents various (in) stability results. It focuses on the following method: Rewrite the model as a temporary equilibrium map in which the current economic outcome is determined by expectations and characterize stability by contracting properties of this map. The main insight suggested by these results is due to Guesnerie (2002): Stability is obtained when the actual outcome is not very sensitive to expectations. Additional insights include that agents' heterogeneity is a source of instability; the ability of prices to transmit information is limited by the quality of private information; and coordination when agents are infinitely lived is difficult because of the large effect of long-run expectations.,"Univ Cergy Pontoise, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France",CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Desgranges, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France.",gabriel.desgranges@u-cergy.fr,,,,,,,47,2,2,0,8,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Choosing the European Union (EU)'s functioning at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) as case study, it shows that these opportunities are limited for various reasons, notably because of the functioning of both the former and the latter. The paper falls into two parts. The first part sets the scene; the second part formulates suggestions for measuring regional leadership at both the state and regional level. Presenting the status quo, section one reviews the main empirical and methodological conclusions regarding the use of voting cohesion in the study of the EU at the UN. Section two calculates the voting cohesion of the EU Member States for ten subsequent sessions of the UNGA covering the years between September 2002 and 2012 (i.e. Sessions 57-66). Taking a closer look at possible operationalizations for regional leadership at both state and regional level, sections three and four point at the importance of incorporating voting cohesion into more complex measurement instruments. The conclusion summarises the main findings and explores the way forward. (C)2013 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We adjust the data for outliers and structural breaks. We employ generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and exponential GARCH (EGARCH) specifications. Normality and homoskedasticity appear only in the GARCH or EGARCH model that corrects for the outliers. When including the break in the mean equation, high volatility persistence remains. After also accommodating the breaks in the variance equation, the integrated GARCH effect proves spurious, either for the symmetric or the asymmetric model. Finally, our empirical results suggest that the finding of higher output growth volatility stimulating output growth and higher output growth reducing its volatility obtained from the symmetric GARCH-in-mean (GARCH-M) model also proves spurious as a result of the emergence of an asymmetric effect. Our more appropriately specified asymmetric EGARCH-M model suggests positive volatility-in-mean and level effects in the long-period real gross national product series.","[Fang, WenShwo] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Miller, Stephen M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Feng Chia University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Miller, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, 4505 Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",wsfang@fcu.edu.tw; stephen.miller@unlv.edu,"Miller, Stephen M/H-8251-2019","Miller, Stephen M/0000-0002-6754-0605",,,,,89,7,7,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Secondly, we show that, from a Post-Keynesian perspective, the debt brake completely neglects the requirements for fiscal policies of member countries in a currency union like the Euro area. It will prevent fiscal policy from contributing to the necessary rebalancing in the Euro area. Thirdly, we show that alternative scenarios, which could avoid the deflationary pressures of the German Debt Brake on domestic demand and contribute to internally rebalancing the Euro area, are extremely unlikely as they would have to rely on unrealistic shifts in the functional income distribution and/or investment and savings behaviour in Germany.","[Hein, Eckhard; Truger, Achim] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Hein, E (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany.",eckhard.hein@hwr-berlin.de; achim.truger@hwr-berlin.de,"Hein, Eckhard/HQY-4102-2023","Hein, Eckhard/0000-0002-6542-6630",,,,,40,10,10,0,11,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2014,61.0,1,,,SI,,21,38,,10.2298/PAN1401021H,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AC4NZ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332499300003,0

Efficient allocation of resources in this public dominant health system is therefore paramount. This article uses a national database of hospital admissions to predict hospital demand. We find lagged information on patient demand imperative in formulating an easy to implement approach for predictive purposes. Contrasting predicted with actual demand, we construct an indicator of volatility in unexpected patient demand (at both the hospital and the disease chapter level) and assess its role with regard to patient outcomes. There is consistent evidence that when actual patient numbers exceed predicted, patients stay in hospital significantly longer and are more likely to have an acute readmission.","[Jiang, Nan; Pacheco, Gail] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Jiang, N (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand.",nan.jiang@aut.ac.nz,,"Pacheco, Gail/0000-0001-9988-0092",,,,,22,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Estimates of a standard Phillips curve indicate that a decline in inflation expectations, the negative output gap, and other factors such as a decline in import prices and a higher exchange rate all account for some of this development. These factors, in turn, reflect various underlying structural features of the Japanese economy. This paper examines a long list of these structural features that may explain Japan's chronic deflation, including the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate, public attitudes toward the price level, central bank communication, weaker growth expectations coupled with declining potential growth or the lower natural rate of interest, risk-averse banking behavior, deregulation, and the rise of emerging economies.","[Nishizaki, Kenji; Sekine, Toshitaka; Ueno, Yoichi] Bank Japan, Tokyo 1038660, Japan",Bank of Japan,"Sekine, T (通讯作者)，Bank Japan, Chuo Ku, 2-1-1 Nihonbashi Hongokucho, Tokyo 1038660, Japan.",toshitaka.sekine@boj.or.jp,,,,,,,35,19,21,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

In particular, Vietnamese authorities used WTO accession as an instrument to lock-in internal structural reforms, signal political stability to trade partners, and secure market access to Western consumer markets. Accession comes after a qualitative change in the export pattern (increased added value) that also meant new trade partners, mostly Western partners.

The method of the analysis is based on growth regressions where economic freedom is included in the set of explanatory variables, along with some other control factors. The dependent variable is gross domestic product per capita growth rate. In order to be robust to the selection of explanatory variables, the paper uses Bayesian model pooling applied to Blundell and Bond's generalized method of moments system estimator. Other contributions are: the use of 'overlapping' panel data in which subsequent observations cover observations from partly overlapping periods and the inclusion of nonlinearities. The results show that the level of and the change in economic freedom both reveal a positive and nonlinear relationship with economic growth.

The source of information is a basic dataset formed in the structure necessary for statistical analysis; the dataset was created by the project implementers. An empirical research has been conducted on the basic statistical file that contains information about all the companies in the Czech Republic, which merged in the last 10 years (2001-2010), and published in digital form financial statements in the collection of the Trade Register. We analyse temporal series reflecting the development of mergers in companies as divided by size and the role of the company in the merger process, measured by the number of mergers and volume of assets of the successor and the dissolved companies. Our research has proven that the Czech economic environment is dominated by the combinations where a larger company devours the smaller one with the objective to achieve a more advantageous position in the market and economies of scale. A closer dependence was found for development trends in the cases when the dissolved companies were larger than the successor company than in opposite cases.","[Sedlacek, Jaroslav; Valouch, Petr; Hyblova, Eva; Krizova, Zuzana] Masaryk Univ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Sedlacek, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",sedl@econ.muni.cz; valouch@econ.muni.cz; hyblova@econ.muni.cz; krizovaz@econ.muni.cz,"Sedláček, Jaroslav/AAF-8051-2021; Valouch, Petr/O-4251-2014","Sedláček, Jaroslav/0000-0001-6238-8619; Valouch, Petr/0000-0002-8755-4457",,,,,29,8,8,2,27,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In the widely used traditional POT method, the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is fitted to severity losses, while an empirical distribution is fitted to small to medium losses. Then, the Expected Loss and the 99.9% operational value-at-risk (OpVaR) are estimated. Additionally, the Expected Shortfall (ES) - a coherent risk measure - is estimated in this article as an alternative to OpVaR. These risk measures constitute the levels of regulatory and economic capitals to cover risks. With the improved POT method, the risks can be estimated more accurately than with the traditional POT method. The results indicate that the OpVaR are much lower than the ES and that the larger the tail losses the greater the difference between these two risk measures. Our findings imply that the ES would provide higher levels of capitals to cover risks than would the OpVaR, particularly during crises, and they have implications for the efficient OR management and regulators.","[Tursunalieva, Ainura; Silvapulle, Param] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University,"Silvapulle, P (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",param.silvapulle@monash.edu,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

International capital mobility affects output in each country directly through the size of domestic investment and indirectly through the aggregate saving rate. Under certain conditions, the indirect effect may dominate the direct effect so that international capital mobility raises output in the poor country and globally, although net capital flows are in the direction to the rich country. We also explore the welfare and distributional effects of international capital flows and show that the patterns of capital flows may reverse along the convergence process of a developing country.

The development of the private sector in Lithuania relied on the principles of free market, rather than on the principles of social market. This sets additional tasks in pursuance of a broader practical development of corporate social responsibility, which is significantly influenced by scientific insights and research. To achieve the aim, the aspects of theoretical research on corporate social responsibility in the Lithuanian studies on the topic are discussed with the purpose to form guidelines for broader future research. Assessing empirical research in private and public sector organisations in Lithuania, focused on social responsibility, the threats posed by the lack of integral development of social responsibility are distinguished. It is stated that the scientific thought in this case should become the coordinating factor for a wider three-party social-organisation-individual discussion; therefore, theoretical and empirical studies should focus on this relationship, with the view of axiological congruence as the point of contact, which could accelerate social responsibility innovations. When carrying out empirical research in Lithuania, private and public capital should be methodologically distinguished, since the latter provides the obligation to serve the public interest, which is a conceptual opposite to profit maximisation. Based on these positions, it would be meaningful to assess in further studies how the earnings of the public sector managed enterprises are generated and used in the context of social responsibility.","[Vveinhardt, Jolita; Andriukaitiene, Regina] Lithuanian Sports Univ, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University,"Vveinhardt, J (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Sporto St 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jolitaw@gmail.com; regina.andriukaitiene@gmail.com,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Andriukaitiene, Regina/AAC-8251-2022; Andriukaitiene, Regina/AAW-8584-2020; Andriukaitiene, Regina/AAA-2509-2019","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Andriukaitiene, Regina/0000-0002-0691-7333",,,,,61,13,13,0,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We analyse whether affordable (unaffordable) housing construction has changed in response to the past and contemporaneous construction of unaffordable (affordable) housing. Our empirical results reveal an asymmetric crowding-out pattern between affordable and unaffordable housing. We also observe that when urbanization rate is lower than 57.39%, unaffordable housing construction crowds out affordable housing construction.

However, in explaining this relationship, very little attention has been paid to the role of political competition. We hypothesize that the degree of proportionality of the electoral system has a direct and indirect impact on corruption, via the degree of electoral competition among political parties. The estimated results, on a sample of the 20 Italian regions over 26 years, show that both the direct and the indirect effects are relevant in explaining corruption. As the electoral system becomes more proportional, corruption directly decreases.

Issues in measuring innovation in the public sector,STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public sector; Innovation indicators; Cognitive testing; Surveys,DIFFUSION,"Interviews with 37 branch level managers in the Australian Federal Government were conducted to determine how managers understood the concept of innovation and their familiarity with different types of innovations. A follow-on survey found that 91% of branches introduced an innovation in the previous two years. This high rate suggests that many of the innovations could be minor. Extensive cognitive testing found that public sector managers can provide high quality estimates of the amount of person months expended on innovations and on other measures of the significance of an innovation. Using this information, the share of branches that introduced a significant innovation is approximately 60%. Although suggestive, there is no statistically significant difference in the time required to develop innovations derived from ideas provided by upper management or by lower level staff. These and other results are relevant to the design and interpretation of public sector innovation surveys. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

When comparative advantage is based on the abundance or scarcity of something that is costly to acquire, one expects rational behavior to respond to a change in prices by increasing that abundance or scarcity. To explore this issue in simple theoretical terms, this paper examines two types of simple growth model - a Solow Model with proportional saving, and a Ramsey model with optimal saving - to see whether this reasoning is born out. In the Ramsey model, it is. In the Solow model, on the other hand, results vary, but this should not be surprising, as the proportional saving assumption does not embody optimizing behavior. To the extent that we believe that aggregate saving behavior is indeed based on rational and fully informed optimization, we should therefore expect that the dynamic effects of trade do indeed operate in the direction of increasing comparative advaptage over time.

We decompose inequality for six countries (Canada, Germany, Norway, Sweden, the U.K., and the U.S.) into the three sources of market income (earnings, property income, and income from self-employment) and taxes and transfers. Our findings indicate that although changes in the distribution of earnings are an important force behind recent trends, they are not the only one. Greater earnings dispersion has in some cases been accompanied by a reduction in the share of earnings which dampened its impact on overall household income inequality. In some countries the contribution of self-employment income to inequality has been on the rise, while in others, increases in inequality in capital income account for a substantial fraction of the observed distributional changes.","[Garcia-Penalosa, Cecilia] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Orgiazzi, Elsa] Univ Rennes 1, F-35014 Rennes, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes,"García-Peñalosa, C (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Ctr Vieille Charite, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille, France.",cecilia.garcia-penalosa@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,54,36,36,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Many members of Congress often accuse China of being a currency manipulator. This paper has two objectives. First, it investigates the extent to which PAC contributions from key interest groups as well as constituent interests influence the frequency with which members of Congress criticize. China's exchange rate policy, controlling for other factors. The results indicate that the odds that a congressman will call China a currency manipulator are 1.35 times higher for every $5000 in PAC contributions from groups that favor legislation against China. In addition, the results show that a one percentage point increase in the share of the congressional district labor force in manufacturing is associated with a 19.6% increase in the likelihood that the district's legislator will label China a currency manipulator. Second, this paper investigates the consequences that currency manipulation bashing may have on the rate at which the RMB appreciates against the U.S. dollar. The results for a VAR model indicate that an increase in the incidence of currency manipulation bashing appears to temporarily slow down, rather than accelerate, the rate at which the renminbi appreciates against the dollar. This result suggests that bashing China may actually be counterproductive. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This cannot be seen as caused by religion as such, as there are now several democratic Muslim-majority states. Popular explanations such as values, culture, economic development, natural resources, or colonial legacy have been refuted. Based on Ostrom's approach regarding local groups' ability to establish institutions for 'governing the commons', we present a novel explanation for this puzzle, based on historical variations in institutions for financing religion. In Northwestern Europe, religion and secular services managed by local religious institutions have been financed 'from below', creating local systems for semi-democratic representation, transparency, and accountability. In the Arab-Muslim region, religion and local secular services have been financed 'from above', by private foundations lacking systems for representation and accountability. It is thus not religion, but how religion has been financed, that explains lacking successful democratization in the Arab-Muslim world.","[Rothstein, Bo; Broms, Rasmus] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Qual Govt Inst, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Rothstein, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Qual Govt Inst, Gothenburg, Sweden.",bo.rothstein@pol.gu.se; rasmus.broms@gu.se,,"Broms, Rasmus/0000-0002-2903-8198",,,,,85,15,16,0,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

It integrates R&D-based innovations into a unified growth framework with micro-founded fertility and schooling behavior. The theory suggests a refined view on the human factor in productivity growth. It helps to explain the historical emergence of R&D-based growth and the subsequent emergence of mass education and the demographic transition. The model predicts that the erstwhile positive correlation between population growth and innovative activity turns negative during economic development. This population-productivity reversal explains why innovative modern economies are usually characterized by low or negative population growth. Because innovations in modern economies are based on the education of the workforce, the medium-run prospects for future economic growth-when fertility is going to be below replacement level in virtually all developed countries-are better than suggested by conventional R&D-based growth theories.","[Strulik, Holger; Prettner, Klaus] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Prskawetz, Alexia] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Math Methods Econ, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Prskawetz, Alexia] Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Prskawetz, Alexia] Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital, Vienna, Austria",University of Gottingen; Technische Universitat Wien; Austrian Academy of Sciences,"Strulik, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",holger.strulik@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de; klaus.prettner@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de; afp@econ.tuwien.ac.at,,"Prettner, Klaus/0000-0002-8971-8750; Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,64,78,83,2,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Because house lock is likely to extend job search in the local labor market for homeowners whose home value has declined, I focus on differences in unemployment duration between homeowners and renters across geographic areas differentiated by the severity of the decline in home prices. The empirical analyses rely on microdata from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) files and on an econometric method that enables the estimation of individual and aggregate covariate effects on unemployment durations using repeated cross-section data.

The evolution of credit rules shapes economic networks between households, firms, banks, governments and central banks in space and time. The properties and characteristics of this evolutionary process are discussed in three sections. First, the author looks into the origins of the theory of money and its role for contemporary monetary economics. Second, he briefly discusses current theoretical foundations of top-down as well as bottom-up approaches to the banking-macro nexus, such as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium and agent-based models.

While the former leads to an increase in cost, the latter affects natural regeneration. To address both impacts, we investigate the relevance of resource extraction costs for a private property fishery in an intertemporal general equilibrium model with capital accumulation, commodity production and a labor market. We show how the extraction cost parameter-in addition to time preference, technology and natural regeneration-matters for the existence (and stability) of an economically feasible, nontrivial stationary state. Higher extraction costs increase the equilibrium resource stock, while a reduced regeneration rate (e.g. due to climate change) decreases the stock. Moreover, resource extraction overshoots its new equilibrium value after the cost shock while after a regeneration shock extraction levels adjust monotonically towards the new equilibrium.","[Bednar-Friedl, Birgit; Farmer, Karl] Graz Univ, Dept Econ, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Bednar-Friedl, B (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",birgit.friedl@uni-graz.at,"Bednar-Friedl, Birgit/F-3257-2016","Bednar-Friedl, Birgit/0000-0002-8348-4615",,,,,30,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

I find no effect of rainfall variation on the enrollment of boys and young girls. Moreover, I find that when schooling is free of charge and both marginal boys and girls are enrolled, a negative income shock has an adverse effect on the test scores of female students while boys are not affected. The results imply that households respond to income shocks by varying the amount of schooling and resources provided to girls while boys are to a large extent sheltered a finding consistent with a model where parents' values of child labor differ across sexes.

Water consumption elasticity to individual meters has changed from -0.307 to -1.317 with the introduction of per inhabitant tariffs, which demonstrates that there are water-saving synergies when the two measures are implemented together.

The IROM is suitable for risk-aversive planners under high-variability conditions. The IROM is applied to a case of energy systems and CO2 emission planning under uncertainty. The results obtained can generate desired decision alternatives that are able to not only enhance electricity-supply safety with a low system-failure risk level but also mitigate CO2 emissions. They can be used for generating decision alternatives and minimizing the system cost of energy system while meeting the CO2-emission permit requirement. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Based on this evidence, a theoretical model is presented and estimated to characterize the commodity convenience yield dynamics that are consistent with previous findings.

Giving rewards to contributors transforms the game but gives rise to a second-order dilemma. By allowing for coevolution of strategies and network structure, the evolutionary dynamics operate on both structure and strategy. Players learn with whom to interact and how to act and can overcome the second-order dilemma. More specifically, the network represents social distance which changes as players interact. Through the change in social distance, players learn with whom to interact, which we model using reinforcement dynamics. We find that, for certain parameter constellations, a social institution, prescribing prosocial behavior and thus solving the second-order dilemma, can emerge from a population of selfish players. Due to the dynamic structure of the network, the institution has an endogenous punishment mechanism ensuring that defectors will be excluded from the benefits of the institution and the public good will be supplied efficiently.","Univ Giessen, VWL VI, Dept Econ, D-38394 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Greiff, M (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, VWL VI, Dept Econ, Licher Str 66, D-38394 Giessen, Germany.",matthias.greiff@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,,"Greiff, Matthias/0000-0003-2855-2635",,,,,39,10,10,1,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Our article provides three sets of answers to this general question. First, it supports the conclusion in the literature that relativity leads to higher marginal tax rates. In doing so, it both generalizes some of the conditions under which this result is obtained in the literature and fleshes out the detailed structure for optimal marginal tax rates for specific functional forms for distribution, utility function, and social welfare function. Second, the article goes beyond the literature and examines the impact of relativity on the progression of optimal marginal tax rates. By and large, we find support for greater progressivity, defined as the steepness of the rise of the marginal tax rate schedule, as relativity concern increases. Third, none of the papers in the literature, to our knowledge, examines the interplay of relativity and inequality in determining the optimal structure of income taxes. Our special analytical cases and more general numerical calculations support the conclusion that higher inequality dampens the positive impact of greater relativity on the level and the progression of marginal tax rates. More work is needed to further explore this interaction between relativity and inequality that our analysis has uncovered.","Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Tuomala, Matti] Univ Tampere, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland",Cornell University,"Tuomala, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland.",matti.tuomala@kolumbus.fi,,,,,,,41,27,28,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Using security-level transaction data related to four distinct programs over a period of roughly four years, we test for the presence of flow effects in both price and liquidity of Treasury securities.

Thus nominal rates of interest should be zero. This logic has been shown to be correct in a number of contexts, with and without various distortions. In practice, however, economies that have confronted very low nominal rates of interest over extended periods have been viewed as performing very poorly rather than as performing very well. Examples include the U.S. during the Great Depression, or Japan during the last decade. Indeed economies experiencing low nominal interest rates have often suffered severe and long-lasting recessions. This observation suggests that the logic of the Friedman rule needs to be reassessed. We consider the possibility that low nominal rates of interest imply that fiat money is a good asset. As a result, agents are induced to hold an excessive amount of savings in the form of money, and a sub-optimal amount of savings in other, more productive forms. Hence low nominal interest rates can lead to low rates of investment and, in an endogenous growth model, to low rates of real growth. This is a cost of following the Friedman rule. Benefits of following the Friedman rule include the possibility that banks will provide considerable liquidity, reducing the cost of transactions that require cash. With this trade-off, we describe conditions under which the Friedman rule is and is not optimal. Finally, our model predicts that excessively high rates of inflation, and nominal rates of interest, are detrimental to growth. This implication of the model, which is consistent with observation, in turn implies that there is a nominal rate of interest that maximizes an economy's real growth rate. We characterize this interest rate, and we describe when it is and is not optimal to drive the nominal rate of interest to its growth maximizing level.","[Paal, Beatrix] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Smith, Bruce D.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Paal, B (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",bsmith@eco.utexas.edu,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,13,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

While providing high quality unpaid, or left side results attracts users, doing so can also cannibalize the revenue that comes from paid ads on the right side. This paper examines this tradeoff, focusing, in particular, on the role of users' post-search interaction with the websites whose links are displayed. In the model, high quality left side results boost demand from users, causing them to tolerate a search engine on which advertisers do not offer the lowest possible prices for the goods that they sell. However, because websites appearing on the left side still have an incentive to compete in the same market as advertisers, an increase in quality on the left side may reduce advertisers equilibrium prices. I analyze the circumstances under which this will occur and discuss the model's potential implications for antitrust policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In general, global climate change is expected to positively affect Russian agriculture. In high and middle latitudes, global warming would expand the growing season. Acreages of agricultural crops may expand toward the north, although yields would likely be lower due to less fertile soil. However, in the south there is a possibility of drier climate, which has a negative impact on crop yields and livestock productivity. In addition, climate change is expected to increase the scarcity of water resources and encourage weed and pest proliferation, and it is expected to increase the short-term risks associated with an increase in extreme weather events and natural disasters. This paper uses data on current conditions to simulate future scenarios and examine possible impacts on crop production in the Russian Federation.

Variations in the growth rate of value added - decomposed in the growth rate of the number of establishments and the growth rate in average size - of manufacturing industries in 34 developing countries before and after trade liberalisation are used to study the effects of inequality on the difference in growth under liberalised and nonliberalised regimes. The results show that the number of firms in industries with high dependence on external finance in countries with higher inequality grow significantly slower, in both statistical and economic terms, than in industries with low dependence on external finance in countries with lower inequality following a trade liberalisation relative to the closed-economy period.

We elicit subjects' beliefs, risk and other-regarding preferences. Our design also allows us to examine the behavior of subjects in both roles, to determine whether the behavior in one role is the best response to the subject's own behavior in the other role. The results of the experiment indicate that, when acting as senders, the majority of subjects adopt deceptive strategies by sending favorable message when the true state of the nature is unfavorable. When acting as receivers, the majority of subjects invest conditional upon receiving a favorable message. The investing behavior of receivers cannot be explained by risk preferences or as a best response to subject's own behavior in the sender's role. However, it can be rationalized by accounting for elicited beliefs and other-regarding preferences. Finally, the honest behavior of some senders can be explained by other-regarding preferences. Thus, we that find liars do believe, and that individuals who care about the payoffs of others tend to be honest. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, this puzzle is regularly challenged by new developments in the specification of the gravity equation or in its estimations. We propose an original survey on the existing methods used to quantify the distance puzzle - basically the computation of an average distance of trade, a meta-analysis on existing gravity papers and the implementation of recent econometric developments, all on a well-specified gravity equation both in cross-section and panel data. We apply all these methods to a unique large database (124 countries from 1970 to 2006). It appears that if all these new developments can change the amplitude of the increase in the trade elasticity to distance, none solve the distance puzzle. We confirm the existence of this puzzle and identify that it only applies to low-income countries which exhibit a significant rising distance effect on their trade of around 18% between 1970 and 2006 while the distance puzzle' for trade within richer countries disappears.","[Carrere, Celine; de Melo, Jaime] Univ Geneva, FERDI, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Wilson, John] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",University of Geneva; The World Bank,"Carrère, C (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, FERDI, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,48,19,19,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Lachmann's entrepreneurs are creatively constructive change-agents who discover, exploit and create gaps in capital structures. Entrepreneurs select and interpret specific market and institutional phenomena using pre-existent rules and mental `instruments', extract meaning about capital-forming opportunities, and generate all subsequent capital combinations. Lachmannian entrepreneurs are problem-solvers and communicate problem 'solutions' by dissolving and reforming capital combinations. We examine 20th-century Lachmannian research that builds on these foundations research that emphasizes the institutional and material embeddedness of entrepreneurial behaviour and that appreciates the capacity of Lachmann's approach to explain entrepreneurial success, imitation and failure in a dynamic endogenous process. To underscore the distinctiveness of the Lachmannian entrepreneur, we compare it with Schumpeterian and Kirznerian approaches. Without... the steady action of the entrepreneurs in specifying the uses of capital and modifying such decisions, as the forces of change unfold, a civilized economy could not survive at all.","[Endres, Anthony M.] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Harper, David A.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",University of Auckland; New York University,"Endres, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",a.endres@auckland.ac.nz; david.harper@nyu.edu,"Harper, David A/U-3706-2018","Harper, David A/0000-0002-4716-3638",,,,,70,21,23,1,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Whether public or private investors, they need to have an optimal return on their investment given the finite resources. In relatively new sectors like grid-connected renewable energy, many investors face difficulty in assessing proper return, making them more averse to financing such projects, affecting transborder project development opportunities. In developing countries like South Africa, which has tremendous potential for renewable energy projects, an arbitrary choice of the required rate of return for project evaluations can negatively affect funding decisions. This paper explores an index-based model to make fair estimates of the required equity benchmark internal rate of return (IRR) using financial markets observation for renewable energy projects in South Africa. The index-based model is parsimonious and captures common macroeconomic factors. More specifically, it provides a simple and effective mechanism to calculate IRR for renewable energy projects given different gestation periods.","[Fay, John] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-8001 Cape Town, South Africa; [Kumar, Umesh] State Univ New York Canton, Dept Econ, Canton, NY USA",University of Cape Town; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Canton,"Fay, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Portswood Rd, ZA-8001 Cape Town, South Africa.",john.fay@gsb.uct.ac.za,,,,,,,26,2,3,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Here, I examine the welfare impact of MFC clauses under endogenous product variety. Product variety is relevant because prospective higher prices from MFC clauses can be anticipated by multi-product firms in their provision of product lines. Under such circumstances, I find that these clauses can be socially harmful, but this is not always the case: they tend to be socially neutral for relatively large fixed costs of product-line assortment, harmful for intermediate costs, and beneficial for relatively small costs.

Survey evidence by Graham and Harvey (2001) indicates that Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) consider credit ratings as the second most important determinant of financing policy. If credit ratings are indeed important, we should observe that firms facing a potential downgrade should react by reducing debt financing in an attempt to avert the potential rating downgrade. In the case of a potential upgrade, we should also observe a scaling back of debt financing to reinforce the rating upgrade. We find evidence for the latter but for potential downgrade firms, contrary to expectations; we find that these firms issue more debt relative to equity. Overall, we conclude that while credit ratings may be a consideration in determining corporate financing policy, it is probably a secondary determinant.","[Kemper, Kristopher J.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Eau Claire, WI 54702 USA; [Rao, Ramesh P.] Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Finance, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",University of Wisconsin System; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Rao, RP (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Finance, 309 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",ramesh.rao@okstate.edu,"Rao, Ramesh P/HTO-1523-2023","Rao, Ramesh P/0000-0003-1174-477X",,,,,4,6,6,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

However, there does not exist a similar condition for social choice correspondences that are implementable in strong equilibrium.

In each period, the retailer based on his inventory needs to determine a payment function (a procurement contract) according to which a number of potential suppliers compete in the reverse auction. We show the existence of the retailer's optimal payment function and find that the suppliers' Bayesian-Nash equilibrium bidding strategy is similar to the base-stock policy in the traditional multi-period inventory control problems when the retailer incurs no fixed setup cost, while similar to the (s, S) policy when the retailer incurs a fixed setup cost. This strategy is for the suppliers, instead of for the retailer, depends on the supplier's marginal cost and so is stochastic for the retailer. Thus, this paper extends well beyond traditional procurement environments studied so far in the inventory control literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Energy resource world markets are investigated as an offsetting mechanism possibly coordinating emission fluctuations between countries. The results of the analysis provide evidence that world energy resource markets are acting as a coordinating mechanism for emission fluctuations in most cases. The results also suggest that until recently the dominant emission co-fluctuation pattern for developed countries differs from the dominant emission co-fluctuation pattern for developing countries. The common fluctuation pattern found in the 1984-2000 time period suggests that an offsetting mechanism does exist and will help contain global per capita emissions into the future. The strong degree that emissions are linked between countries and energy markets acting as an offsetting mechanism suggests that to be successful a global agreement to address climate change must require emission reductions by all major emitters, not just the developed countries.

I argue that this tendency is troubling; putting a price on every human activity erodes certain moral and civic goods worth caring about. We therefore need a public debate about where markets serve the public good and where they don't belong. In this article, I would like to develop a related theme: When it comes to deciding whether this or that good should be allocated by the market or by nonmarket principles, economics is a poor guide. Deciding which social practices should be governed by market mechanisms requires a form of economic reasoning that is bound up with moral reasoning. But mainstream economic thinking currently asserts its independence from the contested terrain of moral and political philosophy. If economics is to help us decide where markets serve the public good and where they don't belong, it should relinquish the claim to be a value-neutral science and reconnect with its origins in moral and political philosophy.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Sandel, MJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",msandel@gov.harvard.edu,,,,,,,48,98,113,3,46,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This article argues that this assertion is factually wrong. Working with the same data used to make the assertion, the article shows that the competitiveness loss view is the result of several misleading assumptions. When using a proper definition of competitiveness, the data reveal that whatever loss occurred was being corrected before the crisis erupted and was completely eliminated within three years. It also provides evidence that competitiveness changes have been endogenous to demand shocks.

For analyzing these relationships, we consider an economy where three sectors of production are vertically integrated: final goods sector, intermediate goods sector and research sector. We show that the extent of imperfect competition in the intermediate products market affects both economic growth and the allocation of the available labor to all the sectors employing this input. The resources from capital taxation, which are used for financing research sector, have a U-shaped effect on growth and lead to a movement of the labor from research sector to final goods sector. Additionally, we show that if there exists a higher competitive structure in an economy, the probability of the positive effect of an increase in tax on growth gets higher. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The main result concerns the regular structure of the core that enables a simple characterization of the nucleolus. However, compared to the Shapley value, the nucleolus defines compensations that appear to be less appropriate in the context of data sharing.

Based on Chen et al. (2007), we consider a bidder's negative abnormal announcement-period return as a measure for bad merger. To investigate the investor trading behaviours around the bad mergers, we employ a unique daily trading data of different groups of investors in Korean stock market. Our finding shows that institutional investors sell their shares on a bidding firm before announcement of a bad merger, while individual investors buy the shares. In addition, we find that institutional investors continue to sell their shares on a bidding firm even after announcement of a bad merger, but individual investors keep buying them. Hence, our results newly support the hypothesis that individual investors are less informed and/or less sophisticated than institutional investors.","[Han, Areum; Chung, Chune Young] Kookmin Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 136702, South Korea",Kookmin University,"Chung, CY (通讯作者)，Kookmin Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 136702, South Korea.",cychung@kookmin.ac.kr,,,,,,,12,8,8,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

To answer this question, we study the post-unification trajectory of convergence between East and West German individuals with regard to trust, cooperation, and risk. Our hypotheses are derived from a model of German unification that incorporates individual responses both to incentives and to values inherited from earlier generations as recently suggested in the literature. Using two waves of balanced panel data, we find that despite twenty years of unification East Germans are still characterized by a persistent level of social distrust. In comparison to West Germans, they are less inclined to see others as cooperative. East Germans are also found to have been more risk loving than West Germans. However, risk attitudes fully converged recently. Journal of Comparative Economics 41 (3) (2013) 789-803.

The original contribution is on developing some joint coefficient-based tests, obtained by rewriting the UIP, the EXPPP and the RIP as a set of cross-equation restrictions in a vector autoregression (VAR) framework. Test results point to a forward premium bias in both the UIP and the EXPPP. The latter result is novel in the literature and stems from testing the PPP in expectational terms. Moreover, the results suggest a currency-dependent pattern for the UIP, contrarily to the EXPPP equation. Finally, it is shown that conditioning the VAR on M3 growth differential has important explanatory power in resolving the aforementioned biases in both the UIP and EXPPP equations for the UK vs US data. At the same time, variables having a strong forward-looking component (i.e. share prices) help recover a unitary coefficient in the UIP equation.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Macchiarelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",c.macchiarelli@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Our focus is on the optimal distribution of administrative costs between polluters and the government and the optimal level of the emissions tax in relation to marginal pollution damage. We demonstrate how the policy variables affect aggregate equilibrium administrative costs and show that these effects are generally indeterminate, as is the effect of the distribution of administrative costs on aggregate emissions.

The numerical method is flexible enough to solve a model with several state variables, to discuss the effect of risk aversion, and to take into account uncertainty in the size of reserves. Optimal extraction in the baseline model is found to be volatile. If the oil producer is risk averse, production is more stable, but spare capacity is much higher than what is typically observed. We show that decisions are very sensitive to expectations on the equilibrium oil price using a mean reverting model of the oil price where the equilibrium price is also a random variable. Oil production was cut during the 2008-2009 crisis, and we find that the cut in production was larger for OPEC members, for countries facing a lower discount rate, and for countries whose governments' finances are less dependent on oil revenues. However, the net present value of a country's oil reserves would be increased significantly (by 100%, in the most extreme case) if production was cut completely when prices fall below the country's threshold price. If several producers were to adopt such strategies, world oil prices would be higher but more stable. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Snakes are processes whose sequencing is dictated by engineering; spiders involve the assembly of parts in no particular order. This paper studies spatial unbundling as frictions fall, showing that outcomes are very different for snakes and spiders, even if they share some features. Both snakes and spiders have in common a property that lower frictions produce discontinuous location changes and 'overshooting'. Parts may move against their comparative costs because of proximity benefits, and further reductions in frictions lead these parts to be 'reshored'. Predictions for trade volumes and the number of fragmented stages are quite different in the two cases. For spiders, a part crosses borders at most twice; the value of trade increases monotonically as frictions fall, except when the assembler relocates and the direction of parts trade is reversed. For snakes the volume of trade and number of endogenously determined stages is bounded only by the fragmentation of the underlying engineering process, and lower frictions monotonically increase trade volumes.

Based on input- and output-oriented DEA models, overall technical efficiency was estimated for the sector, and both radial and slack adjustments were calculated. The course of the dynamic adjustments was identified and presented for factor inputs over the past decade. The results show that the radial adjustments have exhibited a decreasing trend, while structural, slack adjustments have practically disappeared. The course of the dynamic adjustments suggests that there has been a transformation from labor-intensive to land-intensive and capital-intensive operations which will continue to dominate China's wheat production sector. As a consequence, to optimize factor inputs and reduce radical and slack adjustments, it seems necessary that the major wheat producing areas reduce labor inputs; enhance land-intensive operations; and increase agricultural mechanization.

Several states, however, had previously allowed pharmacy access to emergency contraception. In particular, Washington State was the first state to implement such a program in 1998. If emergency contraception is used as a substitute for a surgical abortion, then pharmacy access could reduce unintended pregnancy. Pharmacy access, however, could lead to an increase in risk taking, especially among teens or young adults, and hence lead to increased rates of sexually transmitted diseases. In this article, we use county-level data as well as specific timing of changes in pharmacy access to consider the intended and unintended consequences of pharmacy access to emergency contraception in Washington. The results indicate that while county-level access to emergency contraception was unrelated to trends in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and abortions before access changed, access afterwards led to a statistically significant increase in STD rates (gonorrhea rates), both overall and for females. We do not find, however, an impact of pharmacy access on abortion or birth rates. These results are robust to several specification tests (including use of Oregon counties as additional control counties) as well as several falsification tests.

It examines how China's education policy reflects the country's unique dual economy. Focusing on the post-reform period, the paper contends that while progress has been made, there are risks to China's future growth prospects from failing to reap the benefits of sound education policy. It argues that if the Chinese education system is to continue to be a driver of rather than a drain on economic growth, and if China is to successfully manage its transition towards more inclusive, sustainable and equitable growth, reforms will be needed to improve the quality of education at all levels and to create an environment in which China's extensive human capital is duly recognized and respected. Crucially, the education system should be transformed to ensure it promotes a comprehensive range of human capabilities, including those that go beyond the part humans play in augmenting production possibilities.","[Glazebrook, Kate] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Song, Ligang] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Harvard University; Australian National University,"Song, LG (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",kate_glazebrook@hks14.harvard.edu; ligang.song@anu.edu.au,,"Song, Ligang/0000-0002-5700-2352",,,,,61,5,6,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL,2013,21.0,4,,,,,56,78,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12028.x,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,180BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321566600004,0

While these household level remittance flows have often been associated with poverty alleviation, positive welfare gains and even as an alternate source of development finance, a detailed study of the effects of these flows on a remittance-dependent small developing economy, however shows counterintuitive results. The paper applies the Dutch Disease theory to explain the effects of remittances on the economy and introduces a micro-macro framework to establish channels of transmission of remittances through the economy. The paper shows that international remittances, by altering the household budget constraint, have a direct impact on the micro level household decision making, primarily with respect to the consumption and labor supply decisions. These when aggregated give rise to significant adjustments in the macro level production functions and consumption behaviors, leading to a decline in the output, particularly of the trading sector and an adverse impact on the external sector of the economy.

The effect of geographical mobility is always small: Using pre-recession mobility rates, decreased mobility can account for only an 11 basis points increase in the unemployment rate over the period. Using dynamics of renter geographical mobility in this period to calculate homeowner counterfactual mobility, delivers similar results.

We use an HOSV kind of framework to prove whether trade liberalization necessarily leads to a decline in intermediation activities.

This paper examines the effectiveness of a public policy geared towards the reduction of gender inequality. The national Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostics Techniques (PNDT) Act of 1994, implemented in 1996, banned sex-selective abortions in India. Although demographers frequently mention the futility of the Act, we are among the first to evaluate the law using a treatment-effect analysis framework. Using village and town level longitudinal data from the 1991 and 2001 censuses, we find a significantly positive impact of the PNDT Act on female-to-male child sex ratio. Given the almost ubiquitous decline in the observed child sex ratio during this period, we argue that the law was successful in preventing any further worsening of the gender imbalance. We find that a possible absence of the law would have led to at least 106,000 fewer female children. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I show how to implement Pareto optima as equilibria when agents can trade claims to consumption contingent on aggregate shocks in financial markets. The first result is that if aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks are independent, the implementation of optimal allocations does not require any interventions in financial markets. This result can be extended to dynamic settings in the sense that, in this case, only savings need to be distorted, but not trades in financial markets. Second, I characterize optimal trading distortions in financial markets when aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks are not independent. In this case, optimal asset taxes must be higher for those securities that pay out in aggregate states in which consumption is more volatile. For instance, this can provide an efficiency justification for the frequently observed differential tax treatment of different asset classes, such as debt and equity claims. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

China is taken as an example to measure its oil import security during 1993-2011 and to identify the main risk factors in different periods. Results indicate that China's oil import risks have kept rising since 1993 and face multiple potential threats from each stage of oil import supply chain, among which the threat from external dependence has become the biggest challenge. Under different economic situations and changing energy environment, the risk factors affecting China's oil import security switched among different stages of the supply chain, showing a phase-transitioning characteristic from import over-dependence to increasing external supply pressure. The threat of external supply has become a new risk since the pressure of decreasing availability of external resource rose. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These techniques yield high levels of accuracy, but have the drawback of requiring the inversion of large full system matrices. In the present paper, by combining Gaussian radial basis functions with a suitable operator splitting scheme, a new RBF method is developed in which the inversion of large system matrices is avoided. The method proposed is applied to five different problems which concern the pricing of European and American options under both the Black-Scholes and the Heston models. The results obtained reveal that the novel RBF scheme is accurate and fast, and performs fairly better than the finite difference approach. Finally, the RBF method proposed is very versatile, and, just like finite difference schemes, can be used to solve an infinite variety of models and problems, not only in the finance area but also in other fields of science and engineering.

Foreign ownership and net-export intensity are not significant determinants of technical efficiency inthe parts sub-sector. Although majority foreign ownership is not allowed in the assembly sub-sector, this sub-sector is large, with asmall number of establishments generating scale economies in the automotive industry.

The objective is to offer a fresh view of economic policy and performance through the lens of the threat posed by social instability. This is a concept that economists rarely analyse, and yet it can lurk behind much economic policy-making. China's leadership has often publicly expressed its concern to avoid 'social instability'. It is viewed as a threat both to the political order and to the continued rapid growth of the economy. This threat to growth in turn endangers the maintenance of social stability. The paper examines the likely economic determinants of social instability, using both surveys and other evidence. After discussing the determinants of China's rapid growth, the paper goes on to examine the likely mechanisms by which social instability can affect the growth rate. There is a case for more research on the role of social instability in the economic development process. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

First, parental experiences of a nonagricultural family business before collectivization have a positive and statistically significant effect on offspring's family wealth. Second, the offspring of landlord/rich peasant and middle peasant families are more likely to have higher family wealth than poor and lower-middle peasant families.

J,"Scott, R; Pressman, S",,,,"Scott, Robert; Pressman, Steven",,,Household Debt and Income Distribution,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES,,,English,Article,,,,,,household debt; poverty; income inequality; middle class,,"Our previous work argued that the official U.S. poverty definition is flawed because it ignores interest paid on household debt. When it was developed in the early 1960s, this was not a problem because U.S. households had little consumer debt. Today, most households have considerable consumer debt and are paying high interest rates on that debt. This paper argues that what is true of poverty is likewise true of income inequality indices, such as the gini coefficient and the percentage of middle-class families. Interest payments on past debt reduce the income that households have to maintain a certain standard of living. A problem (such as a bout of unemployment, the expenses of having a new baby, or a health problem) leads to borrowing that tends to reduce household living standards in the long run. This phenomenon is not captured in standard measures of income equality. We then use the Survey of Consumer Finances to correct this problem, estimating income inequality both before and after subtracting interest payments on consumer debt. Finally, we discuss why these different measures have increased over time and conclude with some policy proposals to deal with the problem of substantial consumer debt interest payments.","[Scott, Robert; Pressman, Steven] Monmouth Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, West Long Branch, NJ USA",Monmouth University,"Scott, R (通讯作者)，Monmouth Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, West Long Branch, NJ USA.",,,,,,,,14,8,11,3,34,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The soldiers were asked to answer questionnaires regarding their time preferences, and dispositional optimism. We found that the soldiers have a higher subjective discount rate on Thursday when they need money for weekend activities. In addition, we found that optimism, being a firstborn sibling, having parents with higher earnings, and time remaining until discharge are negatively related to subjective discount rate. Conversely, having a balanced bank account is positively related to subjective discount rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Simple comparisons of households with maids and those without suggest that maids raise the participation rate of their female employers by 26 percentage points. However, such comparisons are not directly comparable. Households employing maids differ in many ways from those that do not. When propensity score matching methods are used to estimate the treatment effect of having a foreign maid, the female labor force participation rate is estimated to be only 18 percentage points higher in 1993/1994 and 13 percentage points higher in 2004/2005. This decline over time in the treatment effect is not apparent when simpler but potentially biased methods are used.

However, they have not facilitated intra-regional trade as much as their supporters have suggested. The complexities of rules of origin - part and parcel of all preferential agreements - have resulted in low utilization rates in Asia. The key driver of trade integration in Asia has instead been the rise of China. In the past two decades, China has managed to establish itself as the indispensable trading partner in the region. In 2011, China ran a trade deficit with its neighbouring countries whilst running surpluses with the USA and the EU. At the same time, deeper trade integration in Asia, e. g. an Asian wide customs union, appears to be an unrealistic goal. At this juncture, the political obstacles that hinder a deepening of co-operation are formidable.

This has led to an appreciable improvement in development levels, albeit off a small base. However, these patterns are still dominated by commodity flows and investment, and remain marginal on the global stage. Increased trade and investment flows, particularly related to network services, would be of great benefit to the sub-continent. Yet many domestic regulatory constraints remain. Furthermore, substantial international market distortions, particularly in agricultural trade, inhibit economic diversification into more value-adding activities. The Doha development round could, if concluded, go a long way towards addressing these barriers.

The latter, whilst important, is shallow and too reliant on institution-intensive forms mimicking the European Union.

The underlying hypothesis is that the presence of comorbid obesity and hypertension poses an additional burden on patients with diabetes, thus impacting their overall resource utilization. More than one-third of diabetes patients suffer from comorbid obesity and hypertension, which outnumbers diabetes patients with neither or only one of these comorbidities. The results of multivariate regressions clearly show the significant impact these comorbidities have on the health-care expenditures of the diabetes population. For example, a person with diabetes and obesity has health-care expenditures 14% greater than a diabetes patient without obesity. Adding hypertension to a diabetes patient raises health-care expenditures by 26%. Finally, diabetes patients with both comorbid obesity and hypertension the fastest growing group of diabetes patients have health-care expenditures 40% higher than those without these comorbidities. Our results indicate that diabetes patients are placing an increasing strain on health-care resources, and health-care providers should consider the management of comorbid hypertension and/or obesity, as these have significant effects on resource utilization and expenditures beyond the underlying diabetes condition.","[Condliffe, Simon] W Chester Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Econ & Finance, W Chester, PA 19383 USA; [Link, Charles R.] Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Parasuraman, Shreekant] AstraZeneca, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Wilmington, DE 19850 USA; [Pollack, Michael F.] HealthCore, Hlth Plan Res, Wilmington, DE 19801 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); West Chester University of Pennsylvania; University of Delaware; AstraZeneca,"Condliffe, S (通讯作者)，W Chester Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Econ & Finance, W Chester, PA 19383 USA.",scondliffe@wcupa.edu,,,,,,,7,9,9,0,86,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We use a two-step design. In the first step, the proportions of job seekers to be assigned to treatment (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%) were randomly drawn for each of the 235 labor markets (e.g., cities) participating in the experiment. Then, in each labor market, eligible job seekers were randomly assigned to the treatment, following this proportion. After eight months, eligible, unemployed youths who were assigned to the program were significantly more likely to have found a stable job than those who were not. But these gains are transitory, and they appear to have come partly at the expense of eligible workers who did not benefit from the program, particularly in labor markets where they compete mainly with other educated workers, and in weak labor markets. Overall, the program seems to have had very little net benefits.

To assess this empirically, we investigate the impact of various components of economic liberalisation on the performance of firms from Central and Eastern European countries from 1998 to 2006. The impact of reforms on profitability vis-A-vis productivity differs, which we interpret as an indication that profitability is an ambiguous measure of performance: one needs to distinguish between unproductive rents and productivity-based quasi-rents. We find that competition-enhancing liberalisation measures have more impact on state owned firms as compared with domestic and foreign owned firms.

Starting from a benchmark equilibrium which reflects the current German family policy regime we introduce various reforms of the tax and child benefit system and quantify the consequences for birth rates and female labor supply. Our simulations indicate three central results: First, higher transfers to families (either direct, in-kind or via family splitting) may increase birth rates significantly, but they may come at the cost of lower female employment. Second, the introduction of individual taxation (instead of joint taxation of couples) would increase female employment but might further reduce current birth rates in Germany. Third, it is possible to increase birth rates and female employment rates simultaneously if the government invests in child care facilities for children of all ages.","[Fehr, Hans; Ujhelyiova, Daniela] Univ Wurzburg, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Fehr, H (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Dept Econ, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",hans.fehr@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,,43,10,12,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

This paper provides a statistical analysis of the determinants of attitudes towards foreigners and analyzes the factors associated with changes in anti-foreigner sentiment among European citizens. The paper concludes that while rising racial prejudice accounts for a substantial portion of the trend in anti-foreigner sentiment, economic conditions also matter, with economic strain leading to more negative attitudes. At the same time, educational attainment is shown to be a strong antidote to anti-foreigner attitudes. Both rising average schooling and more positive attitudes towards foreigners by the highly educated have led to a reversal of the climbing anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe.

The reason is that tournaments allow the principal to trade insurance for lower income to the agents. Our analysis shows that this celebrated result does not carry over to the case when a limited liability (bankruptcy) constraint limits the payments the principal can make, provided that the liquidation value of the firm is sufficiently small. This finding has important implications for the vast number of limited liability firms. Even though limited liability becomes an issue for different ranges of liquidation values under the two schemes, tournaments are still superior when the liquidation value of the firm is intermediate or large, even though the limited liability constraint is still binding for intermediate values. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the price of output strengthens the need for tournaments by expanding the range of liquidation values over which tournaments are dominant, because price uncertainty introduces additional bankruptcy risk. These findings provide insight into policy implications in the contracting out of services by state and local governments, in procurement, in rent-seeking contests and in tournaments used by HMOs.

Substituting carbon taxes for labour taxes can reduce GHG emissions and enhance welfare by improving the efficiency of the tax system - a strong double dividend. The analyses confirm, when capital is not internationally mobile, that a double dividend is likely to occur under (i) a high elasticity of labour supply, (ii) high elasticities of substitution between labour and the capital-energy aggregate, (iii) low elasticities of substitution between capital and energy.

LTF holds that financial markets are legally constructed and as such occupy an essentially hybrid place between state and market, public and private. At the same time, financial markets exhibit dynamics that frequently put them in direct tension with commitments enshrined in law or contracts. This is the case especially in times of financial crisis when the full enforcement of legal commitments would result in the self-destruction of the financial system. This law-finance paradox tends to be resolved by suspending the full force of law where the survival of the system is at stake; that is, at its apex. It is here that power becomes salient.

Input-output analysis is largely used to fulfill this objective. Furthermore, information provided by the Leontief inverse matrix is useful for the identification of key sectors. This identification may guide policy makers in setting an adequate industrial strategy. In this paper, the classification of productive sectors is performed by using the Unweighted Rassmussen Approach. The ordering of sectors depends on the intensity of their links with other sectors. Two results ought to be highlighted. First, key sectors of the Moroccan economy (sectors that are classified in category II) reduced to two sectors in 2007 instead of four sectors in 1998. Second, the ordering of sectors is highly sensitive to the precision of the data and to the year in which the classification is realized.","[Tounsi, Said; Ezzahid, El Hadj] Mohammed V Agdal Univ, Rabat, Morocco; [El Alaoui, Aicha] Sultan Moulay Slimane Univ, Beni Mellal, Morocco; [Nihou, Abdelaziz] High Planning Commiss, Rabat, Morocco",Mohammed V University in Rabat; Sultan Moulay Slimane University of Beni Mellal,"Ezzahid, E (通讯作者)，Mohammed V Agdal Univ, Rabat, Morocco.",ezzahidelhadj@yahoo.fr,"EL ALAOUI, Aicha/R-7728-2017",,,,,,21,0,0,1,24,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 26,2013,7.0,,,,,,,,201318.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-18,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,185JP,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321964100001,0

We derive the equilibrium pricing and enforcement rules for a n-region economy. We show that under mild conditions on the pattern of substitution between spillover goods and contrary to the 2-region case, the decentralized equilibrium cannot be Pareto improved by coordinated policy changes. However, decentralized equilibria are suboptimal from the point of view of utilitarian welfare. We characterize the direction of the distortion for this case. The regions' incentives for user-fee enforcement are ambiguous in general. With only two regions and if regions only charge non-residents, however, there is overinvestment in user-fee enforcement in the decentralized equilibrium. For the case of a Tullock enforcement function and linear demand for the spillover goods we show that welfare is u-shaped in a parameter that measures the technological advantage of user-fee enforcement.","[Fuest, Clemens] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Kolmar, Martin] Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of Oxford; University of St Gallen,"Kolmar, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ, Varnbuelstr 19, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",martin.kolmar@unisg.ch,,,ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,20,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Evidence is found that trading volume Granger causes stock return in quantiles and the causal effects of volume are heterogeneous across quantiles. This shows that volume carries some information to the return and could be interpreted in light of theoretical models. In addition, we find that there is bi-directional causality between stock return and trading volume in most of the markets. The finding indicates that those Asian emerging markets with different institutions and information flows than more mature markets have present similar causal effects on the stock returnvolume relation. Furthermore, the cross-country evidence shows that the US market helps to predict the returns of the emerging Asian markets.","Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 116, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Lin, HY (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 116, Taiwan.",linh@nccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,19,20,0,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

A panel dataset based on the Italian NAMEA (National Accounting Matrix including Environmental Accounts) over 1990-2007 is analyzed, focusing on both emissions efficiency (EKC model) and total emissions (IPAT model). Results show that, looking at sector evidence, both decoupling and also eventually re-coupling trends could emerge along the path of economic development. The overall performance on greenhouse gases, here CO2, is not compliant with Kyoto targets. SOx and NOx show decreasing patterns, though the shape is affected by some outlier sectors with regard to joint emission-productivity dynamics. Services tend to present stronger delinking patterns across emissions than manufacturing. Trade expansion validates the pollution haven in some cases, but also shows negative signs when only EU15 trade is considered. This may due to technology spillovers and a positive 'race to the top' rather than the bottom among EU15 trade partners. General R&D expenditure shows weak correlation with emissions efficiency. SUR estimators (Seemingly Unrelated Regressions) suggest that, as regards manufacturing, the slope varies across sectors. Further research should be directed towards deeper investigation of trade relationship at the sector level and increased research into and efforts to produce specific sectoral data on 'environmental innovations'.","[Marin, Giovanni] IMT Adv Studies Lucca, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Mazzanti, Massimiliano] Univ Ferrara, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Mazzanti, Massimiliano] Ceris CNR Natl Res Council, Milan, Italy",IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; University of Ferrara,"Marin, G (通讯作者)，IMT Adv Studies Lucca, Piazza S Ponziano 6, I-55100 Lucca, Italy.",giovanni.marin@imtlucca.it; ma.maz@iol.it,"Marin, Giovanni/A-1917-2014","Marin, Giovanni/0000-0002-7396-1561; mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942",,,,,90,48,49,1,63,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This paper examines the effectiveness of the interest rate policy in controlling inflation. The model utilized in this paper considers both demand and supply side effects of interest rate policy. These effects are used to derive not only the relevant impulse response functions but also the welfare loss to the society that arises from the supply side shocks. Based on their ability to control inflation and minimization of the overall welfare loss to the society, three policies are compared: (i) monetary policy with commitment, (ii) Taylor's rule, and (iii) inflation targeting. We argue that, in the presence of a cost channel, it is imperative that the interest rate policy is used with restraint. Our results also suggest that ignoring the cost channel of monetary policy can lead to significant under-estimation of the social welfare loss. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Various sources of involuntary unemployment are next considered, such as inability to work, long-term search unemployment, and temporary search unemployment. The latter raises the need for unemployment insurance as well as redistributive taxation.

In contrast, there is no evidence of a systematic positive relationship between capital account liberalization and economic growth. Moreover, the effect of domestic financial reforms on economic growth in middle-income countries is accounted for by improvements in measured aggregate TFP growth, not by higher aggregate investment Additional analysis suggests that sufficiently developed property rights are a precondition for reaping the benefits of financial and trade reforms.

Since the inception of the MILC program, large dairy producers have expressed concerns that the MILC payments have negatively affected their farming income. They argue that the program is not only inefficient but rewards inefficiency by keeping small, high-cost dairy farms in business. Using farm-level ARMS data from 2005, this study investigated the factors that affect farmers' decisions to participate in the MILC program and if participation in MILC has an impact on milk production. The results show that participation in the MILC program is positively correlated with farmers' educational attainment, organic certification subsidy, milk price, off-farm work by spouses, and financial record keeping. Further, medium-sized dairy farms are more likely to participate in MILC program. Finally, results indicate that participation in MILC program has a positive impact on milk production.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the renewable energy alternatives as a key way for resolving the Turkey's energy-related challenges because of the fact that Turkey's energy consumption has risen dramatically over the past three decades as a consequence of economic and social development.

These models are founded on the idea that the efficient market hypothesis could be justification to use various credit derivatives to price-related assets. This market-based approach to pricing greatly simplified the complex nature of structured finance. However, it also created new risks that were not apparent to the market and subsequently grew unattended. These risks are identified and their connection to the real economy is explored in Keynesian, Davidsonian, and Minskian terms. It is the conclusion of this paper that a significant contributor to the credit crisis was market participants' reliance on the efficient market theory and lack of awareness of Keynes's key insights into uncertainty.",,,,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,11,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We first show that the separability of private consumption from public consumption at the individual level carries over to the household level. Hence, changes in public consumption only matters through a change in the residual budget available for private consumption. When the consumption decisions within the household is efficient, private consumption decisions can be modeled as the solution of a problem consisting in maximizing a weighted sum of the private-consumption sub-utility functions of the spouses under the residual budget, the weights being unique and representing the distribution of power over the allocation of private consumption. The model presented in this paper can be used to analyze the changes in the household resource allocation due to, for example, childbirth.","[Fujii, Tomoki] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Ishikawa, Ryuichiro] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Engn Informat & Syst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan",Singapore Management University; University of Tsukuba,"Ishikawa, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Fac Engn Informat & Syst, 1-1-1 Ten Nodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",ishikawa@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Fujii, Tomoki/D-1425-2009; Ishikawa, Ryuichiro/GYJ-5636-2022","Fujii, Tomoki/0000-0002-9879-4835; Ishikawa, Ryuichiro/0000-0002-0290-1107","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25590029, 21243016] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,17,2,2,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We consider an environment where both demand reduction and preemptive bidding are supported as equilibrium phenomena of the ascending auction. In a series of experiments, we compare its performance to that of the discriminatory auction. Strategic demand reduction is quite prevalent in the ascending auction even when entry imposes a (large) negative externality on incumbents. As a result, the ascending auction performs worse than the discriminatory auction both in terms of revenue and efficiency, while entrants' chances are similar across the two formats.","[Goeree, Jacob K.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Offerman, Theo; Sloof, Randolph] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Zurich; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Sloof, R (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",r.sloof@uva.nl,,"Goeree, Jacob/0000-0001-9876-3425; Offerman, Theo/0000-0002-3469-8334",,,,,28,13,13,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

But even if trade liberalization raises inequality, these effects may be short lived and associated with important dynamic effects such as capital and skill accumulation. Using a simple dynamic open economy model we show that trade liberalization can induce substantial human capital accumulation, and that the transition path for the skill premium can be non-monotonic. We then consider a higher dimensional version of the model which is calibrated to data for China and India. In both cases trade liberalization generates a jump in the skill premium on impact, and a fall in the long run. It also generates strong wage growth for both skilled and unskilled labor and substantial accumulation of skilled labor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our main findings are that: First, the largest specification outperforms the smallest one in terms of forecast accuracy. Second, the MEDIUM VAR outperforms both the LARGE BVAR and the SMALL VAR in the case of structural analysis. So the MEDIUM VAR is sufficient to provide plausible impulse responses, and reproduce more realistically what happened during the subprime crisis.

The study finds that though statistically Svensson's (SV) (1994) model outperforms Nelson and Siegel's (NS) (1987) model in yield curve estimation, 99% of the movements in yield curves in India are explained by three factors which are 'level' (long-term factor), 'Slope' (short-term factor) and 'Curvature' (medium-term factor) with 'level' contributing more than 90% of its variations. This implies that in more than 90% of cases, the yield curves move parallel either in upward or in downward direction bringing similar effects to all maturity spectrums. This means that yield curve movements in India mainly reflect the monetary policy changes of central bank. Hence, NS's three parameter model is probably more than sufficient to capture all possible shapes of yield curves in India. This finding also suggests that a simple 'duration and convexity' hedging strategy should be appropriate to cover maximum risk exposure of government debt market investors in India.

The data were collected from 170 respondents mainly from iron and steel, cement and chemical industries, using a multiple-bounded discrete choice (MBDC) format. Estimations indicate that a mean of 8.8% in energy cost increase would be acceptable for all the samples. The chemical companies express a slightly higher affordability, with the mean of acceptable ratios of energy cost increases being 9.9%, while the cement companies show slightly lower affordability with a mean of 7.7%. Econometric analysis confirms that the market competition degree has a significant but negative relationship with the affordability while the company's size is significantly and positively associated with the affordability. Calculations indicate that the mean of affordable energy cost increases roughly equals a carbon price of 83.7 CNY/t-CO2 (about 12 USD/t-CO2) for chemical companies and around 40 CNY/t-CO2 (about 6 USD/t-CO2) for iron and steel and cement sectors.

Using a four-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with asymmetric information in the formal financial sector, we come up with three fundamental findings. First, we demonstrate that formal and informal financial sector loans are complementary in the aggregate, suggesting that an increase in the use of formal financial sector credit creates additional productive capacity that requires more informal financial sector credit to maintain equilibrium. Second, it is shown that interest rates in the formal and informal financial sectors do not always change together in the same direction. We demonstrate that in some instances, interest rates in the two sectors change in diametrically opposed directions with the implication that the informal financial sector may frustrate monetary policy, the extent of which depends on the size of the informal financial sector. Thus, the larger the size of the informal financial sector the lower the likely impact of monetary policy on economic activity. Third, the model shows that the risk factor (probability of success) for both high and low risk borrowers plays an important role in determining the magnitude by which macroeconomic indicators respond to shocks.

In contrast to the standard CES-based gravity equation, translog gravity generates an endogenous trade cost elasticity. Trade is more sensitive to trade costs if the exporting country only provides a small share of the destination country's imports. As a result, trade costs have a heterogeneous impact across country pairs, with some trade flows predicted to be zero. I test the translog gravity equation and find empirical evidence that is in many ways consistent with its predictions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

I show that many existing models in the literature can be derived from a structural equation with unobserved heterogeneity by imposing constancy assumptions on the first and second derivatives. I consider a less restrictive model that imposes constancy assumptions on the second partial derivative of the structural equation. Assuming the existence of suitable instrumental variables, I provide identification results and show that the model can be estimated using a generalized control function approach. I consider an application to the estimation of the returns to education in Chile, exploiting variation across regions and cohorts in educational infrastructure and compulsory schooling laws. Using penalized spline functions to approximate the components of the average structural function, I find that the local average returns to schooling are highly nonlinear and typically underestimated by flexible models that ignore the endogeneity of schooling. I also find evidence of credential effects for high school and college graduates, and limited evidence of comparative advantage bias in the returns to certain levels of education.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Rau, T (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Santiago, Chile.",trau@uc.cl,,"Rau, Tomas/0000-0002-0964-0165",,,,,26,3,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

A model of assessing contaminated sites in Lithuania consisting of two main stages - preliminary and detailed investigation has been developed. The first one is used for collecting preliminary information on the contaminated site and for evaluating the need for detailed analysis. The second is subjected to a comprehensive risk assessment of the site shifting focus on the environment and human health. The model for evaluating contaminated sites involves organic chemical materials and metals. Risk assessment depends on the sensitivity of a site to contamination. Equations for establishing the level of contamination involve the content of soil organic matter and clay.

Through econometric analysis, this paper analyzes the reasons why the regional equalization level of BPS in China has been decreasing. We find that the level of regional gaps of economic development, differences in fiscal decentralization, the degree of opening to the outside world and of marketization, and the level of urbanization are significantly positively correlated with the level of regional BPS; while regional disparity of financial capacity and governments' preferences are significantly negatively correlated with the level of regional BPS; but transfer payments from the central government do not play a role in promoting the equalization of BPS. It can be seen that in order to raise regional equalization of BPS in China, the gap of regional economic development should be controlled within reasonable ranges, normative fiscal decentralization established, and the system of transfer payments reformed with explicit equalization goals in mind. At the same time, the central government should reform the current rigid system of household registration management or internal passport system, known as hukou. To ensure the rational flow of population, and it should force local governments to improve the supply of BPS rather than simply relying on competition for regional economic growth.","[Zhang Qichun] Huazhong Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Tang Xuebing] Huazhong Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm & Sociol, Mobile Stn Postdoctoral Res, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Central China Normal University; Central China Normal University,"Tang, XB (通讯作者)，Huazhong Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm & Sociol, Mobile Stn Postdoctoral Res, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",zhangqich@gmail.com; xuebingt@126.com,,,,,,,15,4,5,10,84,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We use a panel sample of all municipalities from the Spanish Region of Murcia for 1995-2008. Our results reveal that mayors adopt an opportunistic behavior, increasing cultural spending in the election year and reducing it in the second year after the election. We also investigate whether the electoral cycle in cultural spending is influenced by mayors' ideology, political strength, willingness to run for re-election, and electoral competitiveness. In this regard, our study shows that when mayors expect close elections, political budget cycles' size is greater. Concerning political leadership, the magnitude of the electoral cycle is influenced by mayors' political ideology rather than mayors' political strength and re-election willingness. Additionally, we seek to shed some light on the determinants of public cultural spending. We find that income and upper-level governments' transfers have a positive impact on cultural spending. Finally, unemployment, young people's proportion and elderly people's proportion negatively influence cultural spending.","[Benito, Bernardino; Bastida, Francisco; Vicente, Cristina] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dpto Econ Financiera & Contabilidad, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Benito, B (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dpto Econ Financiera & Contabilidad, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",benitobl@um.es; alba@um.es; cristina.v.o@um.es,"Bastida, Francisco/K-9670-2014; Benito, Bernardino/K-9416-2014","Bastida, Francisco/0000-0001-9875-3817; Benito, Bernardino/0000-0003-2165-994X",,,,,78,39,46,0,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The main findings are threefold. First, FDI firms are significantly more involved in knowledge transfer activities than domestic producer firms. In particular, FDI firms offer more technological support, support with a direct positive impact on production processes of local suppliers. Second, the type of ownership also influences the effect of the technology gap on technology transfers. A large technology gap between a producer firm and its suppliers lowers the provision of support; however, FDI firms offer more technological support to their suppliers of material inputs when the technology gap is large. Independent of the support that the suppliers receive, foreign ownership of client firms and a large technology gap make it more likely that suppliers experience large positive impacts. Third, the level of absorptive capacity of local suppliers is also important for the impact of the technology transfers, confirming the notion that heterogeneity among both producer firms and local suppliers affect the level, nature and impact of local technology transfers.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Jordaan, JA (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.a.jordaan@vu.nl,"Jordaan, Jacob/AFM-9545-2022","Jordaan, Jacob/0000-0002-6981-0584",,,,,50,10,13,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Our results suggest that support for banks had a stabilizing effect on EA output, consumption and investment. Increased government purchases helped to stabilize output, but crowded out consumption. Higher transfers to households had a positive impact on private consumption, but a negligible effect on output and investment.

It has been argued that FDI provides access to advanced technologies and other intangible assets, which may spill over to the host country and allow domestic firms to improve their performance. While there is a substantial literature on this issue, for obvious reasons, little is known about the effect of FDI on domestic firms in the African context. Noting this gap, this paper uses two-period (2003 and 2007) firm level panel data from South Africa to examine the impact of FDI on the labour productivity of domestic firms. A key policy change during this time period was the passage of the broad-based black economic empowerment act (BB-BEE) and we also examine the effect of the interaction between foreign firm ownership and BEE on labour productivity. Regardless of the empirical specification, we find no spillover effects and no evidence that a greater degree of BEE compliance by foreign firms influences labour productivity.","[Mebratie, Anagaw Derseh; Bedi, Arjun S.] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands; [Bedi, Arjun S.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bedi, Arjun S.] ZEF, Bonn, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Bonn,"Bedi, AS (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands.",bedi@iss.nl,,", Anagaw/0000-0002-6489-335X",,,,,58,11,17,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We consider simple fiscal instrument rules for government purchases, transfers, and consumption, labour and capital taxes in analogy to interest rate rules in monetary policy. The paper finds a dichotomy in the welfare effects of fiscal policy for liquidity-constrained and intertemporal optimising households, i.e. policies enhancing the welfare of one group tend to reduce the welfare of the other one. The moderate average welfare gains from optimal policy contrast with potentially large welfare losses from non-optimal policy. Fiscal rules that respond to employment fluctuations may be preferred to fiscal rules responding to indicators of price competitiveness, because optimal policy corresponds more closely to the idea of countercyclical stabilisation in the former case. The simulations also emphasise the crucial impact of the budgetary closure rule on the welfare consequences of fiscal business-cycle stabilisation.","[Vogel, Lukas; Roeger, Werner] Commiss European Communities, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Herz, Bernhard] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Law & Econ, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Vogel, L (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, CHAR 14-233, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",lukas.vogel@ec.europa.eu,,"Vogel, Lukas/0000-0002-8106-2750",,,,,27,8,9,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

First, the method of principle component analysis and composite indicators are adopted to construct an overall sustainable development index and resource intensity measure using Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and World Development Indicator Data. Second, this paper applies an integrated paradigm to investigate the relationship between natural resource availability, economic growth, and the environment using a panel of 62 countries over the period 1990-2007. This interlocking relationship is analyzed through estimating the Resource Curse Hypothesis model and the Environmental Kuznets Curve model simultaneously while taking into consideration an important dimension-namely institutional quality. The results suggest that the way countries are dealing with sustainability in the context of MDG is negatively affecting the quality of the environment. Moreover, it proposes that countries with good institution quality are not taking the environmental problems seriously. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Most applied models of asymmetric information are covered as special cases whereby. pins down the probabilities initially assigned to states of nature.

This paper shows that the Taylor rule equation not only rests on the so-called onew consensus macroeconomics', but also on the neoclassical theory of growth. The various criticisms raised against these theoretical foundations suggest that interpretations of the Great Recession based on the Taylor rule equation are building their arguments on shaky theoretical premises. Furthermore, this paper shows that an equation formally similar but logically alternative to the Taylor rule can be regarded as the expression of a general condition of solvency of firms and workers. According to this osolvency rule' the prevailing outcome of monetary policy decisions is the oregulation' of insolvencies.","[Brancaccio, Emiliano; Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Sannio, Sannio, Italy; [Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Leeds, Econ Div, Business Sch LUBS, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Sannio; University of Leeds,"Fontana, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Econ Div, Business Sch LUBS, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",gf@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,"BRANCACCIO, Emiliano/0000-0001-7765-3892",,,,,58,18,18,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

To the extent that aid raises consumer expenditure, there will be some real exchange rate appreciation and a shift of resources away from traded goods production and into non-traded goods production. However, aid for investment in the traded goods sector can mitigate this effect. Also, a relatively high level of productivity in the non-traded goods sector combined with a high level of investment will tend to depreciate the real exchange rate. We examine aid inflows in twenty-six Sub-Saharan African countries and find a variety of macroeconomic responses.

In this paper we analyse the characteristics of product platform development projects to evaluate the necessity to handle these projects by defining a specific project type. We show differences between product platform development projects and product development projects in objects, expected effects, challenges, and decisions to be taken and also in risk management. Product platform projects are very much specific in the sense that it requires longer vision and future possible technology and market scenarios. Reducing development costs of product variants Is one of the expected effects of platforms that firms strive to achieve. One specific challenge in product platform development projects is to find the right balance between product synergies and market diversity. Especially because of high complexity, the high number of interactive decisions, uncertainties in technologies and customer requirements, specific challenges In risk management companies in several industries might consider to establish an own project type for product platform development projects.","[Harland, Peter; Uddin, Zakir] Tech Univ Dresden, Int Inst Zittau, D-02763 Zittau, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,,peter.harland@mailbox.tu-dresden.de; zakir.uddin@mailbox.tu-dresden.de,,,,,,,21,1,1,1,4,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,176,184,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300018,0

In particular, we focus on the case of differentiated products with multiple attributes and heterogeneous consumers. We show that there exist certain configurations of consumers' multidimensional preferences under which a firm, no matter whether producing a high- or low-quality product, may choose not to reveal the quality even with zero disclosure costs. The failure of information unraveling arises when providing consumers with more information results in more elastic demand, which triggers more intensive price competition and leads to lower prices and profits for competing firms. As a result, the equilibrium in which disclosure is voluntary may diverge from that in which disclosure is mandatory. (JEL L15, L5)","[Hotz, V.

Since the political transition in 1994, South Africa has consistently invested over eight of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health, but so far returns remain uneven, with some localities delivering lower outcomes than others, even when they have comparable input levels. This study measures the performance of the country's health system, following a stochastic production frontier approach. Results have revealed that eight of the 52 districts in the country had an efficiency score of below 60%, and in four of these, the score was below 50%. Technical inefficiency was positively and significantly associated with HIV prevalence and illiteracy rates reported for districts. Overall mean technical efficiency (TE) in the country was around 80%. Given this, further improvements in health outcome in the country are expected to depend both on its ability to address existing inefficiencies and on the capacity to invest additional resources in communities where existing services were already inadequate.","African Populat & Hlth Res Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya",African Population & Health Research Centre,"Kinfu, Y (通讯作者)，African Populat & Hlth Res Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya.",ykinfu@aphrc.org,"Kinfu, Yohannes/AAC-8054-2020","Kinfu, Yohannes/0000-0001-9607-6891",,,,,36,9,9,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It looks across a large number of variables and methods, using annual data from 1960 to 2005. It finds robust evidence supporting that public consumption, wages and employment co-move with the business cycle in a pro-cyclical manner with 1-2 year lags, notably for the euro area aggregate and euro area countries.

Related techniques are widely explored in the field of statistical surveillance, that is, on-line turning point detection procedures. This paper will first present a power controlled turning point detection method based on the theory of the likelihood ratio test in statistical surveillance. Next we show how outliers will influence the performance of this methodology. Due to the sensitivity of the surveillance system to outliers, we finally present a wavelet multiresolution (MRA) based outlier elimination approach, which can be combined with the on-line turning point detection process and will then alleviate the false alarm problem introduced by the outliers.

Among the provisions of this agreement were a set of mandated escrow payments to the states that would be based on cigarette sales. The result of these provisions is that the apparent relationship between taxes and prices changed substantially following implementation of the MSA. This article estimates whether the MSA escrow amounts are reflected in prices and compares the pass-through rate of state and federal cigarette taxes only and the rate when one adds escrow payments. We find much different pass-through rates for the two measures. State and federal taxes are not fully passed to smokers. In years that escrow payments were made, cigarette prices increased by more than the sum of the state and federal taxes and the escrow payments.","[Sfekas, Andrew] Temple Univ, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Lillard, Dean R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Cornell University,"Sfekas, A (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",sfekas@temple.edu,"Lillard, Dean R/C-3244-2014",,NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA120338] Funding Source: Medline; NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG030379] Funding Source: Medline,NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,9,9,12,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We found that: (1) per capita real public spending (total and capital, assistance and subsidies, wages and salaries, and social insurance categories) was part of a cointegrating relationship with UR and real per capita state personal income. (2) With the exception of social insurance, other spending variables, when statistically significant, actually had a depressing effect on UR. The magnitude of this effect, however, was generally small. UR was most sensitive to increases in wages and salaries. (3) Long-term causality analysis based on panel error-correction coefficients provided consistent evidence of a causal effect from spending to UR, but less consistent evidence of such effect in the opposite direction. Social insurance, however, drove UR. (4) The size of the error-correction coefficients suggested a slow response of UR to deviations from the cointegrating relationship. (5) The marginal effect of spending on UR increased with the amount of the federal grants received. Our results suggest that public spending may not serve as a quick fix in relation to UR. They also seem to favour allocation of the federal funds to wage and salaries and assistance and subsidies, but not to capital and social insurance expenditures to lower UR.","[Mahdavi, Saeid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Alanis, Emmanuel] Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mays Business School,"Mahdavi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, 1 UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",smahdavi@utsa.edu,,,,,,,46,6,6,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Two of them represent the two extremes of polities in the EU: Sweden and Greece and the third, Germany is used for comparison purposes. Our results indicate absence of any asymmetries. TAR or MTAR, for Sweden and Germany. The symmetric ECM provides support for the fiscal synchronization hypothesis of revenues and expenditures in both countries. For Greece, however, we find evidence for asymmetries of the MTAR form, which in turn support the spend-and-tax hypothesis with asymmetric adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium. This indicates that the Greek fiscal authorities would cut deficits only if they exceeded a high trigger threshold, which gives support to the soft budget constraint strategy to gain political support. The fiscal adjustment takes place by cutting government expenditure. The out-of-sample forecast results suggest that a shift from a univariate model specification to a multivariate model improves marginally the forecast performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Five points are noted. First, there is a big drop in the overall elasticity for developing countries for 2005-2008, indicating a considerably weaker response of poverty to increased income. Second, the drop is particularly sharp for $1.25 poverty rate but is fairly substantial for $2.00 line also. Third, the fall largely reflects a slowdown in poverty reduction in China from the extremely high declines in previous periods and the consequent drop in the elasticities for that country. Fourth, the elasticities, particularly that for $2.00 line, continue to be extremely low in poverty-dense India where $2.00 poverty rate is still higher than that even in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Fifth, the good progress towards the poverty goal of the Millennium Declaration is once again noted to be almost entirely due to the huge poverty declines that have occurred in China.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Illinois State University,"Ram, R (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",rram@ilstu.edu,,,,,,,11,4,4,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Our results suggest that non-anticipatory behavior of firms was found on key variables and several robustness checks confirm our results. Furthermore, we found that the adjustment of hours was implemented just before the deadline. Also, we found that a reduction of standard hours had no significant effects on employment transitions, although we found a significant effect on hourly wages (i.e. wage compensation). Unlike experiences from other countries, this policy was innovative as it isolated the reduction of working hours from other policy changes, such as flexibility and financial incentives. These characteristics allow us to use a difference in difference approach to identify the effects of the policy change on employment. The effects of this kind of policy are of special interest as many countries do not have the fiscal capacity to give financial incentives in order to reduce working hours. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Estimates of a double hurdle negative binomial regression allow us to test hypotheses on the influence of the Big Five personality traits on work attendance. Our findings augment previous results on the link between personality and absenteeism by analysing representative data and including a large set of control variables typically not available in small scale surveys. We find clear negative correlations between the absence probability and Conscientiousness among women. For male employees a negative correlation with the incidence of absence is observed for the Agreeableness dimension. When looking at the length of absence occurrences Neuroticism is found to significantly influence male absenteeism despite controlling for the subjective health of the individual. Following the reasoning by Bowles et al. (2001) for the provision of effort by employees, employers might pay for incentive-enhancing preferences such as low Neuroticism among male employees because employers can only insufficiently monitor the true level of sickness of their employees and consequently want to avoid voluntary absenteeism.","[Fahr, Rene] Univ Paderborn, Fac Business Adm & Econ, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Stoermer, Susi] Talanx Serv AG, Hannover, Germany; [Fahr, Rene] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Paderborn; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Fahr, R (通讯作者)，Univ Paderborn, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",rene.fahr@wiso.uni-paderborn.de,,"Fahr, Rene/0000-0002-0304-6675",,,,,49,17,23,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The study is based on the data from the Prague Stock Exchange in the space of 7 years from 2 January 2006 until 2 January 2010, specifically for the close daily prices of the following shares: CEZ, Komercni Banka and Telefonica O2. Out of these close prices the share price daily change and the share price cumulated change for a certain period of time have been calculated. The length of time period has been determined by the number of growing or decreasing close prices in sequence. According to daily and cumulated share price changes three models with different discreet state spaces have been defined. For each model we have calculated the number of individual states, the conditioned probabilities of transition between particular states and conditioned probabilities of transition into growing and decreasing states. Calculations have been carried out In MS Excel using algorithm programmed in VBA. Gained results show that for a conveniently defined state space, models based on MCA could be usable for TA. Making use of these models for construction of TA indicators will be the objective of other research.","[Svoboda, Milan] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,svobodm@kem.zcu.cz,,,,,,,8,2,2,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,551,557,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300057,0

We find that male celebrity media exposure can positively impact the success of a movie, whereas female celebrity exposure tends to decrease box office revenues. The results also suggest that although it may be harder for older actresses to land a lead role, it is actually the older male actors who lack the ability to carry a movie.

According to new theoretical foundations (Resource Based View, Dynamic Capabilities and Knowledge Based View) key strategic knowledge or Intellectual Capital has become the fundamental driver of wealth creation. A revision of the literature concludes that business excellence has always been due to good strategy formulation and superior strategy implementation. In order to achieve business excellence in the knowledge economy context substantial efforts have been made to improve the process of strategy implementation and some of them have produced relevant frameworks and methodologies, such as Balanced Scorecard and InCaS (Intellectual Capital Statement. Made in Europe). Nevertheless, fewer efforts have been made in the process of strategy formulation and, in practice, the SWOT analysis still is the most well known existing framework. However, in a world where customer preferences are volatile and the identity of customers and the technologies for serving them are changing, a market-focused strategy may not provide the stability and constancy of direction needed as a foundation for long term strategy. When the external environment is in a state of flux, the firm itself, in terms of its bundle of resources and capabilities, may be a much more stable basis on which to define its identity. Hence, a definition of the firm in terms of what it is capable of doing may offer a more durable basis for strategy than a definition based upon the needs the business seeks to satisfy. Consequently, the SWOT analysis methodology can't cope with the new external environment requirements and a kind of improved or extended SWOT analysis is needed. ICBS (Intellectual Capital Benchmarking System) is the output of a practical research on extended or improved SWOT analysis, a framework that knowledge economy requires for successful strategy formulation. ICBS is a new management method that allows companies to perform a competitiveness strategy check-up of their business models. For that purpose, ICBS benchmarks their core innovation and operations intellectual capital against the world class competitors in their sector.","[Viedma Marti, Jose] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Business Adm, Barcelona, Spain; [Cabrita, Maria do Rosario] Univ Nova Lisboa, UNIDEMI, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Fac Sci & Technol, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Marti, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Business Adm, Barcelona, Spain.",jose.m.viedma@upc.edu; m.cabrita@fct.unl.pt,"Cabrita, Maria do Rosário/ABA-5197-2021","Cabrita, Maria do Rosário/0000-0001-8394-2260",,,,,28,1,1,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,445,454,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000051,0

The difference from the existing literature is that the liability is assumed to be influenced not only by the stochastic return of the liability but also by some uncontrolled cash flows, which can be explained as, for example, stochastic expenditure of individual investors, or claim processes of insurers. Firstly, the original problem is translated into a standard multi-period stochastic optimal control problem by introducing a Lagrange multiplier, and the corresponding analytical solution is derived by adopting the dynamic programming approach. Secondly, according to Lagrange duality theorem, closed-form expressions for the efficient investment strategy and the mean-variance efficient frontier are obtained. Moreover, a multi-period version of two-fund separation theorem is proved, and some special cases are discussed. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate our results.

Access to a standard punishment technology in this setting significantly decreases net payoffs, even in the long run. Access to a severe punishment technology leads to roughly the same payoffs as with no punishment option, as the benefits of increased cooperation offset social costs of punishing.","[Ambrus, Attila] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Greiner, Ben] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Duke University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Ambrus, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",aa231@duke.edu; bgreiner@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,37,68,73,0,55,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We compare the efficacy of vigilante justice, as represented by peer-to-peer punishment, to delegated policing, as represented by the hired gun mechanism, to deter free riding and improve group welfare. Small self-governing organizations often place enforcement in the hands of an appointed leader-the department chair, the building superintendent, and the team captain. This hired gun, we show, need only punish the least compliant group member, and then only punish this person enough so that the person would have rather been the second least compliant The hired gun mechanism is an example of a low cost device that promotes complete compliance as the unique Nash equilibrium. We find that subjects are willing to pay to hire a delegated policing mechanism over 70% of the time and that this mechanism increases welfare between 15% and 40%. Moreover, the lion's share of the welfare gain comes because the hired gun crowds out vigilante peer-to-peer punishments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, we designed the radio-button experimental paradigm, in which participants are asked to set default options that remain effective until they decide to change them, and the outcomes from active and inactive options are determined and presented to participants every two seconds. Comparison of behavior in six basic decision problems run under the clicking and radio-button experimental paradigms reveals an unexpected result. We find that, although the basic properties of decisions from experience are robust to the option to rely on self-set defaults, the introduction of defaults reduces the tendency to prefer the status quo.

The core monetary model provides a unified framework to explain how an interest rule can be used to control inflation in normal times, and to explain the purpose of unconventional monetary policy when policy attains the zero lower bound.

Adopting the non-parametric technique of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to handle the feature of multiple outputs and undesirable outputs in the hospital industry, empirical estimates indicate that hospital efficiency is moderate that increased slightly from 0.6777 to 0.8098 during the sample period. However, it ranges widely from 0.396 to 1 across provinces. The regression analysis on examining determinants of efficiency suggests that a higher proportion of for-profit hospital and high quality hospital is helpful to enhance technical efficiency. We find a negative relationship between government subsidy and efficiency for coastal regions. While technical efficiency varies considerable across provinces, there is no significant difference between coastal and non-coastal regions being found, after controlling for other variables. Crucially, the medical reform of NRCMS overall has a significant efficiency-enhancing effect, particularly for non-coastal regions, ceteris paribus. It highlights the effectiveness of NRCMS on promoting medical service accessibility for rural residents. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

(3) Labor and transport-related taxes are the two largest proportions of total transport costs, and respectively account for 35% and 30%.

First, we find that individual well-being increases contemporaneously with own income and decreases with community's average income, consistent with findings reported in previous studies. This result holds when we replace income with consumption and when we consider employment and health status of other family members. Second and more important, we find that income expectations have a positive and significant effect on individual well-being. This result is robust to alternative model specifications and to controls for optimistic personality. Instrumental variable estimates and endogeneity tests suggest that the positive relationship between well-being and income expectations is genuine.

This study offers a unique contribution to the field by testing whether principals and theories from behavioral economics affect the decisions that participants make in these savings programs. Using a sample of people participating in the $aveNYC program, a matched savings program for very low-income households, we test whether information failure, time preference, and financial hardship affected people's ability to complete the program and receive the match money. We find that future orientation does not significantly impact program completion, but both information failure and financial hardship increase the hazard of early account closure. Although the pool of participants who did not receive the match was small, both information failure and financial hardship had large impacts on the risk of withdrawing the account before receiving a match. We discuss how these findings can inform program design and suggest future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous studies have attributed poor compliance to physicians' failure to exhibit sufficient empathy with patients' problems. Can financial incentives help modify physicians' empathic behavior? In view of contradicting evidence in the health psychology literature, the present paper addresses this question from a rational-choice perspective, introducing a principal-agent model of physician empathy and patient compliance. The model allows the physician to exhibit empathy with the patient, to which the patient responds by choosing his desired level of compliance, which the physician takes into account when determining the level of empathy she exhibits. The model is first applied to rationally substantiate the evidence that patient compliance rises with physician empathy, and subsequently to examining the relationship between physician empathy and the physician's fee. The analysis reveals that the physician will exhibit less empathy in response to a higher fee, implying that the higher the fee the less compliant her patient will be. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Firstly, we separate positive returns from negative returns and model them using the peak-over-threshold (POT) method in order to compute the downside as well as upside risk measures separately. We thereafter compute the value-at-risk (VAR) and the expected shortfall (ES) estimates corresponding to upside and downside risks. We bootstrap these risk measures and compute their standard errors and confidence intervals (CIs) to see whether they fall inside these CIs. Secondly, we compute out-sample forecasts of VAR estimates using the POT method and the generalised autogressive conditional heteroscedasticity process. Three backtesting methodologies are employed: the unconditional and conditional coverage tests and the counting of number of exceptions according to Basel II green zone. We find that all our VAR and ES estimates are well inside their CIs and that at lower quantiles, parametric ES estimates are equal to POT-ES estimates, although the difference between the two is more pronounced at higher quantiles (99% or higher). Furthermore, our market risk model falls into the Basel II green zone, as it produces fewer exceptions in out-sample space.","Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Mwamba, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, POB 524,Auckland Pk, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",johnmu@uj.ac.za,"Mwamba, John Weirstrass Muteba/I-5479-2014","Mwamba, John Weirstrass Muteba/0000-0002-8002-1156",,,,,14,2,5,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Our results show strong effects through the value expressive and expectation channel, but not through either the knowledge channel or procedural fairness.

In this paper, we test the hypothesis that regional knowledge spillovers positively influence China's innovation growth from 2001 to 2008. As knowledge is subjected to spatial decay, innovation of a region is enhanced when location in neighboring regions encourages the formation of regional knowledge and information flows. Applying a spatial autoregressive model to China's provinces, the paper finds that regional knowledge spillovers have a favorable effect on design, invention and utility patents. This indicates that proximate location to innovative neighbors can help to raise the innovation capability of a province. In addition, evidence also shows that R&D expenditure and skilled personnel of research institutes and universities positively affect invention and utility patents. This suggests a favorable role for the government in enhancing indigenous innovation capability.

This paper examines this phenomenon further by using monthly data on EU imports from African LDCs at the lowest level of (publicly) available aggregation thereby coming close to transaction level data.

However, there appears to be little evidence in the literature of such behavior in the field. We study the propensity to punish norm violators in a natural field experiment conducted in the main subway station in Athens, Greece. The large number of passengers ensures that strategic motives for punishing are minimized. We study violations of two distinct efficiency-enhancing social norms. In line with laboratory evidence, we find that individuals punish norm violators. However, these individuals are a minority. Men are more likely than women to punish violators, while the decision to punish is unaffected by the violator's height and gender. Interestingly, we find that violations of the better known of the two norms are substantially less likely to trigger punishment. We present additional evidence from two surveys providing insights into the determinants of norm enforcement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is necessary to bear in mind a number of limitations in the conduct of Croatian monetary policy if it is to be based on the use of the MCI. The most important constrain, that reduces the possibility of freely determining domestic interest rates and money supply, stems from a relative freedom of international capital flows between Croatia and other countries and the necessity of maintaining a stable nominal exchange rate due to a highly euroized economy.","Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Benazic, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",mbenaz@efpu.hr,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,5,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We first argue that this result may hide a structural break: the estimated elasticity is a convolution of two coefficients with opposite signs across the samples 1965-1979 and 1982-2003. The sign of the coefficient in the earlier sample is inconsistent with standard economic theory and intuition. We outline a model with limited asset markets participation that can generate this change in sign when asset market participation changes from low to high, and provide institutional evidence for such a change in the United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

First, jumping behavior is an important process for each market. Second, spot and futures returns do not have the same jump process.

To make up for the income shortfall, women who supply transactional sex engaged in higher risk sex both during and after the crisis. While this particular crisis was likely too short for these behavioral responses to seriously increase the risk of HIV or other STIs for these women, such responses could have long-term repercussions for health in countries with longer or more frequent crises.

By deterring selection, risk adjustment helps to assure fair and efficient payments among health insurers or capitated provider groups. However, since conventional risk adjustment allocates funds among regions or insurers according to current population health status, it does not reward indeed, it penalizes - preventive efforts that improve population health. This prevention penalty of risk adjustment represents a hidden cost of unclear magnitude, undermining provider incentives for health promotion.

It is hypothesized that firms subject to technological change have an increased demand for skills and one mechanism to accommodate this demand is by providing additional training for their workforce. To test this proposition, data are extracted from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development-World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) from waves 2002 and 2005. Probit and tobit estimations are used to analyze the impact of technological change upon training incidence and intensity. The findings of this analysis suggest that firms that undergo technological change are indeed more likely to provide training and there is some evidence that the training is of greater intensity. This positive association between technological change and training suggests that one way to address underinvestment in training in the western Balkans is to enhance incentives for firms to undertake technological change.","[Adnett, Nick] Staffordshire Univ, Sch Business, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DE, Staffs, England",Staffordshire University,,,,"Gashi, Ardiana/0000-0002-9225-6788",,,,,34,3,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

In many countries, electricity distribution is regulated by the government. Many regulators apply frontier estimation techniques such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) or stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) as an integral part of their regulatory framework. While more advanced methods that combine nonparametric frontier with stochastic error term are known in the literature, in practice, regulators continue to apply simplistic methods. This paper reports the main results of the project commissioned by the Finnish regulator for further development of the cost frontier estimation in their regulatory framework. The key objectives of the project were to integrate a stochastic SFA-style noise term to the nonparametric, axiomatic DEA-style cost frontier, and to take the heterogeneity of firms and their operating environments better into account. To achieve these objectives, a new method called stochastic nonparametric envelopment of data (StoNED) was examined.

The change from dispatchable generation to an environment in which Independent System Operators (ISOs), Regional Transmission Operators (RTOS), Load Serving Entities (LSEs) and consumers dynamically respond to the conditions in the system and help to alleviate the uncertainty linked to RES requires appropriate tools to evaluate the social benefits and costs of different policies implemented. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the aforementioned effects using an engineering and economic optimization model. The proposed framework is applied to a stylized case study with operations on a test network that simulates a typical day. The objective of the case study is to compare the effects of (1) controllable demand, (2) on-site storage, and (3) upgrading transmission capacity. The different scenarios are evaluated in terms of (1) the percentage of potential wind generation spilled, (2) the total operating cost of production, and (3) the amount of installed capacity needed to maintain operating reliability. The results show that controllable demand improves (reduces) all of the three criteria by alleviating congestion and mitigating wind variability. In contrast, the beneficial effects are smaller for RES's on-site storage, because it does not shift load to off-peak periods or reduce congestion, and for upgrading transmission, because it does not shift load to off-peak periods or mitigate wind variability.

We first characterize the existence, uniqueness and multiplicity of the steady states as well as their welfare properties. We particularly focus on the CES production functions and show that the steady state is generically either unique or there are exactly two. A simple geometrical methodology enables us to characterize the local dynamics of the steady state. We show that in order to get indeterminacy, the presence of both aggregate and sector-specific external effects is needed, along with low capital-labor elasticities of substitution and high, but bounded from above, elasticities in intertemporal consumption. We perform a sensitivity analysis and show that indeterminacy emerges for parameter values in line with those used in calibrations of standard RBC models, that is for unitary elasticities of input substitution and of intertemporal substitution in consumption.

Previous investigations ignore the possible nonlinear behaviors which may be caused by asymmetry, persistence or structural breaks. To fill this gap, we apply both linear and nonlinear causality tests to examine the causal relationships between energy prices and exchange rates of the U.S. dollar. Our results show that in the period before recent financial crisis, unidirectional linear causality running from petroleum prices to exchange rates and unidirectional nonlinear causality running from exchange rates to natural gas prices are revealed. In the period after the financial crisis, the bidirectional nonlinear causality relationships between petroleum prices and exchange rates can be found and there are no causality between exchange rates and natural gas prices. Moreover, we examine the source of nonlinear behaviors of causality relationships. Our evidence indicates that both volatility spillover and regime shift contribute to nonlinear causality and the explanation power of the former one is much stronger. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Labor market imperfections in line with Mortensen and Pissarides (Job Creation and Job Destruction in the Theory of Unemployment, 1994) give rise to unemployment and a channel for the government to influence markets through institutional changes. Labor market interventions feedback into the product market through changes in a country's competitiveness. Moreover, the distinction between high- and low-skill workers facilitates the analysis of skill-biased institutional changes that have stronger impact on certain skill groups. The comparative static exercise in this paper shows that high-skilled benefit from low-skill biased labor market reforms through higher wages. Lower labor costs reduce unemployment of the low-skilled and increases the reforming country's competitiveness. One-sided labor market interventions have feedback effects through adjustments at the extensive margin, which affect all workers at home and abroad irrespective of their level of skill. Governments in the non-reforming countries may react to this loss in competitiveness by initiating cooperative labor market reforms instead.","IAB Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany",,"Schmerer, HJ (通讯作者)，IAB Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany.",Hans-Joerg.Schmerer@iab.de,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,17,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 4,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201237.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-37,0.0,,,40,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,091GA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315036200001,0

Individuals have private information about their public-goods preferences. Moreover, individuals differ in their productive abilities. The incidence of taxation in the Ramsey model implies that more productive individuals have a lower willingness to pay for public goods than less productive individuals. They are therefore tempted to understate their valuation of public goods and less productive individuals are inclined to exaggerate theirs. The paper characterizes an optimal rule for taxation and public-goods provision that eliminates these biases.","Univ Cologne CMR, Ctr Macroecon Res, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Bierbrauer, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne CMR, Ctr Macroecon Res, 7 Stock,Zi 729 Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",bierbrauer@coll.mpg.de,"Bierbrauer, Felix J/L-4129-2015",,,,,,15,2,2,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Their method uses a recursive multiplier to capture implicit prior promises to the agent(s) that were made in order to satisfy earlier instances of these constraints. As a result, their method relies on the invertibility of the derivative of the Pareto frontier and cannot be applied to problems for which this frontier is not strictly concave. In this paper we show how one can extend their method to a weakly concave Pareto frontier by expanding the state space to include the realizations of an end of period lottery over the extreme points of a flat region of the Pareto frontier. With this expansion the basic insight of Marcet and Marimon goes through - one can make the problem recursive in the Lagrangian multiplier which yields significant computational advantages over the conventional approach of using utility as the state variable. The case of a weakly concave Pareto frontier arises naturally in applications where the principal's choice set is not convex but where randomization is possible. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In auxiliary analyses we explore the potential mediating effects of mental health. We find that safety nets in the form of bank accounts, credit cards, and ability to borrow money increase both participation in organizations and friendships, whereas material hardships decrease friendships but increase participation in organizations.

An individual chooses whether and how much to work at each data. The government must finance a given expenditure and does not have access to lump sum taxation. We develop a solution method that uses that primal approach to solve for the optimal non-linear tax function. The average tax rate determines when an individual will work while the marginal tax rate determines how much she will work. Even in the absence of redistributive concerns, the optimal tax schedule has an increasing average tax rate at low levels of income to encourage labor market participation. The marginal tax rate at the top is strictly positive. Finally, the model is used to assess the effects of changing the current tax schedule to the optimal one. Under the preferred parameters, this delivers a welfare gain equivalent to 0.67 percent of lifetime consumption. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In recent years such models have been increasingly used to identify demand and supply shocks in the market for crude oil. We demonstrate that sign restrictions alone are insufficient to infer the responses of the real price of oil to such shocks. Moreover, the conventional assumption that all admissible models are equally likely is routinely violated in oil market models, calling into question the use of posterior median responses to characterize the responses to structural shocks. When combining sign restrictions with additional empirically plausible bounds on the magnitude of the short-run oil supply elasticity and on the impact response of real activity, however, it is possible to reduce the set of admissible model solutions to a small number of qualitatively similar estimates. The resulting model estimates are broadly consistent with earlier results regarding the relative importance of demand and supply shocks for the real price of oil based on structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models identified by exclusion restrictions, but imply very different dynamics from the posterior median responses in VAR models based on sign restrictions only.","[Kilian, Lutz; Murphy, Daniel P.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kilian, L (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lkilian@umich.edu; dpmurphy@umich.edu,,,,,,,33,225,256,0,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Official government records of these flows have been systematically improved since governments realized their importance, but a significant percentage of remittances remain unrecorded. This, together with the shadow economy, may pose a problem for monetary policy. This article uses a limited participation model to examine the differential effect that higher shares of remittances can have on monetary policy and describes the impact of remittances on a small open economy under partial sterilization. It demonstrates how a typical monetary shock will lead to a more pronounced liquidity effect when remittances become a higher proportion of GDP. It also shows that a positive remittance shock improves consumption and lowers interest rates, but as it also reduces work effort it momentarily lowers output.

The first model, called the jump-diffusion model, was proposed by Cartea and Figueroa (2005), and is a one-factor mean-reversion jump-diffusion model, adjusted to incorporate the most important characteristics of electricity prices. The second model, called the threshold model, was proposed by Roncoroni (2002) and further developed by Geinan and Roncoroni (2006), and is an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by a Brownian motion and a state-dependent compound Poisson process. It is designed to capture both statistical and pathwise properties of electricity spot prices. The third model, called the factor model, was proposed by Benth et al. (2007). It is an additive linear model, where the price dynamics is a superposition of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by subordinators to ensure positivity of the prices. It separates the modelling of spikes and base components. We calibrate all three models to German spot price data. Besides employing techniques similar to those used in the original papers we adopt the prediction-based estimating function technique (Sorensen, 2000) and the filtering technique (Meyer-Brandis and Tankov, 2008). We critically compare the properties and the estimation of the three models and discuss several shortcomings and possible improvements. Besides analysing the spot price behaviour, we compute forward prices and risk premia for all three models for various German forward data and identify the key forward price drivers.

(J Monet Econ 46:281-313, 2000) introduce sticky wages in a New-Keynesian general-equilibrium model. Alternatively, it is shown here how wage stickiness may bring unemployment fluctuations into a New-Keynesian model. Using a Bayesian econometric approach, both models are estimated with US quarterly data of the Great Moderation. Estimation results are similar in the two models and both provide a good empirical fit, with the crucial difference that our model delivers unemployment fluctuations. Thus, second-moment statistics of the US rate of unemployment are replicated reasonably well in our proposed New-Keynesian model with sticky wages. Demand-side shocks play a more important role than technology innovations or cost-push shock in explaining both output and unemployment fluctuations. In the welfare analysis, the cost of cyclical fluctuations during the Great Moderation is estimated at 0.60% of steady-state consumption.","[Casares, Miguel] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain; [Moreno, Antonio] Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Vazquez, Jesus] Univ Basque Country, Dept FAE 2, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra; University of Navarra; University of Basque Country,"Casares, M (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain.",mcasares@unavarra.es; antmoreno@unav.es; jesus.vazquez@ehu.es,"Moreno, Antonio/P-7014-2017; Vazquez, Jesus/D-3067-2019","Vazquez, Jesus/0000-0003-4788-4838",,,,,45,2,2,1,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

It is primarily a system of ideas and principles, rather than a rationally argued intellectual position. Its ideas are powerful and influential on developments in policy and politics, but it is presently less well grounded in the academy. Green economists do not dwell overmuch on introspection and their method is implicit rather than explicit, relying on a grounded, embedded and phenomenological approach and rejecting the scientism and spurious objectivity of neoclassical economics. In this paper I outline four key issues central to a green study of the economy: the need to end economic growth; the importance of equality and questions of the just distribution of resources; the requirement to consider appropriate scale in economic decision-making; and the need to include multiple perspectives in the study of economics.","Southlands Coll, Roehampton Business Sch, London SW15 5PU, England",Roehampton University,"Cato, MS (通讯作者)，Southlands Coll, Roehampton Business Sch, Roehampton Lane, London SW15 5PU, England.",molly.scott-cato@roehampton.ac.uk,"Scott Cato, Molly/HZJ-8765-2023",,,,,,63,10,13,4,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

It argues that there is need for a thorough reform of the EU governance structure in conjunction with radical changes in the regulation and supervision of financial markets. The EMU was sub-optimal from its debut and competitiveness gaps did not diminish against the backdrop of its inadequate policy and institutional design. The euro zone crisis is not related to fiscal negligence only; over-borrowing by the private sector and poor lending by banks, as well as a one-sided monetary policy also explain this debacle. The EMU needs to complement its common monetary policy with solid fiscal/budget underpinnings. Fiscal rules and sanctions are necessary, but not sufficient. A common treasury (a federal budget) is needed in order to help the EMU absorb shocks and forestall confidence crises. A joint system of regulation and supervision of financial markets should operate. Emergency measures have to be comprehensive and acknowledge the necessity of a lender of last resort; they have to combat vicious circles. Structural reforms and EMU level policies are needed to enhance competitiveness in various countries and foster convergence.","Natl Sch Polit & Adm Studies, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Daianu, D (通讯作者)，Natl Sch Polit & Adm Studies, 6 Povernei St,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.",daiandan@b.astral.ro,,,,,,,43,7,7,0,44,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We add two new elements to their model. First, the government may offer cost-sharing contracts when procuring the good. Second, the owner of a private firm may divert resources that increase their own profit/utility but increase total costs. The cost sharing contract allows the government to reduce the private firm's incentives to dump quality in order to save on costs. However, this also leads to resource diversion, which increases total costs. We derive the preferred mode of ownership when the government optimally chooses the power of the cost sharing scheme. We find that the presence of quality-reducing cost reductions only favours government ownership if the scope for resource diversion is substantial. A discussion of when resource diversion is likely to be important is also provided.","[Dalen, Dag Morten; Moen, Espen R.] BI Norwegian Business Sch, N-0442 Oslo, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School,"Dalen, DM (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Business Sch, Nydalsveien 37, N-0442 Oslo, Norway.",dag.m.dalen@bi.no,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

The article focuses on the foreign-born population from Rumania and Bulgaria that recently have undergone a deep change in their legal circumstances. Using data from the Spanish Labour Force Survey (2000-2009), we estimate the probability of being a member of the active population, of being employed and of having a fixed-term contract for these collectives. Results allow us to build labour assimilation profiles for each collective. Outcomes show that a slight but constant labour assimilation process is occurring for all the dimensions studied except fixed-term employment.

The method is based on a utility and labor supply calibration that takes into account time variations in demographic characteristics of the population.

Results show that the difference between the two approaches in terms of total demand for energy and consumption goods is negligible for a wide range of model parameters.

In particular, we analyze the influence of macro and spatial factors on investment stock changes and discuss whether the origin of these investments and the 2004 EU enlargement have had any effects on BSR FDIs. Our results suggest that EU enlargement has been significant for FDI activity in the region, and that FDI is basically a regional issue as it tends to be bilateral within the region. However, the same results also suggest that geographic distance is not a significant factor. We conclude that while being traditional in nature, the BSR FDI pattern is undergoing changes towards a lesser degree of geographic bias.","[Nakamura, H.

We find that the drivers of current account deficit reversals differ according to the fiscal policy stance. In economies with expansionary fiscal policies, external sector adjustment is driven by cyclical and credit factors. In economies implementing fiscal consolidation, adjustment is triggered by fiscal and financial factors, while the disruptive effects of the adjustment are smaller. We conclude that fiscally challenged economies facing external imbalances could ameliorate the adjustment path through fiscal consolidation policies. (C) 2011 Society for Policy Modeling.

We show that opening up to trade generally leads to a steeper optimal managerial incentive scheme (and hence, higher firm productivity) via a new mechanism by which selection of heterogeneous firms into the export market plays a key role. This is because trade openness unambiguously increases the variation of firm profits by reallocating profits towards ex post low-cost exporters, leading to a higher stake of the market game faced by the principals. Interestingly, it is further shown that, whilst falling variable trade costs unambiguously increase managerial incentives, a reduction in fixed trade costs could possibly lead to weaker incentives and thus generate productivity losses due to an adverse inter-firm reallocation effect. Hence, the model establishes a causal link between the Melitz-type reallocation effect and the within-firm productivity changes, both of which have been identified as important sources of aggregate productivity gains from trade by recent empirical studies.","Univ Nottingham, Leverhulme Ctr Res Globalisat & Econ Policy, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Yu, ZH (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Leverhulme Ctr Res Globalisat & Econ Policy, Sch Econ, C4,Sir Clive Granger Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",zhihong.yu@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Yu, Zhihong/0000-0003-1533-3732",,,,,34,4,5,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This proposed method provides a comprehensive and systematic framework that combines bi-level multi-objective optimization with real option analysis (ROA) and fuzzy cooperative n-person game theory. The contribution of the proposed segment evaluation and selection method is fivefold: (1) it addresses the gaps in the marketing literature on the efficacious and effective assessment of market segments; (2) it provides a comprehensive and systematic framework that combines bi-level multi-objective optimization with ROA and fuzzy cooperative n-person game theory; (3) it considers fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets to represent ambiguous, uncertain or imprecise information; (4) it does not insist on consensus but synthesizes a representative outcome based on qualitative judgments and quantitative data; and (5) it is applicable to national and international market segmentation.

It extends Godley and Lavoie (Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth, 2007) and the Theory of the Monetary Circuit to give a mathematical representation of Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis. In the extended circuit, the central bank rate is not neutral and the path is non-ergodic. The extended circuit has survival constraints that include a living wage, a zero interest rate and an upper interest rate. Inflation is everywhere. The possibility of stable carry trades emerges. In high interest rate, hedge economies, powerful banks invest surplus loan interest. With speculation, banks lobby to enter investment markets and the system is precariously liquid/illiquid. In a Ponzi economy, where loans never get repaid, solvency is a balance between increasing reserves, reducing interest rates and rebuilding banks' balance sheets during systemic crises. Simulating bank bailouts, household bailouts and a Keynesian boost suggests that bank bailouts are the least effective intervention, exerting downward pressure on wages and household spending: austerity.","Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Lancastle, N (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",nml5@le.ac.uk,,"Lancastle, Neil/0000-0003-0316-3553",,,,,26,0,0,0,21,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,AUG 28,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201234.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-34,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,002KG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308530300001,0

Diverse fiscal policies, which are subject to fiscal limits and stochastic shocks, can threaten a monetary union. The fiscal limits arise due to distortionary taxation and political will. Stochastic shocks are random and could push a fiscally sound policy towards its limit. In equilibrium agents refuse to lend along a path which violates the fiscal limits, creating a fiscal solvency crisis. The dynamics leading to the crisis depend on the policy response to restore lending. We focus on two responses, default and policy switching. We simulate our model to quantify the probability of a fiscal solvency crisis in the European Monetary Union with fiscal variables at end of 2009 values.

A specific channel is explored through which the possible diaspora externality associated with the emigration of workers may occur: the removal of informational, cultural, and reputational barriers that could prevent firms of high-income countries from investing in the low-income immigrants' economies of origin. By means of a straightforward gravity specification, a fragmentation and multinational production model is taken to the data. The focus is on the mobility of capital and workers between the advanced European Union countries (EU15) and New Member States (NMS) in the 19952007 period. The evidence points to a significant correlation between the volume of EU15's activities in NMS and the total stock of NMS's own-migrants in the EU15 economies.","[Manchin, Miriam] UCL, SSEES, London WC1E 6BT, England; [De Simone, Gianfranco] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy; [De Simone, Gianfranco; Manchin, Miriam] Ctr Studi Luca dAgliano, Milan, Italy",University of London; University College London; University of Milan,"Manchin, M (通讯作者)，UCL, SSEES, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",m.manchin@ucl.ac.uk,"Manchin, Miriam/I-4615-2019","Manchin, Miriam/0000-0003-0099-1863; De Simone, Gianfranco/0000-0002-4424-9436",,,,,24,25,27,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

A contingent valuation survey was carried out in order to evaluate the economic benefits of improving coastal zone quality. The study area was coastal line of an area in Central Greece (Volos) where some beaches failures to meet the standards of the Blue Flag program. Our empirical findings suggest that the major variables affecting respondents' willingness to pay were related to previous environmental behavior. The previous respondents' participation in environmental protection programs by paying an amount was the most important determinate parameter for their WTP. Income, age, gender, coastal recreational activities and environmental quality of the site plays an important role to people's WTP for quality improvement of coastal zone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Discrimination makes some workers cheap to hire. As a consequence, some firms might save on capital costs adopting labour intensive technologies. This framework allows one to reconcile search models with three well-known facts regarding the labour market outcomes of minority workers: low wages, high unemployment and occupational segregation. Furthermore, the model questions the role of equal pay legislation in reducing inequality since removing this restriction, i.e., allowing firms to post type-contingent wages, eliminates the negative effects of discrimination on investment and wages.

We estimate a dynamic panel model using the system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). It is shown that the impact of financial variables depends strongly on the labour market context. Increased market capitalization as well as decreased banking concentration reduce unemployment if the level of labour market regulation, union density, and coordination in wage bargaining is low. Increasing intermediated credit and banking concentration is beneficial for employment when the degree of labour market regulation, union density, and wage coordination is high. These results suggest that the respective virtues of intermediated and market-based finance are crucially tied to the labour market context.","[Gatti, Donatella] Univ Paris 08, CEPN, EEP, CEPREMAP, F-93526 St Denis 02, France; [Rault, Christophe; Vaubourg, Anne-Gael] Univ Orleans, LEO, CNRS, UMR 6221, F-45067 Orleans 02, France; [Rault, Christophe] Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France",Universite Paris-VIII; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Orleans; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education,"Gatti, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, CEPN, EEP, CEPREMAP, F-93526 St Denis 02, France.",gatti@pse.ens.fr; christophe.rault@univ-orleans.fr; Anne-Gael.Vaubourg@univ-orleans.fr,"Gatti, Donatella/GRO-6034-2022","Gatti, Donatella/0000-0003-2836-4335",,,,,46,18,20,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Such settings are common in microeconometric applications where many instruments are used to improve efficiency and allowance for heteroskedasticity is generally important. The solution is a Fuller (1977) like estimator and standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity and many instruments. We show that the estimator has finite moments and high asymptotic efficiency in a range of cases. The standard errors are easy to compute, being like White's (1982), with additional terms that account for many instruments. They are consistent under standard, many instrument, and many weak instrument asymptotics. We find that the estimator is asymptotically as efficient as the limited-information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimator under many weak instruments. In Monte Carlo experiments, we find that the estimator performs as well as LIML or Fuller (1977) under homoskedasticity, and has much lower bias and dispersion under heteroskedasticity, in nearly all cases considered.","[Hausman, Jerry A.; Newey, Whitney K.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Woutersen, Tiemen] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Chao, John C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Swanson, Norman R.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Arizona; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Hausman, JA (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jhausman@mit.edu; wnewey@mit.edu; woutersen@email.arizona.edu; chao@econ.umd.edu; nswanson@econ.rutgers.edu,,"Chao, John/0000-0003-3889-0451",ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,30,55,66,2,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The link between the distribution of income and competitiveness is also analysed. It is shown that labour income repression is not necessary to maintain competitiveness. Quite to the contrary, in this period of international crisis the labour income share should recover lost ground if Thailand and other Asian countries want to rebalance growth in favour of domestic demand.","Univ Paris 13, CEPN, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",Universite Paris 13,"Jetin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, CEPN, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",bjetin@yahoo.fr,"Jetin, Bruno/GXW-1017-2022","Jetin, Bruno/0000-0002-1354-5291",,,,,35,5,6,2,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

When the marginal cost is low, the complete graph is efficient, while high marginal costs imply that the efficient network is asymmetric and has a nested structure. Regarding the stability of network structures, we show the existence of both symmetric and asymmetric equilibria. The efficient network is stable for small industry size and small cost. In contrast, for large industry size, there is a wide region of cost in which the efficient network is not stable. This implies a divergence between efficiency and stability in large industries.

Output and the nominal interest rate are less volatile under flexible inflation targeting than under almost-strict inflation targeting.

The recent global financial crisis, however, was accompanied by an exogenous upward spike in the international price of food, which led some countries to raise export barriers, thereby exacerbating both the price spike and the international welfare transfer associated with that change in the terms of trade. As in previous price-spike periods, that response by some food-exporting countries was accompanied by a lowering of import restrictions by numerous food-importing countries, further exacerbating the international price spike. This paper provides new evidence up to 2010 on the extent of the change in domestic relative to international prices in both groups of countries, and compares it with responses during two previous food price-spike periods. It concludes that there is a need for stronger World Trade Organization disciplines on export as well as import restrictions, so as to limit the extent to which beggar-thy-neighbour government responses to international price spikes (up or down) exacerbate those shocks.","[Anderson, Kym; Nelgen, Signe] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Adelaide; Australian National University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au; signe.nelgen@gmail.com,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,42,42,45,1,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

This paper examines the conditions under which this holds in an anarchy equilibrium in which players may allocate labor to production, to conflict, or to the public good of secure claims to property protection. In a simultaneous choice Nash equilibrium, no secure claims to property are created. However, if players play a sequential choice game in which secure claims to property protection occurs in the first stage, then the strategic benefit of reducing others' subsequent conflict allocation causes secure claims to property to arise. Secure claims to property in a social contract are imperfect, but for sufficiently high productivity of resources, the social contract welfare dominates autocracy.","[Boyce, John R.] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Bruner, David M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of Calgary; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Boyce, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",boyce@ucalgary.ca; brunerdm@appstate.edu,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Relying on a standard job search and matching framework and empirical evidence from a wide array of labor market indicators, we examine whether the natural rate of unemployment has increased since the recession began, and if so, whether the underlying causes are transitory or persistent. Our preferred estimate indicates an increase in the natural rate of unemployment of about one percentage point during the recession and its immediate aftermath, putting the current natural rate at around 6 percent. An assessment of the underlying factors responsible for this increase, including labor market mismatch, extended unemployment benefits, and uncertainty about overall economic conditions, implies that only a small fraction is likely to be persistent.","[Daly, Mary C.; Hobijn, Bart; Valletta, Robert G.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA; [Sahin, Ayseguel] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Daly, MC (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA.",mary.daly@sf.frb.org,,,,,,,53,53,62,0,21,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The paper aims to examine in which areas Vojvodina Province is more competitive as a business tourism destination and where it is less competitive compared to competitive set of three chosen destinations. Also, this paper aims to test relationships between destination competitiveness determinants in order to determine the weakest point of Vojvodina Province business tourism competitiveness, and specifically the position of destination management. The study results indicate that two determinants: destination management and destination policy, planning and development are the weakest points of Vojvodina Province competitiveness, while highest ratings are assigned to core resources and attractors determinant. The results will be most valuable in assisting destination management organizations, tourism policy creators and tourism practitioners to better understand identified destination advantages and problems in business tourism and general tourism development in Vojvodina Province, and to formulate strategies to effectively manage destination disadvantages.","[Dragicevic, Vanja; Blesic, Ivana; Stankov, Ugljesa] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Jovicic, Dobrica] Univ Belgrade, Fac Geog, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Boskovic, Desimir] Inst Agr & Tourism, Porec 52440, Croatia",University of Novi Sad; University of Belgrade; Institute of Agriculture & Tourism Porec,"Dragicevic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 3, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",vanja.dragicevic@dgt.uns.ac.rs; dobricaj@eunet.rs; ivana.blesic@gmail.com; stankovugljesa@yahoo.com; desimir@iptpo.hr,"Pavlukovic, Vanja/AAO-4957-2020; Blešić, Ivana/AAO-7662-2020; Stankov, Uglješa/ABV-0997-2022; Rodrigues de Assis, Iracema/HJZ-4230-2023","Blešić, Ivana/0000-0003-2534-3280; Stankov, Uglješa/0000-0002-7731-592X; Pavlukovic, Vanja/0000-0001-7093-3656",,,,,58,34,35,4,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

One of the most common devices has been legal tender laws that have assured the acceptance of these currencies as tax payments. Economic theory has largely ignored this mechanism, except for the static models of Starr (Econometrica 42:45-54, 1974; Econ Theory 21:455-474, 2003). I provide the first dynamic model of this mechanism, thus showing explicitly the medium of exchange role of money, accounting for expectations about the government's survival, and enabling more realistic taxation systems. I show that a stable government can promote its currency by refusing to accept other objects in tax payments. While this mechanism has similarities to convertibility, it differs from it on a critical aspect: with this mechanism the government can often keep its favorite money in circulation even while increasing its quantity and thus causing it to decrease in value. This opens the door for a successful inflationary policy.","Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Goldberg, D (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",dg@drorgoldberg.com,,,,,,,26,12,12,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Our approach to test the Monday effect is based on spatial dominance, which enables us to analyze the expected sum of instantaneous utilities during trading hours by considering the intraday patterns of returns. The testing of the methods used in previous studies compares the expected utilities only at a specific time, usually market closing time. Empirical results from our tests provide strong evidence of the Monday effect for the 1983 to 1987 period. We also find that the Monday effect is driven by large negative returns accrued during early Monday mornings, The conventional analyses for the Monday effect, such as regression analysis and stochastic dominance, cannot provide strong evidence of the Monday effect for the same period because these testing methods do not consider the return behavior during Monday mornings.","[Lee, Sungro; Kim, Chang Sik; Kim, In-Moo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",sungro@skku.edu; skimcs@skku.edu; inmookim@skku.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,17,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

We examine how conventional comparative advantage (search, communication, trade and diversification costs) and the concern of the product-defect risk arising from outsourcing jointly determine the organization of production and trade.

Our figure is more conservative than the $50 billion figure often cited by other authors, and we also note that the figure would be much higher if it were not for private investment in anti-spam technology by firms, which we detail further on. Based on the work of crafty computer scientists who have infiltrated and monitored spammers' activity, we estimate that spammers and spam-advertised merchants collect gross worldwide revenues on the order of $200 million per year. Thus, the externality ratio of external costs to internal benefits for spam is around 100:1. In this paper, we start by describing the history of the market for spam, highlighting the strategic cat-and-mouse game between spammers and email providers. We discuss how the market structure for spamming has evolved from a diffuse network of independent spammers running their own online stores to a highly specialized industry featuring a well-organized network of merchants, spam distributors (botnets), and spammers (or advertisers). We then put the spam market's externality ratio of 100 into context by comparing it to other activities with negative externalities. Lastly, we evaluate various policy proposals designed to solve the spam problem, cautioning that these proposals may err in assuming away the spammers' ability to adapt.","[Rao, Justin M.] Microsoft Res, New York, NY USA; [Reiley, David H.] Google Inc, Mountain View, CA USA; [Rao, Justin M.; Reiley, David H.] Yahoo Res, Santa Clara, CA USA",Microsoft; Google Incorporated; Yahoo!

There are numerous reasons why real monetary policy can be asymmetric and estimated Taylor rules nonlinear. This paper tests whether monetary policy can be described as asymmetric in three new European Union (EU) members (the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland) which apply an inflation targeting regime. Two different empirical frameworks are used: (i) Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation of models that allow discrimination between sources of potential policy asymmetry but are conditioned by specific underlying relations, and (ii) a flexible framework of sample splitting where nonlinearity enters via a threshold variable and monetary policy is allowed to switch between regimes. We find generally little evidence for asymmetric policy driven by nonlinearities in economic systems, some evidence for asymmetric preferences, and some interesting evidence on policy switches driven by the intensity of financial distress in the economy.

Firstly, some operational laws of interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are introduced. Then some new aggregation operators including interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy ordered weighted geometric (IITFOWG) operator and interval imtuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy hybrid geometric (IITFHG) operator are proposed and some desirable properties of these operators are studied, such as commutativity, idempotency and monotonicity. An IITFWG and IITFHG operators-based approach is developed to solve the MAGDM problems in which both the attribute weights and the expert weights take the form of real numbers and attribute values take the form of interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Finally, some illustrative examples are given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.","[Wei, Guiwu; Zhao, Xiaofei; Wang, Hongjun] Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Inst Decis Sci, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R China",Chongqing University of Arts & Sciences,"Wei, GW (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Inst Decis Sci, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R China.",weiguiwu@163.com,"Wei, Guiwu/M-4177-2015","Wei, Guiwu/0000-0001-9074-2005",,,,,49,42,42,0,27,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In this model, when it comes to choosing one lottery over another, each alternative has a chance of being selected, unless one lottery stochastically dominates the other. An individual behaves as if he or she compares lotteries to a reference lottery-the least upper bound or the greatest lower bound in terms of stochastic dominance. The proposed model is compatible with several well-known violations of expected utility theory such as the common ratio effect and the violations of betweenness. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the proposed model are completeness, weak stochastic transitivity, continuity, common consequence independence, outcome monotonicity, and odds ratio independence.","Univ Innsbruck, Inst Publ Finance, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Blavatskyy, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Inst Publ Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Pavlo.Blavatskyy@uibk.ac.at,,,,,,,54,11,11,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The sensory system encodes information through cell-firing. Cell-firing is measured against a threshold, and an action is triggered depending on whether the threshold is surpassed. The decision system modulates the threshold. We show that the (constrained) optimal threshold is set in a way that existing beliefs are likely to be confirmed. We then derive behavioral implications. Our mechanism can explain in a unified framework a number of 'anomalies' noted in psychology and economics: (i) belief anchoring (the order in which evidence is received affects beliefs and choices): (ii) polarization (individuals with opposite priors may polarize their opinions after receiving identical evidence): (iii) payoff-dependence of beliefs and (iv) belief disagreement (individuals with identical priors who receive the same evidence may end up with different posterior beliefs).

Evidence from World Bank Lending,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,E62; O23,FISCAL-POLICY; PURCHASES; SHOCKS,"This article proposes a novel approach to empirically identifying government spending multipliers that relies on two features unique to many low-income countries: (1) borrowing from the World Bank finances a substantial fraction of government spending, and (2) spending on World Bank-financed projects is typically spread out over several years following the original approval of the project. The first fact means that fluctuations in spending on World Bank-financed projects are a significant source of fluctuations in overall government spending in these countries. The second fact means that fluctuations in World Bank-financed spending in a given year are largely determined by fluctuations in project approval decisions made in previous years, and so are unlikely to be correlated with shocks to output in the current year. I use World Bank project-level disbursement data to isolate the component of World Bank-financed government spending in a given year that is associated with past project approval decisions. I use this as an instrument for total government spending to estimate multipliers in a sample of 29 primarily low-income countries where variation in government spending from this source is large relative to the size of the economy. The resulting spending multipliers are small and reasonably precisely estimated to be in the vicinity of 0.5.","World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Kraay, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,36,62,83,2,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Labor market frictions raise the optimal steady state ratio of government spending to private consumption. The labor tax rate is higher since profits are taxed that arise from employed workers which save hirings costs. For calibrated examples, the quantitative effect of labor market frictions on optimal fiscal policy is small. In the short run, optimal policy involves a strongly procyclical reaction of the tax rate to technology and preference shocks, while the ratio of public to private spending is close to flat. This ratio is, however, markedly counter-cyclical if taxes are constrained to be constant over the cycle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a model that allows a multinational firm to determine both the leverage and ownership structure in affiliates endogenously. A main finding is that affiliates with minority owners have less debt than wholly owned affiliates and therefore a less tax-efficient financing structure. This is due to an externality that arises endogenously in our model, where costs and benefits of debt shifting are shared asymmetrically between minority and majority owners.

Each decision-maker chooses an action and receives an informative but imperfect signal of the once-and-for-all realization of an unobserved state. The state affects all individuals' preferences over present and future decisions. Decision-makers do not directly observe the realized signals or actions of their predecessors. Instead, they must rely on cheap-talk messages in order to accumulate information about the state. Each decision-maker is therefore both a receiver of information with respect to his decision and a sender with respect to all future decisions. We show that if preferences are not perfectly aligned, full learning equilibria-ones in which the individuals' posterior beliefs eventually place full weight on the true state-do not exist. This is so both in the case of private communication, in which each individual only hears the message of his immediate predecessor, and in the case of public communication, in which a decision-maker hears the message of all his predecessors. Surprisingly, in the latter case full learning may be impossible even in the limit as all members of the organization become perfectly patient. We also consider the case where all individuals have access to a mediator who can work across time periods arbitrarily far apart. In this case, full learning equilibria exist.","[Anderlini, Luca; Lagunoff, Roger] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Anderlini, L (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,"Gerardi, Dino/R-7279-2018","Gerardi, Donato/0000-0003-0577-178X",,,,,32,3,4,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We examine the effects of these policy changes on the probability of employment for disability beneficiaries as well as the flows onto and off the disability rolls. We obtain our estimates using a difference-in-difference strategy that exploits the unique structure of disability insurance arrangements in Canada, namely that there are two programs: one that covers individuals in the province of Quebec, and one in the rest of Canada. Our preferred estimates indicate that the introduction of the allowable earnings change increased the propensity of disability beneficiaries to work, but we do not find that the earnings exemption had an effect on the flows on to or off the disability rolls.

Intersectoral factor immobility complicates the optimal monetary policy problem by creating a tradeoff between stabilizing tradable and nontradable sector labor. When labor is mobile between sectors, policy coordination can significantly reduce labor volatility.

In this paper we analyze the impact of such commitments on equilibrium outcomes in a model that reflects important institutional and structural features of electricity markets. We show that, when firms are asymmetric, the distribution of contracts among firms matters. In the case of a single dominant firm, the regulator can be confident that allocating contracts to that firm will be pro-competitive. However, when asymmetries are less extreme, certain contract allocations might yield anti-competitive outcomes by eliminating more competitive equilibria. Our analysis thus suggests that forward contracts should be allocated so as to (virtually) reduce asymmetries across firms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A much-discussed channel of propagation hinges on the international exposure of the balance sheet of highly leveraged players to toxic US assets. Yet, existing evidence on the role of exposure is mixed at best. This paper argues that under financial integration, the fact that leveraged investors face the same returns across internationally traded assets, would tend to equalize their borrowing cost across countries. Model simulations show that an unexpected increase in credit spreads in one country generates a similar increase in credit spreads in other financially integrated countries bringing about a global contraction, quite independently of the exposure to foreign assets in the balance sheet of leveraged investors. Our analysis thus suggests some caution in assessing the risks of contagion on the exclusive basis of quantitative measures of integration based on cross-border balance sheet exposure.","[Dedola, Luca] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Dedola, L (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,52,51,61,1,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Increased competition not only reduces the profits of entrants and the acquirer of the inventions in a similar fashion, but also reduces the profit of non-acquirers. Therefore, incumbents' valuations of innovations are less negatively affected by increased competition, and the incentive for innovation for sale can increase with increased competition. Moreover, a stricter, but not too strict, merger policy is shown to increase the incentive for innovations for sale by ensuring the bidding competition for the innovation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze 10 non-rate tax system aspects, codified based on recent reports published by the Organisation for Co-operation and Development. We find that a single factor (which we call Dispersed Responsibility), related to the role of taxpayers and third parties in tax collection, can reasonably summarize the cross-country covariation, and offer it as a parsimonious measure of non-rate tax system dimensions for future empirical analysis. We also ascertain that a standard measure of trust in government is positively associated with greater administrator coverage and administrative assessment, as well as more serious sanctions for non-compliance. Ethnic heterogeneity, individualism, and a history of external conflict also can explain certain aspects of tax systems. We find that countries with greater trust in government score lower on Dispersed Responsibility. Finally, we find that adding a measure of the number of tax authority employees can eliminate the otherwise significant positive estimated coefficient of GDP per capita on the tax level, and attracts a significant positive correlation itself, suggesting that the extent of tax administration and enforcement is part of the story that explains the enduring statistical regularity between tax levels and per capita income.","[Robinson, Leslie] Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Slemrod, Joel] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Slemrod, Joel] Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Dartmouth College; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Robinson, L (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, 100 Tuck Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",Leslie.A.Robinson@tuck.dartmouth.edu; jslemrod@umich.edu,"Slemrod, Joel/AAJ-5709-2020",,,,,,36,14,18,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Our results suggest that decentralized and market-driven programs (subsidies for hiring and training) are more efficient than centralized (direct employment) programs in terms of productivity, but are targeted to people that are less vulnerable to unemployment. Direct employment programs result in moderate increases of the income of the participants' households. However, these increases may be outweighted by the costs (in present value) associated with unintended consequences (higher school drop-out and participation rates). If analyzed at the municipality level, centralized programs do not target municipalities with higher unemployment and vulnerability to unemployment, or even with lower median income levels, but appear to have a strong political component. Our results also suggest that the population targeted in direct employment programs is not more vulnerable to unemployment than the currently unemployed.","[Romulo Chumacero, E.] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Ricardo Paredes, M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Chumacero, ER (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",rchumace@econ.uchile.cl; rparedes@ing.puc.cl,"Paredes, Ricardo D/M-1653-2013",,,,,,17,0,0,0,4,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

This result ensures that the value of a stock vector is jointly continuous with respect to the stock vector and its support price vector.

In addition, subjective perceptions of job security depend on local labor market conditions indicating the informational value of employment data. For unemployed persons we cannot find any welfare gains owing to a social norm effect. Thus, the existence of a public bad is not more enjoyable the more people suffer from the public bad.

Then each agent has a feasible interval of shares where his preferences are single-peaked. A rule has to propose to each agent a feasible share.

Specifically, based on an a priori definition of housing submarkets and the assumption of a multifactor model, toe develop maximum likelihood methodology to estimate hedonic models that facilitate understanding of both spatial heterogeneity and spatial interactions.

The income effects were, however, statistically insignificant, as they may have been captured by choices of appliances rather than utilisation. The estimated model results were then employed to examine the effect of a proposed change in the tariff structure for electricity in Barbados. The simulated results seem to indicate that changes in the electricity rate structure are likely to have very little impact on households demand for electricity.

Both the theoretical model and the empirical results based on a survey of 453 households in Anhui Province indicate that agricultural labor input and small-sized machinery investment are gross complements rather than substitutes when machinery services are available in the market. Consequently, farmers with small-sized machinery are more likely to reduce their off-farm employment time. On the other hand, an increase in off-farm employment is more likely to reduce the possibility of possessing small-sized machineries mainly due to substitution effects of market machinery services.

Our empirical results indicate that technical efficiency has worsened across all industries and plant-size groups. In contrast, we find evidence of substantial technical progress in all industries. In fact, technical progress has been larger than technical efficiency deterioration in most industries and plant-size groups, leading to total factor productivity growth.

Results suggest that the assumption implicit in additive expected utility models that relative risk aversion (RRA) is the inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) is flawed. Specifically, our RRA and EIS estimates are consistent with a preference for the early resolution of uncertainty, which we believe is driven importantly by the instrumental value of early uncertainty resolution.

While the average American today lives in a household of only three people, in 1850 household size was twice that figure. Furthermore, both the number of children and the number of adults in a household have fallen dramatically. We develop a simple theory of household size where living with others is beneficial solely because the costs of household public goods can be shared. In other words, we abstract from intrafamily relations and focus on households as collections of roommates. The model's mechanism is that rising income leads to a falling expenditure share on household public goods, which endogenously makes household formation less beneficial and privacy more attractive. To assess the magnitude of this mechanism, we first calibrate the model to match the relationship between household size, consumption patterns, and income in the cross section at the end of the 20th century. We then project the model back to 1850 by changing income. We find that our proposed mechanism can account for 37 percent of the decline in the number of adults in a household between 1850 and 2000, and for 16 percent of the decline in the number of children.","[Salcedo, Alejandrina] Banco Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Schoellman, Todd] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Tertilt, Michele] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Tertilt, Michele] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Bank of Mexico; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Mannheim; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Salcedo, A (通讯作者)，Banco Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",asalcedo@banxico.org.mx; todd.schoellman@gmail.com; tertilt@uni-mannheim.de,,"Tertilt, Michele/0000-0003-0605-4141",,,,,58,29,34,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

There is a banking crisis: banks are undercapitalized and have faced liquidity problems. There is a sovereign debt crisis: a number of countries have faced rising bond yields and challenges funding themselves. Lastly, there is a growth crisis: economic growth is slow in the euro area overall and unequally distributed across countries. These crises connect with one another in several ways: the problems of weak banks and high sovereign debt are mutually reinforcing, and both are exacerbated by weak growth but also in turn constrain growth. This paper details the three crises, their interconnections, and possible policy solutions. Policy responses that fail to take into account the interdependent nature of the problems will likely be incomplete or even counterproductive. A broader point also becomes clear: a currency union may not need a fiscal union, but it does likely need both a financial union and some way to adjust for unbalanced economic conditions across countries.","Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Shambaugh, JC (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,72,147,169,1,24,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Information security is identified as one of the requirements for the successful e-Government implementation although the government has not adopted any standards or issued guidelines to government agencies with regards to information security. Comprehensive addressing of information security can be an expensive undertaking and without guidelines information security implementations may be more prone to failure. In a resource poor country such as Tanzania, there is a need for a cost effective and sustainable means of addressing information security in e-Government implementations. In this paper the authors present a case study of an e-Government interaction between a ministry and a government agency and the information security challenges identified in the implementation. In order to address these challenges an information security framework is conceptualized using action research. The framework is applied in the case study to address the identified challenges and the means to address future challenges in a sustainable manner is identified. Finally, the proposed framework is evaluated against Tanzanian and international metrics.","[Wangwe, Carina Kabajunga; Eloff, Maria Margaretha] Univ S Africa, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Venter, Lucas] North West Univ, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa",University of South Africa; North West University - South Africa,"Wangwe, CK (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, POB 392 UNISA 000, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",carina.wangwe@gmail.com; eloffmm@unisa.ac.za; lucas.venter@nwu.ac.za,"Eloff, Mariki/B-5431-2009","Eloff, Mariki/0000-0001-8997-7931; Venter, Lucas Marthinus/0000-0003-3608-2872",,,,,31,9,11,0,33,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The new round of electricity system reform provides a good opportunity to consolidate and integrate DSM policy and expedite its development and implementation. DSM policy can be upgraded by incorporating it into the current electricity system reform. Comparing the potential acceleration of electricity price reform with the possibility of imposing a System Benefit Charge (SBC), the author argues that support for a SEC would be much easier to gather among policymakers and stakeholders in a short time and would have a much better policy effect in the current situation. The author discusses three kinds of price discrimination related to the DSM development in China: time-based electricity pricing, electricity price discrimination for industrial structure adjustment in China (Fujian Province as a case), and direct power purchases by large customers and preferential tariff policy. These can be well designed to be combined with DSM and energy efficiency policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Because quality is privately observed, adverse selection implies that the market can only offer a price that reflects the average quality of ideas sold. Only workers with good ideas decide to spin off, whereas workers with mediocre ideas sell them. Existing firms pay a price for ideas sold in the market that implies zero expected profits. Hence, firms project selection is independent of firm size, which can lead to scale-independent growth.

Because school effort is unobservable to households and policymakers, schools have an incentive to under provide effort. This moral hazard affects both public and private schools, although public schools are subject to an additional distortion because of limited competition and fixed funding. Household monitoring of schools can mitigate moral hazard, but some households may free-ride on the monitoring of others. Using our calibrated model we simulate two policies aimed at raising achievement: public monitoring of public schools and private school vouchers. Our results indicate that in large scale settings no single tool may suffice. The reason is twofold: a) no tool raises achievement or welfare for all households; and b) since the extent of moral hazard is endogenous, the application of each tool has unintended consequences that limit its own effectiveness. Results also indicate that setting the policy parameters for public schools at the levels preferred by the majority of households may mitigate the distortions. Nonetheless, the current actual values of these parameters seem to match more closely the preferences of public schools than the preferences of parents. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Under a limited budget, the public supplier uses a rationing policy. A private firm may supply the good to those consumers who are rationed by the public system. Consumers have different amounts of wealth, and costs of providing the good to them vary. We consider two regimes. First, the public supplier observes consumers wealth information; second, the public supplier observes both wealth and cost information. The public supplier chooses a rationing policy, and, simultaneously, the private firm, observing only cost but not wealth information, chooses a pricing policy. In the first regime, there is a continuum of equilibria. The Pareto dominant equilibrium is a means-test equilibrium: poor consumers are supplied while rich consumers are rationed. Prices in the private market increase with the budget. In the second regime, there is a unique equilibrium. This exhibits a cost-effectiveness rationing rule; consumers are supplied if and only if their costbenefit ratios are low. Prices in the private market do not change with the budget. Equilibrium consumer utility is higher in the cost-effectiveness equilibrium than the means-test equilibrium.","[Grassi, Simona] Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ & Econometr, Fac Business & Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Grassi, Simona] Univ Lausanne, Inst Econ & Management Sante, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Ma, Ching-To Albert] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",University of Lausanne; University of Lausanne; Boston University,"Grassi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ & Econometr, Fac Business & Econ, Bldg Internef, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",simona.grassi@unil.ch; ma@bu.edu,,,,,,,10,8,8,1,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

It compares the economic performance of two alternative tax systems: a wage tax system and a sales-tax-cum-labor-subsidy system. The two systems are applied to the small country, while the wage tax system always obtains in the large country. The main result is that the sales tax system outperforms the wage tax system, using standard economic indicators. Moreover, it turns out that under the sales tax system economic activities appear to be moving toward the 'better' of two theoretical equilibria. It is argued that producers' reluctance to incur costs up-front while being uncertain about product prices can explain these results. Several pieces of evidence are provided to support this claim. The results strongly suggest that behavioral aspects should be taken into account also in applied macroeconomic models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, new structured securities have been developed, e.g., MBS, CDOs, and CDS, which have acted as instruments of risk transfer. We show that there is a certain non-robustness in the pricing of these instruments and we create a model in which both their role in the recent financial market meltdown, and in which the mechanism by which they exacerbate leverage cycles, is explicit. We first discuss the extent to which complex securities can amplify boom-bust cycles. Then, we propose a model in which distinct financial market boom-bust cycles emerge naturally.

We argue that this relation is more subtle. The endogenous choices of prices and quantities by a cartel of oil exporters, such as the OPEC, can affect the directions of the changes in the likelihood of equilibrium indeterminacy. We show that fluctuations driven by self-fulfilling expectations under oil shocks are easier to occur if the cartel sets the price of oil, but the result is reversed if the cartel sets the quantity of production. These results offer a potentially interesting explanation for the decline in economic volatility (i.e., the Great Moderation) in oil importing countries since the mid-1980s when the OPEC cartel changed its market strategies from setting prices to setting quantities, despite the fact that oil prices are far more volatile today than they were 30 years ago.

The empirical investigation is carried out in an Error Correction Vector Autoregressive (ECVAR) framework based on the theory of cointegration and error-correction representation of cointegrated variables. The results provide evidence in favor of the presence of a long-run relationship between the exchange rate and the spread between US and EA (Eurozone) interest rates. With respect to the direction of causality, the empirical findings show that in the long and short-run there is a unidirectional causal relationship between interest-rate spreads and the US Dollar Euro exchange rate.

We use auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) modelling to develop a dynamic structure of the B-S hypothesis. Using annual data from Penn World Table Version 7.0 and the 'bounds test', we found no evidence of the B-S hypothesis in six sampled countries (Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and the only exception was Bangladesh. We found that a 1% increase in labour productivity in Bangladesh relative to the US will lead to 2.5% appreciation in the real exchange rate of Bangladesh. The speed of adjustment towards equilibrium was found to be high, with short-run disequilibrium correcting by nearly 25% per annum in Bangladesh. The two endogenously determined structural breaks are found to be negative and statistically significant. These results add new insights to the time-series literature on the B-S hypothesis.","Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Chowdhury, K (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",khorshed@uow.edu.au,,,,,,,48,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We consider an evolutionary industry simulation model based on Nelson and Winter (1982), in which R&D efforts of an incumbent firm generate technological know-how embodied in key R&D employees, who might use this know-how to found a spinoff of the incumbent. Venture capital is needed to finance a spinoff, so that the expected profits from founding a spinoff depend on how easily venture capital can be acquired. Accordingly, thick venture capital markets might have two opposing effects. First, incentives of firms to invest in R&D might be reduced and, second, if spinoff formation results in technological spillovers between the parent firm and the spinoffs, the generation of spinoff firms might positively influence the future efficiency of the incumbent's innovation efforts. We study the manner in which this tradeoff influences the effect of venture capital on innovation expenditures, speed of technological change and evolution of industry concentration in several scenarios with different industry characteristics.","[Dawid, Herbert; Kabus, Kordian] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Colombo, Luca] Catholic Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Milan, Italy; [Dawid, Herbert] Univ Bielefeld, Inst Math Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Bielefeld,"Dawid, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",lucava.colombo@unicatt.it; hadwid@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de; kordian.kabus@uni-bielefeld.de,"Dawid, Herbert/K-8627-2012","Dawid, Herbert/0000-0002-8536-9960",,,,,45,6,7,4,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The rational expectations hypothesis is tested by comparing the estimated belief function with the 'true' offer function which is estimated extraneously using data on offers actually made to contestants.

We focus on the interaction between SO2 and NOx, as they became more highly regulated and estimate shadow prices of the pollutants and the Morishima elasticity of transformation between two pollutants, NOx and SO2, as well as with respect to the desirable output, kilowatt-hours of electricity.

This phenomenon is known as the natural resource curse. We develop an infinite-horizon, two-country model of trade in which countries are identical, except that one country is endowed with deposits of an exhaustible resource and the other is not. Within the context of the model, we show that this phenomenon can be explained in part by an inelastic demand for the exhaustible resource that increases growth in trade revenues and induces the resource-abundant country to invest relatively less than the country lacking in exhaustible resources. These results are derived analytically and illustrated by an empirical analysis based on plausible parameters obtained from data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This article fills the gap in the theoretical literature concerning mergers in pharmaceutical markets. To prevent generic firms from increasing their market share, some brand-name firms produce generics themselves, called pseudo-generics. We develop a Cournot duopoly model by considering the pseudo-generics production as a mergers' catalyst. We show that a brand-name company always has an incentive to purchase its competitor. The key insight of this article is that the brand-name laboratory can increase its merger gain by producing pseudo-generics beforehand. In some cases, pseudo-generics would not otherwise be produced and this production is then a predatory strategy.","[Granier, Laurent] Univ Lyon 2, CNRS UMR 5824, GATE Lyon St Etienne, F-69365 Lyon 07, France; [Trinquard, Sebastien] UNOCAM, F-75006 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2,"Granier, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 2, CNRS UMR 5824, GATE Lyon St Etienne, F-69365 Lyon 07, France.",granier@gate.cnrs.fr,,,,,,,22,4,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The World Food Programme estimated that between 2.1 and 3.2 million people were threatened by starvation. Despite this assumed severity, not much research on the actual consequences of the crisis has been carried out so far. In order to fill this gap, this paper aims to identify the effects of the 2002 food crisis on the health status of the very young children exposed to it. Given the lack of longitudinal data and data collected during the crisis, assessing the potential impact of the 2002 events and the emergency aid that followed is challenging. We rely on representative data collected before and after the crisis and various methods from the impact evaluation literature to create a counterfactual in order to assess the implications of the crisis. Our analysis indicates that the net impact of the crisis was surprisingly low. Under-five excess mortality must have been below the 10,000 crisis-induced deaths suggested by some NGOs. Moreover, we also do not find any general and lasting loss in weight or height of children below the age of five. Nevertheless, if we disaggregate our sample population further by age and gender, we do find some nutritional impacts, both positive and negative. The positive effects identified seem to be the result of the combined influence of selective mortality and effective aid and policy interventions responding to the crisis.","[Hartwig, Renate; Grimm, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Grimm, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",grimm@iss.nl,,,,,,,50,2,4,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

We find general support for the relationship that when companies do more harm, they also do more good. The empirical analysis is based on an extensive 15-year panel dataset that covers nearly 3,000 publicly traded companies. In addition to the overall finding that more CSI results in more CSR, we find evidence of heterogeneity among industries, where the effect is stronger in industries where CSI tends to be the subject of greater public scrutiny. We also investigate the degree of substitutability between different categories of CSR and CSI. Within the categories of community relations, environment, and human rights-arguably among those dimensions of social responsibility that are most salient-there is a strong within-category relationship. In contrast, the within-category relationship for corporate governance is weak, but CSI related to corporate governance appears to increase CSR in most other categories. Thus, when CSI concerns arise about corporate governance, companies seemingly choose to offset with CSR in other dimensions, rather than reform governance itself.","[Kotchen, Matthew] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kotchen, Matthew] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Moon, Jon J.] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Korea University,"Kotchen, M (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",matthew.kotchen@yale.edu; jonjmoon@korea.ac.kr,,"Moon, Jon/0000-0001-6697-4340",,,,,31,171,194,4,87,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This reveals the existence of a type of individual who shares reluctantly, preferring to avoid the opportunity to share. Second, after subsidizing the sharing environment, the aggregate amount shared increases, but less is shared, on average, by those who enter. Thus, subsidies intended to induce more sharing have weak effects since they attract those who share the least.","[Lazear, Edward P.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Knight Management Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Malmendier, Ulrike] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Weber, Roberto A.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Zurich,"Lazear, EP (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Knight Management Ctr, 655 Knight Way,E346, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lazear@stanford.edu; ulrike@econ.berkeley.edu; roberto.weber@econ.uzh.ch,"Weber, Roberto/H-3464-2011; Seheda, Serhii/M-5655-2016","Seheda, Serhii/0000-0002-6179-564X; Malmendier, Ulrike/0000-0002-2786-4365",,,,,48,150,162,1,26,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

Specification tests, i.e. F-test and Hausman test indicate that the fixed effect model can be considered as the best model to examine the relationship between budget deficit and price level. Empirical findings also show that budget deficit is significant and negatively related with the price level in pooled least square, while fixed and random effect model explain that the budget deficit has no role in explaining the given scenario. The GDP per capita is positively and highly significant in all of the models, while openness is explaining its role in reducing the price level in the specified set of countries. The additional robustness tests are also performed to test the validity of results of the model. After removing the variable, i.e. GDP(PC) from the fixed effect model, the budget deficit (BD) significantly impacts on the SAARC price level. Our findings substantiate that fiscal theory of price level is not valid in the selected SAARC countries.

Our findings indicate that SMEs are pushed to follow the early internationalization path mainly by internal capabilities related to international social capital, to a smaller extent by their unique resources or capabilities, and indirectly by prior international business experience of their manages.

The relevance of considering breaks is demonstrated by utilizing the Johansen et al. (2000) procedure that allows for up to two predetermined breaks. The results provide support for long-run G-PPP and suggest that the larger group ASEAN5+Big3 could form an OCA in one step. Conversely, for smaller groups, such as the Big3, an OCA is not supported. However, adding one or more countries to the Big3 supports an OCA. The impact of the Asian crisis seems to be limited to when the US is the base country and the results suggest a change in the G-PPP relationship between the pre- and postcrisis periods.

An estimated 1600 fans per game were lost as a result of these payroll efficiency strategies, which produce teams composed of young, relatively unknown players and game tactics perceived as less exciting than more traditional approaches.","Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College,"Regan, CS (通讯作者)，Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",csr02005@mymail.pomona.edu,,,,,,,21,3,4,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Knowledge of inter-regional trade flows, at least of the pooled volume of exports and imports by commodity, is critical in accounting for important spillover and feedback effects deriving from inter-regional linkages. However, in most countries, there are no completely reliable survey-based statistics on inter-regional trade. Thus, this paper intends to evaluate the reasonability of using indirect inter-regional trade estimates, comparing different estimating methods and assessing the sensitivity of the model results. Based on our empirical comparisons we conclude that input-output models are not greatly affected by the insertion of different trade values. Thus, our results support the use of indirect estimates for inter-regional trade, whenever survey-based data are unavailable.","[Sargento, Ana L.

In this paper, an attempt is made to introduce the balance-of-payments constraint hypothesis into the neoclassical growth model through a consideration of a sample of 14 European Union (EU) countries over the period 1980-2004. A panel data model is estimated using different proxies for human capital and foreign trade as conditioning factors to explain growth. The income-elasticity ratio with respect to exports and imports and the degree of openness are also used to capture the effects of (non-price) competitiveness and trade intensification on growth. The regression analysis shows that the inclusion of human capital, external trade and interaction terms between them have significant effects on growth. Depending on the combination of variables used, the constraining factor to growth can be shown to be due to foreign trade, human capital or both.","[Soukiazis, Elias; Antunes, Micaela] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Soukiazis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Off 519,Av Dias Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal.",elias@fe.uc.pt,"Antunes, Micaela/A-8228-2013; Antunes, Micaela/GQZ-8240-2022; Antunes, Micaela/AAD-8220-2020","Antunes, Micaela/0000-0002-2113-2139; Antunes, Micaela/0000-0002-2113-2139; Soukiazis, Elias/0000-0001-9265-0438",,,,,49,12,13,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The financial sector has grown relative to the real economy and become more fragile. Non-financial businesses have adopted shareholder value orientation, which had negative effects on investment. Working class households became squeezed because of rising inequality and have become more indebted, in particular in countries with real estate bubbles. Financial globalization has given rise to growing international imbalances, which have allowed two growth models to emerge: a debt-led consumption growth model and an export-led growth model. Both should be understood as reactions to the lack of effective demand due to the polarization of income distribution. The resulting finance-dominated accumulation regime is characterized by slow and fragile growth.

In the model, financial intermediaries (FIs) enter into chained credit contracts at home and abroad, engaging in cross-border lending to entrepreneurs by undertaking cross-border borrowing from investors. The FIs as well as the entrepreneurs in two countries are credit constrained, so all of their net worths matter. Our model reveals that under FIs' globalization, adverse shocks that hit one country affect the other, yielding business cycle synchronization on both the real and financial sides. It also suggests that the FIs' globalization, net worth shock, and credit constraints are key to understanding the recent financial crisis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Panel unit root testing is more prevalent due to at least increased size of the sample and relatively more power of the tests. Within the panel, since some rates could be stationary and some nonstationary, Sequential Panel Selection Method (SPSM) should be used to distinguish the series. Furthermore, since some series could suffer from unknown structural break, the SPSM should be supplemented with Fourier function.

Supply side constraints on the program resulted in some beneficiaries receiving complementary training with the cow transfer, and other households not receiving such training with their cow. We exploit these differences to estimate the additional impact of receiving complementary training with the cow transfer, on household's economic outcomes up to six years after having received the livestock asset transfer. Our results show that even in a Setting such as rural Rwanda where linkages between farmers and produce markets are weak, the provision of training with asset transfers has permanent and economically significant impacts on milk production, milk yields from livestock, household earnings, and asset accumulation. The results have important implications for the design of 'ultra-poor' livestock asset transfer programs being trialled globally as a means to allow the rural poor to better their economic lives.

In our theoretical analysis we model CSR adoption as the optimal response of a profit maximizing firm to the competition of a not for profit corporate pioneer in the presence of a continuum of consumers with heterogeneous preferences towards the social and environmental features of the final good. CSR adoption implies a trade-off since, on the one side, it raises production costs but, on the other side, it leads to accumulation of ethical capital. We investigate conditions under which the profit maximizing firm switches from price to price and CSR competition by comparing monopoly and duopoly equilibria and their consequences on aggregate social responsibility and consumer welfare.

The heterogeneity is introduced via weights which the individuals attribute in their utility function to consumption of different goods depending on the vintage of the good. The goods are produced by monopolistically competitive firms and the variety of available goods/technologies is determined endogenously through R&D investments. A competitive bank sector provides financial resources for investments, secured by agents' savings and future firms profits. The general equilibrium is characterized by a system of functional equations and is analytically or numerically determined for several particular weight functions. It is shown that the investments by agents alone may be insufficient to sustain growth, while additional investments provided by the bank sector may lead to growth. The resulting imbalance between agents' assets and the total value of firms can grow unboundedly in the case of homogeneous consumption. The results exhibit the qualitative difference between the dynamics of the model with heterogeneous versus homogeneous consumption. In particular heterogeneous consumption (when old goods are discounted) reduces the additional investments by the financial sector so that the values of firms become balanced by the assets of agents in the long run.","[Belyakov, Anton O.; Haunschmied, Josef L.; Veliov, Vladimir M.] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Math Methods Econ, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Belyakov, AO (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Math Methods Econ, Argentinierstr 8-E105-4, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",anton.belyakov@tuwien.ac.at; josef.haunschmied@tuwien.ac.at; veliov@tuwien.ac.at,"Belyakov, Anton O./G-9463-2011","Belyakov, Anton O./0000-0002-3350-6433; Veliov, Vladimir/0000-0001-6737-1250",,,,,21,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

Since this forecast-augmented VAR (FOAVAR) uses both forecasted and realised variables, and the standard VAR uses only realised variables, the standard VAR is nested in the FOAVAR. I find that the Fed responds to forecasted macroeconomic variables more significantly than realised variables. I also find that the monetary policy shock in the FOAVAR generates impulse responses of variables that are consistent with the predictions of economic theories, while the policy shock in the standard VAR causes a price puzzle: an increase in the price level due to a contractionary policy shock. These results suggest that a monetary policy function identified in a standard VAR, by using only realised macroeconomic variables, may incorrectly represent the Fed's policy function.","[Bhuiyan, Rokon] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Bhuiyan, R (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",mobhuiyan@fullerton.edu,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

The efficiency of each worker is positively related to both the wage and the unemployment rate in the economy. The unionized wage is greater than the efficiency wage and the firm finds it profitable to keep the unionized wage as close as possible to the efficiency wage. The union leader who is entrusted with the task of determining the unionized wage charges a bribe from the firm to keep the wage close to this level. The corrupt trade union leader and the management of the firm play a two-stage Nash bargaining game from where the equilibrium unionized wage and the bribe are determined. The analysis leads to some interesting results which are important for anticorruption policy formulation.,"[Chaudhuri, Sarbajit] Univ Calcutta, Kolkata 700073, W Bengal, India; [Dastidar, Krishnendu Ghosh] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi 110067, India","University of Calcutta; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Dastidar, KG (通讯作者)，Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Econ Studies & Planning, New Delhi 110067, India.",krishnendu.dastidar@gmail.com,"Dastidar, Krishnendu Ghosh/AAU-8534-2021; CHAUDHURI, Sarbajit/AAE-6343-2019","Chaudhuri, Sarbajit/0000-0003-1471-0460",,,,,22,6,6,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We find evidence that corruption has a sizeable nonlinear role in the FDI-growth relation, weakening the effectiveness of FDI at improving growth rates in many developing countries.

Emphasizing the concept of sentiment in contrast to the expectations of a single selected variable, it is meant to take an important step forward towards a canonical heterodox framework for the microfounded modelling of irreducible uncertainty and, specifically, herding. Referring to a large population of agents who repeatedly face a binary decision problem, two stylized approaches are considered to describe the aggregate sentiment dynamics: the transition probability and the discrete choice approach. After a slight modification of the latter, the two specifications are shown to give rise to essentially the same adjustment equations. In addition to these conceptual issues, a two-dimensional prototype model is put forward which can illustrate the rich potential of an inherent nonlinearity to generate scenarios with single and multiple (point and set) attractors.

So, can there be too much privatization? We show that this depends on the political objectives that are pursued with a privatization policy. We study two types of government: a budget-oriented one which aims at generating revenues and which shows some similarities to the governments of the GIIPS countries (Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain); and a citizen-oriented one which aims at maximizing the income of its citizens and which bears some resemblance to the East European transition countries. In accordance with the empirical literature, the budget-oriented type shows a larger propensity to privatize than the citizen-oriented type. But for both types of government, we identify instances where they privatize too much relative to the social optimum. It follows that privatization programs must be designed with the necessary caution.","[Fuchs, Kira] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany; [Uebelmesser, Silke] Univ Jena, Dept Econ, D-07743 Jena, Germany",University of Munich; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Fuchs, K (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany.",kira@drfuchs.de; silke.uebelmesser@uni-jena.de,,"Uebelmesser, Silke/0000-0001-5889-9061",,,,,37,4,5,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

Participants specified in each of at most 60 periods four capital volumes making up the skeletal balance sheet of a financial institution in a computer-simulated environment with rare but potentially payoff-devastating crises. In the main study, we compared decision outcomes from two treatments: in the first, a participant had access to information on business numbers of two other participants, at least one of whom - unknown to the participant - was of the opposite sex (treatment with group information); in the second, no such outside information was available (treatment without group information). Our main finding is that, without group information, men adopted significantly more risk-exposed financial positions than women, whereas this pattern did not obtain beyond the first few periods when group information was available. A further study produced evidence that this effect of the availability of group information upon risk exposure is moderated by the gender composition of the groups. We also confirm the well-established tendency of social information to diminish cross-sectional variability in decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An aim of this reform is for a greener development mode, but relevant empirical evidence is slim. In this study, we propose an innovative methodology to shed light on the environmental externalities of economic rebalancing. First, we use air visibility across China to reflect air quality during 1984-2006. Second, with the daily visibility data, we propose a weekend-effect regression model to difference out city-specific unobserved heterogeneity. Third, we approximate local consumption intensity with the portion of the residential electricity usage in the total electricity usage. To our surprise, the estimates suggest that the pollution intensity of consumption activities has not only been significant, but also exceeded that of production since the mid-1990s. Hence, rebalancing toward consumption is not necessarily more environmentally friendly according to the recent development experience of China.

Fixed effects and no-effects models are employed for estimation of the parameters of the simultaneous equations and their elasticities. The results suggest that the demand is highly income inelastic. However, private insurance and Medicaid raise the rate of utilization. The adverse effect of uninsured is also evident, though it is not as high as private insurance. Evidence also supports the demand inducement hypothesis and points to the rising demand for health care as the U.S. population is aging. The supply function parameters generally demonstrate their expected pattern. It is notable that the malpractice liability premiums exhibit a negligible effect on the supply of office visits.

The firms differ in their costs of realizing the project at a given quality, and these costs are private information. The contracting official, in exchange for a bribe, abuses the power of his or her public office by distorting the quality ranking of the bids and by giving the favoured firm an opportunity to readjust its bid to undercut its rivals. Our analysis suggests that when the firms serve only the internal market, the public project is realized at low quality and inflated prices.

We specifically focus on the effects of the employee's downward wage flexibility (i.e., the willingness to accept a lower wage) and contract flexibility (i.e., preference for a contract which allows flexible hours or employment). The results show that employers are strongly affected by employees who offer to work for a significantly lower wage, but not by the employees' preference for a particular labor contract. Employers are overall quite disinclined to rehire employees after mandatory retirement, although large differences exist between employees. Part of these differences can be explained by employers having higher retirement age norms (i.e., the maximum age at which employers consider employees suited for work in their organization).","[Mulders, Jaap Oude; van Dalen, Hendrik P.; Henkens, Kene] Univ Groningen, Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst NIDI KNA, NL-2502 AR The Hague, Netherlands; [Mulders, Jaap Oude; Schippers, Joop] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Dalen, Hendrik P.] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management TISEM, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Dalen, Hendrik P.] Tilburg Univ, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Henkens, Kene] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Henkens, Kene] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI-KNAW); Utrecht University; Tilburg University; Tilburg University; University of Amsterdam; University of Groningen,"Mulders, JO (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst NIDI KNA, POB 11650, NL-2502 AR The Hague, Netherlands.",oudemulders@nidi.nl,"van Dalen, Hendrik P./A-1736-2008; van Dalen, Harry/AAR-5621-2020; Mulders, Jaap Oude/J-5488-2019","van Dalen, Hendrik P./0000-0002-1628-9764; Mulders, Jaap Oude/0000-0002-7583-1023; Henkens, Kene/0000-0002-3416-5191",,,,,41,28,31,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2014,162.0,4,,,,,415,431,,10.1007/s10645-014-9234-8,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS3IE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344170000006,0
