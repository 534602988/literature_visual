J,"Meissner, D",,,,"Meissner, Dirk",,,Results and impact of national Foresight-studies,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TECHNOLOGY POLICY; SCIENCE; FUTURE,"Conducting national Foresight studies has become common in many countries. However the impact of such studies on the performance of the national innovation system remains unclear. The paper therefore assesses the impact of national Foresight studies conducted in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Research Area (ERA). The study provides a first indication of the impact of national Foresight studies on the performance of national innovation systems. However the findings so far are preliminary since input data reflect long term developments of national innovation systems. Thus a long term study of the impacts of national Foresight studies is essential. In the short term, it can be concluded that national Foresight studies contribute significantly to the design and in some countries reshape of the innovation system structure and framework conditions. A direct quantitative measurement of the impact and thus the value of Foresight studies cannot yet be done in a statistically reliable fashion. However the changes these studies have caused within the national innovation systems may have an indirect impact on the future national innovation performance. Most recently national Foresight studies have switched from a rather exclusive focus on technology trend assessments towards more integrated holistic approaches identifying future challenges for society and economy as a whole thus deriving strengths and weaknesses of the national scientific, research and technology base to meet these challenges long term in the most appropriate way.

The effect of institutional quality is generally difficult to separate from that of student ability because more capable students usually sort into better colleges. A detailed analysis of student sorting reveals this not to be the case among community college students, for whom college quality is effectively determined by factors other than their aptitude. This facilitates identification of school quality effects. I find that community college quality (as measured by instructional expenditure per student and several other measures) has no impact on community college students' educational attainment. States and colleges should seek to identify other factors that may be more influential.","Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Stange, K (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",kstange@umich.edu,,,,,,,32,20,31,0,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Like the term 'contingent work', precarious employment has been adopted and increasingly used by academic researchers and later policy-makers since the 1980s. However, the term has deeper historical roots and its recent use can be more accurately seen as a revival as labour markets have taken on some features characteristic of an earlier period. This article examines the use of the term 'precarious employment' in political and public debate in the century or more prior to the 1930s, finding that in key respects, this use mirrors contemporary debates. Recognising that precarious employment was a pervasive feature of labour markets in developed countries prior to World War Two has a number of major benefits for contemporary debates. These include a better understanding of the policies that shape the extent of precarious employment. Historical evidence also provides a guide for and reinforcement of a growing body of contemporary research, pointing to both the immediate and broader social effects of precarious employment.","[Quinlan, Michael] Univ New S Wales, Sch Management, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Quinlan, Michael] Univ New S Wales, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Quinlan, M (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",m.quinlan@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,57,85,99,0,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

As Kalecki foresaw, the success of Keynesian demand management was undermined when, in an era of full employment, the power of labour threatened industrialists' authority over the economy. From the 1970s, this led governments to introduce pro-capitalist measures. Countering recessions with budget deficits was now seen as irresponsible. The rise of globalisation meant that domestic demand management became less effective, especially in economies highly dependent on imports. Opening up economies meant that their exchange rates and stock markets became more vulnerable to capital flights. As the reach of finance became increasingly global, those private credit rating agencies became the game changers. Today private credit agencies, through their rating of the investment climate and sovereign risk of a country, in effect rate the quality of its government. Capitalist democracies are now dominated by private finance. Management of the investment climate is increasingly done through the virtual rather than the real economy creating artificial financial asset and housing market bubbles. At the same time, in the neglected real economy, inequality and unemployment have increased, and living standards are falling.","[Bhaduri, Amit] Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Bhaduri, Amit] Council Social Dev, Delhi, India",University of Pavia,"Bhaduri, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",,,,,,,,6,5,6,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

J,"Bonaiuti, M",,,,"Bonaiuti, Mauro",,,Growth and democracy: Trade-offs and paradoxes,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The present paper attempts to reveal the relationships between some long-run systemic processes (on the economic, ecological, social and symbolic levels) and the theme of democracy. Starting from the distinction between democracy and autonomy, the paper focusses on its main issue: the trade-off between growth and autonomy. Continual growth can be produced, and indeed has been produced throughout history, only if accompanied by a loss of autonomy, even, beyond a certain scale threshold, to the detriment of representative democracy. While this conflict has never been rejected by political theorists, it has, in actual fact, been removed from all political debate. The second part of the paper seeks to individuate some of the long-run basic dynamics that characterise the global system: the analysis starts from the growth/accumulation/innovation process which characterized industrial capitalism, first, and financial capitalism, later, pointing out its self-pursuing, multi-scale, emergent nature with its main consequences for both ecological and social sustainability. The outcome of these processes, such as the loss of well-being, the increasing social and ecological costs and the growing fragmentation of the collective imaginary, in the long run leads the global system towards a condition of non equilibrium, from which either scenarios of greater autonomy or fatal risks for democracy itself, may emerge.

This is a sign of an inconsistent and fragmented landscape of international legal order with different IOs playing differently defined roles, even within the narrow field of WTO dispute settlement. While many remedies have been offered to cure the problem, this article examines institutional fragmentation by using the example of interaction between the WTO and WCO. While the cooperation between the WTO and WCO has been quite prolific, the central question addressed in this article is to what extent this cooperation model can serve as reference for the WTO judiciary in shaping its interactions with other IOs and what would be the factors for such assessment.","WTI, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Foltea, M (通讯作者)，WTI, Bern, Switzerland.",marina.foltea@wti.org,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

An out-of-sample forecasting competition between the two grey prediction models and exponential smoothing used by NCES was conducted for education expenditure and school enrollment under the assumption that grey prediction was as promising as NCES's forecasting technique in dealing with univariate time-series data while some other determinants of the variables under examination were excluded. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to verify that the GM(1,1), and GM(1,1) rolling models would provide forecasts that were at least as accurate as the NCES's approach to extrapolating education expenditure and school enrollment. The findings revealed that the forecasting efficiency of GM(1,1) rolling model was superior to exponential smoothing and GM(1,1) model.

While a sizeable literature has flourished around the notion of international pollution havens (the movement of goods production with polluting by-products to low environmental regulation countries), this paper is the first to explicitly test the hypothesis that differences in environmental regulation across countries can create international waste haven effects (the exporting of physical waste by-products, rather than goods production, to low environmental regulation countries). Using bilateral waste trade data and an index of environmental stringency for 92 countries, compelling evidence is found that waste imports increase for a country whose environmental regulations deteriorate vis-a-vis it's trading partner, implying that differences in environmental standards play an important role in international waste trade flows for some country pairs.

The study suggests that the composition of external finance differs considerably across firm types based on size and export performance under tight and loose financial conditions. Small and medium-size manufacturing firms and firms with a low export share are less likely to have access to bank finance, especially in tight periods. In addition, financially constrained firms with limited access to bank finance (small, low-export-share firms) tend to substitute trade credits for bank loans more aggressively in tight periods as monetary policy tightens. The large volume of trade credit on firms' balance sheets and its positive response to contractionary monetary shocks imply that the trade credit channel might subdue the traditional credit channel of monetary transmission.","[Ozlu, Pinar; Yalcin, Cihan] Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey",Prime Ministry Turkey; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Özlü, P (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey.",pinar.ozbay@tcmb.gov.tr; cihan.yalcin@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,40,14,15,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

It symbolizes national self-confidence and self-conception. As a results commercial aviation remains a preferred target for attacks by terrorists and other offenders. Security measures intended to render these threats harmless have mostly been introduced in response to specific occurrences, thus allowing the potential attackers to always remain one step ahead. As this approach seems inappropriate for dealing with future security threats, this paper provides a proactive approach to identification of future threats and their coverage by airport security processes and technologies. To meet the requirements of a highly complex and at the same time critical system, such as airport security, a standard scenario process has been enhanced by matrix-based methods of complexity management.

Central to arguments for market reforms is the idea that competition and choice will spur changes in schools to be more innovative, which in turn will lead to better student outcomes. We define innovation in terms of a practice's relative prevalence in a local district context. A charter school is innovative in its use of a practice if the traditional public schools in its local school district are not using that practice. We explore factors based on arguments for charter schools that may affect a charter schools' propensity toward innovation to explain variation in levels of innovation across charter schools. We find that, on the whole, charter schools do not fulfill their promise of innovation. Teacher tenure is the most notable exception. Parental involvement is the only characteristic of charter schools that significantly predicts variation in levels of organizational innovativeness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent experience evaluating a randomized need-based financial aid intervention highlights some of our arguments and guides our outline of the circumstances under which the examination of mechanisms and heterogeneous impacts is particularly important. Comprehensive experiments can enhance research productivity by increasing the number of theories both tested and generated and can advance policy and practice by exploring the conditions under which interventions will be most successful in scale up. Paradoxically, while the emphasis on average treatment effects is typically associated with efficiency-minded economists, we argue that the approach is often inefficient from the standpoints of science and policy.","[Harris, Douglas N.; Goldrick-Rab, Sara] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Harris, DN (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dnharris3@wisc.edu; srab@education.wisc.edu,,"Goldrick-Rab, Sara/0000-0002-9352-2099",,,,,86,8,14,0,19,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The interests and actions of stakeholders are described based on political theory and are illustrated using examples from 25 years of research in forest policy and consulting. The value of the knowledge produced by a model of analytical research is dependent upon its salience, credibility and legitimacy. Due to the political process of knowledge transfer, strong stakeholders can achieve a high level of salience for their interests and thus misuse analytical arguments for ideological legitimacy. To address this problem, the proper use of analytical knowledge can be supported by four strategies. First, internal allies can use analytical science to persuade other stakeholders to accept specific results. Such behavior produces scientific, rational actions, even if consensus is absent and the results are biased. Second, external allies can force other stakeholders to make use of analytical science to demonstrate that they have carefully considered scientific findings, whatever they may be. Third, political learning means that the unpredictable results of analytical science can be surprising, even to powerful stakeholders, thereby inciting learning effects. Fourth, political integration is useful for identifying the limits of analytical knowledge and adding to other sources of knowledge. These four strategies prove that even if stakeholders always dominate knowledge transfer, strictly separating analytical research from the valuations and/or direct interventions of stakeholders may bring some analytical rationality to the practical use of knowledge. These options encourage the promotion of an analytical-scientific model, even if it is often ideologically misused by powerful stakeholders. Moreover, properly used analytical research can speak truth not to power but within power processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Data about community forestry in Cameroon was collected in 10 selected communities in 2009/10. Today in practice community forestry favors techno-scientific knowledge about the forest, separate nature from human life, is a bureaucratic controlled engagement with nature and is aimed to make nature and people productive. The benchmark identifies a strong Colonial heritage within community forestry in Cameroon and questions whether the aim of including the local people in forest management, correcting their previous exclusion by the Colonial policy in the management of their forest resources, thus, the self determined life of people within the forest can be reached.

Taking an institutional approach, this article discusses the development of the RC initiative and the more recent negotiation of a Responsible Care Global Charter, which seeks to streamline standards and implementation models around the globe. My argument shows how different national associations defend their interests in exporting certain regulatory models to the global level and in making commitments more or less binding.

Using data from Spain's 2007 Economically Active Population Survey (Encuesta de Poblacion Activa), the results suggest that immigrant women in Spain suffered a double burden from occupational segregation since it affected them to a greater degree than either native women or immigrant men. In fact, gender is a useful variable for understanding the labor market performance of immigrant workers for this period in Spain, although there were notable discrepancies in the segregation of immigrant women depending on their region of origin. Immigrant women from the European Union (EU) had the lowest occupational segregation, while such segregation appeared to be particularly intense among women from European countries outside the EU and women from Asia.","[del Rio, Coral; Alonso-Villar, Olga] Univ Vigo, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac CC Econ, Vigo 36310, Pontevedra, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"del Río, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac CC Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Pontevedra, Spain.",crio@uvigo.es; ovillar@uvigo.es,"del Rio, Coral/M-5560-2019; Alonso-Villar, Olga/K-4348-2014","del Rio, Coral/0000-0002-3173-3624; Alonso-Villar, Olga/0000-0002-7355-0279",,,,,57,22,24,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The key to understand the different behavior of these forms is in its molecular mechanisms. Current literature highlights the role of zinc(II) ions in the development and pathogenesis of this cancer. Our objective was to identify diverse metabolical pathways of these forms of cancer and determine prognostic markers of high-grade form of prostate cancer. We determined genes alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), caveolin-1 (Cav-1), metallothionein (MT), p53, NF-kappa B, c-FOS, c-JUN, Ki-67, ZIP1 and ZnT-1 on RNA and protein level in the sera of 133 men (82 tumorous and 51 healthy) and in cell lines derived from aggressive form of cancer. The level of these genes was determined and compared to prostatic specific antigen, widely used prostate cancer biomarker. We identified significantly (p < 0.05) decreased (> 4-fold) RNA level of Cav-1, NF-kappa B, c-FOS a c-JUN and significantly elevated (> 2-fold) RNA level of MT, AMACR, PSA, Ki-67, MMP-9 and ZIP1 and ZnT-1 (> 25-fold) in tumorous cell line 22Rv1 in comparison to healthy cell line PNT1A. On the protein level, we identified significant (> 20-fold) decrease of MT in cell lines. In contrary, serum MT level was significantly 4-fold increased. Furthermore, we identified insignificant changes in serum Cav-1 and AMACR. However, Cav-1 level was significantly increased in high stage TNM T4 patients and positively correlated with grading (r = 0.29 at p = 0.028). Thus, we may consider the combination of Cav-1 and MT as a high risk prostate cancer biomarker.","[Gumulec, J.; Sztalmachova, M.; Raudenska, M.; Masarik, M.] Masaryk Univ, Dept Pathol Physiol, Fac Med, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Gumulec, J.; Kizek, R.] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Tech 3058 10, Brno 61600, Czech Republic; [Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Brno University of Technology; Mendel University in Brno,"Gumulec, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Pathol Physiol, Fac Med, Kamenice 5, Brno 62500, Czech Republic.",j.gumulec@gmail.com,"Gumulec, Jaromir/D-7638-2012; Svobodová, Markéta/F-4144-2012; Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Masarik, Michal/D-9920-2012; Raudenska, Martina/F-9187-2012","Gumulec, Jaromir/0000-0002-9658-3444; Masarik, Michal/0000-0003-1172-7195; Raudenska, Martina/0000-0001-8258-6671",,,,,15,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,934,941,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200107,0

Family forest owners constitute a significant portion of the overall forestland in the U.S., yet little is known about family forest owners' preferences for supplying wood-based biomass. The goal of this study is to understand how Massachusetts family forest owners feel about harvesting residual woody biomass from their property. The study estimates the probability that Massachusetts landowners will harvest biomass as part of a timber harvest using data from a survey of 932 Massachusetts family forest owners. Logistic regression results suggest that the likelihood of harvesting for biomass is quite low, and that the supply of participation in biomass harvesting is inelastic with respect to price. These low probabilities may be due to the method used to account for preference uncertainty, as well as the unique nature of Massachusetts forests, forest markets, and landowner attitudes in comparison to other states (e.g., Minnesota). The study suggests that it would be more effective to target renewable energy policy toward different regions and/or markets rather than develop a uniform national policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There are also mechanisms for participation in the formation of the Fund's large transnational companies (TNCs), transnational banks (TNB). The whole system of formation, distribution and use of the Financial stability fund of the world economy must be extremely transparent. IMF is necessary annually to report before the UNO and the heads of all the countries of the world (about 200 countries) about forming and use of facilities of this Fund.

The survey was administered in the University of Economic Studies in Bucharest, Romania. A combination of exploratory research techniques and a survey methodology was used for studying the academic behavior of students when facing the potential implementation of mobile devices in their learning process. A set of procedures were used for gathering and analyzing more than 300 observations from a heterogeneous population. The results show that from a technological perspective mobile learning is feasible, however, a lack awareness and understanding about this new way of learning still hinders the effective implementation of mobile learning. Furthermore, the results reveal several issues that need to be resolved in order to achieve the effective integration of mobile technologies and for implementing a mobile learning system.

In the affair research study, three time windows are chosen: a. from 11 days before publishing accounting change to 10 days after publishing day; b. from 11 days before publishing accounting change to 1 day before publishing day; c. from publishing day to 10 days afterwards. Then the article analyses the accumulative abnormal yield rate variation in order to test whether investors know and take it into full consideration that accounting change will influence the present income. It turns out to be that due to the disclosure of VAPC and its influence on the present income, investors will sufficiently realize the essence of VAPC and negative impact of income-increasing VAPC on the surplus quality and consider the short-run effect on corporate value carefully when making decision. In the purchase and holding study, we vertically tests the annual stock yields after VAPC to judge its influence on the long-term value of company. The result proves that market is not sensitive to both the income-increasing VAPC and income-decreasing VAPC. A model is then used to test the relationship between return of investment and income in the same year of VAPC. Controlling samples in this model are those companies of the same size and in the same industry. Cross-section regression analysis is done on the influence of VAPC over the estimated value in the same year to find out its impact on information quality, which eventually proves that the yield from the income-increasing VAPC is worse than that from the reverse one.","[Zhou, Yiqiang] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Accountancy, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China",Chongqing Technology & Business University,,zyqiang2005@sina.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-61896-012-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,1279,1282,,,,,,4,Economics; Management; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BBY61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308816301133,0

The study focuses on the carpet-weaving and textile industries and civil society organizations in Turkey, investigating the ways in which charitable giving, pious practice, and local labor conditions create uniquely complex ways in which socioeconomic policies, processes, and commitments affect gendered lives. What is witnessed in weaving neighborhoods, civil society organizations, and the transnational linkages of production-consumption is neither a wholesale translation of Weberian capitalism nor a strict implementation of Islamic texts and practices. It is a unique Turkish assemblage of faith, religious practice, charitable giving, and flexibility of labor.

Detecting the causes of juvenile crime is an important educational policy concern as many of these crimes happen during the school day. In the 2009-10 school year, the State of Hawaii responded to fiscal strains by furloughing all school teachers employed by the Department of Education and canceling classes for seventeen instructional days. We examine the effects of these non-holiday school closure days to draw conclusions about the relationship between time in school and juvenile arrests in the State of Hawaii on the island of Oahu. We calculate marginal effects from a negative binomial model and find that time off from school is associated with significantly fewer juvenile assault and drug-related arrests, although there are no changes in other types of crimes, such as burglaries. The declines in arrests for assaults are the most pronounced in poorer regions of the island while the decline in drug-related arrests is larger in the relatively more prosperous regions.

As an alternative to clearing the forest, a landowner has the option to sell it to an international carbon crediting program. The model is used to investigate corrective incentive programs needed to ensure a socially optimal level of forest resources. Optimal conditions for a land income tax and carbon compensation rate are derived. The paper shows that the optimality of national carbon compensation policies crucially depends on the land income taxation. In the presence of an optimal land income tax-subsidy program, the government may need to pass on to the landowners the very carbon compensation that it receives from the international community to ensure a socially optimal tropical forest stock. However, the government may need to over-transfer or under-transfer the carbon compensation depending on whether the pre-existing land income tax is below or above the optimal level, respectively. This suggests that the pre-existing sub-optimality in land income taxation in a given country can be corrected by adjusting the carbon compensation. Therefore, a carbon compensation scheme should take into account existing national policies that affect forest clearing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Gao, H",,,,"Gao, Henry",,,Public-Private Partnership: The Chinese Dilemma,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"As noted by Greg Shaffer in his book 'Defending Interests: Public-Private Partnerships in WTO Litigation', the US and EU have different approaches to public-private partnership in dealing with foreign trade barriers: the former tends to be more 'bottom-up', while the latter tends to be 'top-down'. Inspired by Shaffer's work, this article examines China's experience in establishing public-private partnership. Initially, China appeared to prefer the American approach by adopting the Rules on Trade Barrier Investigation (TBI), which empowers domestic firms to petition the government directly to launch investigation against foreign trade barriers. However, since 2005, China seems to have shifted to the European approach by adopting a 'Quadrilateral Coordination' system, which pools together the resources of the Ministry of Commerce, local government, and relevant industry associations to help affected individual firms to fight foreign trade barriers. The article analyses the pros and cons of the two systems, the political and social reasons for the shift, and how the new system has worked in practice with case studies. The article concludes with thoughts on the lessons we can draw on the relationship between the government and private firms in China, as well as how the public-private partnership will develop in China in the future.","[Gao, Henry] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Law, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Gao, Henry] Shanghai Inst Foreign Trade, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Singapore Management University; Shanghai University of International Business & Economics,"Gao, H (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Law, Singapore 178902, Singapore.",gaohenry@gmail.com,"GAO, Henry Shuchao/E-6661-2013","Gao, Henry/0000-0002-7020-3853",,,,,37,8,8,2,24,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We designed a new practice of mediating food over social networks, which reflected related phenomena of underground restaurants, crowdsourcing of food information and persuasive apps supporting various dieting practices etc. With this prototype we supported ad hoc interactions over impromptu dinners based on sharing data on food leftovers, which enabled commensality between strangers. The project was part of a series of workshops between several universities and local hackerspaces in Singapore, Prague and Amsterdam in 2010-2011. We involved university students, but also local foodies and hackerspace members and asked them to reflect upon existing food online networks and then collectively create a prototype for a novel form of commensality. While as an educational probe, FridgeMatch examines the possibilities of interdisciplinary (design and STS) case study approach to teaching, as a prototype it supported interaction between strangers over food leftovers in their refrigerators.

This descriptive analysis is a thought experiment in which we show the consequences for school performance if girls and boys had similar resources and took similar advantage of these resources. Our findings indicate that gender differences in resources with respect to social and instrumental skills and need for achievement can explain part of the differences in performance.

Strongly coordinated capitalism communicates insider information but suppresses public information, and vice versa for weakly coordinated economies. Selectively targeted insider information credibly signals intention for long-term cooperation, while indiscriminately revealed public information credibly reveals intention for opportunism. Since the same hidden knowledge cannot be revealed both indiscriminately and selectively, coordinated capitalism forces the two types of information to crowd each other out. Using the external financing of R&D as an example, I test this theory in informational environments typical for different types of capitalism (mature technologies for some and cutting-edge for others). When investors rely on public information (Initial Public Offerings), strongly coordinated capitalism exhibits severe symptoms of poor information; when investors rely on insider information (venture capital and banking), symptoms of poor information shift to weakly coordinated economies.","Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Huo, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",jjhuo@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,58,3,3,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The potential for comprehensive measures of patient morbidity to explain variation in negotiated FFS expenditures has not previously been examined. To examine the relative explanatory power of morbidity measures and related general practice (GP) clinic characteristics in explaining variation in politically negotiated FFS expenditures. We applied a multilevel approach to consider factors that explain FFS expenditures among patients and GP clinics. We used patient morbidity characteristics such as diagnostic markers, multimorbidity casemix adjustment based on resource utilisation bands (RUB) and related GP clinic characteristics for the year 2010. Our sample included 139,527 patients visiting GP clinics. Out of the individual expenditures, 31.6 % were explained by age, gender and RUB, and around 18 % were explained by RUB. Expenditures increased progressively with the degree of resource use (RUB0-RUB5). Adding more patient-specific morbidity measures increased the explanatory power to 44 %; 3.8-9.4 % of the variation in expenditures was related to the GP clinic in which the patient was treated. Morbidity measures were significant patient-related FFS expenditure drivers. The association between FFS expenditure and morbidity burden appears to be at the same level as similar studies in the hospital sector, where fees are based on average costing. However, our results indicate that there may be room for improvement of the association between politically negotiated FFS expenditures and morbidity in primary care.","[Kristensen, Troels; Olsen, Kim Rose] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, Fac Hlth Sci, COHERE Ctr Hlth Econ Res, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Kristensen, Troels; Olsen, Kim Rose; Thomsen, Janus Laust; Halling, Anders] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, Fac Hlth Sci, Res Unit Gen Practice, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Schroll, Henrik; Thomsen, Janus Laust] DAK E Danish Qual Unit Gen Practice, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark,"Kristensen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, Fac Hlth Sci, COHERE Ctr Hlth Econ Res, Windslowpk 9A,JB Winslows Vej 9, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark.",trkristensen@health.sdu.dk,"Olsen, Kim Rose/ABA-9678-2021; Thomsen, Janus Nikolaj Laust/AAJ-5125-2020; Olsen, Kim Rose/AAU-5526-2020","Olsen, Kim Rose/0000-0002-0473-4736; Thomsen, Janus Nikolaj Laust/0000-0002-0745-6815; Kristensen, Troels/0000-0001-5232-6895",,,,,46,4,5,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This paper is a review article that analyzes the importance of both vertical integration and governance of economic activity for communities aiming to benefit from commercial forestry. Transaction cost economic theory serves as a basis for the analysis. Organizational forms, also known as governance structures, set order and provide for mutual gain in commercial exchanges between parties. One of the most important tasks of economic governance is to reduce transaction costs stemming from opportunistic behavior from one or both of the transacting parties. Governance structures exist in a continuum with the market and the firm at opposite ends of the spectrum. A 'firm-type' organization is only one possibility in a continuum of enterprise governance structures.

Instead of measuring gender inequality in outcomes, the SIGI and its subindices measure long-lasting social institutions defined as societal practices and legal norms that frame gender roles. The SIGI combines them into a multidimensional index of women's deprivation caused by gendered social institutions. Inspired by the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke poverty measures, the SIGI offers a new way of aggregating gender inequality by penalizing high inequality in each dimension and allowing only partial compensation between subindices. The indices identify countries and dimensions of gendered social institutions that deserve attention.

School councils are expected to work collaboratively and decide on the best use of the funds. In this paper, we study the effects of one such program in Mexico on student outcomes. We complement the differences-in-differences analysis by qualitatively exploring program implementation. Results suggest the program had substantial positive effects on third grade Spanish test scores, with most benefits accruing to schools receiving SBM cash grants for the first time. These results are robust to alternative model specifications. The implementation analysis suggests school councils did monitor grant use, but parental participation did not significantly improve in other areas. Our findings suggest that the observed positive program effects are likely to be the result of providing schools with financial resources to meet pressing equipment, material, and infrastructure needs.

Five individual travel cost models were estimated, one for each of 5 national forests (i.e., Allegheny, Coconino, Mount Baker-Snoqualmie, Ouachita, and Wenatchee). Travel cost had a consistently negative effect on the number of visits (and thus caused losses in aggregate consumer surplus) across all recreational activities and national forests, although the magnitudes of the effects varied significantly. For example, decreased visit numbers (and thus the aggregate loss of consumer surplus) resulting from hypothetical increases in travel costs are greater for non-trail and backpacking-activity participants than for trail and backpacking-activity participants in the Allegheny national forest. This finding implies that increases in funds allocated towards improving non-trail and backpacking-based recreational activities may stem the loss of consumer surplus due to the decline in visits to the Allegheny national forest caused by the increase in travel cost more than similar increases in funds allocated to trail and backpacking-activities. These results are important because many national-forest managers are facing declining visits resulting from the effects of higher gasoline prices on travel costs. Thus, they can use our results in making decisions about allocating scarce budget resources to recreational activities that have the greatest potential to stem the decline in national-forest visits.

We apply a new search matching function taking into consideration of the job destruction rate. Workers may not find a job because the job they are searching for no longer exists in the economy. This leads to an above-expected rate of unemployment. Labor market friction requires adjustment in some of the unemployed labor force in order to meet the requirements for new jobs being created. Moreover, this friction affects the real market wage. This theory is tested using Brazilian state panel data for the period 2001-2009. The results are as follows. We found a job matching rate of around 64.5%. This implies that the job destruction rate is around 36.5%. Using this rate to explain real wages, it exhibits a positive reaction to friction. In this case, better job matching improves real wages and increases productivity. So friction in the job market does influence real market wages. Moreover, there is a real wage persistency or inertia of at least two periods. This means that productivity is evolving slowly in the economy of the Brazilian states.","[de Oliveira, Luma] Univ Estadual Maringa, Econ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Dias, Joilson; Ambrosio Dias, Maria Helena] Univ Estadual Maringa, Grad Program Econ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Dias, Joilson; Ambrosio Dias, Maria Helena] Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",Universidade Estadual de Maringa; Universidade Estadual de Maringa; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"de Oliveira, L (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Econ, BR-90046900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",luma_de_oliveira@hotmail.com; jdias@uem.br; mhadias@uem.br,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,DENFAR TRANSNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,ONTARIO,"58 RIDEAU HEIGHTS DR, ONTARIO, OTTAWA NEPEAN K2E 7A6, CANADA",,,978-0-9868210-5-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,196,211,,,,,,16,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353691000013,0

For this purpose, the managers are always in search of tools or methods to assist in improving productivity. However, in order to improve the productivity, we have to take into account a number of key issues. Besides that it is essential to calculate the businesses productivity through various methods and it is necessary to take into account the qualitative factors affecting the productivity level, factors that can not be included in any calculation method. Many literature studies investigates quantitative or qualitative part of a problem. A research which takes into account both aspects is very difficult and requires a high volume of work and information. This research aims to combine the two issues to encompass a broader range of issues that are related to the enterprise productivity. Thus, using our studies so far, we proposed a way to determine the level of productivity for the qualitative and quantitative factors (PQQF). For this purpose we developed a framework to help improve productive performance in terms of productivity. This framework is a guide of best practices and recommendations for large enterprises managers in mechanical engineering. The proposed framework includes a set of steps leading to the identification of five productivity levels of quantitative and qualitative factors (PQQF), which was reached by the DMUs (Decision Making Units). This level of productivity can be compared to the levels attained by direct market competitors. Improving the productivity of machine building industry enterprises can be done following the reverse path proposed by the developed framework. This reverse path helps identify, step by step, the unproductivity sources that exist within the studied firms.

Each focus group consisted of 8-10 owners and lasted approximately 2 h. Overall, only two beneficial federal income tax provisions (treatment of timber income as a long-term capital gain and timber depletion deductions) and five federal estate tax provisions (the effective exemption for estates, the annual exclusion for gifts, use of a will, the step-up in basis for inherited assets, and the effective exemption for gifts) were brought up in over half of the groups. Groups composed of tax program enrollees tended to discuss federal income tax provisions more distinct times than those composed of tax program non-enrollees, and tended to be familiar with more federal estate tax provisions; otherwise, there was little difference between them. Misconceptions about tax provisions were common. As well, groups in every region noted the negative effects of tax uncertainty and that not all professionals are knowledgeable about federal taxes as they apply to family forest owners.

Many valuable ideas are described in this paper and need to be taken into consideration. In the literature and practice of public human resource management circulate many myths about career planning and development and career management.

The paper applies a FIGARCH model (Beine at al., 2002) for measuring the volatility of exchange rates in order to see how the forex market actors react to shocks in the exchange rate. We used daily data of Ron-Euro exchange rate between 2007 and 2012. Our results indicate that the exchange rate is highly fractionally integrated, indicating a fast process of mean reversion. The source of the exchange rate persistence is difficult to be explained and may be accounted for by unobserved factors or by the central bank intervention. If there are structural breaks in data, then the exchange rate could falsely indicate persistence in the data. In order to test for the spurious long-memory, we used a Zivot-Andrews Unit Root Test.

An integrated approach, as a holistic means, should be considered as incorporating both the formal approach and the content-based approach. Moreover, this paper presents the necessary reasons for alternative futures discourses in Korea and proposes several countermeasures to improve Korea's futures practice. To date the Korean society and its futures practices have been dominated by five tendencies: (a) a dominant modernization paradigm, (b) a prevailing unipolar worldview, (c) an uncertainty avoidant culture, (d) poor methodological practice, and (e) Westernization of the Korean futures studies. These current tendencies and their ensuing negative effects have undermined both the continuation of creative futures and the Korean way of seeing the future. Thus, Korea's futures practice has experienced a lack of alternative futures approaches as well as a kind of identity crisis. In order to respond to those problems and create rigorous products of future practice, it is crucial for Korea's futures community to concentrate on the five alternative tendencies: (a) inventing Korean models in a viable utopia, (b) adopting a liberal cosmopolitan worldview, (c) building an uncertainty tolerant culture, (d) overcoming methodological challenges and (e) moving toward indigenous futures studies. In particular, indigenous futures studies can provide the grounds for relevant and enriched futures studies as well as the development of universal futures studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The argument is that politics arises from attempts to establish or eliminate rents. The paper discusses ethnographic research on subjectivity and culture industry work and provides a theoretical account of rent in the capitalist imaginary and in explanations of formal problems of power in the entrepreneurial firm as the basis for the analysis of political practices in culture industries.

Empirical results reveal that systematic policy improvements account for less than 30 percent of the drop in the volatility of growth in aggregate consumption, while policy improvements do not explain investment and rates of net export growth.","[Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, Dept Monetary Finance, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Chaofeng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China,"Li, CF (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangcs@ruc.edu.cn; chaofenglee@ruc.edu.cn,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The cultural proximity between donors and recipient countries is used as an instrument to tackle endogeneity.

Over-crediting is reduced by setting aside mean estimates of uncertain services in favor of a more conservative estimate. Like many environmental policy problems, ecosystem service markets involve the aggregation of uncertainty over multiple scales, e.g. from landowners to market intermediaries to the overall market. We examine how the MOS instrument affects, and is affected by, an ecosystem services market. We show that the common bottom-up approach of imposing risk preferences at a local, disaggregated level held over from earlier development in the context of toxics and command and control-style health risk regulation-leads to several unintended consequences. Furthermore, discounting landowner services can actually increase their profits, conditional on the elasticity of credit demand. We illustrate theoretical insights with an empirical application to greenhouse gas offset crediting in agriculture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We address the question of the importance of the part played by decentralized government in coordinating the economic activities from a planned to a market-directed economy in the aquaculture sector. In this case study, we have interviewed farmers and officials and used secondary official data in Shandong province. We find that coordination by local government has been crucial in developing small-scale household agricultural and aquaculture production in transitional economy, and enabling the market to become the driving force in the development of household pond aquaculture in rural China. The Chinese experience may bring valuable lessons for other developing countries, where hunger are endemic, and the smallholder farmers are the key target in poverty reduction.","[Sun, Helen Lei] QingDao Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Collins, Edward J.

Designing and implementing these actions put to the test the ability of such a group of actors from different scientific disciplines and professions to share and build the knowledge that is needed to do so. The success of conservation projects depends to a large extent on the integration of different kinds of knowledge and their underlying epistemologies. This integration characterizes transdisciplinarity. An increasing amount of studies focuses on the difficulties to develop transdisciplinary approaches due to the sub-division and specialization of research disciplines. Little work deals with the difficulties faced by the researchers that are engaged in a mode of knowledge production associating different scientific disciplines and professions. Among these difficulties, the link between the content of science and the values and believes underlying researchers' and stakeholders' perspectives remains unexplored although it is a critical point in the success of collaboration. A transdisciplinary project on local seed use in an ecological restoration in the Pyrenees is taken as an example to show how not taking into account such link could lead to the failure of a project. Analyzing this failure revealed that the success of a problem-based project is highly dependent on the compatibility of each partner's thought-style, i.e., epistemological background, values and conception of the world. Since the success of a transdisciplinary project depends on the ability of the partners to collaborate, not only technical and methodological issues should be debated as it is always the case, but also the paradigms underlying the collective action. Overcoming thought-style divergences require the partners to enter into a collective learning process. This learning process deserves a specific task dedicated to a reflexive analysis involving all the project's partners. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To meet their caps, firms optimally choose levels of trading and investment in each period by equalizing the marginal benefit of abatement to the marginal cost of abatement in each period. The fact that investments have long-term effects introduces new effects: investments in period 1 have both an additional benefit (the reduction of emissions in period 2) and an additional cost (the decrease in abatement opportunities in period 2). This changes the standard condition of equalization of marginal costs across periods for cost-effectiveness. Without intertemporal trading, some investments in period 1 are entirely driven by second-period abatement needs. In that case, allowing intertemporal trading may reduce investment in period 1 as some long-term investments are substituted by intertemporal permit trading. Descriptive evidence from the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) illustrates this potential effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In practice, however, it is difficult to deal with such an irregular or deviant topic as the long term in public policy and politics. A perspective on how the long term and its inherent uncertainty play a role in politics and public policy-making processes is under-represented. This article examines how policy-making processes and politics deal with the uncertainty of a long-term issue from the perspective of futures studies. The case study under consideration is the ageing population in the Netherlands, which has been on the country's political agenda since the end of the nineties. It is shown that the over-reliance on forecasting studies has impacted how uncertainty about the future is dealt with in both policy-making processes and politics. With these conclusions, this paper integrates the existing, yet fragmented, literature on using futures studies in public policy and politics and adds to the scarce empirical research.

Thus, the visibility of conflicts is an important condition for balanced conflict resolutions. The analysis of public administration forms shows, theoretically and empirically, that different patterns support the visibility of conflicts in specific ways, mainly by offering the potential for the development of independent expertise and its integration into consideration procedures. Combining different organisation forms increases the potential for balanced conflict resolutions. The effect of this potential depends on its utilization by administrative resources. In the case of administrative reform in the German federal state of Lower Saxony, the utilization of this potential was neglected, reducing the visibility of nature conservation concerns. This had far-reaching consequences for the resolution of forest conflicts. Economically-biased resolutions become camouflaged by keeping conservation issues invisible, neglecting them within administrative procedures and within the operations of forest owners whilst making legal and political claims to their consideration, so as to be able to pretend that conflict resolutions are balanced in their approach.

Increased bioenergy production is also seen to have political and economic benefits for rural areas and farthing regions in Europe and in the developing world. There are, however, conflicting views on the potential benefits of large scale bioenergy production, and recent debates have also drawn attention to a range of environmental and socio-economic issues that may arise in this respect. One of these challenges will be that of accommodating forest uses - including wood for energy, and resulting intensification of forest management - with biodiversity protection in order to meet EU policy goals. We note that the use of biomass and biofuels spans over several economic sector policy areas, which calls for assessing and integrating environmental concerns across forest, agriculture, energy and transport sectors. In this paper, we employ frame analysis to identify the arguments for promoting bioenergy and assess the potential policy conflicts in the relevant sectors, through the analytical lens of environmental policy integration. We conclude that while there is considerable leverage of environmental arguments in favour of bioenergy in the studied economic sectors, and potential synergies with other policy goals, environmental interest groups remain sceptical to just how bioenergy is currently being promoted. There is a highly polarised debate particularly relating to biofuel production. Based on our analysis, we discuss the potential for how those issues could be reconciled drawing on the frame conflict theory, distinguishing between policy disagreements and policy controversies.

The extent of this effect depends on a number of factors, including the existence of hedging instruments, the structure of production (e.g. the prevalence of small firms), and the degree of economic integration across countries. The second issue involves exchange rate misalignments, which are predicted to have short-run effects in models with price rigidities. However, the exact impact depends on a number of features, such as the pricing strategy of firms engaging in international trade and the importance of global production networks. Trade effects of currency misalignments are predicted to disappear in the long-run, unless an economy is characterized by other relevant distortions.

When the consequences of action cannot be calculated, decision-makers confront uncertainty rather than risk. This paper examines how, as a practical accomplishment, uncertain decisions are shifted in the direction of risk, focusing on the history of credit ratings. Decision-making about credit is fraught with uncertainties, and credit rating was invented in the nineteenth century in the USA to help make those uncertainties more tractable. Credit rating methods spread widely, even before their accuracy or efficacy had been demonstrated. The origins of credit rating reveal problems and limits that re-emerged during the financial crisis of 2008, when rating agencies performed very poorly.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Carruthers, BG (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, 1810 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",b-carruthers@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,90,89,105,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

They find that the relationship between the best bid/ask depth on limit order books and price movement is positive. However, the relationship is less significant for the sum of the second to fifth depths resulting from the corresponding bid/ask prices, especially in the groups having the lowest trading volume and the lowest market capitalization. They conjecture that the difference in informational content between the best depth and minor depth is due to the continuous auction-trading mechanism on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE). In addition, the authors find that individual and institutional investors submit and cancel orders differently depending on the depth of the limit order books. In particular, individual investors are more stable in providing liquidity on the buy side than on the sell side.

This development represented a philosophical shift from a neutral presentation of methods without particular advocacy for one or the other. The challenge that this neutral approach presented is that each method is somewhat different and especially for those new to foresight, it became challenging to find common ground, distinguish them, or to know when to use one or the other. Our experience is that our initial wariness of promoting a standard method and thus a one-right-way of doing foresight proved unfounded. Not only does it not detract from the teaching of other methods, in fact it has made it easier. Framework Foresight was deliberately built to accommodate and incorporate other methods and approaches. It provides a basis of comparison of how various practitioners and methods do the work, enabling them to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each. Framework Foresight thus could be viewed as a meta-method in that it is a modular approach that accommodates a substitution of, or supplementation from, other methods or techniques at various steps. As students became practitioners and used the method in their practice, they have provided useful feedback and have generally reported back good results. Thus, Framework Foresight is offered to the foresight community as a method for carrying out foresight projects (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The reform of the Eurotransplant system of priority setting in kidney allocation (ETKAS), which is in many respects ideal, is a case in point. To give due weight to new medical knowledge, waiting time after the onset of end state renal failure should change from a priority-enhancing to a priority-reducing factor. Since those who have gained in priority by waiting under the present system would be set back under the new, severe problems of transitional justice must be overcome when responding to advances in medical knowledge. The paper explores conceptually some possible ways of rule change and indicates their general relevance from an ethical and a practical point of view for future problems of medical resource allocation under transparent, standardized priority-setting rules.","[Ahlert, Marlies] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Law & Econ, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Kliemt, Hartmut] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Ahlert, M (通讯作者)，Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Law & Econ, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany.",ahlert@wiwi.uni-halle.de; h.kliemt@frankfurt-school.de,,,,,,,12,5,5,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This study was designed with the objectives of assessing the contribution of forests to annual income of rural households and identifying its determinants using the case of Jelo Afromontane forest in eastern Ethiopia. It also examined the gender dimensions of forest income, and how this income varies with the wealth status of households. Key informant interview, focus group discussion and household-based questionnaire survey were used to collect data. On average, income from crop production accounted for 40.7% of the total annual household income. Forest income was second in importance, contributing 32.6%. Income from livestock, off- and non-farm activities, and woodlots accounted for 13.6%, 11.4%, and 1.7% of the total household income respectively. Firewood was the most used forest product and constituted the largest proportion (79%) of the total forest income. The contribution of forest income to the total household income varied significantly (P<0.05) with wealth category. Forest income was more important for poor households (47.3%) than for medium (30.5%) or rich (20.2%) households. It was also more important for female headed households (58.2%) than for male headed households (29%). The gender dimension of forest income was also apparent within the household. Female members generated about four times more forest income (77% of the household forest income) than male members (23%). The sex of the household head (P<0.01) and distance to the forest (P<0.05) were the two determinant variables that significantly affected forest income out of the eight explanatory variables considered in the regression model. Policy to promote new forest management arrangement such as participatory forest management (PFM) in Jelo forest needs to take into account the major forest users and the types of products they depend on, and be accompanied with other poverty reduction measures so that improved forest conservation outcome will not have negative consequences on local livelihoods, particularly on poor and women, who depend most on the forest.

The social scientific scholarly literature on arts funding, precarious employment and community economies provides an entry point for our critique of the creative class theory for its neglect of grassroots struggles to produce and fund spaces of collective artistic experimentation. We argue, that local, non-capitalist and collectivist spaces, where artists can share resources, collaborate and build an alternative community cultural economy, are essential for sustaining the cultural sector because they assist individual creatives to performatively resist neo-liberal tendencies naturalized in the creative city script.","[Bain, Alison] York Univ, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [McLean, Heather] York Univ, Fac Environm Studies, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Bain, A (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Geog, N430 Ross Bldg,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",abain@yorku.ca; hmclean@yorku.ca,,"Bain, Alison L./0000-0003-2221-0044",,,,,69,67,77,1,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

The project organised conversations about sustainability ideas for some cities in Europe, including Venice, and for Europe as a whole. For the city of Venice four different scenarios were built, illustrated and debated through a social research process. The project is emblematic of many discussions about anticipation, foresight and futuring activities taking place today in many places. In this paper we discuss how conversations about the future are indeed enquiries in the present; we also use Borges Aleph invention and post-normal science to argue that futuring conversations need to pull in often neglected types of knowledge; we also argue that the ways in which plausibility of future scenarios is argued needs to be deliberated by all concerned and not relinquished to a specific elite. Eventually, we argue that a post-normal framework and its associated concept of fitness for purpose contains the necessary elements for making futuring activities a fundamental step on humans' desirable constant self-reflection.

The Appellate Body has twice made recommendations as if a protocol of accession were a separate covered agreement under the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) when, manifestly, it is not. This approach can affect the interpretation of the accession protocols, notably as regards the availability of general exceptions. Even if it is agreed that an accession protocol is 'an integral part of the WTO Agreement', that statement needs to be analysed and not merely recited. It is a pivotal clause which expressly addresses the relationship between an accession protocol and the WTO Agreement and therefore provides an interpretative framework for the assessment of claims arising under accession commitments. Analysis of that clause in its context reveals that it provides for an accession protocol to be read together with the WTO Agreement as a whole, including the multilateral trade agreements, such as GATT 1994.","[Kennedy, Matthew] Univ Int Business & Econ, Fac Law, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Kennedy, M (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Fac Law, Beijing, Peoples R China.",Matthew.Kennedy@uibe.edu.cn,,"Kennedy, Matthew/0000-0002-5048-4184",,,,,22,12,14,1,12,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In this study, Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) and extreme value models were utilized to examine price variation and volume dynamics of six firms that have specialized in timberland investment. Total standing shares and average daily turnover rates for the MLPs were smaller than those for the timber REITs. Both the GARCH and extreme value models revealed a positive return-volume relation, which provided a strong empirical support for the mixture-of-distribution hypothesis. During extreme market movements, the MLPs had stronger and more stable return-volume relations than the timber REITs. Asymmetric return-volume relation was identified for the MLPs, while the relation was fairly symmetric for the timber REITs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Sectors are self-organized, self-managed groups of fishermen that receive annual catch entitlements. We hypothesize that the success and longevity of these sectors is likely to depend, in part, on the relationships amongst the members including their degree of trust and ability to collaborate. The value of these relationships and the ability to cooperate is commonly referred to as social capital. Prior to the implementation of the new sector system, we conducted a survey to derive baseline measures of social capital for individual groundfish permit holders and sectors. We construct indices of bonding, bridging and linking social capital, information sharing, and trust. We explore correlations between these social capital indices, characteristic of the vessels in the sectors, and various measures of economic performance of sectors.","[Holland, Daniel S.] NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA Fisheries, Natori, Miyagi 98112, Japan; [Kitts, Andrew W.; da Silva, Patricia Pinto] Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA Fisheries, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Holland, DS (通讯作者)，NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA Fisheries, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Natori, Miyagi 98112, Japan.",dan.holland@noaa.gov; Andrew.kitts@noaa.gov; patricia.pinto.da.silva@noaa.gov; josh.wiersma@gmail.com,,"Nedanov, Aleksandar/0000-0002-4238-9275",,,,,27,35,44,0,35,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The soil has a relatively high ability to withstand adverse environmental influences. Often due to water erosion the natural soil fertility can be reduced. Soil erosion strongly influences the Chernozems in loessic hilly land in the South Moravia. The erosion control evaluates the erosion processes as intensity of erosion, meaning how much soil is lost from the unit area per unit of time, what is expressed as lt.ha(-1) year. The rain erosivity R-factor is one of the main parameters in the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). For the Czech Republic it is recommended to use the average value R = 40 MJ.ha(-1).cm.h(-1). The paper aims to assess admissible soil loss by comparing the values of old R-factor (R-factor = 25 MJ.ha(-1).cm.h(-1)) with a newly proposed (value corresponding to the central European average R-factor = 40 MJ.ha(-1).cm.h(-1)), to which in the future the R-factor value should be modified to as part of the Wishmeier-Smith equation. Collection of samples was conducted in late summer and early autumn of 2013. On each slope, three sampling site were selected. Samples were taken from the topsoil and subsoil. Subsequently gradients and slope lengths were measured. Admissible soil loss value for factor R = 25 for deep soil, which includes the Chernozems should be maximally 10 t ha(-1).yr. This condition fulfill only two locations - Dambofice 2 and Klobouky u Brna 2. For the new proposed value of R = 40 are the values of G multiple times higher. Because of the calculated values it would be appropriate and useful to do anti-erosion measures. As an examples for lowering the value of G an anti-erosion measure called diking can be used. For the new factor R = 40 diking is not a sufficient measure of anti-erosion.","[Hrabovska, B.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Hrabovská, B (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",beata.hrabovska@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,301,307,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800052,0

Even though the programme has gained wide acceptability among owners, compared to traditional conservation such as land acquisition, more owners need to be engaged. In this study, we examined how the new protection measures have diffused among forest owners. This analysis will help find means to promote the protection among owners who could but have not yet participated. The theoretical background is innovation diffusion. We focused on the communication channels and attributes of innovation that would be important for the rest of the adopters. Data were gathered from owners who have protected their forests in the eastern part of Finland. The results showed that the idea of protection has reached forest owners mainly via certain advisors of a regional Forestry Centre or via forestry magazines and newspapers. In the future, it is important that the advisors of local Forest Management Associations and employees of timber buying companies promote the programme more, since they are the most familiar forestry experts for many owners. In addition, it would be necessary to increase the role of peer forest owners and enhance the visibility of protected areas. Highlighting the rationality and ease of protection to potential adopters is important. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Present value costs per tonne of carbon sequestration through the creation of new forests are estimated, and results of a static comparative analysis, aiming to show the influence of key variables on the costs, are presented and discussed. The paper provides empirical evidence of the cost effectiveness of the establishment of forest plantations for climate change mitigation in different locations in the UK, identifying also the importance of placing forestry for carbon sequestration in the general context of rural land use, where significant policy reforms can be anticipated. The evidence from this research suggests that the choice of location for forestry development, and of appropriate species and management regimes to be applied, are important factors in determining economic costs. Afforestation with relatively fast growing tree species (e.g. Sitka spruce) on low grade agricultural land (e.g. currently used for sheep grazing) may be a cost effective option. The general conclusion is that there is a case for forestry in the UK to contribute to climate mitigation, that woodlands expansion is likely competitive with other means of removing carbon from the atmosphere, and that in certain cases and locations, afforestation projects may provide relatively low cost options for carbon sequestration.

First, the basic techniques that use thermal energy for joining materials are processed. Electric arc is analyzed here, as the main source of heat for fusion welding. In the next part, attention is given to special methods with high density of energy per area, which are in principle significantly different from the previous ones. In particular, this includes plasma welding, electron beam and laser. The modern methods also include the CMT welding process that allows joining dissimilar materials using the electric arc. This procedure successfully resolved the long-term problem of joining steel and aluminum in the automotive industry. Attention is given to the principle of CMT process, composition and description of the individual components welding sets and where is the most applicable. The main objective of this contribution is a detailed analysis of the CMT welding process. Steel and aluminum as two mutually dissimilar materials are joined this method using a welding robot. Generated samples are then subjected to accelerated corrosion degradation in the salt chamber. In the next part, it will be investigated degree of corrosion degradation and penetration of corrosion materials by metallographic analyzes. Research will continue with other tests. Corrosion is a slow, progressive or rapid deterioration of metal body properties such as its appearance, surface aspect or mechanical properties under the influence of the surrounding environment: atmosphere, water, seawater, various solutions, organic environments, etc. (Vargel Ch. 2004).","[Polak, V; Dostal, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Technol & Automobile Transport, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Polak, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Technol & Automobile Transport, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",vojtechpolak@seznam.cz,"Dostál, Petr/A-4164-2018; Dostál, Petr/JTV-6004-2023",,,,,,6,1,1,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,847,851,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800149,0

Objective To explore the cost-effectiveness of CAM compared with conventional medicine. Methods A dataset from a Dutch health insurer was used containing quarterly information on healthcare costs (care by general practitioner (GP), hospital care, pharmaceutical care, and paramedic care), dates of birth and death, gender and 6-digit postcode of all approximately 150,000 insurees, for the years 2006-2009. Data from 1913 conventional GPs were compared with data from 79 GPs with additional CAM training in acupuncture (25), homeopathy (28), and anthroposophic medicine (26). Results Patients whose GP has additional CAM training have 0-30% lower healthcare costs and mortality rates, depending on age groups and type of CAM. The lower costs result from fewer hospital stays and fewer prescription drugs. Discussion Since the differences are obtained while controlling for confounders including neighborhood specific fixed effects at a highly detailed level, the lower costs and longer lives are unlikely to be related to differences in socioeconomic status. Possible explanations include selection (e. g. people with a low taste for medical interventions might be more likely to choose CAM) and better practices (e. g. less overtreatment, more focus on preventive and curative health promotion) by GPs with knowledge of complementary medicine. More controlled studies (replication studies, research based on more comprehensive data, cost-effectiveness studies on CAM for specific diagnostic categories) are indicated.","[Kooreman, Peter] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands; [Baars, Erik W.] Univ Appl Sci, Dept Care, NL-2333 CK Leiden, Netherlands; [Baars, Erik W.] Louis Bolk Inst, Dept Healthcare & Nutr, NL-3972 LA Driebergen, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Kooreman, P (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, Warandelaan 2, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands.",p.kooreman@uvt.nl,,,,,,,14,60,65,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

If sibling composition is associated with educational attainment, then those associations should be stronger in poor societies of developing nations. We use data from a pre-industrial society of native Amazonians in Bolivia and found that school-age (5-16) girls or boys with an additional older sibling, particularly an older brother, were less likely to enroll in school and had fewer years of completed schooling. Because older siblings affected the school attainment of younger siblings, older siblings lowered a child's academic skills. Unlike their peers in rich households, younger sisters in poor households were less likely to enroll in school if they had an older sibling.

In this context, we use a Panama-based example to show the impacts of the current levels of uncertainty in forest carbon density estimates on GHG baseline estimation and estimations of emission reductions. Using five aboveground tree carbon stock estimates for Moist Tropical forest in a simulation study, we found a difference in terms of annual CO2 emissions of more than 100% between the lowest and the highest estimates. We analyze the economic significance to show that when comparing the income generated for the different forest carbon density estimates to the cost of 10% reduced deforestation, the break-even point differs from US$6.74 to US$16.58 per ton of CO2e between the highest and the lowest estimate. We argue that for a country such as Panama, improving the quality of forest carbon stock estimates would make economic sense since the highest forest carbon density estimates were developed nationally while the lowest estimate is the global default value. REDD could result in a huge incentive for forest protection and improved forest management, in consequence, we highlight that progress on the incorporation of uncertainty analysis and on the mitigation of the main sources of error in forest carbon density estimates merit further methodological guidance.

Among 26 OECD countries, we find various institutional configurations including a group of liberal market economies (LMEs) and of coordinated market economies (CMEs). However, these configurations are not stable. From 1990 to 2005, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden all moved from the CME model closer to the LME model. Capitalist variety is strongly linked to sector-specific comparative advantages, as predicted by Hall and SoskiceCMEs export more heavily in medium high-tech industries, and LMEs in high-tech industries. In addition, the economies that have moved towards the LME model have also specialized more strongly in high-tech over time. In sum, we find mixed evidence for the claims made by Hall and Soskice. Comparative advantages develop as predicted in the VoC approach, but the types of capitalism are more varied and more dynamic than the VoC approach suggests.","[Schneider, Martin R.] Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Fac Business Adm Econ & Business Comp, Paderborn, Germany; [Paunescu, Mihai] SAS, Vienna, Austria",University of Paderborn,"Schneider, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Fac Business Adm Econ & Business Comp, Paderborn, Germany.",martin.schneider@notes.upb.de,,,,,,,60,134,138,0,84,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

As of March 2012, the operation of this new import regime has not been formally assessed. The first GM-crops are just now working their way through the post-moratorium regulatory system and an assessment of the operation of the regime is timely. The results of this assessment suggest that the EU's approval system is only partially based in science and thus, the potential for political interference remains.

We consider soft collars, which provide limited volume of additional emission allowances (a reserve) at the price ceiling, and hard collars, which provide an unlimited supply of additional allowances, thereby preventing allowance prices from exceeding the price ceiling. Conversely, allowances are removed from the market if prices fall to the floor. We find that increasing the size of the reserve strictly lowers expected net present values of compliance costs; however, there is a diminishing effect as the allowance reserve is expanded. Most of the expected cost savings are achieved with a modest reserve. Consequently, a rather limited soft price collar could provide considerable assurance about cost while preventing the possibility that emissions could spiral out of control. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The paper mainly aims at identifying the main drivers of household behavior regarding collection of main forest products in the context of dry forest environment. A multivariate probit analysis was used to explain variation in household participation in collection of different forest products. The results show that households' participation in collection of different forest products is significantly determined by a combination of household demographic characteristics, ownership of oxen and of cows, proximity to forest, access to health and school infrastructure, resettlement history and self-reported change in standard of living.

Opportunities and Threats) analysis yields analytical priorities for the SWOT factors and makes them commensurable. Decision alternatives can also be evaluated with respect to each SWOT factor. SWOT analysis provides the basic frame for analyses of operational environments to support strategic decision-making. MCDS methods enhance SWOT analysis and its results so that alternative strategic decisions can be prioritised overall. This benefits the utilisation of the SWOT-results in the decision making process. The methods also help in defining the action line alternatives that are based on the recognition of the most important operational environmental factors and their possible interdependencies. The MCDS method applied initially and most often within the SWOT framework has been the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the hybrid approach has been called the A'WOT. Any MCDS method, and its prioritisation principles, can, however, be applied and the existence of different techniques allows the adaptation of use of the MCDS method according to the needs of the decision-maker and the specific planning situation. This paper reviews the evolution of the A'WOT method with AHP, SMART and SMAA-O techniques applied within SWOT, and studies their applicability and the MCDS methods more generally, through required assessment techniques of decision-makers' preferences. The usability of the techniques is analysed with case studies in the field of strategic natural resources management planning.

To test this thesis, this paper examines attitudes of German employers towards board-level codetermination. It compares firms attitudes at the individual and the collective level: individual firms attitudes are analysed using survey data and media statements from individual executives; collective attitudes are analysed using policy statements from the national business federations. The paper finds considerable support for board-level codetermination among individual firms but continued opposition from the federations. The paper suggests that this difference arises from the federations strategically over-representing dissatisfied members. The promotion of voluntary arrangements allows the federations to campaign against board-level codetermination without alienating the satisfied members. The paper highlights the need to complement a micro-foundational analysis of preference formation with an analysis of intra-associational processes of preference aggregation.","Max Planck Inst Study Soc, D-50676 Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Paster, T (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Paulstr 3, D-50676 Cologne, Germany.",thomas.paster@mpifg.de,"Paster, Thomas/K-7511-2012; Paster, Thomas/F-3787-2015","Paster, Thomas/0000-0001-9762-5813",,,,,62,15,15,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Little attention has been paid to how the number of memberships is affected by common measures of team performance, such as the team's win-ratio. This study utilises a previously unavailable long range time-series data set of annual memberships for an Australian Football League (AFL) club, Hawthorn PC. A succession of basic correlation analyses demonstrates that, while the relation between club membership numbers and win-ratios is strongly positive as it is for attendances (for most of the sample), some of the finer properties are substantially different. It is suggested that much of the reason for this lies in differences between the segmented nature of these markets for attendances and memberships.","La Trobe Univ, Fac Business Econ & Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University,"Lenten, LJA (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Fac Business Econ & Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",l.lenten@latrobe.edu.au,,"Lenten, Liam/0000-0001-7694-994X",,,,,18,4,5,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This paper aims to identify factors associated with the type of care (informal, formal, mixed or no care at all) received by the French disabled elderly and to assess the care's relative costs. This paper uses data from a French survey on disability; the 3,500 respondents of interest lived at home, were aged 60 and over, had severe disability and needed help with activities of daily living. We use a multinomial probit model to determine factors associated with type of care. We also assess the cost of care with the help of the proxy good method. One-third of disabled elderly people receive no care. Among those who are helped, 55% receive informal, 25% formal, and 20% mixed care. Low socioeconomic status increases difficulties in accessing formal care. The estimated economic value of informal care is 6.6 billion euro [95% CI = 5.9-7.2] and represents about two-thirds of the total cost of care. Public policies should pay more attention to inequalities in access to community care. They also should better support informal care, through respite care or workplace accommodations (working hours rescheduling or reduction for instance) not detrimental for the career of working caregivers.","[Paraponaris, Alain; Davin, Berengere; Verger, Pierre] INSERM, U912 SE4S, F-13006 Marseille, France; [Paraponaris, Alain; Davin, Berengere; Verger, Pierre] Univ Aix Marseille, IRD, UMR S912, Marseille, France; [Paraponaris, Alain; Davin, Berengere; Verger, Pierre] ORS PACA, Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Paraponaris, A (通讯作者)，INSERM, U912 SE4S, 23 Rue Stanislas Torrents, F-13006 Marseille, France.",alain.paraponaris@inserm.fr; berengere.davin@inserm.fr; pierre.verger@inserm.fr,,"Paraponaris, Alain/0000-0001-8281-8305",,,,,63,62,72,5,75,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Trading costs indicate that it is less costly for institutional investors to trade large cap stocks at market close than at open.

They can be viewed as a way for private stakeholders to bypass public policies by contracting outside the policy framework, as long as the instrument is viewed as an application of the Coase theorem. For instance, some PES enable local users to be rewarded for abandoning illegal practices in place of law enforcement. But high transaction costs, institutional requirements for action, or the need to upscale the scheme tend to bring public bodies back into play. This can materialise in the issuance of regulations, the establishment of ad hoc entities to implement PES, the negotiation of contracts with resource users, and many other effects. In theory and according to the classical definition of the instrument, PES apply a beneficiary pays principle. With the policy framework potentially playing a central role in their future development, PES may be interpreted as a way to complement the polluter pays principle under the control of public bodies. Indeed, in contexts where those degrading an environmental service (polluters) are not eligible to be considered as payers, e.g. insolvent rural populations in developing countries that cannot afford to pay for their negative impacts, PES may eventually represent the vehicle to justify and finance public action. This analysis, built on a case study in Indonesia, downplays the statements presenting PES as market-based mechanisms aimed at filling the regulatory gap - i.e. the lack of prescriptive regulations for the environment - and enlarging the funding sources for conservation. We note also the promising emergence of a specific type of PES that relies on mandatory financial contributions by service beneficiaries, while keeping payments to service providers on a voluntary basis through contracts.

At the same time, the transportation and urban planning fields have increasingly employed scenario planning approaches, not only to develop long-term strategy, but also potentially to strengthen organizational networks and encourage collaborative action. Yet these latter supposed outcomes of scenario planning remain under-theorized and largely untested. In this study, we propose a methodology, based on established theories of collaboration, to test the ability of a particular type of scenario planning to encourage collaboration between participants. We demonstrate the approach using a scenario planning process undertaken within the transportation and urban planning community in Portugal. The pre-/post-test experimental design uses a survey designed to assess participants' propensity for future collaboration by measuring change in individuals' perceptions and understandings. The results suggest that the process likely modestly increased participants' propensity to collaborate, primarily by strengthening inter-agency networks. The effects on participants' views and understanding remain inconclusive. We suggest that specific challenges in applying this specific scenario planning approach to public sector contexts may limit the method's potentia; in achieving inter-organizational collaboration. Nonetheless, only more widespread efforts to formally test the scenario planning rhetoric will reveal the true impacts on organization change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As a partial response for Norway, a cost-of-illness study was carried out to estimate the yearly cost of the illness to society and relate costs and patients' quality of life to illness severity. Estimated cost to society was Euro 439 million in 2002 exclusive of the cost of reduced quality of life. The cost per patient was close to Euro 65,000. Account taken of methodological differences, the results compare to results for Sweden, Norway's closest neighboring country. The illness reduced patients' quality of life with 0.26. More patients were early retired because of their MS in Norway than in any of nine other European countries comprised by a recent European study, illustrating a liberal practice in Norway. The Norwegian cost of unpaid assistance was almost identical to the Swedish cost that was the lowest found across the countries in the European study. When related to illness severity, the cost per patient increased, and the patients' experienced quality of life decreased with increasing EDSS levels in line with what has been found for other countries. Cost-of-MS studies have been carried out for a number of countries. Together they contribute to our understanding of the economic consequences of multiple sclerosis and, if their results are related to illness severity, also provide valuable information for further economic analyses of treatment and medication.

Experts further propose that organization begin implementing a management system considerate to the employee's age age management, including recommendations in fields such as health care, job restructuring, adapting to work organization, shift management according to impulses by employees and other. (E-sondy.cz, 2012) Age management is a term used for activities, the purpose of which is to support the complex approach towards dealing with demographical changes at the workplace. Legitimate practice in age management was defined as measures contending with the age barrier or supporting diversity and activities ensuring each employee receives the opportunity to fulfill his or her potential and is not at a disadvantage due to age. (Pillinger, 2008) The article introduces the results of the quantitative and qualitative research that was conducted by the author while writing his doctoral thesis, which was focused on personnel management and specific features of employees of the age group 50+ in Czech and Slovak organizations. Results from the article predominantly focus on the philosophy of age management and its role in Czech and Slovak organizations, both from the viewpoint of employees and from the viewpoint of managements from addressed organizations. The article attempts to point out the potential and personal know-how 50+ employees have, and which employers could appreciate and utilize for their competitiveness. Furthermore, it is necessary to realize that establishing age diversity within work groups or teams will become inevitable. Company culture, which should support the complex approach to the entire philosophy of age management, also plays an important role in implementing age management into the organization. Also considered significant will be providing effective training of managers in order for them to successfully implement company strategy and processes and to further support employee age diversity. This step shall help improve the relations between organization management and all employees, which will comprehensively reflect on the image of the organization that will be considered as an organization implementing the policies of individual approach to each employee.","[Bejtkovsky, Ing Jiri] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,bejtkovsky@fame.utb.cz,"Bejtkovsky, Jiri/B-2001-2018","Bejtkovsky, Jiri/0000-0003-1600-3487",,,,,12,3,3,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2212,2220,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801099,0

This presumes that innovation occurs in an almost natural way within these networks, especially within strategic public-private initiated ones. An ecosystem in which innovation projects do not take place would be artificially and deliberately maintained in status quo by some powerful agents. In fact, power is the central concept in networks analysis (Thorelli, 1986). This paper contributes to better understand the interplay between episodic and systemic power in ecosystems of innovation. It analyses agents' rhetoric in an ICT ecosystem with a high entrepreneurial agenda whose members were known for using their episodic power (Lawrence, 2008) to perpetuating an intriguing status quo situation. As power operates to normalize and naturalize certain values and practices (Khan, Munir and Willmott, 2007), it is necessary to identify the artificial and deliberate processes that led to the durability of the status quo but also to understand the determinants of such practices. Two key dimensions will be highlighted: the processes through which actors affect the institutional context and disrupt their ecosystem (the episodic power), and the decision makers' rhetoric which points out the systemic power (Clegg, 1989). This paper highlights the interplay between these two kinds of power.","[Ben Letaifa, Soumaya] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ecole Sci Gest, Montreal, PQ H3C 4R2, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,,Ben_letaifa.soumaya@uqam.ca,"Ben LETAIFA, Soumaya/JAX-4435-2023",,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2376,2379,,,,,,4,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549801115,0

This introductory article to the Special Issue of Socio-Economic Review examines the potential contributions of institutional theory to understanding CSR as a mode of governance. This perspective suggests going beyond grounding CSR in the voluntary behaviour of companies, and understanding the larger historical and political determinants of whether and in what forms corporations take on social responsibilities. Historically, the prevailing notion of CSR emerged through the defeat of more institutionalized forms of social solidarity in liberal market economies. Meanwhile, CSR is more tightly linked to formal institutions of stakeholder participation or state intervention in other advanced economies. The tensions between business-driven and multi-stakeholder forms of CSR extend to the transnational level, where the form and meaning of CSR remain highly contested. CSR research and practice thus rest on a basic paradox between a liberal notion of voluntary engagement and a contrary implication of socially binding responsibilities. Institutional theory seems to be a promising avenue to explore how the boundaries between business and society are constructed in different ways, and improve our understanding of the effectiveness of CSR within the wider institutional field of economic governance.","[Jackson, Gregory] Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Brammer, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Matten, Dirk] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",University of Warwick; York University - Canada,"Jackson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Berlin, Germany.",gregory.jackson@fu-berlin.de,"Brammer, Stephen/ABE-2187-2021; Brammer, Stephen J/C-5890-2009; Brammer, Stephen/F-8982-2018; Jackson, Gregory/E-3178-2010","Brammer, Stephen/0000-0003-1424-0008; Brammer, Stephen J/0000-0003-1424-0008; Jackson, Gregory/0000-0002-1593-8988",,,,,96,550,640,13,488,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We find, via Monte Carlo simulations, that the power to detect predictability in finite samples tends to decrease at long horizons in a linear framework. Although Monte Carlo simulations applied to exponential smooth-transition autoregressive models of the price-dividend and price-earnings ratios show increased power, the ability of the nonlinear framework in explaining the pattern of stock return predictability in the data does not show any promise at either short or long horizons, just as in the linear predictive regressions.","[Gupta, Rangan; Modise, Mampho P.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; mamphomodise@yahoo.com,,,,,,,56,9,12,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

If total fishing effort is reduced to the socially optimal level, then we estimate gross revenue would be SR 167 million and the potential net benefit from the KSA Red Sea traditional fisheries could be as large as SR 111 million.","[Jin, Di; Kite-Powell, Hauke; Hoagland, Porter; Solow, Andrew] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Policy Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,"Jin, D (通讯作者)，Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Policy Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",djin@whoi.edu; hauke@whoi.edu; phoagland@whoi.edu; asolow@whoi.edu,,"Jin, Di/0000-0002-6403-7983",King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI),King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI),This research was supported by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under a research agreement with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).

With implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, reducing emissions of carbon dioxide is the common goal of everyone. Afforestation and carbon reduction have become important forestry policies of the Taiwanese government. Attitudes and behavioral intentions of the domestic public towards afforestation and carbon reduction will play important roles in the effectiveness of forestry policies. In this study, the theory of planned behavior was applied to better understand the relationships among domestic public attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral controls, and behavioral intentions. Data were obtained by a mail survey. The domestic public's behavioral intention model was verified by a structural equation model. This study found that older people not only had a positive attitude towards the concept of afforestation for carbon reduction but were also willing to participate in related activities. Significant reference groups also had greater influence on these people, but for the question of whether a person had better means to participate in afforestation activities for carbon reduction, the level of monthly income emerged as the factor of main consideration. It shows that even though an overall positive attitude towards afforestation activities for carbon reduction increases people's willingness to participate, actual participation is still determined by the level of the participant's ability to control difficulties during the related activities. The policy implication of this study is that when setting into action the carbon reduction policies or programs, the Taiwanese government should take into account the claim from significant reference groups, and enhance the visibility of those groups' positive points of view towards the policies. In addition, the government should enhance the promotion of the high-income and the older people's participation in carbon reduction programs, because our results show their high intention to participate.

Individual acquisition prices of equipment in question were recalculated according to the methodology of pricing of machinery and equipment to get the general price in 2007 and the same procedure was applied to calculate the general price in 2008. The effect of the change of appropriate legislative laws on the technical economic parameters of six equipment for factory farming of pigs was analyzed according to the methodology for pricing of the machinery and machine equipment. Three out of the six equipment falls under concerned equipment and the other three does not fall under criteria of the law no. 76/2002 Coll. relating to integrated prevention.

This paper focuses specifically on the scope and limits of 'investment regionalism' involving Asia. A combination of regional foreign direct investment (FDI) stakes and international socialization patterns has led Asian actors to mark investments as a key issue in their regionalism strategy overall. As elsewhere, they too have moved toward a mode of governance favoring the formal legalization of investments in terms of the precision, obligation, and delegation of rules. Already the endeavors of both the middle and dominant economies in the region have shifted from just concluding Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and investment-related chapters in Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to designing region-wide investment agreements and initiatives by-and-for Asian countries. Although the legal effectiveness of this rule-making change will play out in the long run in and across Asian societies, the more immediate policy implication relates to its potential impact on the evolution of Asian regionalism as a whole.","Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Pekkanen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",smp1@uw.edu,,,,,,,127,10,10,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2012,11.0,1,,,,,119,154,,10.1017/S1474745611000383,0.0,,,36,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,886WU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299885400005,0

Like any other signal molecule, the action of cytokinins is determined by the amount of active hormone exposed to receptor molecules, and the strength and duration of the subsequent signalling. Active hormone levels are the result of the combinatorial regulation of their biosynthesis, reversible and irreversible metabolic interconversion, and terminal degradation. The existence of genetically determined variation in geographically distinct populations within the model species Arabidopsis thaliana is being increasingly documented. We are exploring the cytokinin status of young Arabidopsis seedlings from a collection of accessions that represent maximal genetic diversity within the species. We will present data regarding cytokinin levels and some examples of physiological analysis of the variation in response to exogenous cytokinin. Comprehensive mapping of the variation in cytokinin metabolism will allow us to establish a basis for understanding how relatively minor changes in hormone status are used by the plant to form and fine-tune adaptive processes.","[Samsonova, Z.; Kuklova, A.; Mazura, P.; Rotkova, G.; Brzobohaty, B.; Kiran, N.

Customer experience management (CEM) represents a holistic concept combining both strategic and tactical customer retention management. In this research project, strategic customer retention research was conducted in an online survey with 600 consumers of garden and leisure products. Two main sub-groups - customers of garden centres and Do-It-Yourself (DIY) stores - were compared. The level of satisfaction for garden centre customers significantly exceeded the level of satisfaction for DIY store customers. Furthermore, customers' expectation and experience were higher for garden centres. Consequently, garden centres as specialist horticulture retail stores have profitable strengths and sustainable market opportunities compared to DIY stores. In a second study focused on tactical CEM and performance at customer touch points, a newly developed methodological concept and survey instrument for mystery shopping was tested in a study of 230 shop visits in a service sector. The most important competencies of a salesperson which impacted on customer experience were sales talent and the soft skills. The most important aspect of the selling process was the presentation and recommendation of a product. The mystery shopping instrument enabled retailers to zoom in on the critical moments of a service interaction, to identify basic problems and areas of improvement and to resolve them directly. It can be applied to all horticultural retailers such as garden centres, food stores, whole food shops and landscape designers.","RheinMain Univ Appl Sci, Wiesbaden, Germany",,"Sparke, K (通讯作者)，RheinMain Univ Appl Sci, Wiesbaden, Germany.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66050-68-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2012,930.0,,,,,,183,188,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BDT45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314782400024,0

Provider assigns the price for bandwidth resource to maximize its own profit, whereas the primary user tries to find balance between using the bandwidth resource for its own needs and renting spectrum band to secondary users for profit gain. Secondary users can access to the network and transmit their signals by using the spectrum band of the primary user paying for that in proportion to the power of the transmitted signal. For this game the optimal strategies of the players are found.

In this paper, we estimate the earnings gains to for-profit college attendance using restricted-access data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97). Using an individual fixed effects estimation strategy that allows us to control for time-invariant unobservable characteristics of students, we find that students who enroll in associate's degree programs in for-profit colleges experience earnings gains of about 10% relative to high school graduates with no college degree, conditional on employment. Since associate's degree students attend for an average of 2.6 years, this translates to a 4% return per year of education in a for-profit college, slightly lower than estimates of returns for other sectors found in the literature.

The article demonstrates how regional intermediaries support small manufacturers and enable firms to develop as a localised, networked group - effectively operating as a cohort not tied by sector or technology but by process. These intermediaries recast manufacturing as a practice of working with rather than working for others, thus reintroducing both agency and collective action to the US manufacturing narrative.

J,"Klein, JT",,,,"Klein, Julie Thompson",,,Discourses of transdisciplinarity: Looking Back to the Future,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transdisciplinarity; Transcendence; Problem-solving; Transgression; Complexity; Contextualization,,"The current ascendancy of transdisciplinarity (TD) is marked by an exponential growth of publications, a widening array of contexts, and increased interest across academic, public and private sectors. This investigation traces historical trends, rhetorical claims, and social formations that have shaped three major discourses of TD: transcendence, problem solving, and transgression. In doing so, it also takes account of developments that have emerged or gained traction since the early 21st century when a 2004 issue of Futures on the same topic was being written. The epistemological problem at the heart of the discourse of transcendence is the idea of unity, traced in the West to ancient Greece. The emergence of transdisciplinarity was not a complete departure from this historical quest, but it signalled the need for new syntheses at a time of growing fragmentation of knowledge and culture. New synthetic frameworks emerged, including general systems, post/structuralism, feminist theory, and sustainability. New organizations also formed to advance conceptual frameworks aimed at transcending the narrowness of disciplinary worldviews and interdisciplinary combinations of approaches that did not supplant the status quo of academic structure and classification. The discourse of problem solving is not new. It was fundamental to conceptions of interdisciplinarity in the first half of the 20th century. Heightened pressure to solve problems of society, though, fostered growing alignment of TD with solving complex problems as well as trans-sector participation of stakeholders in society and team-based science. The discourse of transgression was forged in critique of the existing system of knowledge and education. TD became aligned with imperatives of cultural critique, sociopolitical movements, and conceptions of post-normal science and wicked problems that break free of reductionist and mechanistic approaches. It also became a recognized premise in interdisciplinary fields, including cultural studies, women's and gender studies, urban studies, and environmental studies. And, calls for TO arrived at a moment of wider crisis in the privileging of dominant forms of knowledge, human rights accountability, and democratic participation. Even with distinct patterns of definition, though, discourses are not air-tight categories. Transcendence was initially an epistemological project, but the claim of transcendence overlaps increasingly with problem solving. The imperatives of transgression also cut across the discourses of transcendence and problem solving. Broadly speaking, though, emphasis is shifting from traditional epistemology to problem solving, from the pre-given to the emergent, and from universality to hybridity and contextuality.

These two advocacy narratives intersect uniquely in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) towns and can lead to flawed understandings of the true dynamics of women's experiences in these contexts. Mining areas are important centers of economic activity for women, but also pose distinct risks. A simplistic portrayal of women's victimization in mining towns suppress discussion of their participation in non-conflict political and social processes. Yet, these processes are among the most important to ensure that women secure opportunities for long-term, substantive engagement in mining activities. This paper draws on systematically collected qualitative data from two territories in South Kivu, Walungu and Kalehe, to examine how women negotiate these complex social and economic mining landscapes in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Their accounts compel a re-examination of development efforts to remove women from the mines altogether, and to look more closely at the measures available to help them realize their legal rights to work safely and fairly in these contexts.

In Finland, the rapid growth of nature-based tourism has expanded tourism and outdoor recreation activities from protected areas into commercial forests, especially in northern Finland. This has created demands to modify current forest management regimes, in particular regeneration practices. As the landscape and recreational benefits of forests mainly represent direct and indirect use values, there may be a case for a direct contractual mechanism of payments between the users (e.g. tourism entrepreneurs) and providers (forest owners). This paper presents the key results of a choice experiment study analyzing domestic and foreign tourists' demand for and willingness to pay for enhanced forest amenities, in particular landscape values and biodiversity, in private forests in the Ruka-Kuusamo tourism area in northeastern Finland. The results support the idea that tourists are willing to pay for selected improvements in the quality of outdoor recreation environments through adjustments in forest management in the case study area. Both foreign and domestic tourists were willing to pay for improvements in forest landscape, in terms of less frequent clear-cutting and site preparation areas along the routes, as well as for increased biodiversity. Foreign tourists' willingness to pay was significantly higher than domestic tourists'.

Trade liberalization based on PTA MFN clauses cannot be considered part of the internal trade liberalization required by GATT Article XXIV:8 or GATS Article V:1. The exclusionary effects caused by trade liberalization through PTA MFN clauses increase the burden on trade with third parties. As a result, PTA MFN clauses do not meet the necessity test under the Appellate Body's decision in Turkey-Textiles, as reasonable alternatives to the PTA MFN clauses are available. For these reasons, PTA MFN clauses fail the requirements for legal defences under GATT Article XXIV or GATS Article V for their violations of the general MFN clauses under GATT Article I and GATS Article II.

The conceptual framework shows that these policies differ in the incentives they create for the consumption and mix of different types of biofuels and in their effects on food and fuel prices and GHG emissions. We also simulate the welfare and GHG effects of these three policies which are normalized to achieve the same level of US GHG emissions. By promoting greater production of food-crop based biofuels, the RFS is found to lead to a larger reduction in fossil fuel use but also a larger increase in food prices and a smaller reduction in global GHG emissions compared to the LCFS and carbon tax. All three policies increase US social welfare compared to a no-biofuel baseline scenario due to improved terms-of-trade, even when environmental benefits are excluded; global social welfare increases with a carbon tax but decreases with the RFS and LCFS due to the efficiency costs imposed by these policies, even after including the benefits of mitigating GHG emissions.

The CATS is generally associated in this context with a bottom-up (positive-list) scheduling approach where the sectors on which trade commitments are undertaken are selected individually. This is claimed to be less efficient, in terms of liberalization effects, than alternative approaches under which everything is considered to be fully committed unless specifically excluded (top-down or negative listing). However, a closer look at services negotiations conducted in various settings, including the Doha Round process, WTO accession cases and different types of Regional Trade Agreements (RTA), suggests that such structural issues have limited, if any, impact on the results achieved.

The analysis draws on both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Four qualitative Future World Images to the year 2040 are based on varying degrees of cooperation in international governance and of state involvement in markets. These qualitative Images have been converted into quantitative parameters which could be input to the POLES model in order to produce four quantitative scenarios. In all four scenarios, annual CO2 emissions by the year 2040 are higher than those in 2009 and much higher than the UN target for 2050. Emissions are significantly higher in the collaborative worlds than in the uncollaborative worlds. Notwithstanding this apparent unattractiveness of the collaborative images, they do allow greater technological development and higher energy efficiencies to be achieved than do the uncollaborative images. These advantages of the collaborative worlds are likely to provide a much stronger basis for moving to a low-carbon world after 2040, especially where markets play a strong role in trade and investment.

To date, the actual decision-making behavior regarding logging has hence been only derived from the analysis of data gathered in surveys or on the basis of aggregated data. Currently, no studies exist that compare the individual timber harvesting behavior with a normative benchmark. The present study experimentally examines the behavior of decision-makers from forestry organizations by means of the example of selling a one-off property with a normative benchmark derived using the Jevons-Fisher rule. We investigate if the intuitive behavior shown by forestry decision-makers in an incentive-compatible experiment for the sale of a one-off property can be approximated to the optimal behavior according to the Jevons-Fisher rule. For determining the normative benchmark, the decision-maker's risk attitude measured by a Holt and Laury lottery is explicitly taken into account The results reveal that, on average, participants decide earlier for selling the property than what would be expected according to the normative benchmark. This illustrates the importance of experimental investigations in order to better understand the decision-making behavior in a forestry setting. Furthermore, the findings indicate that risk-averse participants, males, participants who completed a forestry apprenticeship as well as participants with an economic-related educational background sell the property earlier. Older participants, participants holding a university degree, and participants interested in participating in further experiments sell the property rather later. Moreover, with progressive repetition of the property sale experiment, participants decide to sell the property earlier. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Although these cost increases undoubtedly will contribute to each nation's fiscal problems, we conclude that effective education contributes to improvement of the economic performance of each country and can mitigate resulting financial pressures by spurring growth in overall purchasing power.

For both minorities and nonminorities, these changes to the estimated admissions rule hurt students with relatively strong academic credentials and whose parents were relatively affluent and educated.

It questions the dominant perspective on the future that the Western liberal and consumerist system will endlessly rise. By using macrohistorical perspectives, distance is created from short-term economic and political projections allowing a view of the stages of history, the broader shape of the future through space and time, which provides another way to think about China's alternative futures. Four alternative futures are developed. In the first future, there is a regime change, with moves towards democracy and greater human rights. In the second future, there is a Golden Age for China and the world with major scientific, political and cultural achievements. In the third future, change is material and shallow, and in the fourth future there is collapse, not just of China's rise, but also of the world capitalist system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

After using a rich set of controls, we found little evidence that the ECERS-R related to children's development. Further, higher levels of quality failed to improve growth in academic, language, or socioemotional skills and behaviors for children with more exposure to sociodemographic risk.

As George's geoengineering experiment is one of the largest and first of its kind, many were quick to denounce his rogue action while others were delighted to see that he succeeded as a large algae bloom was reported to have emerged. Using the George event as a point of entry for exploring alternative futures of geoengineering in an age of global weirding, this project fuses the 2 x 2 scenario modeling technique with the Manoa School four-futures method by situating command and control, along X( control) and Y (command) axes as two critical uncertainties and key drivers of change that will impact the design, development, and diffusion of climate mitigation engineering initiatives, which some see as holding the only solution to avert global catastrophe and others condemn as a postnormal remedy.

In some countries, citizens accept corruption as a day-to-day reality with stoic silence, while in others they are determined to fight against it. In all countries, however, there is that moment in time-a tipping point-in which citizens rise up and demand answers and accountability in public life. In India business is simultaneously the reason and the victim of corruption, for a business depends on the eco-system created by the interplay of government and society for its inception and growth. Dynasty has emerged as a major factor in entrenching crony capitalism-among both business and political families. Apart from mutual give-and-take of money and patronage to sustain power equations, there is now also a growing trend of fungibility between business and politics where there is a thin dividing line and people move over from one to the other with consummate ease. However, there are distinct winds of change that give reasonable cause to hope for change. Chief among these are: growing civil society activism, fiercely guarded free media, enabling legislations such as Right to Information Act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, public procurement legislations, improved justice delivery systems and a pro-active government auditor. Administrators, citizens and businesses alike are moving towards incremental qualitative improvement in accountability rather than disruptive upheaval. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

There are no easy solutions to address such a complex and seemingly contradictory set of goals and India will have to find a development trajectory that fits its unique requirements. While there are some positive signs of recognizing the need for innovative and different approaches, the overall picture is currently not very encouraging.

Three key insights emerge: the evolving gender and land tenure literature provides valuable information for understanding the likely effects of land deals; some of the land deal issues transcend gender-equity concerns and relate to broader problems of dispossession and loss of livelihoods; and huge gaps remain in our knowledge of gender and land rights that require urgent attention and systematic integration of gender analysis into mainstream research.","[Doss, Cheryl] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Summerfield, Gale] Univ Illinois, Women & Gender Global Perspect Program, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Summerfield, Gale] Univ Illinois, Dept Human & Community Dev, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Tsikata, Dzodzi] Univ Ghana, ISSER, Legon, Ghana",Yale University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Ghana,"Doss, C (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",cheryl.doss@yale.edu; summrfld@illinois.edu; dzodzit@yahoo.co.uk,,"Doss, Cheryl/0000-0001-8292-3295",,,,,51,29,44,4,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Design/methodology/approach - The approach is survey research based on questionnaire used to assess the communication process within city halls and county councils from Crisana Region. Data from a representative sample were analyzed. Findings-Research results show that there is a significant difference between citizens perceptions and expectations regarding the communication process within city halls and county councils. By analyzing data it was possible to determine citizen satisfaction and to assess the relationship with specific different ethnic features. The results illustrate that on the responsiveness dimension of communication quality, satisfaction is significantly affected by the respondents' belonging to an ethnic group. Research limitations/implications This study focused only on local public administration within Western Romania. Generalisability of results to other servicescapes in public sector remains to be tested. Therefore, further research should investigate the local public communication in other regions with different ethnic groups. Practical implications - In public policy making local public sector managers should recognize the importance of ethnic characteristics and grant weight to ethnic features of the community members they serve. Originality/value-The characteristics of ethnic groups received somewhat less attention from the academic researchers, there is a paucity of academic papers in this area, it has been neglected the relationship among ethnicity, service quality, and customer satisfaction in public sector. This has been identified as a need in the literature. Therefore, this paper presents a framework for evaluating local public communication within multi-ethnic communities. (C) 2014 The Authors.

It is based on two pillars: a network of protected areas and a species protection regime. Implementation of both requirements has been a troublesome and contested undertaking for EU member states, not least because of potentially significant implications for on-going land uses like forestry. Even twenty years after its adoption, the Habitats Directive's political and practical implications continue to be a source of contestation. Domestic implementation is characterised by differentiation and emerging varying practices. This article applies a ground-level perspective explaining differential implementation resulting from the spatially and temporally specific interplay of structure and agency. It moves beyond structural and actor centred accounts applying a strategic-relational perspective. Implementation processes in the UK and Germany are studied comparatively focusing especially on the crucial role of local administrations for specific operationalisations of ambiguous requirements.

The algorithm is inspired from the Gustafson-Kessel (GK) Clustering method in the sense that it identifies clusters of time series in the form of hyper-ellipsoids. The novelty of the algorithm resides in the dynamic search for clusters, depending on the analyzed data, without prior specification of a possible number of clusters. Also, there is no specification of a fixed distance from the cluster centers for points that do not belong to any cluster (noise points). The algorithm was applied to daily stock return data with the scope of establishing how well this technique would identify systemic events in the market that cannot usually be observed through classical statistical methods.

This problem becomes more complicated when the violation of constant error variances comes together with the existence of outliers. The weighted least squares (WLS) procedure is often used to estimate the regression parameters when heteroscedasticity occurs in the data. But there is evidence that the WLS estimators suffer a huge set back in the presence of outliers. Moreover, the use of the WLS requires a known form of the heteroscedastic errors structures. To rectify) this problem, we proposed a new method that we call two-step robust weighted least squares (TSRWLS) method where prior information on the structure of the heteroscedastic errors is not required. In the proposed procedure, the robust technique is used twice. Firstly, the robust weights are used for solving the heteroscedasic error and secondly, the robust weighting function is used for eliminating the effect of outliers. The performance of the newly proposed estimator is investigated extensively by real data sets and Monte Carlo simulations.","[Midi, Habshah; Rana, Sohel] Univ Putra, Inst Math Res, Dept Math, Darul Ehsan, Malaysia; [Imon, A.

Accuracy issues arise even in the short term with consequences for policy. The technique of scenario analysis is increasingly applied in scientific inquiry on the long term but it also has utility in the short term. This paper presents a discussion of the use of forecasts for prediction and proposes integrated or 'hybrid' exploratory qualitative and quantitative scenarios in its stead. Various methodological issues are explored towards formulation of a scenario development process. Integrated scenarios structure thinking on the future, bound uncertainty, document important assumptions, aid communication, widen perspectives, can explore new dynamics and permit exploration of 'softer' issues in development paths such as governance, social and cultural drivers. These can be crucial to outcomes but are not captured by quantitative approaches alone. An example of the technique employed to construct integrated scenarios for Ireland to 2020 is presented, which as a process is applicable with diverse quantitative techniques. The advancement of more broad holistic perspectives on development and processes of change is policy relevant in all states, for which purpose integrated scenarios are an ideal analysis and mainstreaming tool even on short time scales.

It advocates a liquidity perspective that problematizes the capacity for a herd to form because of the absence of sufficient counterparties willing to trade. Drawing on ethnographic interviews with local professional investors in Malaysia (a substantively and theoretically important stock market) the findings are non-intuitive relative to the common-sense expectations of the information asymmetry and identity-based herding literatures. Although locals watch their foreign competitors closely, and therefore could imitate their trades, these small, local finance firms find few reasons to imitate these powerful international actors. Instead, locals enable crowds of foreigners because they are willing to be counterparties even when they perceive the foreigner's trade as savvy, highly skilled or informed. The conclusion explores implications for herding, global capital flows and social structures that may generate liquidity in business-to-business markets.","[Pitluck, Aaron Z.] Illinois State Univ, Normal, IL 61761 USA; [Pitluck, Aaron Z.] Cent European Univ, Polit Econ Res Grp, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Illinois State University; Central European University,"Pitluck, AZ (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Normal, IL 61761 USA.",Aaron.Pitluck@IllinoisState.edu,"Pitluck, Aaron/F-3069-2013; Pitluck, Aaron Z./Q-7155-2019","Pitluck, Aaron/0000-0002-6633-5853;",,,,,73,13,13,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Once the students internalize the content or process, they take full responsibility for controlling the progress of their learning. The temporary scaffolding provided by the teacher is removed to reveal the permanent structure of student understanding. To construct such scaffolding, the approach of using learning portfolios is a more effective tool.

We set up a dynamic model of clean experience goods that replace old polluting consumption options and show how optimal regulation evolves over time. In our base setting where social and private learning incentives coincide, the optimal tax on the polluting consumption is increasing over time. We show, however, that if social and private learning incentives diverge because the private discount rate exceeds the social discount rate, it may be optimal to temporarily increase the tax rate beyond net marginal external damages to induce more learning before reducing the tax rate to the steady state level. Alternatively, one could complement the tax with subsidies for first-time users which can be phased out over time. Similar results apply if consumers have biased expectations. We therefore give a rationale for introductory subsidies on new, clean technologies and non-monotonic tax paths from a perspective of consumer learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Uncertainty about the discount rate is formulated as a decision under Knightian uncertainty. To solve this, we employ minimax regret, a decision criterion that is much less conservative then the related criterion maximin-in particular, it can be shown to implement a proportional response in that it equally balances concern about the mistake of doing too little with that of doing too much. Despite the criterion's balanced nature, the minimax regret solution mimics a policy that maximizes the present discounted value of future net benefits with an effective (certainty-equivalent) discount rate that declines over time to the lowest possible rate. In addition to reinforcing Weitzman's (1998) original limiting result, the approach generates concrete policy advice when decision makers are unable to specify a prior over possible discount rates. We apply it to the Stern-Nordhaus discounting debate and find that the effective discount rate converges to the Stem rate in just under 200 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Such attachments reflect the value these 'things' have in our lives and often are based on cultural (shared) or spiritual (individualistic) meanings. However, there has been relatively little discussion of environmental services that are symbolic, cultural or spiritual. One potential problem created as a by-product of this lack of discussion is that there may be a tendency to inadvertently trivialize the importance of cultural and/or spiritual environmental services. A second problem is that it is essentially inconceivable, at the present time, to consider functioning markets in which such services are traded. In this paper, I explore both of these themes. In terms of addressing the importance of cultural/aesthetic/spiritual values of trees, specifically, occasionally an event occurs that reminds us forcefully that these values are not trivial - indeed, they may be quite sizable - and command our attention as scientists and in policy discussions. The recent poisoning of Auburn University's beloved Toomer's oaks provides a compelling case study. With respect to the absence of markets for cultural/spiritual/aesthetic services, I seek to better understand why markets have emerged for certain environmental services but not for others.

The study objective was to obtain societal preferences in the UK for progression-free and progressive states of late-stage CLL, refractory to current first and second line regimens. Preferences were also obtained for selected treatment-related adverse events (AEs). A utility elicitation study, using the time trade-off (TTO) method, was conducted by face-to-face interviews with 110 subjects for a baseline disease state (before treatment), three primary disease states [progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment responder, PFS and treatment non-responder and disease progression], and 4 AE sub-states (PFS responder with thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and infection, and PFS non-responder with infection). TTO scores were converted into utility values, and disutilities were calculated for AEs. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were obtained. The primary disease state mean TTO utility scores were: baseline: 0.549; PFS response: 0.671; PFS non-response: 0.394; and progression: 0.214. The mean TTO utility (disutility) scores for the AEs were: PFS response with thrombocytopenia, 0.563 (-0.108), neutropenia, 0.508 (-0.163), and infection, 0.476 (-0.195); PFS non-response with infection, 0.333 (-0.061). The VAS results were in line with the TTO results. The utility was higher for the PFS state than baseline, but decreased below baseline in non-response and disease progression states. AEs had an impact on utility within the PFS response state. The severe infection AE had a greater impact on utilities for the responding to treatment state compared to the non-responder state.","[Tolley, Keith] Tolley Hlth Econ, Buxton, England; [Goad, Catherine; Yi, Yunni] Mapi Values, Bollington, Cheshire, England; [Maroudas, Penny; Thompson, Gwilym] GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Haiderali, Amin] GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA USA",GlaxoSmithKline; GlaxoSmithKline,"Haiderali, A (通讯作者)，GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA USA.",amin.m.haiderali@gsk.com,,,,,,,36,56,61,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

One of the consequences of these reforms is a reconfiguration of the patterns of interactions between multiple governance actors, which may create friction as actors with different interests shift positions within the governance structure. These shifts may imply important differences with regards to access to power, information, and flows of benefits from forest resources. In this paper, we explore how forestry decentralization affects the propensity for forest-related conflict among forest governance actors. We draw on qualitative field research from the North Atlantic Autonomous Region of Nicaragua to develop a set of hypotheses about the effect of decentralization on conflict. We argue that decentralization generates conflict and that lack of transparency and accountability in reform processes further contributes to more conflict. We hypothesize that over time, under effective decentralization reforms, increases in both transparency and accountability will lead to a decline in conflict. We then test these hypotheses with empirical data from interviews with local governance actors in Bolivia and Peru, two countries with contrasting degrees of forestry sector decentralization. The quantitative analysis finds that there is no clear relationship between decentralization, transparency or accountability and the prevalence of conflict. These findings lead us to conclude that the prevalence of conflict alone is not a particularly instructive indicator of forest governance performance and suggest that future research should pursue a better understanding of how decentralization may alter the nature of conflicts.

Within this literature, a 'China Threat Theory' has emerged which portrays China as a destabilizing force within global politics and economics. Though originating in Realist accounts, this China Threat Theory has spread across to other approaches, and it increasingly forms the backdrop against which scholarly work positions itself Our article contributes to this debate by examining China's role within the World Trade Organization (WTO). It assesses the extent to which China has been the disruptive power that it is often claimed to be. In particular, the article examines the change identified in Chinese diplomacy around 2008, and argues that this is attributable to the process of learning and socialization that China had to undergo as a new member, coupled with its elevation to a position of decision-making power. Contrary to the China Threat Theory, we find little to suggest that China has adopted an aggressive system challenging mode of behaviour.","[Scott, James] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Wilkinson, Rorden] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Wilkinson, Rorden] Univ Manchester, Brooks World Poverty Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of London; King's College London; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Scott, J (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England.",James.Scott@kcl.ac.uk; Rorden.Wilkinson@Manchester.ac.uk,,"Scott, James/0000-0003-3296-0375; Wilkinson, Rorden/0000-0002-0883-8081",Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University; Henry Luce Foundation,Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University; Henry Luce Foundation,"We are grateful to the Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University and the Henry Luce Foundation for their help in financing the research for this article.

Moreover, it develops a set of hypotheses about how institutions contribute to shape capitals preferences towards pension privatization. In particular, I study the impact of institutional feedback from the public/statutory pay-as-you-go system, from existing private/supplementary occupational pensions and the influence of social partnership. Financial firms are hypothesized to be a key proponent of pension privatization, while employers may have a much more ambivalent attitude.

The aim was to study the effect of time cost of physical exercise on the amount of physical exercise and on health-related quality of life. We used 2-year data (n = 1,292) from a 4-year randomised controlled trial in a population-based sample of Eastern Finnish men and women, 57-78 years of age at baseline, in 2005-2006. In the statistical analysis, physical exercise and health outcomes were assumed to be endogenous variables explained with a set of exogenous variables. The statistical modelling was done by panel data instrumental variable regressions. Health-related quality of life was evaluated by the RAND 36-item survey and motives for exercise with a questionnaire. Joy as the motivation for physical exercise and retirement increased the amount of physical exercise per week (p < 0.001). A higher amount of exercise was associated with physical (p < 0.001) and mental (p < 0.001) components of quality of life. Moreover, a higher amount of physical exercise decreased the metabolic risk factor score (p < 0.001). The motivation and extra time, i.e. retirement, have a significant impact on the time spent on physical exercise (p < 0.001). Our data agree with the theory that high motivation and retirement lower the time cost of physical exercise.

New markets created through the successful commercialization of military technology ('spin-off') goods have a long and profitable history. For instance, the Internet, GPS, lithium ion batteries and wireless communication tools. But although a product works in a military environment there are significant challenges in bringing it successfully to a commercial marketplace. Military-industrial capabilities are focused on having technological superiority over the enemy while cost and price considerations have a much more important role in commercial settings. Successful diversification of radical military innovations into the commercial sphere is difficult to predict, as this involves the development of new concepts with no current examples. Further they also often potentially completely change the marketplace of an industry (such as the case of the music and newspaper industries). This type of innovation frequently involves bringing in technology from one field into another (civil diversification).

The essence of this system to improve the environmental and social responsibility of forestry companies by providing them with additional competitive advantages in the global market. The study demonstrates that, on an international level, the degree of trust in the system is affected by its design features (management structure and organization of the certification process) as well as the expert activities of a number of transnational NGOs and certification bodies. At the same time, at the local level trust in the new system is constructed on interpersonal relationships between the local community and the certified company. The initial foundation of this process is the rational interest of the local community in the new opportunities and resources offered by the system. At the same time, using the new rights, residents gradually begin to adopt new rules and values. This leads to further development of institutional trust and its transformation from the instrumental to the social, based on common shared values. This article identifies and analyzes the general steps undertaken in trust formation toward a new system that are common to all settlements. At the same time, the research has demonstrated the diversity of the communities and of the factors involved in local trust formation in variety of different cases (the economic prosperity of settlements, the availability of local initiatives in the villages, the immediate task of collecting and collating everyone's problems so that they can be resolved through the new system). The research itself has been based on qualitative research methods (semi-structured, participant observation, and analysis of documents), and the data has been collected at Russian forestry enterprises and forest settlements in the period 2007-2009.

Most importantly, this dispute highlights the economic, legal, and statistical importance of sample-selection bias when calculating 'all others' rates for exporters that were not queried during dumping investigations. Sampling is particularly problematic in this dispute since US investigators found only zero and de minimis margins in the administrative reviews, a situation in which the relevant provision of the Anti-Dumping Agreement appears to provide no guidance (an apparent 'lacuna'). The Panel did not directly deal with the key sample-selection issues in the case, and so we provide an alternative legal and statistical analysis. These issues are likely to become more important as the practice of zeroing is phased out in the United States.

New perspectives stemming from the different policies that impinge upon this issue have been gradually incorporated. Complex structural causes that lay behind large wildland fires (LWF) call for the implementation of a number of diverse actions that are contained in different territorial policies. The present paper analyzes some public policies with great incidence on wildland fire management: spatial planning, agricultural and rural development policies, energy and environmental policy. By doing so it focuses on: i) identifying those cross-sectoral policy impacts that influence wildfire prevention and propagation, and ii) assessing the main strengths and weaknesses that these policies have for integrated wildland fire management (IWFM). The analysis of the impact of these policies has been undertaken at the European and Spanish levels, moving then down to the specific implementation problems offered by the case-study of El Solsones in the Catalonian region. The vertical (appropriate territorial level of action) and horizontal (appropriate division of labour between public and private actors) dimensions of the subsidiarity principle are found of utmost importance for IWFM. The local level is where the most important opportunities for synergic actions emerge. However, intrinsic difficulties and procedural limitations linked to LWF seem to be impairing those actual measures which could positively attack the structural causes of fires.

The dispute resulted in a Panel ruling that conforms with earlier Appellate Body decisions outlawing the use of 'weighted average to transaction' zeroing in such reviews. However, we note that the Panel's stance was driven largely from a desire to preserve 'stability and predictability' within the system, suggesting a practical recognition of the shadow of past Appellate Body decisions on the same legal question. In addition, we argue that to understand fully the effects of zeroing, it is important to account for the underlying reasons behind observed price changes in the market. We show that zeroing is more likely to convert a negative dumping determination into a positive one when price changes are driven by variations in demand relative to when they are driven by variations in the cost of exporting. In the present case, Brazilian exporters of orange juice experienced an increase in 9residual) demand for their product since, by reducing the local supply of round oranges, adverse weather conditions in the United States made it difficult for US orange-juice producers to meet local demand.","[Saggi, Kamal] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Wu, Mark] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Vanderbilt University; Harvard University,"Saggi, K (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37212 USA.",k.saggi@vanderbilt.edu; mwu@law.harvard.edu,,,,,,,14,8,8,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2013,12.0,2,,,SI,,377,408,,10.1017/S1474745612000766,0.0,,,32,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,126CZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317590600012,0

However, the evidence on the effect of private tutoring is inconclusive for education researchers and policy makers. Employing a comprehensive dataset collected from China in 2010, this study tries to identify the effect of private tutoring on student achievement in the National College Entrance Exam (NCEE) of China. This study finds that private tutoring has mixed and heterogeneous effects on mathematics, Chinese language, and English language respectively and on the NCEE total score. The average effect of private tutoring is not significant, but it may have a significant and positive effect on urban students with lower achievement or in schools with certain quality. Students from schools with more educational inputs are more likely to benefit from private tutoring. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the authors agree that XBRL could play an important role in financial audit and continuous audit. We turned our attention to the current state of XBRL implementation in Romania, a provisional jurisdiction which is currently examining ways of implementation for XBRL standard. In this context, we proposed a model for using XBRL interactive data during financial audit missions. The model requires a series of financial reports to be tagged in XBRL format (e.g. XBRL application and then uploaded securely on a web portal and stored within a XBRL database.

One of these factors is accepting new blood into the breed, which can be done on basis of knowing origins of single horses and their consecution of their own ancestors. From this point of view, line breeding can be considered a method of selecting the appropriate pair of parents. In our work, we focused on judging various lines by four basic measurements.; The file was then subjected the general linear model and if a statistical signicance was found, a multiple comparison was applied. Our sample consisted of 351 stallions, which were acquired into the studbook of Czech warm-blooded horse between 2009 and 2013. A selection was then performed to omit inadequate data, which lead to narrowing the sample down to 263 stallions. These stallions were then divided into 24 lines and evaluated using statistical methods. Subjecting the sample to general linear model identified statistically significant differences in Tape Withers Height (TWH), Cane Withers Height (CWH), and Shin Circumference (SC). Further tests with multiple comparison method indicated a statistically significant difference of the Shaggy line, which, compared to other lines, showed lower values. This might be caused by a more subtle constitution of these individuals as their ancestors originated from Arab horses. Therefore, Shagya individuals can be considered a line of refiners.","[Kost'ukova, M.; Jiskrova, I; Cernohorska, H.; Bihuncova, I; Oravcova, I] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kost'uková, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",markostuko@centrum.cz,"Jiskrová, Iva/L-2939-2018",,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,226,232,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800039,0

The study shows that relative price of tourism is statistically significant in influencing the demand for tourism by tourists from OECD countries to Malaysia. This reveals that tourists from OECD countries are sensitive to the price changes. As for substitute price in the competing destination, the result proved that Singapore is a substitute destination for Malaysia.

Romania during 2000-2010 had the largest public investment expenditures across European countries as a share of GDP, and in 2011 was ranked second after Poland. But while the share of GDP allocated to public investment in Romania is above the average of EU countries, in the economy these expenditures have been seen too little. Looking at Lisbon Index score, which tracks the performance of member countries to achieve the objectives of the current Lisbon strategy, one can notice that Romania is on the penultimate position, being preceded only by Bulgaria. The explanation for this poor performance in achieving the objectives of development comes from the lack of efficiency with which public money was used in financing investment projects and the low absorption rate of EU fonds; Romania records in 2013 a rate of absorption of structural and cohesion funds of only 13.05%, the lowest among CEE countries.

We use an in-person, on-site survey at seven bay beaches in the state. The analysis is in two stages. The first is a model for predicting the number of visitors at each site over a 12-month period based on an on-site count of visitors. The second is a single-site travel cost model that combines actual and contingent trip data. We estimate the loss for narrowing beaches to a quarter current width at about $5.00 per day at the beach and the gain from widening to twice current width at about $2.75 per day at the beach.

Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) research has developed rapidly and has become a main area of research for dealing with complex decision problems. FAHP, TOPSIS, VIKOR and SAW are used as MCDM techniques in the present study. The proposed method enables decision analysts to better understand the complete evaluation process and provide a more accurate, effective and systematic decision support. In this paper, we study the importance degree of three effective dimensions (human resource, financial and management performance) on productivity improvement and also their sub criteria in state-owned, partially private and private banks in Iran. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is applied for evaluating productivity improvement. TOPSIS, VIKOR and SAW are utilized for ranking the three mentioned banks.

To encourage its recognition and conservation, sustain benefits, this study analyses the place of plant species of NWFPs in household food security in Southern Nigeria. Data were collected from 400 households in Cross River and Enugu States of Southern Nigeria. Descriptive statistics and probit regression were used in data analysis. The study revealed that Bush mango (Irvingia gabonensis and I. wombolu), afang (Gnetum africanum), oil bean (Pentaclatra macrophyla), African mesquite (Prosopis africana) and bread fruit (Treculia africana) were the plant species producing NWFPs that were mostly used by the respondents. NWFP appeared in the meals of the households for 43.20% of the time. The daily documentation of meals showed that gang and Bush mango appeared mostly in meals of the households. Income from bread fruit (N27,116.67) was the highest, while the lowest (N15,000) income was from African bush pear and African star apple respectively. Household size, medium wealth, respondent being a civil servant and respondent being in business positively and significantly increase the likelihood of utilization of plant species of NWFPs. The high dependence of households on NWFPs and the high percentage of its appearance in meals justify increased attention by policy makers and inclusion in the national accounting framework in Nigeria.

They highlight the distinction between the public and private sectors in this respect, contrasting the former's very limited scope for integrative bargaining in the face of mounting budget deficits and austerity with the latter's (initially) more balanced trade-offs between cost competitiveness and maintenance of employment and wages, especially in countries with coordinated bargaining systems.

In the pooled European sample and in some individual countries, older immigrants use from 13 to 20% more health services than native-borns after demographic characteristics are controlled. After controlling for the need for health care, differences between immigrants and native-borns in the use of physicians, but not hospitals, are reduced by about half. These are not changed much with the incorporation of indicators of socioeconomic status and extra insurance coverage.

Deducing from these data the value of the good (or bad) at the core of the program - the welfare gain generated by a parcel of conserved land, for instance, or the loss incurred by a species invasion - often is not possible because respondent preferences are conflated with their expectations about future environmental outcomes in the absence of the program. This paper formally demonstrates this conundrum in the context of a standard contingent valuation survey, and examines the use of additional survey data to resolve it. The application is to the prevention of lake invasions by Eurasian Watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), an invasive aquatic plant that is present in many lakes in the northern U.S. and Canada and a possible threat to many more. Respondents are shoreline property owners on lakes without Eurasian Watermilfoil. The estimated per-property welfare loss of a lake invasion is $30,550 for one model and $23,614 for another, both of which are in reasonable agreement with estimates obtained from a recent hedonic analysis of Eurasian Watermilfoil invasions in the study area Mb and from a companion contingent valuation survey of shoreline property owners on already-invaded lakes.

The ritual and precinct of the Sajik of Joseon dynasty, were analyzed from the perspective of sylvanism, the reverence of grandiose tall tree and forest. Institutionalized sylvanism comprised sylvanic tree, precinct, rituals, and mode of thinking. Dan-tree represents a sacred tree tradition that has been institutionalized into the ritual and precinct in the Manchuro-Korean region, while Sa-tree that of China Proper. Dantree was the sylvanic tree in the Dangun narrative and institutionalized in the mythical kingdom of Dangun Joseon. However, Dan-tree in the Dangun narrative was depicted in some Koguryo mural paintings. Dan-tree is a fruit-bearing broadleaved tree species and it appears to be Manchurian walnut (Juglans manschurica). A special bow made of Dan-wood was produced by the Ye people. Koguryo and its preceding kingdom (Biryu) had the sylvanic precincts at least before the 1st century BC, which were equivalent to the Sajik precincts in China Proper. The roles of Dan-tree and its precincts of later Joseon appear to have inherited into Hahn's sodo in the midland and southern part of Korean peninsula. Sa-tree contains different tree species in ancient kingdoms in China Proper. It was pine (Pinus massoniana) for the mythical Xia, cypress (Platycladus or Thuja orientalis) for Shang (Yin), and chestnut (Castanea mollisima) for Zhou. Sa-institution contains tree species, precinct, rituals, and mode of thinking. It incorporated Jik, the crop god, during the Zhou period. The succeeding kingdoms and empires in China Proper maintained the Zhou tradition (Sajik) with the priority of Sa over Jik. The sylvanic mode of thinking and the precinct landscaping in the Manchuro-Korean tradition are embedded at the base of the royal Sajik precinct of Joseon dynasty and the Great Sajik Ritual conducted by modern Koreans. A culturalist strategy was established for transforming the ancient values of sylvanic trees into some modernized environmental and cultural values. The culturo-natural legacy of the sylvanic trees and forests are the cultural capital available for forest and environmental conservation and afforestation in Northeast Asia. And they can also be subjected to the relevant development of environmental history and forest philosophy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings show that both types of institutions were informed about which firms would implement the share structure reform in the next batch of reform. Foreign institutions bought even more shares than domestic ones in the days closely preceding reform announcements. Furthermore, both of them traded aggressively with large trades to profit from their private information. We can calculate the impact of large buy trades initiated by foreign and domestic institutional investors in each day. The impact increased in days before the Share Structure Reform for both foreign and domestic institutional investors.

In addition to the relatively unexploited cross-country framework, our main contribution resides in the search for heterogeneous responses of trade to migration according to different goods typologies. Besides the usual distinction between homogeneous and differentiated products dictated by the information channel, we also investigate the effects of migration on trade in primary and final goods and in labor- and capital-intensive goods with the aim of assessing the preference and technology channels as well. Our results show that, as expected, migration enhances the import of primary and final goods (preference channel) and the export of differentiated, low elasticity of substitution goods (information channel).

Using both qualitative and quantitative analysis, this paper demonstrates how a minor term for the future, primarily used in Buddhist contexts in pre-modern society, has become the dominant term in modern China and Korea. This shift reflects the unique historical experiences of each East Asian country, including its encounters with the West. Finally, this paper examines how the usage of these two terms for the future expresses the hierarchical structure of the East Asian view of the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

China's FDI regime is specifically compared with that of the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Other countries (France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, and Switzerland) were also included in the discussion to evaluate their regulatory and investment issues. By using interdisciplinary literature, secondary data, and research surveys and reports from multilateral institutions, the study investigates the changing profile of FDI regimes in world trade. The paper reveals that China's FDI regime has embraced significant changes to attract foreign investment. Currently, the Chinese market is open yet restricted in its own regulatory environment and institutional hurdles. Investment regimes in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom continue to change to attract foreign investment that is critical to their economies. We believe that more country- and industry-specific studies are needed to investigate FDI regimes and their institutional frameworks. In today's world trade, China is particularly an interesting case study since the country aggressively attracts foreign investment while keeping its hybrid economy. Policymakers, multinational corporations (MNCs), governments, and researchers need to pay attention to today's changing FDI regimes because of growth opportunities and MNC expansion. The study provides useful discussion and meaningful implications that can be used by policy analysts and practitioners worldwide.","West Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, Canyon, TX USA",Texas A&M University System; West Texas A&M University,"Anwar, ST (通讯作者)，West Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, Canyon, TX USA.",sanwar@mail.wtamu.edu,,,,,,,202,8,8,1,35,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In recent years, European Union policies gave impetus to a large area of new cork oak plantations, which have been established mainly for cork production purposes, and consequently with higher stand density than traditional agroforestry systems. These plantations are important not only for cork production but also for the carbon sequestered by these slow growing forests that won't be harvested for wood production. Thinning operations will be needed to avoid excessive inter-tree competition and wood extracted from these thinning may also provide income for the owners. In the present study, carbon sequestered and wood volumes resulting from thinning were estimated for the next 70 years. Three scenarios of different annual afforestation rates and different site indexes were tested. The resulting values for the considered scenarios show that, if the plantation rates are maintained, new cork oak plantations will have an important contribution to the Portuguese commitments to providing CO2 offsets under the Kyoto protocol. Additionally, due to the increasing values of initial density in new cork plantations, cork oak forests will produce a significant volume of wood that may become an important contribution to the landowners' income.

To do so, we consider intellectual property laws within the context of wider changes in capitalism, focusing on two main historical phases: first, the period covering the formation and development of ocorporate capitalism' dominated by large corporations and then the new phase, which opened up in the 1980s, marked by the rise to power of finance. From a perspective of institutional complementarities, we seek to show how the characteristics and implications of patent regimes can only be understood in relation to changes in the main institutional forms of capitalism: forms of the firm, the status of labour (the owage-labour nexus') and market forms.","[Coriat, Benjamin; Weinstein, Olivier] Univ Paris 13, CEPN, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",Universite Paris 13,"Coriat, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, CEPN, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",coriat@club-internet.fr,,,,,,,51,15,19,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Notwithstanding ASEAN's emerging centrality in Asian regionalism, America remains the only Pacific power that has not concluded any form of FTA with ASEAN This article explains that limited progress in Washington's efforts stemmed from the domestic politics of the US Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) approach and the Myanmar dilemma. It further analyses the challenges that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement negotiations have encountered and contends that the TPP cannot be a substitute for a US-ASEAN FTA. Finally, a 'Plan B' roadmap to reinvigorate US-ASEAN trade ties is proposed. This roadmap calls for an enhanced TIFA that incorporates the building block features of ASEAN's framework agreements, thereby laying a solid yet gradual foundation for an FTA. This research therefore provides a valuable study of a region-based FTA under the multilateral trading system.","[Hsieh, Pasha L.] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Law, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Hsieh, PL (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Law, Singapore, Singapore.",pashahsieh@smu.edu.sg,"HSIEH, Pasha Li Tian/E-6663-2013","HSIEH, Pasha/0000-0002-3439-8120",,,,,94,1,2,0,17,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

During the last years, many universities have undertaken activities for implementing Higher Education for Sustainable Development (HESD). Many have asked which key competencies are most relevant for sustainable development and hence should be developed in future-oriented higher education. Different approaches for the selection of sustainability key competencies have been developed, but there is little international agreement in the debate around the most important key competencies. Consequently, this paper asks which individual key competencies are crucial for understanding central challenges facing the world society and for facilitating its development towards a more sustainable future, and thus identifies those competencies which should be fostered through university teaching and learning. The empirical design of the study is related to a Delphi study in which 'sustainability key competencies' are defined by selected experts from Europe (Germany, Great Britain) and Latin America (Chile, Ecuador, Mexico). The results show that twelve key competencies crucial for sustainable development can be identified; the most relevant ones are those for systemic thinking, anticipatory thinking and critical thinking.

The proposed study analyzes the main properties of Reny's entropy estimated for 139,671 intra-day observations on USD/CAD exchange rate over various time scales.

Recent work on hypoxia develops a bioeconomic model to harness microdata and quantify the effects of hypoxia on North Carolina's brown shrimp fishery. This work finds that hypoxia is responsible for a 12.9% decrease in NC brown shrimp catches from 1999-2005 in the Neuse River Estuary and Pamlico Sound, assuming that vessels do not react to changes in abundance. The current article extends this work to explore the full economic consequences of hypoxia on the supply and demand for brown shrimp. Demand analysis reveals that the NC shrimp industry is too small to influence prices, which are driven entirely by imports and other domestic U.S. harvest. Thus, demand is flat and there are no measurable benefits to shrimp consumers from reduced hypoxia. On the supply side, we find that the shrimp fleet responds to variation in price, abundance, and weather Hence, the supply curve has some elasticity. Producer benefits of reduced hypoxia are less than a quarter of the computed gains from assuming no behavioral adjustment.","[Huang, Ling] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Nichols, Lauren A.

Nowadays is our society living in knowledge age where the knowledge create one of the most valuable capital and powerful competitive advantage of companies. The depreciation of knowledge or the inappropriate system of transfer leads to noticeable decrease of achievement of multinational corporations. Top manager represents the bearer of knowledge of any company and plays the key role in communications and transfers of knowledge flows. Therefore the replacing on this level of management reacts very sensitive about any change. Transfer of knowledge at this level of management is extremely important because improper transfers or loss leads from increase of entropy in company and reduction of objectives to the dysfunction. Final recommendations of this paper will allow managers to adapt to a new position with minimal time loss and assists in strategic succession planning conductive sustainability of competitive. This paper reflects the need of MNC's to investigate the unsatisfactory situation of damage essential knowledge in one of the most crucial moment of leading. The research was aimed at the following questions: What is the most critical moment of the transfer of knowledge? Does the usage the services interim manager constitute an appropriate means to simplify the transfer of knowledge? This research was conducted in carefully selected multination companies with branch offices in two foreign countries at minimum. The data collection derives from the systematic literature review, questionnaires and the guided interviews with representatives of the above organizations, during the period since September 2011 to December 2011. The gained data have been discussed and verified. The results were interpreted in an exploratory manner. Based on the survey a set of principles with short recommendations was proposed.

ITQs were originally proposed to enhance profitability and safety, but may also provide incentives for more conservation-minded fishing practices. Indeed, recent empirical evidence shows a reduction in the likelihood of stock collapse and a threefold increase in catches two decades after ITQ implementation. Yet these spectacular catch increases follow modest 20% reductions in reported catches. We used standard fisheries models to analyze whether these catch trends are consistent with the theory underlying conservation benefits from property rights. We find that it appears unlikely that catch increases are attributable to ITQs alone. Improved catch reporting systems are often enacted concurrent with ITQs and may plausibly explain sustained catch increases. The existence of this alternative explanation warrants caution about claims that property rights are the cause of sustainable catch gains.","[Nowlis, Josh; Van Benthem, Arthur A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Nowlis, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jsnowlis@stanford.edu; arthurvb@stanford.edu,,"van Benthem, Arthur/0000-0002-1028-9464",,,,,29,9,11,1,20,"MRE FOUNDATION, INC",KINGSTON,"PO BOX 1828, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA",0738-1360,,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The study argues that despite ostensibly universal assumptions about human behavior and alleged objectivity, the theoretical foundations of neoclassical economics and its methodological formalism fall short in providing an alternative to culturalism, and, instead, reinforce the misperceptions and misunderstandings about the region.","[Cavdar, Gamze] Colorado State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Yasar, Yavuz] Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO USA",Colorado State University; University of Denver,"Çavdar, G (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",gcavdar2005@yahoo.com; yyasar@du.edu,,,,,,,91,9,11,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The paper discusses the effects of the March 2012 coup and its aftermath on the state and how these changes trickled down to local institutions in the rural commune of Yallankoro-Soloba. During that same period, technological advances in the commune's ASM sector increased local investment and improved profitability in ASM activities. As the state withdrew financial support from the commune government and social services, local government officials, medical services, educational institutions and local populations were able to capitalize on these ASM-generated revenues. The research finds that Mali suffers from the same ASM formalization problems as other mineral rich countries in the region. What makes Mali's situation unique is that ASM has become a critical rural industry which is not only supplying much needed income to rural people, but also serving to informally fund social institutions from the bottom up during a time of national crisis. Local government officials are stuck in limbo between the state which provides them with legitimacy and ASM which supports their communes' population and institutions. The paper concludes that even as Mali begins its recovery, there are urgent needs to formalize rural ASM. If formalization actions are delayed, technological advances will make formalization even more difficult and enable institutions and local officials to become increasingly detached from the fragile central government.

This paper also shows the positive relationship between option proceeds and stock repurchases in the stagnant stage of that cycle.

Meeting the industrial requirements for a stable roundwood supply has traditionally dominated the services targeted at them, but changes such as urbanization and a higher level of education have diversified the NIPF owners' service demands. Therefore, it seems that the traditional 'roundwood supply approach' may no longer match the service needs of all customer groups. Based on the concept of service-dominant logic, the empirical objective is to better understand the challenges presented by the ongoing market renewal in Finnish and Swedish forestry services. Using a qualitative approach and data from 17 thematic expert interviews carried out within Swedish and Finnish forestry service organisations, we aimed to identify potential opportunities and barriers with respect to creating new services in NIPF owner markets. According to the results, concentrated markets dominated by a small number of players are challenging the surroundings for new enterprises to evolve in. The lack of dynamic middle-sized companies in the sector coupled with difficulties in adopting a more cooperative mindset is proving to be hindrances. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, through the use of a survey and in-depth interviews, we examine features of everyday life for Newstart recipients in the Sydney area, experiences that reveal the scarring potential of low benefits. The article illustrates that for a majority of interview participants, the most basic items were difficult to purchase and many of the interviewees were living in inadequate and even unsafe situations owing to an inability to afford satisfactory accommodation. For some, their lack of disposable income had severe health implications. Social isolation was a common phenomenon, and many of the interviewees found that the low payment made finding employment a lot more challenging.","[Morris, Alan] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Sociol, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Wilson, Shaun] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; Macquarie University,"Morris, A (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Local Govt, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",alan.morris@uts.edu.au,,"Wilson, Shaun/0000-0003-4687-1824; Morris, Alan/0000-0001-7652-5370",,,,,46,33,35,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Biosimilar infliximab is first being marketed in the Central and Eastern European countries. This paper presents the estimated budget impact of the introduction of biosimilar infliximab in RA over a 3-year time period in six selected countries, namely Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. A prevalence-based model was constructed for budget impact analysis. Two scenarios were compared to the reference scenario (RSc) where no biosimilar infliximab is available: biosimilar scenario 1 (BSc1), where interchanging the originator infliximab with biosimilar infliximab is disallowed, and only patients who start new biological therapy are allowed to use biosimilar infliximab; as well as biosimilar scenario 2 (BSc2), where interchanging the originator infliximab with biosimilar infliximab is allowed, and 80 % of patients treated with originator infliximab are interchanged to biosimilar infliximab. Compared to the RSc, the net savings are estimated to be (sic)15.3 or (sic)20.8 M in BSc1 and BSc2, respectively, over the 3 years. If budget savings were spent on reimbursement of additional biosimilar infliximab treatment, approximately 1,200 or 1,800 more patients could be treated in the six countries within 3 years in the two biosimilar scenarios, respectively. The actual saving is most sensitive to the assumption of the acquisition cost of the biosimilar drug and to the initial number of patients treated with biological therapy. The study focused on one indication (RA) and demonstrated that the introduction of biosimilar infliximab can lead to substantial budget savings in health care budgets. Further savings are expected for other indications where biosimilar medicines are implemented.","[Brodszky, Valentin; Baji, Petra; Balogh, Orsolya; Pentek, Marta] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Pentek, Marta] Flor Ferenc Cty Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, H-2143 Kistarcsa, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Brodszky, V (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",valentin.brodszky@uni-corvinus.hu,"Brodszky, Valentin/AFN-4112-2022; Péntek, Márta/HTQ-3097-2023; Baji, Petra/JHV-1617-2023","Brodszky, Valentin/0000-0002-6095-2295; Péntek, Márta/0000-0001-9636-6012; Baji, Petra/0000-0003-2899-8557",,,,,12,96,101,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In envisioning the world at 2050, we envisaged future growth in four possible directions: growth without limits, growth within limits, stagnation, and New Welfare. The scenario considered as preferable reflects a transition toward a New Welfare, characterized by a high level of cooperation, heightened concern for the environment and for social welfare, and an increased share of immaterial consumption. This scenario is based on the recognition that the development of new technologies although relevant turns out to be insufficient to resolve the issue of resource scarcity alone. Important behavioral changes are also needed. In the New Welfare scenario, GDP as a measure of growth becomes obsolete and needs to be replaced with ways of measuring progress that are more reflective of natural, human, and social capital. The New Welfare scenario also charts a pathway toward a low-carbon future, with an overall reduction in energy consumption, density, and intensity, and a greatly reduced reliance on fossil fuels. A new, smart electric grid facilitates active demand management and decentralized production of power. Natural gas or even small nuclear plants tackle problems associated with the intermittency of renewable energy sources. Among other likely shifts under this scenario is a re-conceptualization of production, from short-lived to longer-lasting goods and from private to open source knowledge products and services; growth in recycling and zero-waste processes; and a shift from profit-driven business to entrepreneurship that seeks to satisfy social needs and build local capital. The world undergoes a transition from unequal growth to prosperity in a multi-polar, globally interdependent world. New global democracy networks and institutions are created, and constitutions extend beyond the protection of human rights to the recognition of nature rights. Citizens' income is tied to the social welfare-oriented duties and participatory governance. This scenario further leaves room to new forms of self-regulation of common resources. Actions necessary for the shift to the New Welfare paradigm include the adoption of new metrics for measuring progress, measures to increase public acceptance of technological and societal change, the creation of new global and local institutions devoted to sustainable management of shared environmental resources, sustainable production and consumption patterns, and a low-carbon energy and transport systems.

This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of common bariatric surgical procedures from a healthcare system perspective. Methods We evaluated the three most common bariatric surgical procedures in the US: laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB), conventional (open) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (ORYGB), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) compared to no surgery. The reference case was defined as a 53-year old female with body mass index (BMI) of 44 kg/m(2). We developed a two-part model using a deterministic approach for the first 5-year period postsurgery and separate empirical forecasts for the natural history of BMI, costs and outcomes in the remaining years. We used a combination of datasets including Medicare and MarketScan (R) together with estimates from the literature to populate the model. Results Bariatric surgery produced additional life expectancy (80-81 years) compared to no surgery (78 years). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the surgical procedures were US $ 6,600 per quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY) gained for LRYGB, US $ 6,200 for LAGB, and US $ 17,300 for ORYGB (3 % discount rate for cost and QALYs). ICERs varied according to choice of BMI forecasting method and clinically plausible variation in parameter estimates. In most scenarios, the ICER did not exceed a threshold of US $ 50,000 per QALY gained.","[Wang, Bruce C.

J,"Wilkinson, GR; Schofield, M; Kanowski, P",,,,"Wilkinson, Graham R.; Schofield, Mick; Kanowski, Peter",,,Regulating forestry - Experience with compliance and enforcement over the 25 years of Tasmania's forest practices system,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,Compliance; Forest practices; Forest regulation; Tasmania,GOVERNANCE,"Tasmania's forest practices system, one of the most prescriptive globally and the most comprehensive in Australia, has evolved over the last 25 years in response to public demands for high standards of governance, accountability and transparency of forest regulation on both public and private lands. The system was developed in the context of strong contestation, in Tasmanian and Australian civil society and politics, about appropriate forest policies and practices in Tasmania. The system is governed by a Forest Practices Act, which provides for a co-regulatory approach administered by an independent statutory body, the Forest Practices Authority. All forest operations must be undertaken in accordance with a certified forest practices plan, prepared and certified by accredited Forest Practices Officers employed by forest managers. These co-regulatory components of the system are supported by independent monitoring and enforcement by the Forest Practices Authority. This paper describes the genesis and evolution of the Tasmanian forest practices system, and summarises the range of measures employed to foster high levels of compliance, with an emphasis on training and education, self-monitoring and reporting by the industry, independent monitoring by the Forest Practices Authority, and corrective actions, backed by enforcement provisions. Compliance monitoring over 27 years demonstrates rapid improvement in the decade following establishment of the system, with consistently high levels of achievement subsequently. However, larger corporate forest managers consistently achieve higher rates of compliance than do small-scale forest owners, and redressing this imbalance has been a recurrent theme in Tasmania's forest practices system. Experience of implementation of Tasmania's forest practices system suggests that well-designed and implemented co-regulatory approaches, with high levels of transparency, can be effective in delivery of good technical standards of forest practices and high levels of compliance. However, these will not in themselves mitigate public concern about forest management practices unless the policies governing those practices have broad support in civil society.

First, we confirm that a competitive market environment, a well-functioning legal system, and greater bank loans for non-state-sector firms promote the development of trade credit in China. Conversely, corruption hinders its development. Second, we find that proper functioning of the legal system and bank lending to non-state-sector firms are highly likely to be the causes of the complex relationships between these determinants. Finally, we observe that an increase in the number of lawyers effectively improves the quality and function of the legal system, which, in turn, alleviates the harmful influence of corruption on trade credit development.","[Yano, Go] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kyoto, Japan; [Shiraishi, Maho] Univ Kitakyushu, Fac Foreign Studies, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan",Kyoto University; University of Kitakyushu,"Yano, G (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kyoto, Japan.",rswtj922@yahoo.co.jp; mshira@kitakyu-u.ac.jp,"YANO, Go/AAH-4186-2019","YANO, Go/0000-0002-0187-627X; Shiraishi, Maho/0000-0002-5223-8788",,,,,46,4,6,0,20,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

China has become the largest roundwood importer worldwide, with annual spending on imports over $10 billion and the share in total world exports up to 38%. In this study, a Rotterdam demand system is employed to assess China's roundwood import demand by supplying source and product type between 1995 and 2012. Major findings are that the average expenditure share of China between 1995 and 2012 is 36% for coniferous roundwood, 17% for tropical roundwood, and 38% for other nonconiferous roundwood. China's imports have become diversified with more roundwood suppliers, including Russia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Gabon, and the United States. The estimates of expenditure and own-price elasticities for coniferous roundwood are small for most supplying sources. There is little competition within the coniferous roundwood group, but substitute or complementary relations exist across the four product groups by source. These findings are helpful for policymakers, industrial firms, and environmental groups to evaluate the impact of China's strong roundwood demand on economic development and environmental protection on a global scale.

These are strong indications that salmon supply chains are developing in the same direction as supply chains for more processed food products. In this article we investigate to what extent this development has influenced the price transmission process for two product forms: a relatively unprocessed one (fresh fillets) and a more processed one (smoked salmon). Results indicate that the supply chain for fresh fillets can still be characterized by a high degree of price transmission. On the contrary, the hypothesis of full price transmission for smoked salmon is rejected.","[Asche, Frank; Dahl, Roy E.; Zhang, Dengjun] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Valderrama, Diego] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",Frank.Asche@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728; Valderrama, Diego/0000-0003-1497-2954; Dahl, Roy Endre/0000-0002-1874-795X",Norwegian Seafood Research Fund; Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Seafood Research Fund; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),The authors would like to thank the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund and Norwegian Research Council for financial support.,,79,40,42,1,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

This paper examines whether gold is an effective hedge instrument against the inflation and the currency risk of Turkish Lira against U.S. Dollar using the monthly data from February 1986 to June 2013. We in this study employ new generation Kapetanios (2005) unit root and Maki (2012) cointegration tests allowing unknown number of breaks that are determined endogenously. This method is regarded as superior to previous cointegration tests because it considers all economic crises over the long run and all developments that cause the radical changes in the economy. Our findings show that gold is indeed an effective investment tool to hedge against the risks of inflation and currency risks. We therefore conclude that it is always rational to include gold for a well-diversified portfolio.,"[Sarac, Mehmet] Sakarya Univ, Dept Business Adm, Adapazari, Turkey; [Zeren, Feyyaz] Namik Kemal Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tekirdag, Turkey",Sakarya University; Namik Kemal University,"Saraç, M (通讯作者)，Sakarya Univ, Dept Business Adm, Adapazari, Turkey.",msarac@sakarya.edu.tr; feyyazzeren@hotmail.com,"SARAÇ, Mehmet/AAE-4697-2020",,,,,,29,3,3,0,14,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The paper presents actual aspects of consumers' behaviour in the EU and Latvia making environmentally conscious purchases. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to analyse the aspects of consumers' behaviour and the factors that influence consumers' behaviour making environmentally conscious purchases. The study is based on the review of the European Commission's documents on statistical data available from the European Commission's Analytical reports, Eurostat and the EU Consumer Conditions Scoreboard conducted in 2008-2012. Descriptive method and secondary data analysis was applied in the study. Environmentally conscious consumers, in general, are socially conscious and educated consumers in the 25-54 age groups with better knowledge of consumer rights. Women are more likely to consider environmental impact than men are. Although most consumers are willing to pay a small premium for green products if they believe the products are healthier, safer, or better for the environment, the research results show that 33% of the respondents in the EU think that environmentally friendly goods and services are too expensive. The price level of environmentally friendly goods and services for Latvian consumers is even more important, comparing with almost all the EU countries. Product's labelling, information as a whole and the information's credibility play dominant role in consumers' decision-making process making environmentally conscious purchases.","[Spakovica, Evelina; Moskvins, Genadijs] Latvia Univ Agr, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Spakovica, E (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Riga, Latvia.",evelina.spakovica@llu.lv,"MOSKVINS, Genādijs/JBJ-4697-2023","MOSKVINS, Genādijs/0000-0002-2912-6809",,,,,9,0,0,1,15,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-2-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,35,,,,,25,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347133500002,0

The choice of invoicing currency will affect prices in different markets as well as risk, factors that are increasingly important as the supply chain for salmon is becoming more sophisticated and more transactions mechanisms are introduced. The results indicate that destination-specific market characteristics have impacts as to the choice of invoicing strategy. Norwegian salmon exporters primarily invoice in the export market currency (47% of the exported quantity), but also use a vehicle currency and producer pricing (19%) in a significant number of transactions. The euro is the preferred vehicle currency (18%), closely followed by the US dollar (USD) (16%).

Initially the analysis is pitched at a rather abstract and theoretical level - pulling together artisans, nomads and partisans and tracing their intellectual lineages. But the chapter ends with three very concrete illustrations of actual financial relations in practice that meet some of the criteria for being both artisanal and partisanal.","[Thompson, Grahame] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Thompson, G (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark.",gt.dbp@cbs.dk,,,,,,,78,7,7,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The paper outlines a case involving a team of user-centred designers as they envision, construct and demonstrate a wearable technology to intervene in public health warnings concerning obesity. The paper examines various co-becomings of users and technology through the course of a two-stage development cycle and employs the heuristic distinction between 'distal' and 'proximal' users as means to examine the different definitions of obesity occasioned therein. The term 'inventive risk discourse' is coined to describe the designers' articulation of the problem space of obesity as a future figuring putative users. Examples of proximal users are then discussed as users involved in the various enactments of the prototype system as it is programmed and assembled in the present. The implications of this are discussed in terms of the specific definitions of obesity that concresce around particular prototype-user assemblages as well as indicators of overspill that often exceed normative accounts. In conclusion, I consider the case as a rough cosmopolitical sketch where designers engage obesity science as inventive problem making where multiple empirical variations of obesity emerge.","[Wilkie, Alex] Univ London, Goldsmiths, Dept Design, Lewisham Way, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Wilkie, A (通讯作者)，Univ London, Goldsmiths, Dept Design, Lewisham Way, London SE14 6NW, England.",a.wilkie@gold.ac.uk,"Wilkie, Alex/HKO-1697-2023",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021512/2] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J021512/2] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,61,14,14,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

In particular, we are interested in: child cognitive development at ages 11, 14 and 16; intentions towards tertiary education; economic activity in early adulthood; a group of non-cognitive outcomes such as risky health behaviour; and personality traits. Using matching methods to control for a very rich set of child and family characteristics, we find evidence that pre-school childcare moderately improves results in cognitive tests at age 11 and 14, and 16. Positive effects are especially noticeable for girls and children from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds. Results for non-cognitive outcomes are weaker: we do not find any significant evidence of improvement in psychological well-being, petty crime involvement, or on almost all health behaviours. While the cognitive effects may well serve to reduce lifecycle inequalities there is no support here for other important social benefits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using rich data on students, teachers, and schools in Florida, we estimate teacher effectiveness based on repeated test scores reported at the student level for each teacher over time. Among all teachers, those in charter schools appear more likely to exit the profession than those in the traditional public sector, and in both sectors the least effective teachers are more likely to exit than their more effective counterparts. Few of these relationships appear evident for within- or between-district transfers, and there are no differential relationships between effectiveness and attrition in the charter sector. We interpret these results as indicating that whatever administrative or organizational differences may exist in charter schools, they do not necessarily translate into a discernible difference in the ability to dismiss poorly performing teachers.","[Cowen, Joshua M.] Univ Kentucky, Martin Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Winters, Marcus A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Leadership Res & Fdn, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA",University of Kentucky; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,"Cowen, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Martin Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",joshuacowen@uky.edu; mwinters@uccs.edu,,,,,,,59,14,27,1,63,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

A complication of HZ is long-term persistence of pain after the rash has resolved (so-called postherpetic neuralgia, PHN). We aimed to describe the epidemiology of HZ/PHN and to estimate HZ/PHN-related costs in the German statutory health insurance (SHI) system (similar to 85 % of the total population). Treatment data of one large SHI was utilized, containing data on approximately 240,000 insured and their utilisation of services in 2004-2009. Identification of HZ- and PHN-cases was performed based on 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases' and specific medications using a control-group design. Incidences per 1,000 person-years (PY) and cost-of-illness for 1 year following HZ-onset considering the payer and societal perspective were calculated. All amounts were inflated to 2010 Euros. Population-figures were standardised and extrapolated to the total SHI-population in Germany in 2010. A mean annual incidence of 5.79 HZ-cases per 1,000 PY was observed, translating into an estimated 403,625 HZ-cases per year in the total SHI-population. Approximately 5 % of HZ-cases developed PHN. One HZ-case caused on average a,not sign210 and a,not sign376 of costs from the payer and societal perspective, respectively. The development of PHN generated additional costs of a,not sign1,123 (a,not sign1,645 societal perspective). Total annual HZ/PHN-related costs were estimated at a,not sign182 million (a,not sign105 million) to society (payer). HZ and PHN place a considerable burden on the German SHI-system. Since HZ-vaccines will soon be available, a health-economic evaluation of these vaccines should be conducted.","[Ultsch, Bernhard; Siedler, Anette; Wichmann, Ole] Robert Koch Inst, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Immunisat Unit, D-13086 Berlin, Germany; [Ultsch, Bernhard] Univ Med Ctr, Charite, Berlin, Germany; [Koester, Ingrid; Schubert, Ingrid] Univ Cologne, PMV Res Grp, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Reinhold, Thomas] Univ Med Ctr, Charite, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Krause, Gerard] Robert Koch Inst, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Berlin, Germany; [Krause, Gerard] Helmholtz Ctr Infect Res, Dept Epidemiol, Braunschweig, Germany; [Icks, Andrea] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Epidemiol & Biometry, German Diabet Ctr, Dusseldorf, Germany",Robert Koch Institute; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; University of Cologne; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Robert Koch Institute; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research; Deutsches Diabetes-Zentrum (DDZ); Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Ultsch, B (通讯作者)，Robert Koch Inst, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Immunisat Unit, DGZ Ring 1, D-13086 Berlin, Germany.",UltschB@rki.de,,"Reinhold, Thomas/0000-0001-5169-7029; Wichmann, Ole/0000-0003-2353-7188; Krause, Gerard/0000-0003-3328-8808; Schubert, Ingrid/0000-0002-2191-1773",,,,,63,52,53,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

A BENEFIT/COST ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM,EDUCATION FINANCE AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RETURNS,"School voucher programs have become a prominent aspect of the education policy landscape in the United States. The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program is the only federally funded voucher program in the United States. Since 2004 it has offered publicly funded private school vouchers to nearly four thousand students to attend any of seventy-three different private schools in Washington, DC. An official experimental evaluation of the program, sponsored by the federal government's Institute of Education Sciences, found that the students who were awarded Opportunity Scholarships graduated from high school at a rate 12 percentage points higher than the students in the randomized control group. This article estimates the benefit/cost ratio of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, primarily by considering the increased graduation rate that it induced and the estimated positive economic returns to increased educational attainment. We find a benefit to cost ratio of 2.62, or $2.62 in benefits for every dollar spent on the program.","[Wolf, Patrick J.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Educ Reform, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [McShane, Michael] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Wolf, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Educ Reform, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",pwolf@uark.edu; michaelgmcshane@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,10,14,0,63,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Astonishingly, in 2006 the government announced that this area, encompassing one fifth of the country's confirmed oil reserves, would be left indefinitely untapped if the international community contributed at least half of the revenue that the extraction of this oil would generate. Given Ecuador's oil dependency, this seems to be a riddle. Using a case study approach, this article applies concepts of discourse research to examine how the Yasuni-ITT project came about. It is shown how discursive elements related to indigenous peoples' rights, biodiversity conservation and climate change were drawn together and triggered a discontinuity in the dominant tradition of oil extraction. The specific socio-historical context in which these interwoven story-lines were inserted into formal politics is examined. Finally, a discussion is presented assessing the underlying discursive mechanisms that contributed to gaining government support as well as the institutionalization difficulties faced by the oil-moratorium.

We find students with disabilities whose teacher is certified in special education have greater achievement in both math and reading than similar students whose teacher is not special-education certified. However, students without disabilities experience slightly lower achievement when taught by a special-education certified teacher. In-service professional development has no effect on the value-added of teachers in special education courses, but non-disabled students whose regular education teachers received special education training exhibit modestly higher achievement. Similarly, the gain in effectiveness associated with teacher experience is greater for teachers of regular education courses than for teachers of special education courses. Teachers with advanced degrees are more effective in boosting the math achievement of students with disabilities than are those with only a baccalaureate degree. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Even for the most optimistic, it remains unclear whether one can expect a successful negotiating outcome by 2015. There are inherent difficulties associated with climate change negotiations, ranging from which countries should bear most responsibility for a given emission reduction target to the assessment of a globally efficient time path for pricing harmful greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). These difficulties become even more complex and challenging under the pervasive uncertainty of climate science and the uncertainty about the feedback loop between climate change damages and economic growth. During the past decades, the environmental economics literature has provided important insights regarding the design of environmental fiscal policies and treaties but there is a host of issues that remain relatively unexplored. For instance, we know little about the cooperative solution for carbon and trade policies when climate change affects the productive possibilities of countries. In this context, it is also not obvious whether observed policies could be improved upon in such a way that all countries gain in welfare. It remains also unclear what the carbon extraction path should be in the absence of a comprehensive treaty (such as, for example, if environmental policy is unilaterally chosen subject to an agreed 'ceiling' in global temperature). Though carbon pricing instruments like carbon taxes, cap-and-trade and hybrids have been well studied, not much is known about their properties in the presence of 'offset' schemes such as the Clean Development Mechanism. More work is also required to understand the strategic implications of the uncertainty surrounding climate change and how this affects, for example, the choice of climate change strategy ('precautionary' or 'wait and see'), how uncertainty impacts the propensity of countries to sign a climate treaty, and the extent to which the possibility of a climate catastrophe fosters or hinders cooperation. Understanding political economy issues is also vital in tackling climate change because efficient climate policies stand little chance of being successfully negotiated and implemented if they do not receive the support of the electorate. The papers in the special issue of the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management are precisely devoted to this broad research agenda.(C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We link data on these RIF notices to an administrative data set that includes student, teacher, school, and district variables to determine the factors that predict the likelihood of a teacher receiving a RIF notice. Not surprisingly, we find that a teacher's seniority is the strongest predictor, but we also find (all else equal) that teachers with master's degrees and those credentialed in the high-need areas of math, science, and special education were less likely to receive a RIF notice. Value-added measures of teacher effectiveness, which can be calculated for a subset of the teachers, were not correlated with the probability of receiving a RIF notice. Finally, simulations suggest that a very different group of teachers would be targeted for layoffs under an effectiveness-based layoff scenario than under the seniority-driven system that exists today. Budget cuts have resulted in the most rampant layoffs of teachers and other government employees in decades,as 72,700 education jobs were eliminated in September (2010) on a seasonally adjusted basis.

In parallel, scientific information and research plays a critical role in informing climate change adaptation by providing both an improved understanding of the actual climate risks and response alternatives. The paper focuses on two local-scale intervention research projects undertaken in urbanised coastal areas in Brazil and in Australia concentrated on improving the dialogue between 'those who make science' and 'those who use science to make decisions' in order to make climate science more useful, and creating purposeful collective action, respectively. A conceptual model is devised to investigate how intervention research could aid adaptive capacity by generating new knowledge and facilitating change towards climate change adaptation at the local level.

In developing the concept of precarious work-societies, it argues that precarity is a source of individual and social vulnerability and distress, affecting family, housing and communal security. The concept of depoliticisation is used to describe the processes of displacement, whereby the social consequences of precarious work come to be seen as beyond the reach of agency. Using evidence from social attitudes surveys, we explore links between the resulting sense of political marginalisation and hostility to immigrants. Re-politicisation strategies will need to lay bare the common basis of shared experiences of insecurity and explore ways of integrating precarious workers into new community and global alliances.","[Wilson, Shaun; Ebert, Norbert] Macquarie Univ, Dept Sociol, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Wilson, Shaun] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Macquarie University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Ebert, N (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Sociol, Balaclava Rd, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",Norbert.Ebert@mq.edu.au,"Ebert, Norbert/L-1516-2019","Wilson, Shaun/0000-0003-4687-1824; Ebert, Norbert/0000-0003-1177-168X",,,,,33,55,61,4,62,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The paper examines the empirical and theoretical developments which have shifted much of the focus on innovation-related issues to matters of economic geography. As well as academic material we also review the literature on the subject produced by the international development institutions. In terms of policy, special attention is devoted to the role of local market failures and local institutions in explaining the importance and need for regional innovation policies, and the advent of the smart specialisation agenda is discussed. Finally, the paper discusses the current regional innovation policy tools and interventions observed around the world, which are seen by international institutions as examples of best practice.","[McCann, Philip] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Ortega-Argiles, Raquel] Univ Groningen, Dept Global Econ & Management, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"McCann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",p.mccann@rug.nl; r.ortega.argiles@rug.nl,"Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/AAG-1944-2020; Ortega-Argiles, Raquel/HLG-1131-2023; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/0000-0002-7783-2230; McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654",,,,,135,162,167,4,140,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

We examine a group-based teacher incentive scheme implemented in New York City and investigate whether specific features of the program contributed to its ineffectiveness. Although overall the program had little effect on student achievement, we show that in schools where incentives to free ride were weakest, the program led to small increases in math achievement.

However, the authors' assessment research suggests that algorithmic problems by themselves do not encourage students to think about where the theory comes from, why the theory is relevant, or under what conditions different theories and tools should be applied. In this article, the authors draw upon current learning theory to develop a sequence of scaffolding assignments that move students from well-structured algorithmic problems to ill-structured applied problems which encourage more elaborate and robust processing of course concepts. Their assessment data suggest that these assignments promote deep learning of economic theory as well as enhanced ability to transfer learning to later courses.","[Green, Gareth P.; Peterson, Dean J.] Seattle Univ, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98122 USA; [Bean, John C.] Seattle Univ, Dept English, Seattle, WA USA",Seattle University; Seattle University,"Green, GP (通讯作者)，Seattle Univ, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",greeng@seattleu.edu; dean@seattleu.edu; jbean@seattleu.edu,,,,,,,24,16,19,1,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

QALYs gained over 4 weeks based on EQ-5D scores were also generated in order to investigate the implications for cost-utility analysis. EQ-5D scores obtained using the EVS were similar to values obtained using the CVS and UKVS in all countries. CVS-based EQ-5D scores were on average associated with a smaller baseline-to-week 4 change/improvement in all countries (except in Wales and Belgium) while UKVS-based EQ-5D scores showed the largest improvement over the same period for every country.

Correlation analysis shows that the bulk of South Africa's capital inflows do not have a significant cyclical relationship with fiscal policy but have a procyclical and reactive cyclical relationship with monetary policy. Furthermore, causality analysis finds that fiscal policy reacts to monetary policy and capital flows, whereas capital flows react to monetary policy. Hence, these results suggest that South Africa's policymakers are in a better position to control the country's capital inflows using monetary policy than using fiscal policy.","[Gossel, Sean J.; Biekpe, Nicholas] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Gossel, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",gosselse@gsb.uct.ac.za; nicholas.biekpe@gsb.uct.ac.za,"Biekpe, Prof Nicholas/AHB-9529-2022; Biekpe, Nicholas/GNH-1675-2022; gossel, sean/ABC-3931-2021","gossel, sean/0000-0002-9156-1959; Biekpe, Nicholas/0000-0002-9702-1232",,,,,98,4,4,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

All analyses are based on data from the Polish Panel Survey (POLPAN) conducted throughout the post-communist transition period, 1988-2008. The results suggest that being in a job with too low educational requirements is stable through time and raises the probability of experiencing the same situation five years later. The incidence of overeducation increased in the studied period, most rapidly during recession. The youngest cohorts, workers aged 26-35 in 2008, faced a higher risk of persistent overqualification than other cohorts. These findings are consistent with Thurow's job competition theory, as well as Sattinger's job assignment model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This morphometric structure is the most problematic to measure, because of curvature caused by placement in test-tubes with alcohol (97%). We researched there exist correlation between morphometric signs wingspan and the length of body. In addition it has been proved that the correlation of signs is not often linearly correlated. The results are also important, because morphometric signs are used in many determination keys of Odonates.

Now, these metaphors are being widely used to develop both business and political speeches. People are aware of the effects metaphor have towards communication especially in the business arena and therefore proper studies into such subjects are necessary. Metaphor is a transferring or mapping of meanings from one entity to another unrelated entity relative to its similarities in characters. Business managers and other executives sometime include purposive metaphors in order to enhance communication. By doing this, metaphors could simplify the context and enable the speaker to send their key message across in a way that is easy to understand. The main objectives of this study are to explore and analyze the similarities and differences between conceptual metaphors under categorical domains used in Singaporean and Thai business executive speeches. Metaphors are included widely in Singaporean speeches more than the Thai speeches; this could be because of the nature of the English language and the culture itself. Thai speeches contain few metaphors, signifying that this literary vehicle is not popular with Thai business speakers. Thai people tend to understand and integrate metaphorical concepts and meaning differently than Singaporeans, both countries comprehend metaphors based on their culture, tradition, norms, values, and perceptions which affect the use of purposive metaphors respectively. By manually exploring the occurrence of metaphors from secondary data derived from Singaporean and Thai business executives' speeches, new research was completed for this study in the field of modern usage and perception of metaphors. The results of this study enhance the metaphorical understanding between cultures and the effects metaphors have upon audience's thoughts and action. It is necessary for the business executives to increase the usage of figurative language to improve business communication and develop more effective speeches.","[Chandrubeksa, Chanatip; Tapachai, Nirundon] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Business Adm, Bangkok, Thailand",Kasetsart University,,cc.tipsy@gmail.com; ntapachai@yahoo.com,"Tapachai, Nirundon/AAC-9056-2019",,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,272,290,,,,,,19,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600025,0

We pay attension to uninsurable risks, especially non-life risks of flood and deluge, and to their role in conditions of the Czech insurance market. The main aim is to define a functional system, which is ready to solve an impact of implementation risks with vast damage. Our solution is based on multi-source fund system with predetermined role of commercial insurance companies and public sector. This fund system should ensure all consequences of risks mentioned above. The research will be focused on special conditions of the Czech insurance market with comparison of methods solving similar problems in the world insurance market. Flood and deluge belong to a group of key non-life risks, which have broad impact on property and life. These risks and subsequently their realization are more often in the Czech region. The progress of flood effects is uncontrollable. Many insurers avoid of making contracts in areas, where floods or deluges caused enormous damage in the past. This trend affects negatively prices of real estates. Appropriate authorities then set up flood zones, which define exceptions of insurable objects. Nowadays this method influence adversely lives of people and value of their property. According to these random choices of arguments it is necessary to make a new effective system covering all negative factors, which are joined with damage realization. The multi-source system solving uninsurable risks of flood and deluge should have positive impact on all branches in economy. An effective system can protect life and property with minimum costs. The project is prepared to build a new structure based on cooperation between public and private sector. Our suggested structure has characteristic feature of insurance pool. Pool membership of insurers should be considered as a sign of competitive advantage and also as a way of making profit. Each member should take part in fund via netto premium by specified percentage. A role of the state is supposed via grants and subvention. An important requirement is a high quality of state supervision. Insurers also should be joined in risk prevention. Due to successful system it is necessary to prevent from risk causes (e.g. to promote construction of anti-flood barriers). A part of member fees is supposed to cover costs of preventive measures in order to remove efficiently insurer's losses. Our system of solving enormous damage is expected to be profitable. A predetermined part of fund's profit should be divided between insurers undergoing risks. Another part goes back to the fund to finance system activities. The new approach allows for many factors of flood and deluge risks. We want to focus on insurance limits, participation in insurance payments, insurer's commissions, administrative costs, additional premium, insurance deductions and policy coverage in comparison with a simulation of risk development. An important part is a making definition of detailed structure and running system including ways of funding. This new system should play a major role in elimination of negative consequences of uninsurable risks. We want to suggest an organization structure and a business plan of new commercial institution. On the other hand there is a requirement to estimate costs, expenses, revenues and profits of this modern way of business. Next part of our research is expected to establish a base of new commercial insurance product. Our aim is to describe an innovative insurance product including all necessary features of current insurance contracts. In order to design a functional insurance system we intend to create conditions for distribution chain and for claims adjusters. We also want to form external and internal network of salesmen including analysis of chain costs and impacts. Our system of solving uninsurable risks can be used as a framework to apply conclusions to other insurance branches.","[Hanzlik, Karel; Bartova, Hana] Univ Econ, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,HanzlikK@seznam.cz; hanabartova@seznam.cz,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,226,237,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600021,0

In recent years, Nicaragua has suffered a huge setback in its microfinance sector, caused by various reasons. Although we are fully aware of the fact that there were other factors in play, we concentrate mainly on one particular factor - the role of the government and its support to the so called No Pago (Non-Payment) movement. We do that to show how the government's actions can influence the development of microfinances. To be able to abstract from the other factors, that generally weakened the position of MFIs in Central America (as is the world finance crisis), we try to set the situation in Nicaragua into a broader picture by comparing the situation of microfinance sector in other Central American countries.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the effectiveness and efficiency of PA institutions in delivering sustainable outcomes is debated, however, and deforestation has not been avoided within such formal regimes. This paper analyzes the processes that led to deforestation within the PAs on the transboundary Mt. Elgon, Uganda-Kenya, employing institutional theory. Landsat satellite imagery helped identify and quantify forest loss over time. The study showed how, since 1973, about a third of all forests within the PAs on Elgon have been cleared in successive processes. Within formal protected area regimes, complex political and institutional factors drive forest loss. We argue, therefore, that policies to counter deforestation using a PA model have to be considered and understood against the broader background of these factors, originating both inside and outside the PA regimes.

They are especially noteworthy in relation to economic development, growth and innovation, sustainable development and rural development. The practice of FOBs is quite different from large companies with scattered ownership (Nordqvist, Hall & Melin, 2009). The practice turn in social science, well embraced in management studies (Vaara & Whittington, 2012), is relevant to develop new knowledge in the field of business law. We study the practice of shareholder protection and aim to narrow the gap between theory and practice regarding business law and FOBs. An entrepreneurially friendly and inspiring environment presupposes that business owners can protect their ownership positions against unwanted acquisitions of shares, as well as that they are not unwillingly locked-in in a position as minority owners. In addition, this requires legal rules that are not unnecessarily costly, time and energy consuming to comply with, administer and uphold. Legislators should, if possible, thus provide a set of rules that facilitates for owners to effectively avoid both unwanted acquisitions of shares and locked-in positions. We conclude that default rules in the form of e. g. a right of first refusal should be included in the articles, since the lack of an open market place anyhow makes it highly difficult to sell the shares. Furthermore, we find it important to allow also clauses that enhance the possibility to avoid locked-in positions in the articles whereas most national legislations today permit only clauses that contribute to the protection of ownership positions.

Since the declaration of independence in May 1948, Israel's immigration policies have been exceptional in comparison to western countries. There have been significant disproportions in state's attitudes towards the Jewish immigrants and the immigrant of non-Jewish descent. While the Jewish immigrants have been encouraged to apply for the Israeli citizenship, the same procedure has been very complicated for all other applicants. The critics often assume that Israeli immigration legislative is discriminatory and incompatible with proclaimed democratic character of the state. For most of the history of modern Israel, the majority of immigrants applying for Israeli citizenship or a status of permanent residence have been either of Jewish or Arab origin. Obviously, their motivation to reside in Israel has been based on their nationalist self-awareness, historical and cultural heritage and last but not least, religion. Since 1990s new trends in immigration have been appearing in Israeli environment. The most significant change is that the number of newcomers of neither Arab nor Jewish descent has been growing constantly. This new immigration wave has got its origin in Africa. Most of these immigrants are the refugees coming from Cote d'Ivoire, Eritrea, and Somalia as these countries face up a humanitarian crisis. It has been the first time in history when Israel needs to deal with the challenge of non-Jewish and non-Arab immigrants. The reasons why Israel is considered as an attractive destination by the Africans are various. Firstly, the security situation in Israel was stabilized. The era of 1990s is sometimes called the decade of hope. Even though the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in Camp David summit 2000, it is important to emphasize that since 1973 there has not been any significant war on Israel's territory. Terrorism is still considered to be a threat however according to the recent statistics, more people die due to the accidents on the roads than due to the terrorist attacks. Secondly, the State of Israel is a highly economically developed country, a member state of OECD, and it is able to provide all necessary services to its citizens. Finally, the geographic proximity needs to be considered. The journey from Africa to Israel is obviously very long and very harsh however Israel as the only democratic country in the region seems to be worth to overcome all these troubles. The other important factor is that due to the restrictions that are applied by southern European states, the chances to obtain an asylum are rather low for most of African immigrants.","[Taterova, Eva; Darkwah, Samuel Antwi] Mendel Univ Brno, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,,evataterova@gmail.com; darkwah@mendelu.cz,"Darkwah, Samuel Antwi/AAV-9276-2020; Taterova, Eva/HME-1250-2023","Darkwah, Samuel Antwi/0000-0003-3996-7246; Taterova, Eva/0000-0001-9984-4841",,,,,24,0,0,0,6,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,557,567,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600052,0

The latter provision can be used when the RTA involves only developing countries. The way the Enabling Clause is used by developing countries in Asia is very different from other regions. Outside Asia, the Enabling Clause is usually used to form a plurilateral RTA that have an accession clause, which envisages gradual evolution into a (sub)region-wide cooperative agreement. In contrast, in Asia, developing counties started to use the Enabling Clause to sign bilateral RTAs after 2000. Such an innovative way of using the Enabling Clause is one of the contributory factors to the recent proliferation of RTAs in Asia. This paper also considers the implications of the proliferation of Enabling Clause-based RTAs to the ongoing policy discussions on the 'systemic issues' of RTAs at the World Trade Organization (WTO).",,,,,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,6,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Data envelopment analysis is used to assess the long-term performance trend in the context of balance sheet and revenue approaches. Empirical results indicate that the efficiency of deposit banks improve significantly in the restructuring period. The global crisis does not seem to have had a significant impact on managerial efficiency in the deposit banks operating in Turkey. The most striking finding is that the efficiency scores are much lower when nonperforming loans are incorporated as an undesirable output in the model. This shows that all efficiency studies in the literature that ignore undesirable output overestimate efficiency scores.,"Bogazici Univ, Dept Int Trade, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Gunay, ENO (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Int Trade, Istanbul, Turkey.",gunayen@boun.edu.tr,,,,,,,40,23,23,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Since the reforms of the 1980s, industry policy has been characterised by an economic liberal approach, the purity of which has been compromised by political pragmatism-particularly evident in the continued support for the auto industry. This article examines the issues raised by industry policy, and the history of industry policy in Australia, as a context for a review of a Report recently released by the Non-Governmental Members of the Prime Minister's Task Force on Manufacturing. This review finds useful proposals within the document, as well as a strong statement of the need for interventionist policy, albeit buried in the main text and an appendix. That this discussion is not front and centre in the Report's presentation indicates ongoing sensitivity about the main choice in industry policy-whether the government should selectively intervene, or leave the organisation of industry to the market.","[Hampson, Ian] Univ New S Wales, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Hampson, I (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",i.hampson@unsw.edu.au,,"Hampson, Ian/0000-0002-0792-8712",,,,,48,6,7,3,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

They first show that financial factors and fundamentals were very strong in Turkey before the crisis, and monetary and fiscal policies responded strongly to the crisis in a countercyclical way. They find that these strong fundamentals and prudent economic policies are reflected in the risk premium movements. Emerging market bond index (EMBI) spreads for Turkey increased slightly during the 2008 crisis and decreased back to the normal levels quickly. This was in large contrast to the crisis in 2001, when spreads increased significantly due to the weak fundamentals and decreased very slowly. Second, the authors quantitatively analyze the effects of risk premium movements during the crisis in a small open economy framework. They find that the risk premium observed in 2008 could not generate large movements in output, validating the point that the Turkish economy was resistant to the financial factors of the crisis.","[Kilinc, Mustafa; Kilinc, Zubeyir; Turhan, M.

A series of logits predict probabilities of dropping out on determinants such as math and reading test scores, absenteeism, suspension, and retention, at the following grade levels: 3rd, 5th, 8th, and 9th. The same cohort and variables are used to estimate benefits to the 15.737 students admitted to a special program ostensibly for academically and intellectually gifted children. I estimate the probability of admission for schoolmates with similar ability in math and reading to be substantially higher for those from upper income households. Finally. I conclude that extending similar resources to an equal number of high-risk students, as determined by their 3rd grade predicted probabilities, would lead to a 25% reduction in the total cohort dropout rate, and that even dividing existing resources between the two groups could cut dropout rates by half that.

The explanatory power of variables reflecting economic, attitude, learning, spatial autocorrelation, and biological factors are tested by econometric analyses on a panel data set on actual and accepted payments for two types of conservation programs; mandatory set aside and voluntary agreements. The results show both similarities and differences between the two programs; significant and robust results are that payments are increasing in the size of protected areas, and decreasing in spatial autocorrelations. A main difference is that the environmental preferences and ecological productivity have significant effects on actual payments under the voluntary but not the mandatory program.

The objective was to investigate whether physician involvement in a clinical trial financed by the pharmaceutical industry subsequently results in higher health care costs. An open, observational, multicenter study compared direct medical costs and total costs for three groups of patients with different exposure to the clinical trial; (1) Dual exposed, where both the patients and the GP participated in the former clinical trial, (2) GP exposed, where only the GP participated in the former clinical trial and (3) nonexposed, where neither the patients nor the GP participated in the former clinical trial.

However, we did observe a numerical difference in direct medical costs of 24% higher in the dual exposed group compared to the nonexposed group mainly due to a higher consumption of prescribed medication. The higher direct medical cost in the dual exposed group was however counterbalanced by lower observed direct nonmedical and indirect costs. Although we did not find any statistical significant differences in health care costs, we did observe a higher consumption of prescribed medication and lower costs of work hours lost if both patient and GPs participated in a former clinical trial. The results may be limited due to a lower number of patients included than expected.","[Hvenegaard, Anne; Juhl, Henrik Hauschildt] Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Habicht, Andreas] Signifikans ApS, DK-2950 Vedbaek, Denmark",,"Hvenegaard, A (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, 27-29 Dampfaergevej, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",ah@dsi.dk; Henrik.Juhl@kalundborg.dk; ah@signifikans.dk,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We operationalise such 'lifelong learning' as the attainment of certified qualifications in adulthood, following the completion of the first period of continuous full-time education. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) for the period 1991-2006, our approach and findings represent an important addition to the existing evidence base. By using annual data, we are able to employ the fixed effects estimator, which eliminates the problem of time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Our dynamic specification uses a lag structure to consider how earnings returns evolve in the medium and longer run, whilst also controlling for wage trends which were evident prior to qualification attainment. Our results show a medium-run return for women of 10% on hourly wages. For men, initial suggestions of a similar positive return are eliminated once pre-qualification trends are taken into account. This suggests that adult learning has a causal effect on women's subsequent earnings but, for men, any apparent gain is due to selection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Mississippi can benefit from such development because of a strong presence of the forest industry. This study utilized an average nearest neighbor and a cluster and outlier analyses to examine spatial distribution of Mississippi's primary and secondary forest products manufacturers and identify potential forest business clusters. A Poisson regression was used to examine the impact of transportation infrastructure, labor, and availability of raw materials on location of these manufacturers. The results of the spatial analysis indicated that Mississippi's forest products manufacturers tended to cluster and identified four potential forest business clusters. They included one cluster of 26 primary forest products manufacturers in Southwest Mississippi. two clusters consisting of six and 58 secondary forest products manufacturers in Northeast Mississippi, and one cluster of 78 primary and secondary forest products manufacturers in Northeast Mississippi. The regression analysis indicated that county-level volume of harvested sawlogs had a positive impact on location of primary and secondary forest products manufacturers, whereas volume of harvested pulpwood had a positive impact on location of only secondary forest products manufacturers. Presence of four-lane interstate highways was associated with a decreased number of secondary manufacturers, whereas the presence of railway increased their number by almost 1.50 times. The number of existing primary manufacturers in a county had a positive impact on location of secondary manufacturers and increased their number by 1.12 times. Available labor force also had a positive but relatively small impact on location of secondary forest products manufacturers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this article we use value-added methods to examine the relationship between a school's effectiveness and the recruitment, assignment, development, and retention of its teachers. Our results reveal four key findings. First, we find that more effective schools are able to attract and hire more effective teachers from other schools when vacancies arise. Second, more effective schools assign novice teachers to students in a more equitable fashion. Third, teachers who work in schools that were more effective at raising achievement in a prior period improve more rapidly in a subsequent period than do those in less effective schools. Finally, we find that more effective schools are better able to retain higher-quality teachers. The results point to the importance of personnel and, perhaps, school personnel practices for improving student outcomes.","[Loeb, Susanna; Kalogrides, Demetra] Stanford Univ, Ctr Educ Policy Anal, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Beteille, Tara] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Stanford University; The World Bank,"Kalogrides, D (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Ctr Educ Policy Anal, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sloeb@stanford.edu; dkalo@stanford.edu; tara.beteille@gmail.com,,"Loeb, Susanna/0000-0003-1854-8843",,,,,43,87,195,2,62,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

However, tracking scenarios via early warning mechanisms or signposts, is not a common practice. A standard methodology seems to be absent. Within the context of the Justice for tomorrow project, a scenario project of the Dutch ministry of Justice, we developed and applied a signpost method. We used this method to answer the question of how actual developments relate to the development paths depicted in the scenarios. In this paper we evaluate our approach.

Students subjected to the policy were retained in the third grade, were required to be assigned to a high-quality teacher during the retained year, and were required to attend summer school. Exposure to these interventions has a statistically significant and substantial positive effect on student achievement in math, reading, and science in the years immediately following the treatment. But the effect of the treatment dissipates over time. Nonetheless, we find that the effect of remediation under the policy on academic achievement is statistically significant and of a meaningful magnitude several years after the student is exposed to the intervention. Though we cannot completely separate the differential effects of the treatments attached to the policy, we provide some evidence that assignment to a higher-quality teacher in the retained year is not the primary driver of the policy's effect.","[Winters, Marcus A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Leadership Res & Fdn, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA; [Greene, Jay P.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Educ Reform, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Winters, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Leadership Res & Fdn, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA.",mwinters@uccs.edu; jpg@uark.edu,,,,,,,20,24,41,0,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The potential relative efficiency advantage of charters vis-a-vis traditional publics is one of the mechanisms that supports the hypotheses that charters could improve performance for their students while using the same or fewer resources, and that the systemic effect of charters could lead to improved outcomes for traditional public students without requiring an increase in education sector resources. In this paper, we provide evidence as to the cost efficiency of charter schools relative to traditional public schools, and explore the extent to which those differences are attributable to differences in hiring and compensation practices, or to differences in the length of time a campus has been operating. We generate estimates of efficiency using a stochastic cost frontier approach. We estimate a translog stochastic cost frontier model using panel data for charter campuses and traditional public campuses in Texas over the five-year period 2005-2009. Our main findings suggest that charter schools are able to produce educational outcomes at lower cost than traditional public schools probably because they face fewer regulations but are not systematically more efficient relative to their frontier than are traditional public schools.

Over one quarter of Nepal's forests is under community forest management. This study aims to examine whether management regime adopted by the Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs) is pro-poor and also what factors influence the management regime of Nepal's community forestry. The study relies on primary data from 100 CFUGs of three different mid-hill districts of Nepal. A set of questionnaire was developed and administered to a small group of 100 CFUGs. The CFUGs adopt rigid and less rigid regimes to manage the community forests. The CFUGs tend to favor poor by adopting less rigid management regime. The age of CFUGs, number of households using community forests, and percent of sal tree species composition in the forests tends to influence the management regime of CFUGs. A higher age of CFUGs. higher number of households and lower percentage of sal in the forests are likely to increase the CFUGs adopting rigid regime to manage the community forests.

This paper focuses on measuring the relationship between child maltreatment and crime using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We focus on crime because it is one of the most costly potential outcomes of maltreatment. Our work addresses two main limitations of the existing literature on child maltreatment. First, we use a large national sample, and investigate different types of maltreatment in a unified framework. Second, we pay careful attention to controlling for possible confounders using a variety of statistical methods that make differing assumptions. The results suggest that maltreatment greatly increases the probability of engaging in crime and that the probability increases with the experience of multiple forms of maltreatment.","[Currie, Janet] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Currie, Janet] Princetons Ctr Hlth & Well Being, Princeton, NJ USA; [Currie, Janet] Natl Bur Econ Res, Program Families & Children, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tekin, Erdal] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Tekin, Erdal] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Currie, J (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [P01 HD031921, R21 HD050740, R24 HD047879] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,68,107,133,1,55,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

Existing evidence suggests that it is especially common in emerging and developing economies, yet cross-country analysis in this context is rare. We examine the impact of political, economic, and media freedom on corruption in a large sample of countries across multiple time periods to investigate the marginal differences within each. The results show that increased economic and press freedoms are associated with lower levels of corruption in developing countries. We find that although increased political freedom through democratization is statistically significant, it reduces corruption only in developed countries and may increase levels of corruption in developing countries.","[Peyton, Kyle] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Belasen, Ariel R.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",University of Melbourne; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Peyton, K (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",kyle.peyton@unimelb.edu.au; abelase@siue.edu,"Peyton, Kyle/AFC-3915-2022","Peyton, Kyle/0000-0003-4845-5760",,,,,62,23,26,1,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Significant reports, including the Wilkins Review and reports by the Productivity Commission, have argued using the standard neoclassical economics framework that once a carbon price is established, it should be (almost) the only instrument needed to tackle climate change mitigation in Australia. With a small number of exceptions for complementary instruments to address some market failures, the use of other climate policy instruments, it is argued, will result only in unnecessary duplication and potential distortions. The aim of this article is to show that there are, in fact, a significant number of rationales for implementing several climate policy instruments in combination with a carbon price, and we should not be too quick to dismiss certain climate policy instrument combinations.","Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Twomey, P (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",p.twomey@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,84,14,15,0,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The test manages to capture the jump in the data and a recommendation is done with respect to the length of the window to be used in the estimation procedure.","[Duca, Ioana Andreea; Ruxanda, Gheorghe] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Duca, IA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ghrux@ase.ro,,,European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/107/1.5/S/77213],European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was cofinaced from the European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/107/1.5/S/77213 Ph.D. for a career in interdisciplinary economic research at the European standards",,14,0,0,0,12,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Based on the premise of individual rationality, water users will maximize their own income and consequently result in overuse of water resources. On the other hand, based on the premise of collective rationality, the cooperation is unstable and difficult to achieve desired goals. Causes of the non-cooperative game include: (1) the division between river basin and regional management, (2) conflicts among river basin administrative agencies, and (3) the multi-agency of government administration. Therefore, a new management system, building from aspects of the vertical management of river basin and the horizontal management of transverse area, is necessary to guarantee that water users of the river basin follow the common system and rules, and to achieve the endogenous cooperation of water resources utilization.","[Gao, Ming; Wu, Jieyun] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China",Fuzhou University,"Gao, M (通讯作者)，Fuzhou Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China.",,,,MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [10YJA630037]; Social Science Program of Fujian Province [2010B117]; New Century Excellent Talents Foundation of Fujian Province Universities [JA10027S],MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Social Science Program of Fujian Province; New Century Excellent Talents Foundation of Fujian Province Universities,"This work is supported by the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Grant No. 10YJA630037), the Social Science Program of Fujian Province (Grant No. 2010B117) and the New Century Excellent Talents Foundation of Fujian Province Universities (Grant No. JA10027S).",,5,0,0,0,4,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-61896-012-2,,,,2012,,,,,,,1942,1946,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BBY61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308816303022,0

Even if much research has been conducted on the motivations that stand behind the act of peer sharing, voluntarily, knowledge and information with other anonymous online users, fewer studies have focused in explaining the role of social exchange theory and its impact on online health communities. Therefore, in this article, it is believed that the concept that might support the application of social exchange theory in online health communities is reciprocity.

It is understandable that the economic situation has forced many businesses (employers) to reassess the effectiveness of their human resources. However, an employer may only make changes to this area in accordance with the legal regulations in force and effect in the country. Commercial enterprises as entities primarily formed to pursue profit want to be profitable at all times. This requires making correct and strategic decisions by management, i.e. both top management and other executives. The question remains, however, as to what a company can do if it is dissatisfied with the work performance of senior managers or other executives. Therefore, the issue of commercial law necessarily extends to cover the field of labour law. Employers in the Czech Republic have often criticized labour legislation in the past. They complained of rigidity, notably in terms of processes and reasons for terminating employment contracts. The aim pursued by the author of this paper is to seek out, amongst other things, what possibilities for dismissal of inanagers and other executives can currently be explored in the Czech Republic. Another objective is to answer the question as to whether existing legislation permits companies to respond with adequate promptness to certain issues as regards labour.","[Hanakova, Mgr Lenka] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,lhanakova@fame.utb.cz,,"Hanakova, Lenka/0000-0002-2242-7588",,,,,6,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,335,340,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549800030,0

Based on a Chinese nationwide survey, our analysis suggests that entrepreneurs who contribute to charities are more likely to be successful in loan applications.

Therefore, our data provide some evidence for substitutability between various types of social capital.

However, there is a paucity of future scenarios that explore distinct nanotechnology innovation and governance models. This study asks: What could the dominant innovation models look like in the future, and, in contrast, what could alternative ones look like? And how conducive are those different models to mitigating sustainability challenges and improving quality of life? To make the exploration tangible, this study focuses on nanotechnology innovation in an urban region (Phoenix, Arizona). The study uses a mixed methods approach, linking intuitive and analytical scenario construction, to allow for creativity while ensuring analytical rigor. Findings suggest four different models of nanotechnology innovation and governance affect sustainability challenges quite differently. Market-oriented and closed collaboration amplify the lack of social cohesion, result in low-wage service sector jobs, and intensify resource extraction rates. Alternatively, social entrepreneurship and open-source innovation are more conducive to addressing sustainability challenges and improving quality of life, in particular in urban areas. The study concludes that the way a society innovates and governs its emerging technologies is decisive for the way those technologies work in favor of, or against comprehensive public interests.

Policy makers therefore need to understand how to design charter laws that promote the creation of high-performing schools. Crucial to this discussion is the charter authorizing process, which varies across the nation. In some states, authorizing power is held exclusively by local school districts, whereas other states allow a range of authorizers that may include not only local districts, but also nonprofit organizations, counties, higher educational institutions, or a state agency. In this paper we use individual student-level data from Ohio, which permits a wide range of organizations to authorize charter schools, to examine the relationship between type of authorizer and charter-school effectiveness as measured by students' achievement trajectories.

We propose two approaches to measuring social polarization in the case where the distance between groups is based on an ordinal variable, such as self-assessed health status. The first one, the 'stratification approach', amounts to assessing the degree of non-overlapping of the distributions of the ordinal variable between the different population subgroups that are distinguished. The second one, the 'antipodal approach', considers that the social polarization of an ordinal variable will be maximal if the individuals belonging to a given population subgroup are in the same health category, this category corresponding either to the lowest or to the highest health status. An empirical illustration is provided using the 2009 cross-sectional data of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). We find that Estonia, Latvia, and Ireland have the highest degree of social polarization when the ordinal variable under scrutiny refers to self-assessed health status and the (unordered) population subgroups to the citizenship of the respondent whereas Luxembourg is the country with the lowest degree of social polarization in health.","[Fusco, Alessio; Silber, Jacques] CEPS INSTEAD, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Silber, Jacques] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Silber, J (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, Ramat Gan, Israel.",Alessio.Fusco@ceps.lu; jsilber_2000@yahoo.com,"Fusco, Alessio/A-5292-2019","Fusco, Alessio/0000-0002-4726-5108",,,,,33,6,7,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Though many agree that the risk of human extinction is high and intolerable, there is little research into the actions society ought to undertake if one or more methods for estimating human extinction risk indicate that the acceptable threshold is exceeded. In addition to presenting a set of patterns of lower and upper probabilities that describe human extinction risks over 1000 years, the paper presents a framework for philosophical perspectives about obligations to future generations and the actions society might undertake. The framework for philosophical perspectives links three perspectives no regrets, fairness, maintain options with the action framework. The framework for action details the six levels of actions societies could take to reduce the human extinction risk, ranging from doing nothing (Level I) to moving to an extreme war footing in which economies are organized around reducing human extinction risk (Level VI).

Most low-income Iranian women interviewed had conflicted views about paid employment. Some held up the male breadwinner as ideal, occasionally invoking Islam to limit their engagement in work they viewed as socially stigmatizing, physically difficult, or low paying. Others, particularly younger and unmarried women, had more positive views of work. Class, age, type of employment, and marital status all played roles in shaping women's experiences; but among women with similar characteristics, considerable differences were also apparent. Building off previous work that rejects simplistic dualisms such as choice versus constraint or exploitation versus empowerment, this contribution argues for more nuanced categories that allow for an emphasis on the conflicted ways women experience paid work.","[Olmsted, Jennifer C.] Drew Univ Econ, Madison, NJ 07940 USA",Drew University,"Bahramitash, R (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Chair Islam Pluralism & Globalizat, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",bahramitash@gmail.com; jolmsted@drew.edu,,,,,,,31,10,10,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The introduction of Penaeus vannamei in 2009 along with disease-related production declines in competing Asian nations has led to a remarkable expansion in recent years. It is clear that the long-term success of Indian shrimp farming will continue to rely on the widespread adoption of Better Management Practices (BMPs). A two-round stakeholder Delphi survey was conducted in 2012 to elicit views and build consensus on the relative importance of a comprehensive set of BMPs covering most aspects of shrimp farming production. While the vast majority of BMPs were considered important, respondents placed greater emphasis on those BMPs aimed at improving production efficiency. Also, BMPs focused on overall outcomes were ranked higher than those placing specific restrictions on input usage. Results also yielded interesting policy implications on BMPs that are yet to be widely adopted such as distance between farms and construction of effluent treatment systems.","[Valderrama, Diego] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Iyemperumal, Sivaraman] Cent Inst Freshwater Aquaculture, Social Sci Sect, Bhubaneswar, India; [Krishnan, M.] Cent Inst Fisheries Educ, Social Sci Div, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Institute of Fisheries Education,"Valderrama, D (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",dvalderrama@ufl.edu,"KRISHNAN, M/GRE-9049-2022","KRISHNAN, M/0000-0003-0288-7162; Valderrama, Diego/0000-0003-1497-2954",United States - India Educational Foundation through a Fulbright-Nehru Doctoral Research Fellowship,United States - India Educational Foundation through a Fulbright-Nehru Doctoral Research Fellowship,S.

Changes in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) are already driving widespread change in diverse food-related industries such as retail, hospitality and marketing. It is reasonable to suspect that the fields of ubiquitous technology, urban informatics and social media equally have a lot to offer the evolution of core urban food systems. We use communicative ecology theory to describe emerging innovations in urban food systems according to their technical, discursive and social components. We conclude that social media in particular accentuate fundamental social interconnections normally effaced by conventional industrialised approaches to food production and consumption.

J,"Heydon, K",,,,"Heydon, Kenneth",,,Plurilateral Agreements and Global Trade Governance: A Lesson from the OECD,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"A key lesson from failure at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to negotiate a multilateral agreement on investment is that attempts to reduce barriers to trade and investment will fail without broad-based domestic support for open markets. This article applies that lesson to the faltering Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and argues that the deadlock is due to the collective failure to make-the-case for liberalization rather than, as is commonly suggested, the systemic constraints of a 'single undertaking' or the ascendancy of emerging powers. Deadlock in the Doha Round has triggered the pursuit of alternatives to multilateral negotiation. The result is increased emphasis on plurilateral approaches and the further entrenchment at the centre of trade diplomacy of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) - such as those being negotiated across the Pacific and the Atlantic. This article outlines the powerful motivations behind PTAs but also the dangers, including of limited welfare gains, disincentives to non-discriminatory liberalization and increased complexity and discord in international rule making. Plurilateral agreements involve particular risks for developing countries, whether through marginalization from single-issue agreements or asymmetric pressure within multi-issue PTAs. This article concludes that an effective, first-best, multilateral response to the challenge of the political economy of trade will require that trade liberalization be placed more firmly within the framework of sound domestic economic policy and that top-down liberalization, including through the G20 process, be accompanied by more effective bottom-up advocacy of the gains from market opening.",,,"Heydon, K (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",ken.heydon@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,8,8,0,11,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Existing research suggests that the influence of economics is mediated by local circumstances and meso-level social structures, and that much of it flows through indirect channels. We elaborate three sites of analysis useful for unpacking these influences: the broad professional authority of economics, the institutional position of economists in government, and the role of economics in the cognitive infrastructure of policymaking, including the diffusion of economic styles of reasoning and the establishment of economic policy devices for seeing and deciding.","[Hirschman, Daniel] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Berman, Elizabeth Popp] SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12222 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Hirschman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",dandanar@umich.edu,,"Hirschman, Daniel/0000-0002-5913-8982",,,,,175,193,222,1,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In the context of targeting invasive species inspections of agricultural imports, I find that risk aversion increases the relative value of AM and can increase the rate of exploratory action. While calls for AM in natural resource management are common, many analyses have identified modest gains from this approach. I analytically and numerically examine the distribution of outcomes from AM under risk neutrality and risk aversion. The inspection decision is framed as a multi-armed bandit problem and solved using the Lagrangian decomposition method. Results show that even when expected gains are modest, asymmetry in the distribution of outcomes has important implications. Notably, AM can serve to buffer against large losses, even if the most likely outcome is a small loss. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This paper describes the development of integrated explorative and normative scenarios for the analysis of future land use in a climate-neutral Sweden. The aim is to show how backcasting scenarios fulfilling far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction targets can be related to assumptions on possible external developments, in order to contribute to the discussion on future sustainable land use. A target-fulfilling scenario element was combined with an external scenario element, i.e. developments that cannot be influenced by the targeted actors. The scenarios were developed and analysed in collaboration with local actors. Four scenarios were used to describe how land in Sweden could be used when Sweden has achieved zero emissions of greenhouse gases in 2060. The explorative dimension stretched from a situation where there is no international climate agreement to one where there is an international agreement on reducing greenhouse gases. The backcasting dimension illustrated different strategies to achieve the target and stretches from a very influential municipal level to one where the national/EU level is most influential.

Of the twelve possible hypotheses regarding the causal relationships among inflation, output growth, and their uncertainties, we consider five relationships for which we find strong theoretical arguments and empirical evidence in the literature.

We create a theoretical framework which suggests specific tests of the standard teacher input homogeneity assumption. Using North Carolina data we show that value-added fails to empirically meet these tests and document that this leads to a large number of teacher misrankings. Thus, critics of potential value-added teacher personnel policies are correct that such policies will terminate many of the wrong teachers. However, we derive the conditions under which such policies will improve student test scores and find that they will almost certainly be met. We then demonstrate that value-added information can also be used to improve student test scores by matching teachers to students or subjects according to their comparative advantage.

Results on the ASAS20 efficacy endpoint were reported for week 12 in 12 RCTs involving 2,395 patients, and for week 24 in 5 RCTs comprising 1,337 patients. All the five biological agents proved to be significantly superior to placebo. Infliximab showed the highest odds ratio (OR) of 7.2 (95 % CI 3.68-13.19) compared to placebo, followed by infliximab-biosimilar with OR 6.25 (95 % CI 2.55-13.14), both assessed at week 24. No significant difference was found between infliximab-biosimilar and other biological treatments regarding their efficacy and safety. Conclusions This is the first study which includes a biosimilar drug in the meta-analysis of biological treatments in AS. The results have proven the similar efficacy and safety profile of infliximab-biosimilar treatment compared to other biologicals.","[Baji, Petra; Pentek, Marta; Gulacsi, Laszlo; Balogh, Orsolya; Brodszky, Valentin] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Pentek, Marta] Flor Ferenc Cty Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, H-2143 Kistarcsa, Hungary; [Szanto, Sandor] Univ Debrecen Med & Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Rheumatol, Inst Med, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Geher, Pal] Budai Irgalmasrendi Hosp, Dept Rheumatol 1, H-1023 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; University of Debrecen,"Baji, P (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",petra.baji@uni-corvinus.hu,"Geher, Pal/Y-1620-2019; Brodszky, Valentin/AFN-4112-2022; Péntek, Márta/HTQ-3097-2023; Baji, Petra/JHV-1617-2023; Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023","Brodszky, Valentin/0000-0002-6095-2295; Péntek, Márta/0000-0001-9636-6012; Baji, Petra/0000-0003-2899-8557;",,,,,32,26,27,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We propose using the structural conditional correlation model to measure these two contagion mechanisms. Empirical results find significant mean and volatility spillover and dynamic conditional correlation between the residual series of the structural conditional correlation model for China and U.S. stock index returns, which clearly reflect the transmission channel from international markets to China's markets, especially in financial crises.

This study compared the binary discrete choice experiment (DCE) and the multiprofile case of best-worst scaling (BWS) in eliciting preferences for the EQ-5D-5L. Forty-eight EQ-5D-5L health states were selected using a Bayesian efficient design and grouped into 24 pairs for the DCE tasks and 8 sets for the BWS tasks (each set has three health states). A total of 100 participants completed 12 pairs and 8 sets in a random order. A probit regression model and ranked order logistic regression model were used to estimate the latent utilities from the DCE and BWS, respectively. Both tasks were well understood by the majority of participants. The DCE tasks were relatively easier and took a shorter time to complete. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the DCE was higher than that of the BWS. The variances associated with the latent utilities estimated from the DCE were larger than those from the BWS. The DCE is more feasible and reliable than the BWS in valuing the EQ-5D-5L. Future studies could focus on comparing the consistency and accuracy of these techniques in predicting the health utilities of the EQ-5D-5L.","[Xie, Feng; Pullenayegum, Eleanor; Gaebel, Kathryn] St Josephs Healthcare, Ctr Evaluat Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Xie, Feng; Pullenayegum, Eleanor] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON L8P1H1, Canada; [Pullenayegum, Eleanor] St Josephs Healthcare, Father Sean OSullivan Res Ctr, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Oppe, Mark] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Krabbe, Paul F.

It enables a perspective where the focus is on specific sociomaterial formations that articulate urban economic crises and their potentialities 'from within'. This multidimensional aspect of urbanity is then discussed taking Berlin as an example.

This simultaneous, common approach claiming to reunite various ideas aims to identify a way of putting together the different purposes of the modern economic world, characterized by numerous fluctuations and a spectacular evolution in order to be sustainable and efficient. The study of the literature has fostered one of the solutions of harmoniously combining efficiency and sustainability: the orientation towards eco-efficiency. This solution, tackled in the present paper, is based on two of the newest theories of economic scientific research, although little known and dealt with in the national economic research area: the theory of Factor 4 and the theory of Factor 10, both approaching the sustainable development under the conditions of meeting economic efficiency. The main goal of the paper is to identify and analyse the main benchmarks allowing the clarification of the relation between the concepts of sustainability and efficiency, given that there are some difficulties when attempting to apply the obvious theories about sustainability into practical activities. Thus, the conclusions will show that it is necessary to identify and accept the rules of setting the sustainability condition of an economy, so that the eco-efficiency concept might be approached in a pragmatic manner.

Quality could be evaluated by the consumer according to a number of factors, called reference factors. Therefore, the price or the classification category of the tourist accommodation unit, signalling, parking, diversity of propositions, service diversity, direct relationships (employer - customer) or indirect relationships (customer - customer), etc. are only a few of the reference factors analysed. Consequently, we consider that in the field of tourist accommodation units, the concept of quality involves the totality of the problems concerning the quality of tourist services, which is an extremely extended area where the tour operators' (hotel managers') points of view meet those of the consumers. In an extremely competitive hotel environment, hotel managers should find modalities to make their products and services better than the ones of the competition. Therefore, the specialists in this field, Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry, Gronroos, Cronin and Taylor and others propose the use of efficient instruments to measure and to evaluate the quality (SERVQUAL, SERVPERF, etc.). In this work, after a rigorous selection and a critical analysis of the concepts, we proposed to establish an alternative method of quality evaluation in tourism, by the calculation of the global indicator of quality evaluation in tourism (GIQET), case study applied in tourist accommodation units.

In Latvia, mostly the opinion that a company must donate a part of its profit to society, in which it operates, has prevailed so far. However, corporate social responsibility should be perceived much wider -not only as charity but also as company's values that find their expression in company's involvement in tackling environmental and social issues. In modern economy sectors, especially in service industries, human capital becomes more important than the physical capital, thus, comprehensive investors should stop cooperation with partners that fail to reduce such risks. After Latvia's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, which stemmed from the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the country's welfare level has still a strong impact on the consumers' choice. Consequently, Latvian households pay little interest to the overall behaviour of corporate citizens rather than are interested to obtain the largest possible total utility for every spent monetary unit, regardless of what expense it is provided for customers. In scope of the present research, the author has analysed Latvian and the EU citizens' awareness of corporate social responsibility issues. The research results revealed that in Latvia, there is still a corporate social responsibility information gap - almost two thirds of Latvian respondents are interested in what companies do to behave in a responsible way, whereas only one third of respondents say they feel informed in this area.","[Grinberga-Zalite, Gunta] Latvia Univ Agr, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,gunta.grinberga@llu.lv,"Grīnberga-Zālīte, Gunta/AAG-5618-2019","Grīnberga-Zālīte, Gunta/0000-0002-0500-4890",,,,,10,0,0,0,4,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9934-8466-2-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,35,,,,,16,24,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BB8OQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347133500001,0

In my research as a whole I will explore the extent to which this stance impacted upon and influenced the economic policies of Macedonia. This will involve providing a contextualized, critical account of the policy of the IMF focusing on a comparison of its policies during the early 2000s through policy documents, political discourse and enacted policies in Macedonia. The conditionality associated with these policies, such as the enforcement of austerity measures (including cutting public spending and reducing debt) and the privatization of public institutions has provoked strong reactions in countries which receive such loans (Goldstein et al., 2003; Feldstein, 1998). Moreover, the main aim of the policies and the lack of in-depth analysis on the levels of development of the economies involved has had devastating outcomes in the past (such as with the East Asian currency crisis [1997/8], Latin American - Argentinian crisis [2001], Ex- Soviet Union crisis [1998], Eurozone crisis [2007/8]) (Lal, 1987; Goldstein et al., 2003; Joyce, 2003). My focus in this research is on exploring how the process of Financial Liberalization (FL) of the Macedonian economy affected capital flows in the form of foreign direct investments (FDI) in the private sector and how the recent Greek crisis of 2008 has impacted on this. According to Barnett and Monastiriotis, the neighboring countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Serbia) in which Greece is either the first or the second largest direct investor, are 'most vulnerable to negative spillover through reduced FDI flows' as Greek- owned FDI accounts for 7-9% of the GDP of those countries (2010: 47). In the case of Macedonia, the reality of FL was tested by the collapse of the Greek economy. The first part of my research will critically evaluate simplified models used in previous research to explain the influence of crisis on FDI in small economies like Macedonia. I will argue that investigating the impact of FL is much more complex and cannot be explained by linear regression. Instead, by undertaking an in-depth documentary analysis of official reports and documents, I will seek to investigate how the official view of the benefits of FL impacted on the Macedonian economy, thus implicitly testing the accepted IMF position.","[Mano, Viktorija] Roehampton Univ, Erasmus House Roehampton Lane, London, England",Roehampton University,"Mano, V (通讯作者)，Roehampton Univ, Erasmus House Roehampton Lane, London, England.",manov@roehampton.ac.uk,,,,,,,123,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,182,198,,,,,,17,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000015,0

This article aims to provide insight into the quality of the evaluations and explore the possible drivers of the conflicting conclusions. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify all published economic evaluations that compared the incremental costs and outcomes of trastuzumab versus a comparator. Fifteen economic evaluations were identified. In the evaluations that estimated efficacy using an RCT, the key drivers of the conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness were: the approach used to estimate overall survival in the control group given crossover to trastuzumab following progression in the trials; the inclusion of treatment beyond progression; inclusion of wastage due to unused vial portions, adverse events, and the cost of HER2 testing. Four evaluations used non-randomised approaches to estimate efficacy, thus introducing the potential for confounding. As a result these evaluations reported relatively optimistic estimates of comparative effectiveness. Finally the evaluations used different thresholds to determine whether treatment with trastuzumab was cost-effective. There were numerous drivers of the different conclusions regarding the cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab, many of which are due to judgements made by the authors when translating data from RCTs. Many of the potential drivers were not identified by the published systematic reviews of economic evaluations and perhaps more remain unidentified because of inconsistent and limited reporting.","[Parkinson, Bonny; Viney, Rosalie] Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Pearson, Sallie-Anne] Univ Sydney, Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmaceut Policy Res Grp, Fac Pharm, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Sydney,"Parkinson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Bonny.parkinson@chere.uts.edu.au,"Parkinson, Bonny/F-6445-2010","Parkinson, Bonny/0000-0002-2137-0962; Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635",National Breast Cancer Foundation [PD-13-01] Funding Source: researchfish,National Breast Cancer Foundation,,,60,15,16,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

These measures may cause restrictions to forest management leading to losses of income. Our study aimed to analyse natural and economic impacts of the implementation of the Habitats Directive which could, e.g. be used as a basis for designing compensation schemes. In discussion with operational managers it became clear that the measures most restrictive to forest enterprises were small-area land set-aside, restrictions in choice of tree-species and maintenance of a sufficient share of mature stands. The impact of those nature protection measures on case-study forest enterprises was evaluated using an excel-based simulation model which enabled the calculation of, e.g., income losses based on enterprise individual data for a given simulation-period. The main factors influencing income losses were age-class distributions, management practices and objectives of forest enterprises. Annual income losses for the enterprises averaged 31 to 39 (sic)/ha. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Around the world, all nations complain of corruption and, as it is observed in the Corruption Perception Index 2012, no country has a maximum score which shows that a country is totally clean. Corruption, as a public institutions' manner of action, will influence and affect the economical outcomes, being materialized in the decline of the national competitiveness. This is the most frequent approach in the discussion about the correlation between these two variables. Contrary, the aim of this study is to analyze if corruption is influenced by national competitiveness and to show the nature of this influence. Analyzing the national competitiveness data from The Global Competitiveness Report 2012-2013 and the data about corruption from Corruption Index 2012, the results reveal the existence of a strong positive connection between these two indexes, the level of national competitiveness significantly influencing the perception of corruption from a country. It is observed from the analysis that countries rated as having a small national competitiveness rate are perceived to be more corrupt than the more competitive countries. In conclusion, the standard of living, the rate of employment, the productivity, the commercial equilibrium, the national attractiveness, the ability of objective implementation, the flexibility and ability of sustaining growth which define the national competitiveness concept are direct determinants of the corruption perception.

In September 2008, the MSC first certified the Kyoto Danish Seine Fishery Federation (KDSFF) as a sustainable fishery in Asia. In order to examine any impact of MSC certification on the KDSFF, this study examines structural changes in the market. Since no immediate impact of price premium changes can be realized, structural break tests and cointegration tests are conducted. The monthly ex-vessel price of flat-head flounder in the Kyoto market is compared with those in the two adjacent uncertified markets. The structural break tests detected a significant impact two months after the KDSFF's certification. The cointegration and Granger causality tests showed that the Kyoto market was previously influenced by other larger markets, but has become less subject to their influence after introduction of MSC certification.","Fisheries Res Agcy, Fisheries Socioecon Grp, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan",Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA),"Wakamatsu, H (通讯作者)，Fisheries Res Agcy, Fisheries Socioecon Grp, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Kanazawa Ku, 2-12-4 Fukuura, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan.",hwakamatsu@affrc.go.jp,,,,,,,37,38,42,0,37,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Initial financial investment is necessary for the reforestation of the severely degraded areas. In such areas, the State Forest Agency, with the support of the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), began to test the Saving Book Approach (SBA) in Gorno Badakhshan region. SBA is a specific scheme of Payments for Ecosystem Services reforestation scheme. Local people participating in SBA receive compensation for six years, if the workload is fulfilled. This research has been carried out in order to analyze people's willingness to enroll in SBA and the suitability of certain forest plots for SBA implementation. The empirical results show that out of the factors tested - 'benefit expectations', 'social pressure', 'age', 'income' and 'ability', 'ability' was the only influential factor for willingness to enroll. 'Ability' is defined as the labor force availability, physical ability and amount of available time of the labor force in the household. The suitability of the forest plot depends on the needed investments for reforestation activities. Indeed, the willingness to enroll in SBA of local people does not necessarily match with plot suitability. These findings contribute to the improvement of the determination and understanding of factors that influence local peoples' decision to enroll and thus, provide the international development community with useful information for the design of future payment schemes.

The so-called upstream incremental WSA assigns to each country its marginal contribution to its followers in the river. Its mirror image, the downstream incremental WSA, is not sustainable to reduced flow at the source. Self-enforcement problems can be solved by setting water releases and compensations contingent to water flow. We apply our analysis to the Aral Sea Basin.

The emerging national governance structure for REDD + in DRC has a hybrid nature, combining the establishment of a national REDD + fund and independent REDD + projects at the local level. The authors argue that, in the DRC context, the legitimacy and effectiveness of this emerging governance structure is higher than that of other options. This hybrid structure would experience a fairly high level of legitimacy from government entities, civil society organizations and private sector given its participatory design and broad accessibility to funding for different stakeholders. This structure would be more effective in that it allows the country to target both underlying causes of deforestation through international payments conditioned to policy reforms through the National REDD + Fund; and direct drivers of deforestation through REDD + projects. The efficiency of the system is difficult to assess at present, as it is not yet known what type of activities would be supported by the National REDD + Fund or what REDD + projects would be implemented. However, this governance structure is likely to attract more financing to REDD, both from donors and private sector. The authors suggest that institutional and policy indicators should be used to measure and reward REDD + performance at a national level in lieu of emissions reductions in the REDD + investment phase, paving the way for DRC to capture payments for verified emissions reduction in the long term. Informing policy reforms through project interventions is a key element of this governance structure, and particularly important in a country where deforestation rates may increase dramatically in the future given new emerging pressures. The authors recognize, however, that structural policy changes will face vigorous opposition from vested interests, and implementation challenges typical of a fragile state. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This regional electoral system allows voters to choose both the party and the specific candidate (open-list proportional system). The results show that the introduction of a 50 percent gender quota in candidate lists leads to a substantial increase in the probability that voters will choose women candidates, from 12 to 36 percent. Nevertheless, the probability of voting for women (36 percent) is lower than the probability for men (64 percent). Voters have a male bias in Italy. Both the district size and the political party have an effect on the probability of voting for women versus men.

The identification relies on a fuzzy regression discontinuity approach where assignment into high-ability classes constitutes the source of identifying information. An important feature of this system is that both types of classes are taught by the same teachers, they follow a common curriculum and take the same exams. Students are in general unaware of the system prior to school start as it is unofficial. In cases where they are informed of the system's existence, they do not know where the threshold lies and school switching possibilities are limited. I find significant and sizable effect on the academic achievement of students around the assignment threshold.

Against this backdrop, we assessed the value of healthcare spending growth in 14 western countries between 1996 and 2006. We estimated macro-level health production functions using avoidable mortality as outcome measure. Avoidable mortality comprises deaths from certain conditions that should not occur in the presence of timely and effective healthcare. We investigated the relationship between total avoidable mortality and healthcare spending using descriptive analyses and multiple regression models, focussing on within-country variation and growth rates. We aimed to take into account the role of potential confounders and dynamic effects such as time lags. Additionally, we explored a method to estimate macro-level cost-effectiveness. We found an average yearly avoidable mortality decline of 2.6-5.3 % across countries. Simultaneously, healthcare spending rose between 1.9 and 5.9 % per year. Most countries with above-average spending growth demonstrated above-average reductions in avoidable mortality. The regression models showed a significant association between contemporaneous and lagged healthcare spending and avoidable mortality. The time-trend, representing an exogenous shift of the health production function, reduced the impact of healthcare spending. After controlling for this time-trend and other confounders, i.e. demographic and socioeconomic variables, a statistically significant relationship between healthcare spending and avoidable mortality remained. We tentatively conclude that macro-level healthcare spending increases provided value for money, at least for the disease groups, countries and years included in this study.","[Heijink, Richard] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Ctr Prevent & Hlth Serv, NL-3721 MA Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Heijink, Richard] Tilburg Univ, Tranzo, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands; [Koolman, Xander] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [Koolman, Xander] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Westert, Gert P.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Sci Inst Qual Healthcare IQ Healthcare, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands",Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; Tilburg University; Delft University of Technology; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Heijink, R (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Ctr Prevent & Hlth Serv, Antonie van Leeuwenhoeklaan 9, NL-3721 MA Bilthoven, Netherlands.",richard.heijink@rivm.nl,"Westert, G.P./H-8115-2014","Koolman, Xander/0000-0003-4225-8854",,,,,56,53,61,1,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, such trade remedy measures can be applied only after investigations undertaken in accordance with the detailed rules laid down by the Agreements on Anti-dumping Practices (ADP), Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and on Safeguards, it is established that increased imports are causing injury to the domestic agricultural producers or industry. As a result, over sixty developing countries, most 4 which are least developed or countries at lower stages of development, which have not been able to establish such framework because of financial and other constraints are not able to make effective use of the rights which these Agreements provide. The paper suggests that in the situation, the least developed and other developing countries which have not been able to establish legal and institutional framework for applying all of the three trade remedy measures, should be permitted to apply only safeguard measures, which from the administrative point of view would require only modest staff, by adopting an Understanding. It is also in this context important to note that after the conclusion of the Doha Round, all developing countries would be able to apply to agricultural products, special safeguard measures if the price of imports falls below specified price trigger or their volume exceeds specified trigger, irrespective of whether the imported goods which are causing injury are being dumped or being subsidized. The need to apply safeguard measures in accordance with the provision 4 the Understanding clarifying the rules of the Safeguard Agreement would arise only in a few cases of manufactured products where domestic industries complain that the increased imports are causing serious injury to them.","[Rege, Vinod] WTO, Geneva, Switzerland; [Kisiri, Marwa] Geneva Off, Geneva, Switzerland; [Manyara, Elijah] Permanent Mission Kenya WTO, Geneva, Switzerland; [Baafi, Nyame] Permanent Mission Ghana WTO, Geneva, Switzerland; [Bizimuremyi, Edward] Permanent Mission Rwanda WTO, Geneva, Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,6,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The underlying assumption behind many of these policies is that experience promotes effectiveness, but is this really the case? What does existing evidence tell us about how, why, and for whom teacher experience matters? This policy brief distills the research on teacher experience into four general findings: (1) the effect of experience is most evident during the first few years of teaching; (2) the early-career experience effect varies by level of education and subject area; (3) inexperienced teachers are most likely to teach in high-poverty schools; and (4) the impact of experience differs for teachers in high-versus low-poverty schools. The brief concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for several key policy measures including teacher compensation, support and professional development, and the unequal distribution of teachers across schools.","Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Rice, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jkr@umd.edu,,,,,,,38,37,65,4,21,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

It is clear that saving is difficult for many people and throughout the life course. Efforts to help young people accumulate assets might encourage saving by parents, encourage saving by youth, or provide subsidies. The latter strategy is most likely to reduce inequities associated with socioeconomic status. These strategies do not have to be pursued in isolation, and on-going conversations across disciplines and between scholars and practitioners could yield useful insight. In addition, research on existing asset-building initiatives that combine two or more of these strategies will provide important lessons for policy and program development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the US, patients' cost of participating in a clinical trial is considered to be a major barrier to patient enrollment. In order to reduce this barrier, some states in the US have implemented policies requiring health insurers to cover routine care costs for patients enrolled in clinical trials. This paper evaluates empirically how effective these policies were in increasing the supply of clinical trials and speeding up their completion, using data on cancer clinical trials initiated in the US between 2001 and 2007. Our analysis indicates that the policies did not lead to an increased supply in the number of clinical trials conducted in mandate states compared to non-mandate states. However, we find some evidence that once clinical trials are initiated, they are more likely to finish their patient recruitment in a timely manner in mandate states than in non-mandate states. As a result, the overall length to completion was significantly shorter in mandate states than in non-mandate states for cancer clinical trials in certain phases. The findings hint at the possibility that these policies might encourage drug innovation in the long run.","[Chun, Natalie] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong City 1550, Philippines; [Park, Minjung] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Asian Development Bank; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Park, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, 2220 Piedmont Ave, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",natalie.l.chun@gmail.com; mpark@haas.berkeley.edu,"Park, Minjung/R-7774-2017","Park, Minjung/0000-0002-5693-9370",,,,,28,5,5,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The paper suggests two improvements that could be made to Panel procedures; supports the Appellate Body's interpretation of Article XX(d) in the present case, which seems to discard an earlier mistaken approach to Article XX; and examines, in some detail, whether the Appellate Body's application of the 'less favourable treatment' component of GATT Article III:4 in this and other cases is consistent with its jurisprudence under GATT Article III:2 and TBT Article 2.1. From an economics perspective, the case is straightforward on its face. However, the Appellate Body's rigorous application of the 'less favourable treatment' principle might not survive a fuller market analysis in terms of policy impacts on conditions of competition. Further, while we agree with the rejection of Thailand's Article XX claim, we raise the question of whether a strict national-treatment rule may be an unwarranted constraint on policy where there is a clear trade-related external cost to address.","[Davey, William J.] Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Maskus, Keith E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Davey, WJ (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",wdavey@illinois.edu; keith.maskus@colorado.edu,,,,,,,9,3,3,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2013,12.0,2,,,SI,,163,193,,10.1017/S1474745612000481,0.0,,,31,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,126CZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317590600004,0

We use matching techniques to recover the average capitalized value of lakes above the costs of maintenance by comparing transactions in lake communities to observationally similar transactions in surrounding communities. We differentiate between adjacent and non-adjacent houses to recover heterogeneous treatment effects and allow estimates to vary across communities. Importantly, we consider the role of imperfect matching on spatially and temporally varying unobservable variables in our choice of estimator and the appropriate set of potential control properties. Our results suggest that the capitalized value of lakes is heterogeneous with a mean estimate of $6500 an acre-foot. Our results provide estimates of the changes in water prices that would make this form of development unprofitable, illustrating the linkage between water pricing policy and the water intensity of development.

While the relevance of dealing with trends is constantly underlined, the effects of labeling phenomena as trends and megatrends in an organizational context have not been widely discussed. In particular, the dangers of dealing with megatrend semantics are that the strategic implications of these phenomena are unclear and that an organization is likely to increase its blind spots, thereby actually undermining its foresight capability. This paper applies a discourse-theoretical perspective developed by Ernesto Laclau and Chantalle Mouffe to trend management in organizations. It argues that megatrends can be perceived as empty signifiers, as they provide an overdetermined, abstract form of meaning that addresses discourses but cannot convey concrete meaning for management. It is proposed that instead of concentrating on megatrends (empty signifiers), trend management should reconstruct those elements of a discourse in which shifts of meaning can be observed, detecting and understanding the nodal points of a discourse.

Neither is it controlled by fisheries management measures selected under that system. These are merely words on paper. The actual control of the fishery is by enforcement of the fisheries management measures selected. In this sense, fisheries enforcement is the real fisheries management. This observation raises the question of the optimal path of fisheries enforcement over time. Given the initial state of the fishery, a time path offisheries management measures, and a set of enforcement tools and penalty levels, what would be the optimal enforcement effort over time? This article deals with that issue. Given an efficient fisheries management system, it attempts to characterize the solution to the problem of optimal enforcement of fisheries management measures over time. Not surprisingly, it turns out that the optimal enforcement effort would normally not be constant over time and usually not produce 100% compliance. On the contrary, the optimal level of enforcement and, therefore, compliance is generally a function of the state of the fish stocks at each point in time. More specifically, it appears that optimal enforcement effort may typically be a monotonically declining function of the size of the fish stocks. The article proceeds to investigate optimal paths of other enforcement controls such as penalty levels and allowable catches (announced TA Cs) and their dependence on the size of the fish stocks.","Univ Iceland, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Arnason, R (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",ragnara@hi.is,,,EU [044153],EU(European Union (EU)),"Some of the research underlying this article was supported by an EU sixth framework Project No. 044153, COBECOS.

The results of our analyzes and comparisons with historical data do not indicate significant trends of changes in nutrient content (which are depend mainly on fertilizing), organic matter and its quality or pH. However, there has been a dramatic increase of CaCO3 content in the topsoil layer, which is under natural conditions often decalcified. Such an increase in carbonates (about 5%) can, according to literary sources, attributed to erosion - narrowing of the topsoil layer and the gradual approximation to loess - parent material rich in carbonates.","[Chmelar, S.; Jandak, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Chmelár, S (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",simon.ch24@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,314,321,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800054,0

The changes of soil hydrophobicity are very important, because they have a direct influence on soil fertility and leaching of nutrients from soil. This study presents the first results of a long-term pot experiment, which has been carried out in a climate chamber (under controlled conditions). Three groups of the treatment A, B and C with different regime of irrigation were prepared. The water content in soil was maintained at 70% of the Maximum Capillary Capacity (MCC), in the group A and at 40% of the MCC in the group B. Soil water regime was maintained in the range of wilting point and lento-capillary capacity in the group C. These groups were divided into three variants (A1 = B1, C1; A2 = B2, C2 etc.). Variants A1 (B1, C1) have represented the control without addition of another fertilizer. Variants A2 (B2, C2) were fertilized with nitrogen fertilizer DAM 390. Recommended doses of nitrogen (N-min) were applied there (0.140 Mg N/ha). Variants A3 (B3, C3) have contained arable soil with addition of compost (50Mg/ha). High soil hydrophobicity slows water infiltration (hydraulic conductivity is lower) and conversely. Therefore, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) may indicate a degree of soil hydrophobicity. Hydraulic conductivity was measured by Mini Disk Infiltrometer. The highest values of K-sat were found in variants with addition of organic carbon (compost was a source of carbon). Conversely, the lowest values of K-sat were found in variants with addition of N-min. Moreover, all variants with organic carbon addition showed lower amount of mineral nitrogen leaching than variants without (in individual groups; ANOVA, P<0.05). Based on these results, we can conclude, the addition of organic carbon with recommended dose of water has a positive effect on microbial activity, on decrease of leached mineral nitrogen and on hydrophobicity of soil.","[Elbl, J.; Kintl, A.; Zahora, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Elbl, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jakub.elbl@mendelu.cz,"Kintl, Antonín/I-8171-2018; Záhora, Jaroslav/L-6534-2018; Kintl, Antonín/AAJ-3773-2021; Elbl, Jakub/I-5056-2018","Kintl, Antonín/0000-0002-0031-083X; Elbl, Jakub/0000-0001-6401-1516",,,,,8,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,286,290,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800049,0

Becoming a learning organization is one of the best ways an organization can improve their services and practices in order to increase their effectiveness and achieve competitive advantage. In this context, the leadership styles of the top management are imperative in facilitating the transition to be a learning organization. The current study attempts to: (1) examine the link between leadership styles (transformational leadership and transactional leadership) and building a learning organization and (2) whether the influence of transformational leadership is stronger than of a transactional type of leadership. The statistical results obtained from 150 manufacturing firms in Malaysia indicate significant positive relationships between transformational leadership and building a learning organization. The findings suggest the leadership style that is characterized by idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation and individual consideration are important to generate learning in the organization.","[Hussein, Norashikin] Univ Teknol MARA Univ, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ishak, Noormala Amir; Noordin, Fauziah] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Hussein, N (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA Univ, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.",shikin6320@salam.uitm.edu.my; noormala317@salam.uitm.edu.my; fauziah716@salam.uitm.edu.my,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,9,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, Turkiye",,,978-605-64002-1-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,172,180,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336025300013,0

Seven different sector indices of the stock are used and the data was gathered from the year 1996 to 2000. The simulation of sector index using 21-day MACD and ROC are applied in order to determine the efficiency. Buy-and-hold strategy is used as a benchmark of efficiency. According to Richard and Julie (1999), returns above 90 percent of a maximum peak and trough on buy-and-hold strategy are considered outstanding.

Chinese peasants would exchange their products anonymously for cash at the nearest market, while transactions in rural Japan tended to be made among people who were well-acquainted through credit rather than currency. The case of early modern England, where ordinary people tended to make deferred payments by means of oral agreements, shows a similarity to the Japanese situation. This comparison suggests, in general terms, that currency and credit could combine to supply the total amount of means of payment needed in a region. However, commercial activities progressed in divergent ways: either through anonymous currency transactions or by means of chained debts among locals. Unlike currency-dominant systems, which tended to create plural units of account, credit-dominant systems made it easier to establish a monetary system based on a standard formula.","Univ Tokyo, Inst Adv Studies Asia, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Kuroda, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Inst Adv Studies Asia, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",ankuroda@ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330102] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,70,8,9,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Furthermore, after the discussion about agriculture as an engine of growth, energy, the engine that facilitates agricultural production is also investigated Finally, rural development indicators are used in a panel data approach to highlight their influence on agriculture production. A part of the model focuses on the influence of agriculture and energy consumption in agriculture on economic growth. Main findings reveal that: energy consumption within the sector positively influences agricultural output for almost all countries; a lower influence appears from investments (which mainly had a downward trend) and population working in agriculture.","[Popa, Ion; Cicea, Claudiu; Dobrin, Cosmin; Marinescu (Pirlogea), Corina] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Botez, Daniel] Vasile Alecsandri Univ Bacau, Bacau, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Bacau,"Popa, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ion.popa@man.ase.ro; claudiu.cicea@man.ase.ro; cosmin.dobrin@man.ase.ro; corina.pirlogea@ase.ro; Danie163331@yahoo.com,"Cicea, Claudiu C/H-7516-2013; Dobrin, Cosmin/AFW-2382-2022; Popa, Ion/H-5068-2016; Botez, Daniel/AAD-3498-2021; Cicea, Claudiu/GYA-2684-2022; Marinescu, Corina/AAF-9601-2021","Dobrin, Cosmin/0000-0002-8866-9643; Popa, Ion/0000-0003-0703-3828; Botez, Daniel/0000-0003-0986-7631; Cicea, Claudiu/0000-0002-5307-4447; Marinescu, Corina/0000-0002-1557-3245",European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/107/1.5/S/77213],European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was co-financed from the European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/107/1.5/S/77213 Ph.D. for a career in interdisciplinary economic research at the European standards",,28,1,1,0,17,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The whole Vyhon hill was historically a system of small fields, grassland patches, vineyards and orchards, and it is now a Natural Park with an area of 1700 ha, occupying the entire massif Vyhon. Current conditions include mostly arable land, growths of non-native trees (Robinia pseudacia, Ailanthus altissimus) and vineyards. The whole hill was terraced for the cultivation of wine, fruit trees and generally arable during end of last century. These terraces are the only refuge for steppe fauna, except Natural Monument (NM) Nove Hory in the Nature Park Vyhon. The steppe grasslands do not find elsewhere (except NM Nove Hory) than on the faces of these terraces. We chose this faces of terraces in various stages of succession for investigation of epigeic beetle fauna. We used pitfall traps, always in line of three traps of the hillside terraces. Determination currently underway, but so were frequently detected very important species of our steppe fauna: Sisyphus schaefferi, Dorcadion pedestre, Calosoma auropunctaum, Licinus cassideus, Brachinus crepitans and Brachinus explodens. All of these species are important from the rareness point of view. Majority of them are protected by Czech law (as threatened) and some of them are listed under Red List of invertebrates of the Czech Republic. The most widespread species were ground beetles of the genus Harpalus, which occurred at all localities. At each locality, found at least 5 species and at most 8 species of this genus. The largest proportion possessed genus Brachinus.

There were chosen these herbs: lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.), wild garlic (Allium ursinum L.), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) and Baikal skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis L.). The aqueous extracts in the amount of 5% were added into goat whey. These samples were stored at 6 degrees C for four weeks. The microbiological analysis (determining the groups: total plate count, coli-form bacteria, enterococci, thermo-resistant microorganisms), measuring of pH and titratable acidity were performed during storage. The rosemary extract was the only one that significantly reduced the titratable acidity of goat whey. The other three extracts showed mild decrease of titratable acidity. The pH came into lower undesirable values in all prepared samples with the addition of aqueous plant extracts. The results of microbiological analyses suggested that the aqueous extract of rosemary was inappropriate. It contributed to an increase of the number of microorganisms in all the studied groups. A clear opinion cannot be expressed for the other three extracts. To increase the dose of aqueous extracts of selected plants in goat whey would be probably more appropriate performing the results of future experiments devoted to antimicrobial activity of plant extracts.","[Tepla, J.; Luzova, T.; Roznovska, D.; Dvorak, L.; Sykora, V; Sustova, K.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Food Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Dostalova, L.; Prichystalova, J.; Kalhotka, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Teplá, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Food Technol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jana.tepla@mendelu.cz,"Sýkora, Vladimír/F-7486-2017; Kalhotka, Libor/I-8496-2018; Sustova, Kvetoslava/HDN-0072-2022","Sustova, Kvetoslava/0000-0001-6647-5533",,,,,10,2,2,0,0,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-908-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,614,620,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366464800106,0

The smaller disaggregation like localities level using direct estimators conducts to results of unreliable estimates and will surely lead to higher standard error and consequently, high coefficients of variation.

Individuals were randomized to four incentive groups: (a) no incentive, (b) prepaid cash incentive ($2), (c) a low lottery (10 prizes of $25) and (d) a high lottery (2 prizes of $250). Letters of invitation were mailed to 3,000 individuals. In total, 405 individuals (14.4%) contacted the website and 277 (9.8%) provided complete responses. The prepaid cash incentive generated the highest contact and response rates (23.3 and 17.3%, respectively), and no incentive generated the lowest (9.1 and 5.7%, respectively). The high lottery, however, was the most cost-effective incentive for obtaining completed surveys: compared with no incentive, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per completed survey for high lottery was $13.89; for prepaid cash, the ICER was $18.29. This finding suggests that the preferred response incentive for community-based, stated-preference surveys is a lottery with a small number of large prizes.","[Gajic, Aleksandra; Cameron, David; Hurley, Jeremiah] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada; [Gajic, Aleksandra; Cameron, David; Hurley, Jeremiah] McMaster Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Policy Anal, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Hurley, Jeremiah] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University,"Hurley, J (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, KTH 430,1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",hurley@mcmaster.ca,,,Canadian Institutes of Health Research [76670] Funding Source: Medline,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),,,34,35,45,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Remedial programmes are often difficult to evaluate because participation is usually based on pupil characteristics that are largely unobservable to the analyst. We evaluate programmes for children with 'Special Educational Needs' in England. We show that the decentralized design of the policy generates much stronger differences across schools in access to remediation resources for children with moderate learning difficulties than for children with either no difficulties or severe difficulties. However, these differences are not reflected in subsequent educational attainment - suggesting that the programme is ineffective for children with moderate learning difficulties. Also, we use demographic variation within schools to consider the effect of the programme on whole year groups. Our analysis is consistent with no overall effect on account of the combined direct and indirect (spillover) effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is however crucial to understand how these ideas have impacted national and local forest policy and management. The case of Vietnam is interesting and relevant because since the late 1980s, Vietnam's state forestry has undergone a reform towards sustainable management and social participation. This reform has triggered the emergence of two new policy discourses - 'forestry socialization' and 'sustainable forest management'. This article uses discourse analysis to investigate the implications of these discourses in Vietnam forestry. In particular, it examines the extent to which the 'forestry socialization' and 'sustainable forest management' discourses can be recognized in Vietnamese forest policy over the last 20 years. The results show that both discourses are well represented in policy documents and related discussions broad presence of both discourses. However, the findings also demonstrate the existence of discursive struggles among different coalitions over the interpretation of 'forestry socialization' and 'sustainable forest management'. We conclude that the two discourses have had a significant impact on how key actors in Vietnam forestry frame problems and solutions. However, the specific patterns in which the two discourses developed in the Vietnamese context also indicate that powerful elites have been hesitant to take further steps in forestry socialization.

It argues that whereas the MGM has great charm for economists, it fails to achieve acceptance by interested laypersons and policy makers. The main reasons for this failure are: (1) the assumption of a long and fixed planning horizon, (2) a fixed ratio between individuals healthcare expenditure and the cost of their own health-enhancing efforts regardless of their state of health, and (3) their presumed ability to restore the state of health deemed optimal at a speed that does not depend on their state of health. An alternative formulation emphasizing the stochastic nature of health production is sketched that conceptually provides solutions to these three problems. In addition, it permits discarding a popular medical argument that seems to undermine the very basis of welfare analysis applied to health by claiming preferences to be unstable: As long as you are healthy, you don't give a damn, but as soon as you are sick, you are prepared to sacrifice everything to restore your health.

This study presents a theoretically informed comparative political economy analysis focusing on various manifestations of the competition state with special reference to Turkey. To this end, an overview of the competition state literature is presented in order to convey the main dynamics of political globalization under pressures for increased economic integration. Analytically, four crucial policy shifts propounded by the competition state theorists are taken on board. These include the transition from inflationary expansionism to neoliberal monetarism; the shift from macroeconomic to microeconomic governance; the shift from extensive interventionism to strategic targeting; and the shift from maximization of social welfare to promotion of innovation, profitability, and entrepreneurship in public and private sectors. An external dimension is added to these shifts in the form of the transition from a geopolitically determined national security mentality to the dominance of economic diplomacy and the quest for increased competitiveness. Following a vigilant analysis of Turkey's first and second generation neoliberal transformation experiments in light of these five profound policy shifts, the author concludes that the Turkish state could at best be described as a nascent competition state with varying levels of advancement in each of the studied dimensions.","Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University,"Ünay, S (通讯作者)，Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Istanbul, Turkey.",sadikunay@hotmail.com,"Ünay, Sadık/AAT-5593-2020",,,,,,61,3,3,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The aim is to estimate prediction models for long-term AD progression and subsequently economic outcomes. Three-year follow-up data on 435 patients treated with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil in clinical practise were analyzed. Regression models were estimated for long-term prediction of decline in cognitive function (ADAS-cog) and activities in daily living (ADL) ability, risk of institutionalization and costs of care. The cognitive deterioration was estimated at between 1.6 and 4 ADAS-cog points per every 6 months, increasing with disease severity. Cognitive function was an important predictor of ADL-ability, which itself was the most important predictor of the risk of institutionalization and costs of care. Combining all models in a cross-validation process generated accurate predictions of costs of care at each 6 months follow-up. The proposed methods for representing AD progression and economic outcomes can be used in micro-simulation models for the economic evaluation of new treatments.","[Gustavsson, Anders; Jonsson, Linus] i3 Innovus, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gustavsson, Anders; Andreasen, Niels] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurobiol Caring Sci & Soc, Stockholm, Sweden; [Parmler, Johan] EPSI Rating, London, England; [Wattmo, Carina; Wallin, Asa K.; Minthon, Lennart] Lund Univ, Clin Memory Res Unit, Dept Clin Sci, Malmo, Sweden",i3 Innovus; Karolinska Institutet; Lund University,"Gustavsson, A (通讯作者)，i3 Innovus, Klarabergsviadukten 90 Hus D, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden.",anders.gustavsson@i3innovus.com,"Wallin, Åsa k/AAL-4557-2020; Jönsson, Linus/G-2253-2017; Wallin, Åsa/AAB-1737-2021","Jönsson, Linus/0000-0001-5751-6292;",,,,,34,5,5,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, it is unclear how objective socio-economic and institutional conditions affect subjective feelings of insecurity. Based on a review of the relevant literature, we hypothesize that objective contextual factors of labour market characteristics, levels of social protection and levels of internationalization and globalization exacerbate or mitigate subjective feelings of insecurity. We derive and test specific hypotheses using data from the fourth round of the European Social Survey (fielded 2008/2009). Based on our multilevel analysis of 18 412 individuals in 19 countries, we find that socio-economic (GDP) and institutional (welfare state effort) factors are relevant to subjective socio-economic insecurity, whereas the degree of internationalization (economic globalization, share of foreign-born population) plays a surprisingly negligible role. Moreover, significant cross-level interactions among social class and income inequality, unemployment, labour market regulation and economic globalization indicate that these country-level factors have a class-specific impact.","[Mau, Steffen; Mewes, Jan; Schoeneck, Nadine M.] Univ Bremen, Dept Sociol, Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Mau, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Dept Sociol, Bremen, Germany.",smau@bigsss.uni-bremen.de,"Mewes, Jan/AAE-6251-2022","Mewes, Jan/0000-0003-4974-2956; Mau, Steffen/0000-0002-4771-1673",,,,,83,61,64,5,92,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In addition to tariffs and quotas, countries can offer tax relief, low interest financing, reduced regulation, and other subsidies to domestic industries facing foreign competition. In a trade agreement, countries typically agree to reduce not only tariffs but also subsidies. We consider the effect of a free trade agreement on pollution emissions. We show that while reducing tariffs may indeed increase output and pollution, reductions in some subsides required by the trade agreement reduce pollution in general equilibrium for reasonable parameter values. Reducing subsidies has three effects on pollution: (1) reducing subsidies to firms reduces pollution-causing capital accumulation, (2) if subsidized firms are more pollution intensive, then reducing subsides moves capital and labor from more to less pollution intensive firms, and (3) reducing subsidies concentrates production in more productive firms, increasing output and thus pollution. We derive straightforward conditions for which (1) and (2) outweigh (3). We then calibrate the model to China in 1997, and find that pollution has a more elastic response to reducing subsidies than to reducing tariffs. While a 5% reduction in tariffs increases all pollutants by approximately 1%, a 5% reduction in subsidies reduces pollution by 1.8-11.6%, depending on the pollutant. The reductions in pollution occur without any environmental side agreements or abatement policy changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This article addresses this gap in the literature using survey results for a matched sample of charter and traditional public school principals. We compare regression-adjusted survey responses of charter and traditional public school principals to examine whether charter school principals report placing more emphasis on teacher hiring than principals in traditional public schools and whether principals' preferences for teacher qualifications and characteristics vary between charter and traditional public schools. While we find some mean differences in principals' reported hiring focus and preferences across charter and traditional public schools, regression results indicate that these differences are driven not by charter status but by school characteristics, such as average teacher experience and school enrollment.","[Engel, Mimi] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Leadership Policy & Org, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Cannata, Marisa] Vanderbilt Univ, Natl Ctr Sch Choice, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University,"Engel, M (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Leadership Policy & Org, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",marisa.cannata@vanderbilt.edu; mimi.engel@vanderbilt.edu,,"Engel, Mimi/0000-0001-7527-1815",,,,,55,16,20,0,17,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

J,"Romano, O",,,,"Romano, Onofrio",,,"How to rebuild democracy, re-thinking degrowth",FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Can the degrowth project contribute to rediscovering the meaning of democracy? Can the establishment of a real democracy lead to building a degrowth society? And last, has the project of a democratic degrowth a real chance to succeed, from a political point of view? If not, how should degrowth be re-thought to foster democracy? These are the questions entertained in this opinion essay. My thesis is that the currently dominant formulation of degrowth and its relationship to democracy are highly problematic. The degrowth proposal reproduces a central paradox of modernity concerning democracy: degrowth does not aspire to restore collective legein; it only works like a teukein, offering techniques that will allow the human species merely to stay alive. Moreover, there is a political problem: while the need for degrowth is presented as very urgent, the tactic for spreading the idea is one of an elitist strategy of voluntary simplicity, which can only work very slowly. The moralistic ideal of voluntary simplicity runs counter to the dominant de-modernized human subject that is becoming prevalent in our societies; as a result, degrowth cannot connect to real social processes and to the emotions of the large part of the population. To make degrowth feasible and to restore democracy, we need to deflate modern subjectivity. Drawing inspiration from Mediterranean anthropologies, I propose a foundation of degrowth on a human subject of de-thinking and I discuss the political pathways for such an alternative degrowth project.

Site and stage-specific treatment pathways were constructed from guidelines and validated by expert clinical opinion. Health care resource use associated with diagnosis, treatment and follow-up were obtained from the National Cancer Registry Ireland (n=1,498 cancers diagnosed during 2004-2005) and three local hospital databases (n=155, 142 and 46 cases diagnosed in 2007). Unit costs for hospitalisation, procedures, laboratory tests and radiotherapy were derived from DRG costs, hospital finance departments, clinical opinion and literature review. Chemotherapy costs were estimated from local hospital protocols, pharmacy departments and clinical opinion. Uncertainty was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In 2008, the average (stage weighted) lifetime cost of managing a case of colorectal cancer was a,not sign39,607. Average costs were 16% higher for rectal (a,not sign43,502) than colon cancer (a,not sign37,417). Stage I disease was the least costly (a,not sign23,688) and stage III most costly (a,not sign48,835). Diagnostic work-up and follow-up investigations accounted for 4 and 5% of total costs, respectively. Cost estimates were most sensitive to recurrence rates and prescribing of biological agents. This study demonstrates the value of using existing data from national and local databases in contributing to estimating the cost of managing cancer. The findings illustrate the impact of biological agents on costs of cancer care and the potential of strategies promoting earlier diagnosis to reduce health care resource utilisation and care costs.","[Tilson, L.; Usher, C.; Walsh, C.; Barry, M.] St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Sharp, L.; O'Ceilleachair, A.; Comber, H.] Natl Canc Registry Ireland, Cork, Ireland; [Walsh, C.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Stat, Dublin, Ireland; [Whyte, S.; Tappenden, P.; Chilcott, J.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Dublin, Ireland; [Kennedy, M.

Qualitative contextual information was collected in six villages, followed by a structured household (n = 180) survey that included four quarterly income surveys. The average forest income share of total annual household income was 22%, ranging from 12 to 31%. For all income groups, the level of forest income exceeded (except for livestock income for the most well-off income quartile) income from each of agricultural products and livestock products. In absolute terms, the level of forest income increased with total income. Forest income mainly supports current consumption. Determinants of household absolute and relative forest income were available labour, education, and location. The number of livestock units and degree of debt had positive effects on absolute forest income, while the size of remittances and savings had negative effects on forest dependency. Income diversification was the norm for all income groups. There is also clear evidence of differential income diversification both across and within income sources. The consequences for policy-makers are briefly discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is limited information about patients' attitude toward this type of care. The purpose of this study was to measure French cancer patients' willingness to pay (WTP) for home blood transfusion and to analyze determinants of their choice. A contingent valuation survey was administered to 139 patients receiving transfusions in the framework of a regional home care network or in the hospital outpatient department. Participation was high (90%). Most patients (65%) had received home care, including 43% blood transfusions. Just under half of the patients gave a zero WTP, among which we identified 8 protest bidders. The median WTP for home blood transfusion was 26.5 a,not sign per patient. In multivariate analysis, long home-hospital distance, poor quality of life, and previous experience of home care were identified as important factors in determining how much more patients would be willing to pay for transfusion at home. These results demonstrate the benefits of developing domiciliary services to improve patient well-being, notably for the weakest among them. The significant impact of previous home care experience on WTP is probably related to the strong involvement of physicians from the blood center and to their active contribution to a high-level homecare network. Some of our findings could be useful for policy decision-making regarding home care.","[Morelle, Magali; Remonnay, Raphael; Carrere, Marie-Odile] Univ Lyon, GATE Lyon St Etienne, Leon Berard Comprehens Canc Ctr, F-69373 Lyon 08, France; [Havet, Nathalie] Univ Lyon, GATE Lyon St Etienne, F-69130 Ecully, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; UNICANCER; Centre Leon Berard; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2,"Morelle, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, GATE Lyon St Etienne, Leon Berard Comprehens Canc Ctr, 28 Rue Laennec, F-69373 Lyon 08, France.",havet@gate.cnrs.fr; morelle@lyon.fnclcc.fr; raphael_remonnay@sfr.fr; mo.carrere@wanadoo.fr,"Havet, Nathalie/AHC-2729-2022",,,,,,65,15,17,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

A scenario process in the coastal community of Vega in central Norway was complemented by a survey among 200 community residents in which respondents rated a preferred development option from a series of future choices and dilemmas. While the scenario process produced novelty and diversity in thinking about the future, the common community view reflects a more traditionalistic view of the future. Tourism was identified as a key economic opportunity in the scenario process, but the larger island community has little faith in tourism as a future cornerstone of economic development and would rather rely on traditional sectors like agriculture and fisheries. The scenarios brought out richness in future development options, highlighted place identity and support for heritage conservation based on wise use of natural resources. The scenarios were less suited for making decisions about economic investments, but produced salient information about opportunities, uncertainties and complexities of the future. Findings show the need to compliment scenario processes where a small group explores possible futures with surveys to explore the wider populations' views about preferred futures.

We distinguish two transmission channels, an amenity channel and an economic geography channel. Based on annual, cross-country panel data for sub-Saharan Africa, we present an empirical model that suggests that weather anomalies increased internal and international migration through both channels. We estimate that temperature and rainfall anomalies caused a total net displacement of 5 million people during the period 1960-2000, i.e. a minimum of 128,000 people every year.

For a short time, the German Statutory Health Insurance makes use of these methods to support reimbursement decisions on patented drugs. In this context, the discounting procedure emerges as a critical component of these methods, as discount rates can strongly affect the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The aim of this paper is to identify the appropriate value of a social discount rate to be used by the German Statutory Health Insurance for the economic evaluation of health technologies. On theoretical grounds, we build on the widespread view of contemporary economists that the social rate of time preference (SRTP) is the adequate social discount rate. For quantifying the SRTP, we first apply the market behaviour approach, which assumes that the SRTP is reflected in observable market interest rates. As a second approach, we derive the SRTP from optimal growth theory by using the Ramsey equation. A major part of the paper is devoted to specify the parameters of this equation. Depending on various assumptions, our empirical findings result in the range of 1.75-4.2% for the SRTP. A reasonable base case discount rate for Germany, thus, would be about 3%. Furthermore, we deal with the much debated question whether a common discount rate for costs and health benefits or a lower rate for health should be applied in health economic evaluations. In the German social health insurance system, no exogenously fixed budget constraint does exist. When evaluating a new health technology, the health care decision maker is obliged to conduct an economic evaluation in order to examine whether there is an economically appropriate relation between the value of the health gains and the additional costs which are given by the value of the consumption losses due to the additional health care expenditures. Therefore, a discount rate lower than the SRTP for consumption should be applied if an increase in the consumption value of health is expected. However, given the limited empirical evidence on the relationship between consumption and the value of health, it is hardly possible to make reliable forecasts of this value. Regarding the practice of the German evaluation authority, it is not recommended to use differential discounting in the base case. Instead, the issue of differential discounting should be addressed in sensitivity analyses. Reducing the discount rate for health compared to the rate for costs by a figure in the range between near 0% and 3% may be considered to be appropriate for Germany.","[Schad, Mareike; John, Juergen] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Munich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"John, J (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Munich, Germany.",john@helmholtz-muenchen.de,,,,,,,83,30,30,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We develop a spatially explicit two-dimensional model of species spread that allows for differential control across space and time, and we solve for optimal spatial-dynamic control strategies. The qualitative nature of optimal strategies depends in interesting ways on aspects of landscape and invasion geometry. For example, reducing the extent of exposed invasion edge, through spread, removal, or strategically employing landscape features, can be optimal because it reduces long-term containment costs. Optimal invasion control is spatially and temporally forward-looking in the sense that strategies should be targeted to slow or prevent the spread of an invasion in the direction of greatest potential long-term damages. These spatially explicit characterizations of optimal policies contribute insights and intuition to the largely nonspatial literature on controlling invasions and to understanding control of spatial-dynamic processes in general.

In the first section of the paper, timber yield functions for all eucalyptus monoculture clones and seedlings are identified. Next, the biological optimum rotation period for maximizing sustained yield is calculated based on the yield functions for each soil type. In the last section, the economically optimal rotation (EOR) lengths for all clones and seedlings planted in the two types of soil are calculated using a modified Faustmann model. The results indicate that eucalypts in Fluvic Gleysol will produce larger timber yields than in Ferric Acrisol. Among the clones commonly planted in Northeast Vietnam, eucalyptus clones 1116 and PN14 can yield the largest timber volumes in Fluvic Gleysol and Ferric Acrisol, respectively. Our EOR model reveals that EOR lengths of eucalyptus plantations in Northeast Vietnam are longer than the biological rotation time by 1-3 years under the governmentally subsidized credit scheme for rural households. If growers borrow from commercial and private entities, such rotation period will be substantially shortened and negative site values will appear in a number of cases. Nevertheless, wherever eucalyptus clones are economically qualified, their EOR length is longer than what is currently practiced. To capture the highest profits from eucalypt plantations, growers should extend their current farming business cycle of 7 years to 14-18 years under the subsidized credit scheme and to 10-12 years under the commercial borrowing interest rate. As increasing land use profitability is of great concern across the region, these findings are of practical importance for Vietnamese farmers in choosing clones, land lots, and economic optimal rotation for their farming businesses.

With that aim, the Economic Agreement of 1981 established a Free Trade Area, operational since 1983, in the expectation that it would promote regional trade creation and, in turn, greater economic and monetary integration among the Member States. However, most of its provisions for an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) never took effect. Thus, twenty years after its entry into force, the GCC Supreme Council agreed to revise the terms of the Economic Agreement. The Economic Agreement of 2001 now regulates the economic programme of the GCC. A timetable for the establishment of a Monetary Union was approved at the same time with a proposal to introduce a single currency by 1 January 2010. However, only four of the six Member States (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia) have concluded the Monetary Union Agreement of 2008 and, to date, the single currency remains a proposal only. The GCC has failed to achieve any significant level of economic and monetary integration: ultimately, the EMU and single currency are yet to materialize. On that premise, the article critiques the scope and effect of implementation of the Economic Agreements of 1981 and 2001 as it examines the origins and development of economic and monetary integration in the GCC.","[Puig, Gonzalo Villalta] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Law, Master Laws Programme Int Econ Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Al-Khodiry, Amer] Gen Dept Advisors, Majlis Ash Shura, Saudi Arabia",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Puig, GV (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Law, Master Laws Programme Int Econ Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,41,9,10,0,12,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Such strategies include privatisation, rescaling governance in order to detour state-based decision structures, externalising negative costs, internalising externalities in search of profit via, e.g., a more responsible corporate image, and moving state functions to non-state actors. We examine 1) how the environment and other factors motivate neoliberal strategies, 2) how different stakeholders have reacted to the neoliberal strategies, and 3) what the social and environmental outcomes of these strategies are. We examine these questions regarding two cases in northern Finland: the closure of a formerly state-owned pulp mill in Kemijarvi, and the market-based pressure strategies of NGOs towards state-based forestry in triad. We make a set of conclusions on the nature of the neoliberal strategies regarding the three previously mentioned questions. These conclusions relate to the observations that internalisation of negative externalities happens only under pressure, that the resistance towards neoliberal strategies is often inefficient, and that neoliberal strategies lead to marginalisations and empowerments. Previously state-dominated forestry decision-making in Finland seems to be changing towards decisions put forward by market actors, such as corporations, civil society actors, such as NGOs, and local actor groups.

Evidence from Wisconsin's inter-district public school program,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,School competition; Vouchers; Charter schools; Open enrollment program,CHARTER SCHOOLS; OPEN ENROLLMENT; ACHIEVEMENT; PARTICIPATION; COMPETITION,"This paper examines the competitive effects of a unique school choice program implemented in the late 1990s, Wisconsin's open enrollment program, which allows families to send their children to schools outside their home district. In contrast to other school choice programs, districts not only face negative consequences from losing students and state funding, but they also stand to gain in the event of student emigration from other districts. The identification approach exploits differences in the number of schools in bordering districts, which affects inter-district ease-of-transfer. Estimates produce three main conclusions. First, districts that experience student out-migration produce higher standardized test scores in the subsequent year. Second, these effects are most evident among districts for which out-migration, expressed as a percentage of enrollment, falls in the upper quartile of all districts under consideration. Third, districts do not appear to respond to in-migration, indicating that districts place more emphasis on (and have more control over) preventing out-migration, as opposed to encouraging in-migration. These findings provide evidence that schools respond to competitive forces by improving quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

One implication is that protection of public health may be affected if access to medicines is restricted by the relevant patent provisions in these TRIPS-plus provisions. The interpretation approach adopted by WTO has led to an understanding of TRIPS in a manner supportive to public health. Many FTAs have established their own interpretation approach that will also impact on issues concerning access to medicines and public health. The patent provisions in the TRIPS-plus provisions seem to cause conflict between the protection of public health in TRIPS and that in TRIPS-plus regimes if higher levels of patent protection are adopted in FTAs. This article analyses the relationship between the approaches to interpretation of TRIPS and TRIPS-plus and discusses the impact of this interpretive relationship. This article examines the object and purpose of TRIPS and its subsequent developments for the interpretation of TRIPS-plus. This article then discusses the justification of heightened patent protection in the TRIPS-plus and the justification narrative upon the interpretation of the patent provisions in FTAs. This article then concludes that the interpretation of the patent protection provisions in the TRIPS-plus should be conducted with reference to TRIPS and its subsequent developments in order to harmonize TRIPS and TRIPS-plus in the context of public health protection.,"Univ S Australia, Sch Law, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of South Australia,"Xiong, P (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Sch Law, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",Ping.Xiong@unisa.edu.au,"Xiong, Ping/F-4668-2013","Xiong, Ping/0000-0001-6365-603X",,,,,73,2,4,1,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Increasingly, seeds are traded across borders. While international companies often consider the growers expectations, local consumers are often ignored. Although consumers' expectations shape buying behaviours, often they are non-verbal and hard to know. Knowing these expectations may be advantageous for seed companies in several ways: (1) they can adjust their strategies and products to meet consumers' needs; (2) if expectations are acquired and applied quickly, it may provide a competitive advantage; and (3) it can enhance companies' attractiveness among end-users and increase their bargaining power vis-a-vis immediate downstream customers in the value chain. In this paper, we extract the main players' expectations in a mini cucumber value chain using the free association method. We then rank order these expectations applying Friedman's test. Finally, we analyze the expectations with a hedonic/utilitarian approach and provide a means for upstream seed companies to have a better understanding of end users' expectations.","[Bekhradi, F.; Bekhradi, F.] Univ Tehran, Tehran 14174, Iran",University of Tehran,"Bekhradi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Tehran 14174, Iran.",,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66050-68-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2012,930.0,,,,,,49,53,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.930.5,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BDT45,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314782400005,0

Study of the changes in the cortical granule (CG) population in oocytes is indispensable for understending the mechanism of how oocytes block polyspermic penetration and for developing optimum conditions for in vitro maturation and in vitro embryo production. The effect of follicle size and the effect of estrous cycle phase on the lokalization of cortical granules in pig oocytes was studied. A total of 185 oocytes collected from small or medium follicles in the early, middle and late luteal and the early follicular phase were used. For cortical granules staining were used fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled PNA (Sigma). The movement of cortical granules were assessed with laser confocal microscope and MS Elements AR 3.00 software. The index of CG distribution (I-dkg) was formationed. The Index of CG distribution represents ratio between average signal (FITC) intenzity in peripheral part of oocyte and average intenzity signal (FITC) in central part of oocyte. Data were related to the follicle size, with regard to the phase. Regardless of the follicle size the index of CG distribution was significantly (P<0.01) higher (2.22 +/- 0.49) for the medium follicle derived oocytes than for the small follicle derived oocyte (1.48 +/- 0.31). With regard to the phase, in the small follicle derived oocytes, the CG density index increased significantly (P<0.01) from the early luteal (1.2 +/- 0.4) to the early follicular (1.7 +/- 0.4) phase. With regard to the phase, in the medium follicle derived oocytes no differences were found. It can be concluded that greater meiotic competence of porcine oocytes influences distribution of cortical granules to the peripheral part of oocytes.","[Hanulakova, S.; Milakovic, I; Blahova, E.; Machal, L.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Jeseta, M.; Hanzalova, K.; Knitlova, D.] Vet Res Inst, Dept Genet & Reprod, Brno 62100, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Veterinary Research Institute,"Hanuláková, S (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Anim Breeding, Zemedelska 1-1665, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",sarka.hanulakova@mendelu.cz,"Jeseta, Michal/A-3159-2013; Machal, Ladislav/K-7596-2018","Jeseta, Michal/0000-0003-1778-3454; Machal, Ladislav/0000-0001-6638-4404",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-836-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,942,948,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366461200108,0

Our empirical analysis of companies listed on China's stock exchanges provides insightful findings. First, the size of CBRP transactions is positively associated with concentrated ownership, CEO (chief executive officer) duality, and an imbalance of power among large shareholders. Furthermore, the size of CBRP transactions tends to decrease as the proportion of outside directors rises, but it is likely to increase as the outside directors' compensations become larger. State-owned companies make more CBRP transactions than non-state-owned companies.

The results show that women are more likely to be credit constrained than men. Rather than wealth, informal lenders seem to rely more on reputation and credit history to screen prospective borrowers, and the consequences of repayment delays or defaults are more severe for women than for men. These findings provide empirical support for women-targeted credit interventions in urban poor contexts, particularly those that enable women to build and capitalize on good credit histories.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Malapit, HJL (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",hmalapit@worldbank.org,,"Malapit, Hazel/0000-0002-7394-8797",,,,,37,14,16,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

This paper describes the results of a series of semi-structured interviews to explore real-life cases of growth paths towards a process-oriented organisation. 10 organisations gave insight in their respective historical growth paths and future implementation plans. We analysed whether their growth paths altered and how exactly they came to their current maturity level. Our cases were compared on structure, strategy, timing, sponsorship, etc. to discover how these would influence the growth path and the degree of BPM maturity. This research contributes to the understanding of the trail that organisations take towards high BPM maturity, will help readers to benchmark their efforts and eventually aid them in developing a roadmap to become process-oriented.","[Van den Bergh, Joachim] Vlerick Leuven Gent Management Sch, Ghent, Belgium; [Viaene, Stijn] Vlerick Leuven Gent Management Sch, Leuven, Belgium",Vlerick Business School; Vlerick Business School,"Van den Bergh, J (通讯作者)，Vlerick Leuven Gent Management Sch, Ghent, Belgium.",Joachim.vandenbergh@vlerick.com; Stijn.Viaene@vlerick.com,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-7-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,362,+,,,,,,5,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO26,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549800033,0

This paper addresses this question for accidental pollution, which government regulates through the ex post liability regimes of either negligence or strict liability. We find that decentralizing the choice between these regimes does not, in general, induce the socially optimal outcome. When firms can pay all damages, all regions may choose negligence and impose an overly strict standard of due care. When firms may be bankrupted by damages, all regions may choose strict liability, which induces too little care. In addition, asymmetric equilibria are possible in which some regions choose negligence, others strict liability. Combining negligence with a Pigovian tax, or strict liability with a bonding requirement can align regional authorities' incentives with those of a central government. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A necessary condition for competition among hospitals is that patients do not automatically choose the nearest hospital, but are-at least to some extent-sensitive to differences in hospital quality. In this study, an analysis is performed on the underlying features of patient hospital choice in a setting where prices do not matter for patients as a result of health insurance coverage. Using claims data from all Dutch hospitals over the years 2008-2010, a conditional logit model examines the relationship between patient characteristics (age, gender and reoperations) and hospital attributes (hospital quality information, waiting times on treatments and travel time for patients to the hospitals) in the market for general non-emergency hip replacement treatments. The results show that travel time is the most important determinant in patient hospital choice. From our analysis, however, it follows that publicly available hospital quality ratings and waiting times also have a significant impact on patient hospital choice. The panel data used for this study (2008-2010) is rather short, which may explain why no coherent and persistent changes in patient hospital choice behaviour over time are found.","[Beukers, Puck D.

This paper investigates the extent to which course repeaters in high school mathematics courses exert negative externalities on their course-mates. Using individual and school-specific course fixed effects to control for ability and course selection, it shows that increasing the share of repeaters in a given course results in a moderate, significant increase in the probability of course failure for first-time course-takers. Results suggest that the negative effect is only evident when the share of repeaters reaches a threshold of five to ten percent of the total number of course-takers. The possibility that grading to a curve generates the effect cannot be ruled out, but is not fully supported in the data. Evidence is also presented that course repetition externalities may be distinct from low-ability peer effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While there are some advanced initiatives focused on forest governance assessment at international/national scale, there are relatively few at local level. However, assessments of local forest governance would be useful for both policy-makers and practitioners. The paper presents and discusses an original set of indicators to measure the quality of forest governance at local administrative/spatial level and the method used to develop them. A draft list of indicators (mainly process-oriented) has been formulated with respect to seven governance key-dimensions (sustainability, efficiency, effectiveness, participation, transparency, accountability and capacity). This draft list has been tested in two pilot applications (data collection by means of questionnaires). The indicators, which include both dichotomous and continuous variables, can be standardized in a few composite indicators to provide concise information about governance performance. Despite some methodological limitations that need to be further explored, the final set of 78 indicators appears to be a simple and practicable assessment tool, that can be used either for external or internal evaluations. Additional tests are needed to consolidate the tool. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The review distinguishes itself from previous similar reviews by having a high degree of transparency for the search strategy used to identify the studies included in the review as well as the criteria for inclusion and by including the most recent literature. Empirical studies were identified by performing searches in EconLit. The literature search identified a total of 47 studies of the behavioural effects of copayment. Considering the demand effects, the majority of the reviewed studies found that copayment reduces the use of prescription medicine, consultations with general practitioners and specialists, and ambulatory care, respectively. The literature found no significant effects of copayment on the prevalence of hospitalisations. The empirical evidence on whether copayment for some services, but not for others, causes substitution from the services that are subject to copayment to the 'free' services rather than lower total use is sparse and mixed. Likewise, the health effects of copayment have only been analysed empirically in a limited number of studies, of which half did not find any significant effects in the short term. Finally, the empirical evidence on the distributional consequences of copayment indicates that individuals with low income and in particular need of care generally reduce their use relatively more than the remaining population in consequence of copayment. Hence, it is clear that copayment involves some important economic and political trade-offs.","[Kiil, Astrid; Houlberg, Kurt] Danish Inst Local & Reg Govt Res, KORA, DK-1150 Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Kiil, A (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Local & Reg Govt Res, KORA, Kobmagergade 22, DK-1150 Copenhagen, Denmark.",aski@kora.dk,,,,,,,71,99,100,3,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The sector, while providing valuable employment in rural areas, is beleaguered by environmental and social issues. Proponents of decentralisation argue that re-distributing decision-making authority leads to more responsive, transparent and efficient natural resource management. The analysis presented here, however, demonstrates how weak decentralisation has exacerbated the complex, conflictual and clandestine nature of local resource politics surrounding ASM. If future decentralisation reforms are going to reverse this trend and improve the governance of ASM in Ghana, then facilitating the participation of traditional authorities is imperative. It is argued that doing so requires addressing the reticence regarding the role of chiefs in resource governance; simply ironing out existing technical issues with decentralisation reforms is unlikely to improve the social and environmental performance of ASM in the country. In light of the chronic resource management deficiencies in Ghana, epitomised in the ASM sector, fostering frank political debates on resource governance is becoming urgent. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The harvesting regimes are whole-tree harvesting with stump removal and conventional stem-only harvesting. The harvesting regimes are evaluated under two alternative climate policy contexts. The first alternative is a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, which assumes the carbon dioxide (CO2) neutrality of bioenergy and produces substitution benefits, as bioenergy replaces fossil fuels. The second alternative climate policy, a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy, takes into account the fact that bioenergy causes carbon dioxide emissions, producing substitution costs, and that harvested woody biomass affects the ability of a forest to act as a carbon sink. We extend the traditional Faustmann (1849) rotation model to include nutrient load damage, biodiversity benefits, and climate impacts. The empirical analysis is based on Finnish data from a catchment experiment carried out on drained peatland forests. The empirical results show that under a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, whole-tree harvesting with stump removal produces the highest net social benefits. However, if a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy is assumed, the net social benefits are greater under stem-only harvesting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Against this background the authors report the lessons learnt in developing and testing a new PMS that they have devised advancing on the Balance Scorecard (BSC) approach. In reviewing three cases in which their system was applied, they highlight that the inclusion of Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA) would have prevented some of the failures experienced. FTA is seen as crucial in linking strategy and operations with a long-term vision of where a firm sees itself in the future. In this regard, FTA holds the promise to embed critical aspects for jointly shaping common directions to follow across a firm's value chain. These include the notion of stakeholder involvement in decision processes of mutual appreciation and a shared understanding of stakeholders' views as well as of joint experimentation and mutual learning. The authors conclude by highlighting specific ways in which FTA can be integrated in the PMS proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives To assess the cost-of-illness and quality of life of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in Hungary. Methods Consecutive patients with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) >10 and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) >10, or treated with traditional systemic (TST) or biological systemic treatment (BST) were included. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, psoriasis related medication, health care utilizations and employment status in the previous 12 months were recorded. Costing was performed from the societal perspective applying the human capital approach. Quality of life was assessed using DLQI and EQ-5D measures. Results Two-hundred patients were involved (females 32 %) with a mean age of 51 (SD 13) years, 103 (52 %) patients were on BST. Mean PASI, DLQI and EQ-5D scores were 8 (SD 10), 6 (SD 7) and 0.69 (SD 0.3), respectively. The mean total cost was (sic)9,254/patient/year (SD 8,502) with direct costs accounting for 86 %. The main cost driver was BST (mean (sic)7,339/patient/year). Total costs differed significantly across treatment subgroups, mean (SD): no systemic therapy (sic)2,186 (4,165), TST (sic)2,388 (4,106) and BST (sic)15,790 (6,016) (p < 0,001). Patients with BST had better PASI and DLQI scores (p < 0.01) than the other two subgroups. Conclusions Patients with biological treatment have a significantly better quality of life and higher total costs than patients with or without traditional systemic treatment. Our study is the largest in Europe and the first in the CEE region that provides cost-of-illness data in psoriasis involving patients with BST.","[Balogh, Orsolya; Brodszky, Valentin; Gulacsi, Laszlo; Baji, Petra] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Heredi, Emese; Remenyik, Eva; Szegedi, Andrea] Univ Debrecen, Dept Dermatol & Dermatol Allergol, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Herszenyi, Krisztina; Jokai, Hajnalka; Karpati, Sarolta; Hollo, Peter] Semmelweis Univ, Dept Dermatovenereol & Oncodermatol, H-1085 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; University of Debrecen; Semmelweis University,"Gulácsi, L (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",laszlo.gulacsi@uni-corvinus.hu,"Holló, Peter/Q-6505-2018; Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023; Brodszky, Valentin/AFN-4112-2022; Baji, Petra/JHV-1617-2023; Karpati, Sarolta/E-5786-2018","Brodszky, Valentin/0000-0002-6095-2295; Baji, Petra/0000-0003-2899-8557; Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746; Karpati, Sarolta/0000-0002-8472-0712",,,,,33,23,23,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intramuscular interferon beta-1a (IM IFN beta-1a), subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (SC IFN beta-1a), interferon beta-1b (IFN beta-1b) and glatiramer acetate (GA) relative to best supportive care in a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 RRMS patients in Spain. The model was developed from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 30 years. Natural history and clinical trial data were used to model relapse rates and disease progression. Cost and utility data were obtained from a published survey of multiple sclerosis patients in Spain. The primary outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Compared to best supportive care, the base case cost-effectiveness was a,not sign168,629 per QALY gained for IM IFN beta-1a, a,not sign231,853 per QALY gained for IFN beta-1b, a,not sign295,638 per QALY gained for SC IFN beta-1a, and a,not sign318,818 per QALY gained for GA. Results were most sensitive to changes in DMT cost, utility values and treatment effect. In our cost-effectiveness analysis of first-line injectable DMTs in Spain, we found IM IFN beta-1a to be more cost-effective than SC IFN beta-1a, IFN beta-1b or GA. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results.","[Dembek, Carole] Avalere Hlth, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [White, Leigh Ann] Biogen Idec Inc, Weston, MA 02493 USA; [Quach, Jayson; Szkurhan, Andrea; Rashid, Nazia] Dymaxium, Toronto, ON M5A 1E3, Canada; [Blasco, M.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of triptan therapy for migraine was conducted from a health-care payer perspective in four European countries (France, Italy, Spain and the UK). The study included those orally administered triptans available in all of these countries (almotriptan, brand-name sumatriptan, generic sumatriptan, zolmitriptan), and it was performed using a decision-tree model that incorporated costs of the drugs and probabilities associated with the possible events and outcomes. Average cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in two different scenarios. The average cost-effectiveness ratio showed wide variations across the different countries, these differences being up to 131 % (almotriptan), 77 % (brand-name sumatriptan), 153 % (generic sumatriptan) and 77 % (zolmitriptan). Generic sumatriptan was the most cost-effective drug analysed in the studied countries.

A coherent methodology for the determination of 'likeness' has finally begun to emerge, with the same methodology having been adopted in the GAYS (Panel Report, China - Electronic Payments) and the TBT Agreement (Appellate Body Report, US - Clove Cigarettes). Yet, mainstream as the adoption of competition law methodology for the finding of 'likeness' may have become as of recent, its implementation by the adjudicating bodies of the WTO is still inadequate, as demonstrated by the disputes examined in this article. One recurrent problem is the choice of whose consumers' tastes and habits to take into account in the determination of 'likeness'. As shown in the article, competition law has had to deal with the same problem and has developed ways to address common fallacies arising out of relying on evidence regarding the choices of groups of consumers without the groups having been shown to be economically significant. The analysis suggests that the shortcomings of the application of competition law methodology at WTO dispute settlement can be easily addressed in the short-term by raising the awareness of the WTO Members, panels, and the Appellate Body to them, and by turning to competition law for readily available solutions, while increasing the institutional capacity of the adjudicating bodies of the WTO in the long-term.","[Iacovides, Marios C.] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Iacovides, MC (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Fiesole, Italy.",marios.Iacovides@jur.uu.se,"Iacovides, Marios/IWD-9853-2023","Iacovides, Marios/0000-0003-0151-0777",,,,,41,5,5,0,7,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The US challenged the duties for a variety a reasons, many of which involved deficiencies in the producers' application to China's investigating authority, the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM). The US also challenged certain aspects of MOFCOM's injury analysis. The Panel and Appellate Body ruled in favor of the US on virtually every issue. Given the deficiencies in the application and China's handling of the case, the Panel and AB decisions were justified.

Since biofuel production competes for land with agricultural production, a carbon tax could increase land rents and raise food prices. This paper analyzes the welfare effect of a carbon tax on fuel consisting of gasoline and biofuel in the presence of a labor tax, with and without a biofuel subsidy. The market impacts of a carbon tax are also compared with that of a subsidy. Findings show that if a carbon tax increases biofuel demand, the tax interaction effect due to higher fuel prices is exacerbated by higher land rent and food prices and greater erosion of the carbon tax base. Thus, the second best optimal carbon tax for fuel is lower with biofuel in the fuel mix, especially if biofuel is subsidized. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In selection-adjusted models, these effects generally fall to close to zero; however, these effects remain large for certain subgroups, such as for black and Hispanic students.","[Dale, Stacy B.] Mathemat Policy Res, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; [Krueger, Alan B.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Mathematica; Princeton University,"Dale, SB (通讯作者)，Mathemat Policy Res, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA.",,,,,,,,26,106,138,3,45,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

In 2004, the language of instruction in minority schools was changed from essentially minority language to a composite of 60% Latvian and 40% minority. This paper studies the effects of this '60/40' reform on the academic performance of pupils in minority schools. Using data on 2002-2011 centralised exam results for the universe of Latvia's secondary schools, we find that there has been a significant deterioration in the exam performance of minority schools relative to that of majority schools after the reform year 2004. The negative effects were most pronounced in the early years following the reform. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The absence of quota overages and lower aggregate discard levels suggest resource stewardship improved.

By resorting to various procedures and tools, the management of any retail brand seeks to develop in the consumer's mind a unique, different, attractive and particularly strong image of its own chain of stores. In addition to the supply of own items and brands, the location of store and the decision on the price levels, communication and store atmosphere fully contribute to shaping the customer's preference, contentment, satisfaction and, in the end, loyalty toward the store. The empirical research conducted on a sample of about 2000 people highlights, by comparison, the effect of communication and store atmosphere on building consumers' satisfaction with, and loyalty toward, various food and non-food retail formats. Based on the survey methodology and using the face-to-face questionnaire administration, the research reveals major differences in building loyalty. Concepts are carefully operationalized and analyzed with the aid of structural equation modeling. Finally, significant scientific results and a number of managerial implications are revealed.

The concept of the Internet of Things and Services envisions physical devices and appliances to be used as easily as a web service and seamlessly integrated into networked applications with required functionality. Technologically this concept is clear, and several smart applications are currently under development (see e.g. iCore, Hydra, Confidence or IoT@Work projects). However, the business perspective of information as an asset in its own right remains an open issue. To handle this issue we apply an originally value-based requirement technique, e3-value, to model value creation and value exchange within an e-business network of multiple business actors. Using this approach the business activity can be reduced to its core elements, which in the simplest case comprise the value proposition, distribution channels and the customers of the company, explaining how a multi-actor network creates, distributes and consumes value by production of a good or providing a service.

The approach of E-Government adoption and implementation is analyzed from the point of view of two theoretical perspectives: endogenous growth theory and institutional theory.

The empirical evidence based on the threshold regression approach shows that there indeed exists an institutional quality threshold effect in the relationship between financial development and income inequality. Financial development tends to reduce income inequality only after a certain threshold level of institutional quality has been achieved. Until then, the effect of financial development on income inequality is nonexistent. This finding suggests that institutional quality affects the link between financial development and income inequality, reflecting the notion that better quality finance results in more equal income distribution.","[Law, Siong Hook; Azman-Saini, W.

While classic finance assumes people rationalize and optimize their financial decisions, behavioral finance adds the importance of what investors should do and complements the mantra of traditional finance with what people actually do in terms of their economic decisions. The article reviews some psychological concepts relevant and used in the study, in an interdisciplinary effort of understanding the correlation or causality between psychology and finance. The paper aims at demonstrating whether investor psychological biases lead to investment performance deficit. In the research reported here investigated the market pattern zigzag to see any predilections or biases or a random walk. Analyzing the data for this study leads to the interesting conclusion that individual psychological biases and differences should not be confounded with noise within econometric models but rather manifest a solid influential role on the dependent variable - investment outcome. Data base source for the article shows that psychological characteristics have salient relationships with various aspects of investment decision making process making and the transactional activity of the individual investor. The statistical interrogation describes the sampling methodology, the frequency of data and the empirical methodology that lead to analysis of the results and concluding remarks.","[Mitroi, Adrian] AAFBR Romania, CFA Romania, Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Stancu, Ion] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Mitroi, A (通讯作者)，AAFBR Romania, CFA Romania, Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",adrian.mitroi@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,23,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

To meet this end, an analysis of the development strategies of three different communal units was made: Krakow municipality, Kety rural-urban commune, and Klucze rural commune. Based on a comparison of strategic and operational objectives included within the strategies, the hypothesis which claims that the type of units adopted to be analyzed influence the direction of their local development was confirmed. In their objectives of development strategies, all of the studied units emphasize the need to take action for economic development, education, and housing. However, the remaining strategic and operational objectives are divergent. The most significant difference was noticed between the municipality and the rural unit. Their targets range from fulfilling the need for international promotion of the city, to the necessity of ensuring the residents access to water and sewer systems. The conclusions derived from this analysis will allow further research. Its effect is to facilitate the selection of appropriate tools for local development in relation to a certain administrative unit.","[Norkowska, Emilia] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econ & Real Estate Investment Proc, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Norkowska, E (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econ & Real Estate Investment Proc, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",norkowska@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,WYZSZA SZKOLA BIZNESUNATL-LOUIS UNIV,NOWY SACZ,"ZIELONA 27, NOWY SACZ, 33-300, POLAND",2543-540X,2543-5388,978-83-62550-98-2,BUS NON-PROFIT ORGAN,,,2014,13.0,,,,,,277,291,,,,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE4CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371505700020,0

Our goal is to create dynamical financial system model that would express real economic situation and would respect even impact of history of factors considered. One such possibility how to properly express the dynamics of processes in the model is to describe the dynamic model using differential equations with delayed argument. Created financial system model is expressed as system of three delayed differential equations. The article presents graphical solution of the model, on which the influence of feedback on its behavior is tracked. Original, classical model is thus supplanted with new, that is closer to real economic situation, due to respecting the influence of history, using the so-called Delayed differential equations.","Brno Univ Technol, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Novotná, V (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",novotna@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Our results indicated: (1) there is a mismatch in the very definition of recreational fisheries between the fishery managers and resource users; (2) current management regulates the so called sport fishing, whereas three other recorded fisheries-reef fishing, blue fishing, and local recreational fishing-remain unregulated; (3) 26 bony fish species in the study area; and (4) the direct users (fishers) are primarily nonresidents, whereas the indirect users (service providers) are residents.

This mechanism is modeled for the Romanian economy by using a time varying structural vector autoregression model with drifting coefficients and heteroscedastic shocks. Both changes in the transmission mechanism and changes in the exogenous innovations are emphasized by using this model. Drifting coefficients are used in order to capture nonlinearities or time variation in the lag structure of the model and multivariate stochastic volatility is used to capture possible nonlinearities in the simultaneous relations between the variables of the model. Numerical methods are needed for estimation, therefore the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest, such as the unobservable states and the hyper-parameters, are evaluated by using Bayesian inference instead of classical maximum likelihood estimator. More precisely, Gibbs sampling is a particular variant of Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and is used for posterior numerical evaluation of the parameters. On the one hand, the objective of this paper is to analyze whether non-systematic monetary policy responses vary over time and whether the estimated coefficients show much time variation. Therefore, the stability of the responses of those variables forming the non-policy block to policy shock is estimated. On the other hand, the purpose is to observe whether the simultaneous and long run systematic monetary policy responses are correlated, whether the response is gradual or not, whether the Central Bank reacts faster to the evolution of a certain variable than to a different one and how these responses did evolve over time.","[Rosoiu, Andreea] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Rosoiu, A (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",andreea.rosoiu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-08-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,266,276,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450578000024,0

This is despite the fact that a number of innovations have improved quality and reduced prices for many input factors that contribute to the competitiveness of the industry. This article provides an analysis of productivity growth for one key input factor in salmon farming, juvenile salmon. We estimate translog cost functions on salmon hatcheries for the period 1988 to 2010. The econometric analysis shows that innovations and productivity growth have led to a reduction of unit costs in production of salmon juveniles, particularly at earlier stages, but the rate of technical progress has declined in recent years.","[Sandvold, Hilde Ness] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Tveteras, Ragnar] Univ Stavanger, Ctr Innovat Res, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Sandvold, HN (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",hilde.sandvold@uis.no,,"Tveteras, Ragnar/0000-0002-8553-556X",Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the Norwegian Research Council.,,40,31,31,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 CHESTNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The analysis highlights how an enforcement strategy can cause abatement-cost risk to be transmitted to enforcement costs via the price of permits. When this occurs, accommodating the effect of abatement-cost risk with an optimal policy results in higher expected emissions and lower expected permit price than their second-best optimal values. However, it is possible to design an enforcement strategy that shields enforcement costs from abatement-cost risk by tying sanctions directly to permit prices. This enforcement strategy stabilizes enforcement effort, the optimal permit supply and price controls are independent of enforcement costs, and the policy produces the second-best optimal outcome.

The ideal is as we are able to come up with closed form solutions for the infinite horizon ruin probability and the finite horizon ruin probability. But, the cases where this is possible are few; therefore we must make approximations of ruin probability. In this paper, we insist on the discrete time insurance model and on the diffusion approximation and so-called corrected di/fusion approximation (CDA). We analyze the ruin probability with respect to: the parameters of the individual claim distribution and the intensity parameter of the number of claims process. Ruin theory with debit and credit interest has received considerable attention in recent years. In this line, we consider a perturbed risk model in which a current premium rate will be adjusted in any period (usually year) in which there are no losses and any surplus available at the beginning of the period is reinvested. Also, we analyze and the inverse problem: to determine the initial reserve when it is given the ruin probability.","[Tanasescu, Paul] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania; [Mircea, Iulian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Appl Math, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tanasescu, P (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania.",floritanasescu@yahoo.com,,,"CNCS-UEFISCDI [IDEI 303, PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0593]",CNCS-UEFISCDI,"This research was supported by CNCS-UEFISCDI, Project number IDEI 303, code PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0593.",,20,1,1,0,10,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

WTO jurisprudence on this issue can be systematized into three steps. First, inducing compliance is the general purpose of suspension as complaining parties have the right to request the authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations as long as they meet the requirements spelled out in the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding. The second step relates to the level of suspension. In general, WTO jurisprudence has accorded a higher hierarchy to the purpose of rebalancing concessions or other obligations, with some exceptions made regarding disputes on prohibited subsidies and diachronically variable suspension levels. As a third step, WTO jurisprudence has bestowed complaining Members freedom concerning the suspension's content, so as to induce the defending party to comply. Keeping these three steps in mind will hopefully make understanding WTO jurisprudence on suspension of concessions or other obligations easier.",,,,,,"Tijmes-Ihl, Jaime/0000-0003-1317-2015",,,,,73,3,3,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2014,13.0,1,,,,,1,38,,10.1017/S1474745613000177,0.0,,,38,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,AC4RL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332508300001,0

However, prior evidence does not make clear whether the government linkage of a company via ownership holding is good or bad for the firm's performance. We propose two hypotheses. The agency hypothesis holds that government ownership negatively affects firm performance. The support hypothesis postulates that government ownership helps a firm to improve performance. Using a sample of 114 companies, we find that the government-linked companies (GLCs) have better accounting results than do the companies that are not linked to the government (non-GLCs), yet the GLCs are undervalued in the financial market. Subsample analyses reveal that the best accounting results are those of the GLCs in which the government holds 20 to 50 percent of the ownership. If the government takes control of a company by holding more than 50 percent ownership, the accounting results are not improved, yet, unlike other GLCs, these GLCs are overvalued.","[Uddin, Md Hamid; Halbouni, Sawsan; Raj, Mahendra] Univ Sharjah, Coll Business Adm, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",University of Sharjah,"Uddin, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Sharjah, Coll Business Adm, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",mduddin@sharjah.ac.ae; sawsanhalb@sharjah.ac.ae; mraj@sharjah.ac.ae,,"Uddin, Md Hamid/0000-0003-3025-0206",,,,,45,7,10,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

A hi-level programming model should be suitable for optimizing the management of fast-growing plantations. Based on the current management situation in China, which is characterized by decentralized management on a small scale and a lack of integrated planning, we established a nonlinear bi-level programming model to improve the management of fast-growing plantations through the comprehensive consideration of upper- and lower-level targets. An effective hierarchical genetic algorithm was applied to the model, and the specific steps in the solution process were reported.

One of these is to reduce the ways in which it is misused. In order to achieve this, the concepts of 'virtual water' and a 'water footprint' are being developed. An ecolabel with a water footprint indicator is being applied by the first representatives of agribusiness. However, its potential is much more significant. It could be used as a tool of public policy. In both cases, it could affect international trade and therefore needs to be evaluated under the law of the World Trade Organization. The International Organization for Standardization already works on a water footprint norm, which would provide public entities with a strong argument for their water-saving policies. To date, states have not been provided with any relevant international standard. Nevertheless, they must comply with the norms of international trade. The aim of this article is to provide clarification on the existing and developing legal framework on the matter. It also argues that even if the concept of a water footprint were to remain a private standard, states would still he under a 'best effort' obligation to ensure the transparency of its elaboration and application.","[Szwedo, Piotr] Jagiellonian Univ, PL-31007 Krakow, Poland; [Szwedo, Piotr] Jesuit Univ Ignatianum, Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Szwedo, P (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, PL-31007 Krakow, Poland.",,"Szwedo, Piotr/AAO-6976-2021","Szwedo, Piotr/0000-0001-9047-3546",,,,,75,5,5,0,0,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We examined this question using observational annual panel data (2008 and 2009) from 1121 adults in a native Amazonian society of forager-farmers in Bolivia (Tsimane'). Formal math skills were associated with an increase in wealth in durable market goods and in total wealth between data collection rounds, and with improved indicators of own reported perceived stress and child health.

I estimate demand for in-home treatment using geological characteristics to predict a household's drinking water source. The probability of treatment and in particular boiling reduces by 18-27 percentage points in response to source protection, offsetting 4% of the water quality gains and saving households 0.5-1% in monthly expenditure. Behavioral choices partly counteract the water quality gains from source protection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A survey on the implementation status of the Swiss forest reserve concept in the cantons shows that (1) governance elements are clearly favored over traditional command-and-control regulations, (2) 6.6% of the Swiss forest area is delimited forest reserves, (3) large forest reserves are still missing in most of the cantons. Impeding factors can be a lack of conviction of the forest owners, a complicated ownership structure or the weak financial condition of a canton. Improvements may be achieved by increasing consultation and financial incentives or through a purchase of ecologically valuable areas by the Confederation and the cantons. Until now, the Swiss forest reserve policy lacks integration with interacting policies such as climate policy. Climate change could promote forest reserves as sinks for carbon dioxide. Yet this could be counteracted by the support of timber as renewable energy. Integration between forest reserve policy and interacting policies needs to be strengthened, especially with respect to the biodiversity policy (national biodiversity strategy; Convention on Biological Diversity).

We construct a unique data set that combines labour market outcomes and historical census data, and we exploit changes in the availability and size of public and private high schools across states and over time for identification. We find that attending a private high school does not affect school progression to college nor high school wages but it does positively affect wages conditional on college completion.

It uses data from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database and both Worker Self-Assessment and Realized Matches procedures to quantify expected levels of English skills in each of over 500 occupations in the US Census. Earnings data from the 2000 US Census for adult male immigrant workers are then examined in relation to these occupational English requirements using the over-education, required education, under-education (ORU) approach. The analyses show that earnings are related to a correct matching of an immigrant's language skills with what is expected in his occupation. Mismatches have a small effect on earnings - positive for proficiency in excess of the norms in the occupation and negative for deficits in proficiency. The findings are robust with respect to a range of measurement and specification issues typically examined in ORU studies. It is concluded that the ORU model offers a framework for analysis which can be readily generalized to other forms of investment in human capital. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The extent of the response is substantial: for each native woman working due to reform, 0.5 fewer female immigrants enter the local labor force.

The theoretical framework of this study uses an adapted conflict regulation approach based on the conflict triangle model. Empirically four dimensions are analysed to reconstruct and classify the conflicts: substance, procedure, relationship and discourses around the conflict. Empirical data has been gathered by qualitative document analysis and expert interviews with stakeholders at the national and EU level. The results of the empirical analysis identify three major conflicting interests: a) the subsidiarity principle, b) forest management and c) the responsibility for conducting the negotiations.

Total welfare is usually defined as the sum of consumer and provider surplus, i.e., potential external effects are not considered. The general result is then that consumer welfare is a more restrictive standard than total welfare, which is advantageous in certain situations. This relationship between the two standards is not necessarily true when the merger has significant external effects. We model mergers on hospital markets and allow for not-profit-maximizing behavior of providers and mandatory health insurance. Mandatory health insurance detaches the financial and consumption side of health care markets, and the concept consumer in merger control becomes non-evident. Patients not visiting the merging hospitals still are affected by price changes through their insurance premiums. External financial effects emerge on not directly affected consumers. We show that applying a restricted interpretation of consumer (neglecting externality) in health care merger control can reverse the relation between the two standards; consumer welfare standard can be weaker than total welfare. Consequently, applying the wrong standard can lead to both clearing socially undesirable and to blocking socially desirable mergers. The possible negative consequences of applying a simple consumer welfare standard in merger control can be even stronger when hospitals maximize quality and put less weight on financial considerations. We also investigate the implications of these results for the practice of merger control.","[Katona, Katalin] Dutch Healthcare Author, NL-3502 GA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Katona, Katalin; Canoy, Marcel] Tilburg Univ, TILEC, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Canoy, Marcel] Ecorys, NL-3067 GG Rotterdam, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Katona, K (通讯作者)，Dutch Healthcare Author, POB 3017, NL-3502 GA Utrecht, Netherlands.",kkatona@nza.nl; m.canoy@uvt.nl,,"canoy, marcel/0009-0001-6083-9831",,,,,30,0,0,2,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This paper aims to provide a deeper insight into the livelihoods of inhabitants of the Tano Offin Globally Significant Biodiversity Area (GSBA) in Ghana's high forest zone and how these are becoming under greater pressure. It assesses the governance implications of the implementation of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) under the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan of the European Union and projects within the framework of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation plus (REDD+), with a focus on the need for social safeguards. The study shows that the inhabitants of admitted villages in GSBAs already have few legal livelihood options due to restricted access to the forest, which results in competing claims among resource users and with forest managers. Stronger law enforcement resulting from the FLEGT/VPA to combat illegal logging and the Ghana Forestry Commission's consideration to include GSBAs in its REDD+ programme is likely to further restrict inhabitants' access to forest resources, with the result being increasing competition for scarce resources. Social safeguards therefore need serious consideration when implementing new forest governance regimes. The authors argue that the politics of protected areas need to reconsider the position of the inhabitants by creating space to build a livelihood, paying them for taking care of nature or relocating them beyond the protected area. This might involve hard choices. What eventually is needed is a change towards interactive governance and adaptive co-management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

How has the global financial crisis of 2008 affected the influence that developing countries have within the International Monetary Fund (IMF)? What new policy space is available to developing countries? What alternative financial architectures will emerge as competitors or complements to the IMF? The study finds that IMF practice on capital controls has changed partly as a consequence of the crisis; that relatively autonomous developing countries are taking advantage of the policy space that has emerged; and that the global financial architecture is becoming more heterogeneous and multinodal. To date, however, developing countries have secured only modest commitments for increases in their formal influence at the IMF as a consequence of the crisis. Looking ahead, the crisis may create space for pressing an inclusive, participatory, feminist agenda in this domain.","Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80207 USA",University of Denver,"Grabel, I (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, 2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80207 USA.",Ilene.Grabel@du.edu,,,,,,,71,13,13,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Subsequently, they find only a partial reversal of this prelisting increase over the listing days and the postlisting period. However, they observe that stock liquidity improves following the application announcements, peaks around the listing days, and remains at high levels after listing. Further results suggest that firms' announcements that they are switching exchanges are not followed by improved earnings relative to performance-matched control firms. Collectively, these results reveal that transfer stocks in Taiwan convey information about permanent improvements in liquidity rather than better earnings prospects, which is consistent with the stock marketability implications of managerial exchange-switching decisions.","[Liao, Tsai-Ling] Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Yu, Min-Teh] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Univ Chair Prof Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",National Formosa University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Liao, TL (通讯作者)，Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan.",tlliao@nfu.edu.tw; mtyu@nctu.edu.tw,"Yu, Min-Teh/ABB-7718-2021","Yu, Min-Teh/0000-0003-4686-1327",,,,,25,2,2,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Further econometric analysis finds that unions promote individual and collective contracts. The effect of collective contracts vanishes when unions are present, whereas individual contracts have independent and positive effects.

Most research on the effectiveness of such systems has focused on technical components, such as standards-setting, assessments, rewards and sanctions, and data collection and reporting. This brief seeks to demonstrate that this focus may miss the importance of the institutional set-up. We argue that effective accountability systems are largely dependent on associated government structures, rules, and procedures, and the individuals responsible for implementing them. We use an illustrative case from the state of Oklahoma, where a lack of independent oversight, few checks and balances, and little in-state technical capacity combine to call into question the effectiveness of this state's accountability system. We urge researchers and policy makers to focus more attention on the messy governance and politics of educational accountability, and conclude the brief with specific policy proposals to strengthen state education accountability systems.","[Brewer, Dominic J.; Welsh, Richard O.] Univ So Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Killeen, Kieran M.] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Southern California; University of Vermont,"Killeen, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",dominicb@rossier.usc.edu; Kieran.killeen@uvm.edu; richarow@usc.edu,,,,,,,26,1,4,1,12,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

This change allows schools to support a larger student population by rotating which students are on break at any point in time. While year-round schooling can save money, the impact on academic achievement is uncertain and only recently have large-scale studies become available for policy makers. This brief examines research on the effects of multi-track year-round schooling, focusing on two rigorously executed case studies. This research gives little support for claims that year-round schooling will boost student achievement. Except as a remedy for highly over-crowded schools, year-round schooling seems to have little impact on achievement, and has even been shown to decrease achievement, especially among the most high-risk student populations.","[Graves, Jennifer] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [McMullen, Steven] Calvin Coll, Dept Econ, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA; [Rouse, Kathryn] Elon Univ, Dept Econ, Elon, NC 27244 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Calvin University; Elon University,"Graves, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",jgraves@ou.edu; mcmullen@calvin.edu; krouse@elon.edu,"Graves, Jennifer/K-9465-2017",,,,,,26,12,14,0,20,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

We found that developing futures scenarios coupled with natural and malicious hazard episodes provided an effective way to draw in key stakeholders to engage with and address these problems. Starting with a detailed analysis of extant futures studies, scenarios were combined with episodes in order to both draw stakeholders out of their institutional contexts by setting the exercise in the future and to elicit participant responses during future crisis events. A procedure was developed and applied to construct integrated scenario-episodes built upon existing scenarios in order to investigate multi-stakeholder interactions around the resilience of energy and transport infrastructures. The full resulting scenario-episode narratives are also presented. These scenario-narratives were applied in key stakeholder focus groups to address the gaps in the aforementioned 'governing through resilience'.

Assessing what the poor are willing to pay is of paramount importance for policymaking. The contingent valuation method, which relies on a hypothetical market, is commonly used for this purpose. But the presence of the hypothetical bias that is most often inherent in this method tends to bias the estimates upward and compromises policymaking. This paper uses respondents' uncertainty scores in an attempt to mitigate hypothetical bias in community-based health insurance in one rural setting in Cameroon. Uncertainty scores are often employed in single dichotomous choice surveys. An originality of the paper is to use such an approach in a double-bounded dichotomous choice survey.

Between 2002 and 2005, MS sufferers were identified, were offered DMTs only if deemed suitable by their physicians, and were monitored thereafter to assess long-term outcomes. It has been demonstrated for other therapies that judgements about suitability to receive treatment are conditioned by the patient's deprivation status. We hypothesised that this would have been the case for DMTs also. Using individual patient data for samples in Nottingham and in Glasgow, we matched patients' postcodes of residence with deprivation scores and confirmed that patients from more deprived areas were less likely to have been prescribed DMTs. A more detailed analysis of the Nottingham data revealed two channels through which this outcome was effected. First, people from less-deprived areas were more likely to possess clinical characteristics, such as less severe disease severity and shorter duration of the disease, that enhanced their suitability for treatment. Second, the analysis of the clinical notes detailing patients' correspondence with the medical teams suggested that less-deprived people were more able to exercise a voice capable of influencing physicians' prescribing decisions.","[Owens, Trudy; Whynes, David K.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Evangelou, Nikos] Univ Nottingham, Inst Neurosci, Dept Neurol, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Whynes, DK (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",david.whynes@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Owens, Trudy/0000-0001-8676-2919; evangelou, nikos/0000-0003-2871-0672",,,,,53,8,9,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In the 1980s, Malaysia and Taiwan represented more the state-led variety of capitalist development, while Japan and Thailand shared many characteristics of the networked form. In the 1990s and 2000s, these four political economies began to change, but to different degrees and in different directions. In particular, Taiwan became more similar to the co-governed variety of capitalism, while the degree of business co-ordination declined significantly in Thailand so that its political economy became more personalized. These contrasting kinds of changes in the four economies can best be explained by shifts in the interest and power configurations of dominant coalitions.","[Zhang, Xiaoke; Whitley, Richard] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Whitley, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",r.whitley@mbs.ac.uk,,,,,,,125,42,44,1,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Such risks are suggested to be an inevitable consequence of scientific uncertainty about the effects of increased greenhouse gas concentrations on climate. Criticisms of this controversial result fall into three categories: The first suggests that it may be irrelevant to cost benefit analysis of climate policy, the second challenges the fat-tails assumption, and the third questions the behavior of the utility function assumed in the result. This paper analyses these critiques and suggests that those in the first two categories have formal validity, but that they apply only to the restricted setup of the original result, which may be extended to address their concerns. They are thus ultimately unconvincing. Critiques in the third category are shown to be robust however they open up new ethical and empirical challenges for climate economics that have thus far been neglected-how should we 'value' catastrophes as a society? I demonstrate that applying results from social choice to this problem can lead to counterintuitive results, in which society values catastrophes as infinitely bad, even though each individual's utility function is bounded. Finally, I suggest that the welfare functions traditionally used in climate economics are ill-equipped to deal with climate catastrophes in which population size changes. Drawing on recent work in population ethics I propose an alternative welfare framework with normatively desirable properties, which has the effect of dampening the contribution of catastrophes to welfare.

Empirical results indicated the existence of volatility clustering and leverage effect in the industry portfolios. The same macroeconomic news had different impacts on the lumber and paper industry portfolios. The lumber industry was more responsive to the IP and UNEMP news, whereas the paper industry was more responsive to the CPI news.

In the first part, Scenario 'Seeds' are identified or created. The Scenario Content part focuses on the question of what could be changed and by whom, a fundamental element being iterative identification of objects and actors of change. Scenario Outcome focuses on the question of how to assess the potential contribution of these changes, estimated through modelling the scenario in terms of energy usage systems. Scenario Process explores the question of how to develop and represent a scenario in terms of a process of governance. Scenario Content, Outcome and Process are then combined into a Final Scenario which is further assessed and evaluated using qualitative methods. The development of Scenario Content is tested and exemplified in this paper through a scenario study of green mobility in the district of Bromma in Stockholm, Sweden. Preliminary findings indicate that by supporting explicit inclusion of actors and 'the social' aspect, the what-who iteration in Scenario Content also helps identify opportunities and obstacles of a social character, thus contributing to creation of socio-technically more consistent and comprehensive scenarios.

We address this issue by applying a spatial autoregressive model to longitudinal data from Germany at the district ('Kreis') level. The empirical model is specified to explain efficiency scores, which we derive through non-parametric order-m efficiency analysis of regional health production. The focus is on the role of health policy of federal states ('Bundeslander') for district efficiency. Regression results reveal significant spatial spillover effects. Notably, accounting for spatial dependence does not decrease but increases the estimated effect of federal states on district efficiency. It appears that genuinely more efficient states are less affected by positive efficiency spillovers, so that taking into account spatial dependence clarifies the importance of health policy at the state level.","[Tauchmann, Harald] Rheinisch W Fal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Tauchmann, Harald] CINCH Ctr Hlth Econ Res, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Felder, Stefan] Univ Basel, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Felder, Stefan] CINCH Ctr Hlth Econ Res, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Basel,"Tauchmann, H (通讯作者)，Rheinisch W Fal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",harald.tauchmann@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,57,29,29,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The first option is likely to require massive investments in both people and technology. The second option appears to demand near-absolute epistemological and ethical homogenization in a world as populous as ours. Both options seem to require political determination at a scale far remote from present-day realities which are characterized by a deep-felt ambivalence about the modern condition and irony about the prospects for radical change. This ambivalence is not surprising but its implications for environmental politics are both formidable and under-theorized. Instead of unintentionally slipping into an acute state of unsustainability, this paper aims to make explicit the macro-level choices implicit in the Anthropocene. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The model addresses the interactions between the general economy and the forest sector, including forestry, forestry-based industries and energy. The simulation period for all of the scenarios ranged from 2006 to 2025. As compared to the past, the development of the sector substantially changes, even in the base scenario. These changes are primarily caused by increased demand for wooden biomass for energy due to the assumed execution of the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy. All crises' scenarios resulted in declining production and lower prices compared to the base scenario, differing only in magnitude. Forestry, sawmill and paper industries perform better in an export crisis than in a local crisis, because decreased exports can, to a certain extent, be compensated for by increasing domestic demand, while the domestic shortfalls are difficult to compensate by raising exports. By contrast, the export-oriented panel industry does better in a local crisis simulation. In general, economic crises only moderately change the assortment composition of timber supply within the forestry industry. The results also show that the sawmill industry plays a vital role in the allocation of wooden biomass in all of the scenarios. When developing policies for forest-based industries, specifically the procurement of wooden raw material, the key role of the sawmill industry must be considered in each case. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the least-cost intervention levels will be material-specific and vary substantially across materials.

However, while women reverted to the traditional expectations in the last few centuries, and they concentrated on raising the children and running the household, there was a change in attitude in the 20th century, and women have been appearing in the labour market in an ever increasing number. Work became an important aspect of their life in the 21st century: more and more women want a career and be successful professionally. It is no wonder, then, that the issue of the reconciliation of work and family life has been in the forefront since the 70s (Juhasz, T., 2010).

Completing transactions through a website is one of the ways people can place an order. In Thailand, the popularity of online purchases is very high. Online apparel is the most widely ordered product group that consumers purchase from online marketplaces. Interactions in real world shopping are mainly based on face-to-face activities between consumers and sellers, allowing consumers to touch and try the apparel. On the other hand, interactions in electronic commerce are not face-to-face; they take place through websites, and consumers cannot touch and try the product. The advantage, however, is that customers can shop anytime, 24/7. Despite the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use websites for online shopping, very little is known about how consumers make buying decisions, especially in the apparel industry, which comprise products that people like to try on. So, it is interesting and useful to find out what are the factors affecting online buying decision making for apparel in Bangkok metropolitan area. The primary objective of this study was to examine major factors that influence online apparel purchases. The conceptual framework has shown that there is a positive relationship between technology and online buying decision making for apparel; there is a positive relationship between trust and online buying decision making for apparel; there is a positive relationship between marketing mix and online buying decision making for apparel. The research methodology that was used in this research was composed of data collection and data analysis. For data collection, 29 questions were used in the questionnaire submitted to the sample population. Data were gathered from customers who had ever purchased apparel online in the Bangkok metropolitan area. For data analysis, regression analysis was used to find out relationships between independent variables and dependent variables to test the hypotheses. The independent variables were technology, trust, and marketing mix. Technology consisted of security, usability/site design, and privacy. Trust consisted of trust in the online store. Marketing mix consisted of product, price, place, and promotion. The dependent variable was an online buying decision making process for apparel, using frequency to measure it. The hypotheses were tested through multiple regression analysis. The analysis suggested that technology, trust, and marketing mix were strongly predictive and had a significant effect on online decision making. Trust was the most highly related factor affecting online buying decision making, which was followed by marketing mix and technology.","[Into, Tanawan; Apibunyopas, Preeyanuch; Changchenkit, Chuenjit] Kasetsart Univ, Bangkok 10900, Thailand",Kasetsart University,,tanawaninto@gmail.com; Fbuspna@nontri.ku.ac.th,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-0-620-55419-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,547,556,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA6QG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337230600051,0

In contemporary world of business the complicated processes take place: strong competition, rapid changes in price, confusion in the market. Enterprises seek for new ways how to remain in business and to compete effectively against other enterprises each day. One of the methods how to do it effectively is to recognize or to discover anew such resources of the enterprise, which have not been exploited sufficiently. It is more often noticeable that the results of an organization are highly affected not by material resources but by continuously dominating knowledge resources and which are difficult to measure. To improve results and to possess an appropriate advantage the knowledge should be managed properly. The empirical research is presented, the basis of which is a questionnaire. The research results have revealed a positive effect of separate stages of knowledge management on the competitive ability of an enterprise.
