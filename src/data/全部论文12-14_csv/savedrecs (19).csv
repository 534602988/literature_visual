A second-best efficient mechanism is a strategy-proof and anonymous mechanism that is not Pareto dominated by another strategy-proof and anonymous mechanism. In this context, we identify three conditions that are necessary and, together with Voluntary Participation, sufficient for a mechanism to be second-best efficient. This set includes mechanisms that destroy the good at certain profiles. For domains comprising two individuals we provide an explicit characterization of the family of second-best efficient mechanisms.

Generically, this process involves comparing continuously indexed curves that are uniquely determined by the cumulative distributions of the individual attributes under study. In the literature on income poverty and inequality, for example, pairwise comparisons of entire income distributions and their respective Lorenz curves are routinely performed in order to characterize rankings of poverty, inequality, and welfare. In this article, we focus on the inferential problem that arises whenever such comparisons are made in the absence of census data. Statistical inference in these situations is particularly complex due to the fact that comparing curves invariably gives rise to four possibilities: the true population curves are equal, the first curve lies below the second, the second lies below the first, or the curves cross. To address this four-decision problem, we introduce a two-stage test that has good power and fine control over misclassification error rates.","[Bennett, Christopher J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN USA",Vanderbilt University,"Bennett, CJ (通讯作者)，Bates White LLc, 1300 Eye St NW,Suite 600, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",chris.bennett@bateswhite.com,,,,,,,39,15,16,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Agents who have revealed their skill enter a standard matching market, while others are matched randomly. We find that in equilibrium only agents with skills above a cutoff reveal, and then they match assortatively. We show that an equilibrium always exists, and we discuss multiplicity. Increasing differences play an important role to shape equilibria, and we remark that this is unusual in matching models with non-transferable utility.

The analysis uses word detection algorithms to partially characterize prevailing practices. We document a shift toward isolation from other disciplines during most of the twentieth century. In sharp contrast, the most recent decades show a strong move towards a more connected discipline. Periods of more connectedness are associated with openness to a broader set of features of economic agents and the economic environment. In parallel, the 1960s and 1970s show a notable acceleration in the move towards a more mathematical approach. This development did not reverse. As a result, the current state of the discipline is characterized by an embrace of mathematical tools together with openness to a wider set of aspects and findings developed in other disciplines.

Relative to other work in this literature, our paper is unique in that we identify the policies that lead to such changes. By examining skill premium trends along the two dimensions of particular importance to the transition state or non-state firms, and traded or non-traded industries we are able to separate the contribution of external liberalization to wage growth and rising skill premia from that of domestic labor market reforms, and to examine potential interactions between the two types of reform. The results point to the high cost of incomplete reform in Vietnam. Capital market segmentation creates a two-track market for skills, in which state sector workers earn high salaries while non-state workers face lower demand and lower compensation. Growth is reduced directly by diminished allocative efficiency and reduced incentives to acquire education, and indirectly by higher wage inequality and rents for workers with access to state jobs.

We study a French program that allows job seekers to work part-time while remaining registered with the unemployment agency. In this program, insured individuals concurrently receive part of their unemployment benefits and wage income. Using administrative data, we find that subsidized temporary jobs have both a significant lock-in effect and a significant positive post-treatment impact on the hazard rate to employment. Since individuals facing a high implicit tax rate have incentives to self-select into better part-time jobs, we also find that a higher tax rate leads to a weaker lock-in effect and a stronger post-treatment effect. Simulations suggest that the lock-in effect first dominates, but that the overall effect eventually becomes positive. They also point to ways of improving the effectiveness of the policy.","[Fremigacci, Florent] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, EconomiX, F-92000 Nanterre, France; [Terracol, Antoine] Paris Sch Econ, F-75013 Paris, France; [Terracol, Antoine] CES, F-75013 Paris, France",Universite Paris Nanterre; Paris School of Economics,"Fremigacci, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, EconomiX, F-92000 Nanterre, France.",ffremigacci@u-paris10.fr,,"Terracol, Antoine/0000-0001-9937-4114",,,,,21,10,10,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using both administrative and survey data, ERA's effects on benefits and costs were estimated through impact analyses, which exploited the experimental design. The findings indicated that ERA was cost beneficial for long-term unemployed adult men, but not for lone parents. The key findings appear robust to sensitivity tests.

For example, the German federal government pursues the strategy of achieving one million electric vehicles by 2020. In this paper we examine whether it is optimal to subsidize the use of electric vehicles by granting electric power subsidies and how large the corresponding optimal rate is. We, first, analytically derive the optimal power tax in a spatial model of a city with two zones where commuting, carbon emissions, endogenous labor supply, fuel and power taxes are considered. It is shown that in a spatial urban environment, the optimal tax rate depends in particular on transport related externalities, tax interaction effects and redistribution effects working via the urban land market. Second, we extend the model to a full spatial general equilibrium model and employ simulations to calculate sign and size of the optimal tax/subsidy rate. This model is calibrated to a typical German metropolitan area. The results show that electric vehicles should not be subsidized but taxed. The results are robust with respect to changes in the willingness to adopt electric vehicles, the costs of driving electric vehicles, and even if emissions of electric vehicles are zero.

Results indicate that oil inventories and trader positions are needed to generate cointegration between spot and futures prices. The presence of trader positions and oil inventories suggest that both play a role in price discovery. Furthermore, the cointegrating relation for price loads into the equation for both oil prices and trader positions. This suggests a bi-directional simultaneous adjustment process between oil prices and trader positions. This expands the unidirectional causal relation from oil prices to trader positions that is generated by previous studies. Additional results suggest that price discovery occurs in the market for heavily traded near-month futures contracts, but discovery for thin far-month futures markets occurs in the spot market. Together, these results suggest mechanisms by which speculation could affect oil prices but the results presented here are moot regarding their effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We use repeated cross-sectional data from 15 rural villages in Ethiopia to capture the impact of changing household and child characteristics on enrolment status and relative grade attainment between 1994 and 2004. Using instrument variable (IV) estimation, we find, first, a positive income effect for schooling enrolments and an even stronger effect for relative grade attainment. Second, the effect of income is larger for girls compared to boys. Third, OLS estimates of the impact of household income are biased downwards relative to IV results. Finally, observable community characteristics have little role in explaining schooling. These findings suggest that policies that address the demand-side constraints with a special focus on girls will have the potential to improve schooling attainments as well as to reduce gender differences in schooling attainments found in Ethiopia and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.","[Mani, Subha] Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Hoddinott, John] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Strauss, John] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA",Fordham University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Southern California,"Mani, S (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, 441 East Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",smani@fordham.edu,,,,,,,48,20,21,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration uses NEMS to generate the federal government's annual long-term forecast of national energy consumption and to evaluate prospective federal energy policies. NEMS is considered such a standard tool that other models are calibrated to its forecasts, in both government and academic practice. As a result, NEMS has a significant influence over expert opinions of plausible energy futures. NEMS is a massively detailed model whose inner workings, despite its prominence, receive relatively scant critical attention. This paper analyzes how NEMS projects energy demand in the residential and commercial sectors. In particular, we focus on the role of consumers' preferences and financial constraints, investigating how consumers choose appliances and other end-use technologies. We identify conceptual issues in the approach the model takes to the same question across both sectors. Running the model with a range of consumer preferences, we estimate the extent to which this issue impacts projected consumption relative to the baseline model forecast for final energy demand in the year 2035. In the residential sector, the impact ranges from a decrease of 0.73 quads (-6.0%) to an increase of 0.24 quads (+2.0%). In the commercial sector, the impact ranges from a decrease of 1.0 quads (-9.0%) to an increase of 0.99 quads (+9.0%). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Consumption expenditures are divided in durable and nondurable goods for household heads according to different characteristics: education or urban/rural status. The findings indicate that consumption shows an inverted-U shape over the life cycle in opposition to traditional models of consumption. This inverted-U shape pattern cannot be explained by changes in the composition of the household nor for complementarities of consumption with household labor supply during the life cycle. In addition, we find that households in Mexico consume a relatively low proportion in durable goods in comparison with other developed countries. The results suggest that credit constraints are important for Mexican households.","[Campos Vazquez, Raymundo M.] El Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Melendez Martinez, Alvaro] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Colegio de Mexico; Columbia University,"Vázquez, RMC (通讯作者)，El Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",rmcampos@colmex.mx; am3901@columbia.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,4,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We analyze in a benchmark model how the evolution of public debt is affected by lack of commitment per se. While commitment introduces indeterminacy in the level of debt, lack of commitment creates incentives for debt to converge to specific levels. One of the levels that debt often converges to implies no debt accumulation at all. In a simple example we prove analytically that debt converges to zero, and we analyze numerically more complex models. We also show in an imperfect credibility setting that a small deviation from full-commitment is enough to obtain these results.","[Debortoli, Davide] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Debortoli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",ddebortoli@ucsd.edu; ricardo.p.nunes@frb.gov,"Nunes, Ricardo/IQR-4066-2023; Debortoli, Davide/AAJ-4753-2021","Debortoli, Davide/0000-0001-8012-1790; Praca Cavaco Nunes, Ricardo/0000-0002-3157-0802",,,,,35,29,30,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Yet results by Holt and Laury (2002) suggest that questionnaire responses and decisions in hypothetical and low monetary payoff environments do not well predict decisions in higher monetary payoff environments. This raises the question of whether investigating decision making in high stakes environments requires using high stakes. Here we show that one can induce preferences using the binary-lottery reward technique (e.g., Berg et al., 1986) in order to study high-stakes decision making using low-stakes. In particular, we induce preferences such that decisions in a low-stakes environment reflect well the choices made in the high stakes environment of Holt and Laury (2002).

Households are not only concerned about consumption reference levels that is, they gain utility from keeping up with the Joneses but they also exhibit altruism. Two sets of efficient tax regimes are compared, based, on a welfarist- and a non-welfarist optimality criterion, respectively. Altruism turns out not to be at odds with the consumption externalities. Rather, altruism implicates a bound on efficient utility allocations. A non-welfarist government tolerates less inequality than a welfarist one. In the welfarist (non-welfarist) case, first-best personalized commodity tax rates respond highly sensitively (barely) to whether or not a consumption externality is asymmetric or non-atmospheric. If personalized commodity tax rates are not available (second-best case), the tax rate on a non-positional good is typically different from zero for corrective reasons. For plausible functional forms and parameter values, numerical simulations suggest that second-best tax rates are rather insensitive with respect to both the optimality criterion and the nature of the consumption externality.

We call this puzzle the allocation puzzle. Using a wedge analysis, we find that the pattern of capital flows is driven by national saving: the allocation puzzle is a saving puzzle. Further disaggregation of capital flows reveals that the allocation puzzle is also related to the pattern of accumulation of international reserves. The solution to the allocation puzzle, thus, lies at the nexus between growth, saving, and international reserve accumulation.

In particular we show that the relationship between growth in assets and growth in incomes or consumption is extremely weak; instead, we find evidence of asset drift using macro and micro data, which is consistent with the claims we make about possible biases in the use of asset indices.

However, many are still individually small and thus have a limited ability to bilaterally extract and enforce trade concessions from larger developed economies even though as a group they would be able to do so. We show that this coordination externality generates asymmetric outcomes under agreements that rely on bilateral threats of trade retaliation - such as the WTO - but not under agreements extended to include certain financial instruments. In particular, we find that an extended agreement generates improvements in global efficiency and equity if it includes the exchange of bonds prior to trading but not if it relies solely on ex post fines. Moreover, a combination of bonds and fines generates similar improvements even if small countries are subject to financial constraints that prevent them from posting bonds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

(2) For moderate levels of altruism the first best is attained: no distortions and profits are zero. (3) For high levels of altruism the quantity of the inefficient type is distorted upwards, and the quantity of the efficient type is distorted either upwards or downwards; the efficient type makes zero profits.

We examine transition rates in a three-state model and compare our results with those reported for the UK and the US. Explicitly, introducing the employment duality present in the Spanish labor market, we study labor market dynamics in a four-state model set-up and we compute the contribution of the different transitions rates to unemployment fluctuations. Our main findings are as follows: i) around 85% the employment-unemployment gross flows involve temporary contracts; ii) the transition rates involving temporary employment account for around 60% of the fluctuations in the unemployment rate; iii) almost 80% of the unemployment rate volatility - explained by movements between unemployment and employment - involves the transition rates to/from temporary jobs. Our overall conclusion points out that the employment duality is the key to understanding the unemployment volatility and the functioning of the Spanish labor market. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study shows that governments endogenously choose the ad valorem tax method not because of a classic welfare reason, but because it is a good strategy to compete for mobile consumers. Another key finding is that while governments are committed to the ad valorem tax method, the choice leads to inferior outcome; tax-cutting competition becomes more serious when countries adopt ad valorem tax, and competition in ad valorem tax results in smaller tax revenue than competition in unit tax.

We first present a model in which differences in human capital investments emerge as an equilibrium outcome of private decisions and government policy choices. We then illustrate these dynamics in two historical circumstances. In medieval Europe, states and the Church found individuals trained in Roman law valuable, and eventually supported productive investments in this new form of human capital. In late 19th-century China, elites were threatened by the introduction of Western science and engineering and continued to select civil servants-who enjoyed substantial rents-based on their knowledge of the Confucian classics; as a result, investments in productive, modern human capital were not made.

Using the GTAP model data for Australia, we examine three environmental taxes on the production of energy goods. Following Bento and Jacobsen (2007), we examine the role played by specific factors in the production of energy goods. Our results provide support for the existence of a strong DD in Australia when revenue is recycled through reductions in consumption taxes. The strong DD is larger when the share of specific factors is higher, and is much more pronounced when carbon taxes are charged on the production (origin-based accounting) rather than the usage (destination-based accounting) of carbon. These results draw attention to the importance of the definition of the carbon base and have implications for the scale of carbon leakage. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The first dimension is process productivity, which is how we denote the standard concept of productivity as modeled in the literature. The second one is product productivity, defined as firms' ability to develop high-quality products spending small fixed outlays. The distinction between these two sources of productivity, together with the assumption that iceberg trade costs decrease with quality, delivers various conditional exporter premia as theoretical predictions. Conditional on size, exporters sell higher quality products, charge higher prices, pay higher input prices and higher wages, and use capital more intensively. Some of these predictions had already been documented in the empirical literature but lacked a theoretical framework for properly interpreting them. We conduct systematic tests of these predictions using manufacturing establishment data for India, the U.S., Chile, and Colombia, and find strong support for the model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is also shown that stock returns of banks for which interest payments constitute an important share in their balance sheets respond more aggressively to the changes in policy rates. In addition, foreign banks and participation banks give relatively less responses to monetary policy surprises.

However, they were not conducted in the context of social interactions using the methodology of experimental economics. Based on the present study, we find that in such a context, individuals' memory recall accuracy depends on the kindness of acts and who performed them, and negative emotion may lower memory accuracy. A victim of an unkind act is more likely to forget than someone who benefited from a kind act. This result supports the hypothesis that individuals may strategically manipulate their memory by forgetting an unpleasant experience. We also find that individuals who committed an unkind act tend to perceive it as less unkind as time moves on. They also tend to believe that a higher percentage of players have also committed the unkind act. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that individuals strategically manipulate their memory and beliefs to maintain self-esteem or feel less guilty.","[Li, King King] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Li, King King] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Li, KK (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",likingking@gmail.com,"King, Li King/K-3000-2019","LI, King King/0000-0002-9454-3780",,,,,17,11,12,2,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The futures returns of carbon and energy have long memory and own-mean spillover effects. Moreover, the conditional variances also have volatility spillovers, long memory effects and amplitudes.

India. China) compared to those employed in developed markets (e.g., USA. Canada)? Specifically, how should the presence of middle-class consumers with limited ability to pay, prevalent in an emerging market, influence the depth and frequency of price promotions offered by competing firms? Lay intuition suggests that firms should promote more frequently and offer deeper discounts in emerging markets, in order to effectively sell to limited income, middle-class consumers. We construct a theoretical model that investigates the effect of the middle-class segment on firms' price promotion strategies. Contrary to lay intuition, our analysis reveals precisely the opposite results. First, price promotions offered in an emerging market (with middle-class consumers) are shallower than those offered in a developed market (without middle-class consumers). Second, relatively deep price promotions occur less frequently in an emerging market, compared to a developed market. These theoretical findings are consistent with the empirical evidence we gathered from the supermarkets in India and in Canada. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM.

Results indicate predominance of student's t copula in structure. BB1, BB7, BB8, Frank and Joe copulas also fit into some relationships. Regarding dependence, tail measures obtain relevant values in most relationships. Lower tail dependence exceeds absolute, measured by Kendall's Tau, and upper tail in many cases, reflecting the asymmetry in some relationships. Further, in order to give robustness to these results, we forecast daily Value at Risk, considering distinct significance levels, of a portfolio composed of studied sectors through the estimated structure. Results allow one to conclude that VaR predictions are correct. These results permit business industry participants to construct portfolios with assets of these sectors under a proper diversification structure.

We apply the ARDL bounds testing approach in the presence of structural break. The ARDL-ECM estimation results disclose that the relations between defense spending, capital, labor and economic growth are country specific. The interesting finding of this study is that there is a U-shaped relationship that exists between defense spending and economic growth. In addition, the unidirectional causality from defense spending to economic growth exists in the case of Portugal. Therefore, defense spending can play an important role in economic development of Portugal. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The institutional structures of the euro were also widely thought to prevent a country in difficulties being bailed out by other euro members or having its sovereign debt purchased by the European Central Bank (ECB). Despite these restrictions, there was relatively little discussion about sovereign default in pre-Economic and Monetary Union debates among economists, and financial markets priced in almost no default risk in the pre-crisis years. The crisis has seen bailouts and bond purchases by the ECB but there has also been a sovereign default inside the euro and further defaults seem likely. The introduction of the euro was intended to bring greater stability by ending devaluations triggered by self-fulfilling runs on a currency. While this particular scenario can no longer happen, this paper discusses mechanisms whereby expectations that a country may leave the euro can lead to this outcome occurring.","Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Whelan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",karl.whelan@ucd.ie,,,,,,,31,12,13,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Livelihood choices, labor substitution, market infrastructure, a lack of property right protections, entrepreneurship, bureaucracy, and political will are all influential factors that will determine whether such a program would work. The purpose of this paper is to examine the economics of transaction in LURs, estimate the value at which LURs could transact in equilibrium, and to analyze factors that would affect these price changes.

But even with no interbank market, indirect contagion can lead to bankruptcy cascades.

While pure participation numbers may not increase dramatically, there is strong evidence of increases in weekly working hours.

The comparative dynamics properties are given in the preferred form of a symmetric and semidefinite matrix. The testable implications are contrasted with their archetypal counterparts from the adjustment cost theory.

Multiplicity arises from statistical discrimination exerted by firms in the provision of paid-for training to workers, rather than from incentive problems in the labor market. Employers' beliefs about differences in spouses' reactions to housework shocks lead to symmetric (ungendered) and asymmetric (gendered) equilibria. We find that: (1) the ungendered equilibrium tends to prevail as aggregate productivity in the economy increases (regardless of the generosity of family aid policies), (2) the ungendered equilibrium could yield higher welfare under some scenarios, and (3) gender-neutral job subsidies are more effective that gender-targeted ones in removing the gendered equilibrium.

Adopting the concept of the flexible technology in industrial organization theory, the paper develops a simple theoretical model to examine when and why exporters or multinationals adopt flexible technologies to serve multiple markets. The results suggest that firms with basic varieties that are considerably different from the variety demanded by the local country are likely to develop localized varieties to serve the country, whereas those with basic varieties that are considerably similar to the demanded variety are likely to modify their existing varieties. In some circumstances, even when foreign production has an intrinsic cost advantage over exporting before the application of a flexible technology, firms may choose to be exporters by adopting the technology. In addition, the results indicate a possible industry equilibrium: Firms with basic varieties that are considerably similar to the variety demanded by the local country are likely to modify them and become multinationals, whereas those with basic varieties that are considerably different from the demanded variety are likely to develop new localized products and become multinationals.

When computing the effective tax rate as a ratio between total taxes and contributions charged to companies' accounts and net profit before all taxes and contributions, the results are consistent with those found by World Bank/PricewaterhouseCoopers in their series of Doing Business/Paying Taxes surveys. The last of the effective tax rates computed by plotting all the taxes and contributions borne to companies' turnover showed a declining trend over the period, except again for 2009 and 2010.

The aggregate environment resulting from self-interested, objective function-maximizing decision rules on wages, productivity gains, savings and investment, is described by a two-dimensional dynamical system in the employment rate and output/capital ratio. The economy converges cyclically to a long-run equilibrium involving a Harrod-neutral profile of technical change, a constant rate of employment of labor, and constant input shares. The type of oscillations predicted by the model is qualitatively consistent with the available data on the United States (1963-2003), replicates the dynamics found in earlier models of growth cycles such as Goodwin (A growth cycle, in C.H. Feinstein (ed). Socialism, Capitalism and Economic Growth. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1967. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1967); Shah and Desai (Econ J 91:1006-1010, 1981); van der Ploeg (J Macroecon 9:1-12, 1987); Flaschel (J Econ: Zeitschrift fur Nationalokonomie 44:63-69, 1984) and Sportelli (J Econ: Zeitschrift fur Nationalokonomie 61(1):35-64, 1995), and can be verified numerically in simulations. Institutional change, as captured by variations in workers' bargaining power, has a positive effect on the long-run rate of growth of output per worker but a negative effect on long-run employment. Economic policy can also affect the growth and distribution pattern through changes in the unemployment compensation, which also have a positive long-run impact on labor productivity growth but a negative long-run impact on employment. In both cases, employment can overshoot its new equilibrium value along the transitional dynamics.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Tavani, D (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, 1771 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",daniele.tavani@colostate.edu,"Tavani, Daniele/HSE-9182-2023","Tavani, Daniele/0000-0002-2757-0439",,,,,54,11,13,1,26,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

In this article, I quantitatively evaluate the role of liquidity demand in accounting for this puzzle: households that accumulate credit card debt may not pay it off using their money in the bank, because they anticipate needing that money in situations where credit cards cannot be used. I characterize the puzzle in survey data, and calibrate a dynamic stochastic heterogeneous-agent model of household portfolio choice, where consumer credit and liquidity coexist as means of consumption and saving, where households consume a cash good and a credit good, and where cash consumption is subject to uncertainty. The model accounts for between 44% and 56% of the households in the data who hold consumer debt and liquidity simultaneously, and for 100% of the liquidity held by a median such household. Under reasonable calibration alternatives, the model can capture the entire puzzle group size as well. One-half of money demand in the model is precautionary.","Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Telyukova, IA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,,,,,,,27,65,83,4,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We find that energy consumption would continue to increase at least till 2020, with annual growth rates of 10% in 2011-2015 and 6% in 2016-2020. A higher proportion of service sectors in the economy and technological progress reduce energy demand. However, the latter appears to have dwindled impact since 2001. Strong spatial dependence implies copying behaviour in energy consumption across regions. Therefore, more efficient energy control at the disaggregated level can have multiplied impact on the country's goal in energy saving and carbon emission reducing.

The analysis specifically takes into account the classical/Marxian view of competition, which rigorously recognizes the dynamic and turbulent nature of capitalist competition and is based on the concept of regulating capital. Time series analysis is conducted in order to test for the persistence of profit rate differentials among 3-digit classification of the manufacturing industries. The analysis, by differentiating between the intra- and inter-industry competition, addresses the classical/Marxian emphasis on the inter-industry trends of equalization. For this purpose, industry-based data instead of firm-based data are used. Lastly, the incremental rate of profit as the return to regulating capital is taken as the basis for establishing what is actually equalized in the course of competitive process. The analysis is conducted both for the average and incremental rates of return for a comparative view. The results show that while the average rate of profit shows significant persistence in most of the industries, the incremental rate does not. These results are in accordance with the classical/Marxian long-run center of gravity dynamics.","[Bahce, Serdal] Ankara Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Fac Polit Sci, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Eres, Benan] Ankara Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Dept Econ, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Ankara University; Ankara University,"Eres, B (通讯作者)，Ankara Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Dept Econ, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",eres@politics.ankara.edu.tr,,,,,,,66,4,4,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The investigation focuses on the role of tax revenues in explaining the fiscal impact of privatization, as it appears that tax revenue in many transition countries remained lackluster even after the adoption of several tax reforms in the last two decades, and no formal econometric assessment has been conducted of the extent to which privatization has affected tax revenues. Using panel data for 29 Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries, the analysis finds robust signs of a strong negative impact of privatization on different tax revenue sources. The paper also provides some empirical evidence favoring the early adoption of value-added taxes that appear to have contributed to government revenue recovery. (C) 2013 International Monetary Fund.

We show that health insurance operates like a conventional two-part pricing contract that allows monopolists to extract profits without inefficiently constraining quantity. When insurers are free to offer a range of insurance contracts to different consumer types, health insurance markets perfectly eliminate deadweight losses from upstream health care monopolies. Frictions limiting the sorting of different consumer types into different insurance contracts restore some of these upstream monopoly losses, which manifest as higher rates of uninsurance, rather than as restrictions in quantity utilized by insured consumers.

Employing a rich sample of Italian manufacturing firms, we tested for the impact on innovation of the riskiness of the firm, as proxied by the probability of default. We found that riskiness of enterprise reduces the tendency to innovate for the firms. The main channel through which firm risk affects innovation capability appears to be that of innovation financing.","[Murro, Pierluigi] Univ Bari, I-70121 Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,,,"MURRO, Pierluigi/AAH-5198-2020","MURRO, Pierluigi/0000-0002-7743-5024",,,,,57,11,11,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

The relationship is evaluated via an asymmetric GARCH model using monthly data spanning from August 1990 to October 2012. Our results show that a 1 percentage point increase in the cash rate results in an instantaneous 1.086 percentage point rise in the variable rate for small businesses, whereas an equivalent 1 percentage point cut only leads to a 0.862 percentage point fall with a delay of up to 2 months.

Our empirical investigation, based on 2008 data for Luxembourg, shows in fact that, in the case of the so-called zero income Shapley decomposition, inequality in Luxembourg is strongly related to income from capital while bi-polarization is mainly due to the distribution of income from work and polarization to that of the income from work and transfers.","[Deutsch, Joseph; Silber, Jacques] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Silber, J (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel.",jsilber_2000@yahoo.com,"Fusco, Alessio/A-5292-2019","Fusco, Alessio/0000-0002-4726-5108",,,,,63,1,1,2,12,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 23,2013,7.0,,,,,,,,201322.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-22,0.0,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,185JD,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321962900001,0

Although the theoretical advantage of such contracts has long been noticed in the literature, the empirical papers that study this question have produced mixed results. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we shed light on the performance of these contracts. We focus on the simplest version of such a contract: the relative piece-rate (RPR) and compare its performance with that of the tournament and piece-rate schemes. We find that when the RPRs are imposed on the agents, they exert higher effort levels and give the principal (weakly) higher profits than the tournament and piece-rate contracts. Second, we find that agents have little aversion to self-select into the RPR scheme when other alternatives are available. In our paper we fix the environment agents face and vary only their wage scheme. Our results support the theoretical predictions and suggest that principals can benefit from using RPR schemes in places where the piece-rate and tournament contracts would otherwise be used.

Exploiting the quasi-experimental guest worker placement across German regions during the 1960/70s as well as information on immigrants' inter-ethnic contact networks and social activities, we are able to identify the causal effect of ethnic concentration on social integration. The exogenous placement of immigrants switches off' observable and unobservable differences in the willingness or ability to integrate which have confounded previous studies.

Results show strong correlations among decision making domains that involve time discounting. Time preference measured by comparing dollar amounts across time proves a much weaker predictor than a combination of intertemporal behaviors measured either as a linear scale or as factors.

We find that investor protection laws have sizeable cross effects on foreign portfolio investment and the direction of these effects supports the conjecture that foreign investors are particularly sensitive to the perceived riskiness of assets. Specifically, we find that strong protection of creditor rights - limiting excessive risk taking - positively affects foreign shareholders, whereas strong protection of shareholder rights - potentially shifting firms toward riskier projects - negatively impacts foreign bondholders. These findings, on the one hand, emphasize that strengthening investor protection is not a universally desirable policy; on the other hand, they provide a rationale for the failure of convergence toward any successful standard of effective investor protection. The degree of protection enjoyed by investors in each country is indeed endogenously determined by the balancing of many forces. Among them, the political choice to promote inward investment and to favor particular categories of investor may play an important role. Journal of Comparative Economics 41 (2) (2013) 506-526.

Using the relation between parent and subsidiary Tobin's Q to measure the extent of parent companies' rent extraction from partially-owned subsidiaries, the results indicate that governmental quality, legal origin, rules on self-dealing and political stability all predict the degree of rent extraction.","Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Inst Quantitat Econ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Gugler, K (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Inst Quantitat Econ, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",klaus.gugler@wu.ac.at,,"Gugler, Klaus/0000-0002-6795-7216",,,,,29,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2013,40.0,2,,,,,343,362,,10.1007/s10663-012-9189-4,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,138NA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318514100006,0

Moreover, if the cost of counterfeiting is small, then any monetary equilibrium that satisfies the intuitive criterion necessarily exhibits coexistence. A continuity assumption on off-equilibrium beliefs is also considered.

But investment in the America economy has held up quite well (except for the 2008 banking crisis) because of heavy borrowing from foreigners as manifested in the trade deficit. But what is cause and what is effect? The problem is that the Federal government faces an ultra soft borrowing constraint because of the dollar's central role in the international monetary system. Since 2002, Emerging Markets on the dollar standard's periphery have voluntarily bought-or being forced by hot money flows to buy-more than $6 trillion of foreign exchange reserves.

A lower trade cost reduces the number of active domestic firms, but it increases unionised wage in the active domestic firms under decentralised unions. Although a lower trade cost increases wage in the active domestic firms, it reduces domestic employment and total union utility at the free entry equilibrium. So, a trade cost reduction benefits domestic employed workers by increasing the unionised wage, but its effect on the total domestic workers is not favourable. If there is a centralised union, a lower trade cost reduces the number of active domestic firms, unionised wage, domestic employment and union utility. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It eventually aims to provide suggestions for policy makers in developing domestic and international tax structures that balance between inbound and outbound FDI The study empirically investigates the effect of tax structure on inbound and outbound FDI by using an adjusted model that includes the host country's corporate taxes and tariffs, based on the basic gravity model, which has been applied as a robust empirical model for analyzing international trade and FDI flows. Furthermore, we employ Vuong's test to determine if the adjusted inbound FDI or outbound determinant gravity model has a higher explanatory power than the existing gravity model. The empirical results are as follows. First, inbound FDI increases significantly when the corporate effective or statutory tax rates of the host country are relatively lower than those of other countries or when the tariff rates imposed on imported goods in the host country decrease. Second, outbound FDI can increase when the corporate effective tax rates of the multinational enterprise's (MNE's) home country are relatively higher than those of the host country. When we adopt the adjusted regression model in which corporate tax rates are measured by statutory tax rates, outbound FDI can increase with the relatively higher corporate tax rates of the ME's home country than that of the host country and the higher tariff rates of the host country. Meanwhile, the results of Vuong's test significantly supports our hypothesis that the explanatory power of the adjusted outbound FDI determinant gravity model considerably increases as compared with that of the existing gravity model. Therefore, the empirical results of this study intensify the opinion that tax burdens or incentives are deeply associated with inbound or outbound FDI, and imply that the adjusted outbound FDI gravity model is helpful to examine determinants of FDI or tax effects on FDI.","[Park, Jaewhan; Kim, Changbong; Yang, Daecheon] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Park, J (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea.",jaypark@cau.ac.kr; kimchangbong@cau.ac.kr; dcyang@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,69,2,2,0,28,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

When and why do governments choose to consolidate power and monopolize violence? How fast do they try to consolidate power? When does this lead to costly fighting rather than to efforts to eliminate the opposition by buying it off? We study an infinite-horizon model in which the government in each period decides how much to offer the opposition and the rate at which it tries to consolidate its power. The opposition can accept the offer and thereby acquiesce to the government's efforts to consolidate, or it can fight in an attempt to disrupt those efforts. In equilibrium, the government always tries to monopolize violence when it has coercive power against the opposition where, roughly, coercive power is the ability to weaken the opposition by lowering its payoff to fighting. Whether the government consolidates peacefully or through costly fighting depends on the size of any contingent spoils, which are benefits that begin to accrue from an increase in economic activity resulting from the monopolization of violence and the higher level of security that comes with it: When contingent spoils are small, the government buys the opposition off and eliminates it as fast as is peacefully possible. When contingent spoils are large, the government tries to monopolize violence by defeating the opposition militarily.

By allowing the government's type to change overtime, I explore how reputation concerns may generate partial commitment. Restricting attention to equilibria that are strongly renegotiation proof, I show that there is a unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium. This contains episodes of investment and good behaviour followed by periods of expropriation and non-investment. I then apply the model to consider how the power of the incentive scheme and decentralization may influence the properties of this equilibrium. In the case of the power of incentives, the model suggests that price-caps may worsen commitment in developing countries, but not in developed ones. Similarly, the model suggests that decentralisation is likely to have a significant effect on commitment, but that this effect will depend on the general ability of the government to commit. Overall, we conclude that the effect of such policies on commitment will be different across countries, depending on the institutional environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There are several algorithms extending the basic case of a linear-quadratic optimization and taking nonlinearity and stochastics into account, but being still limited in a variety of ways, e.g., symmetry of the objective function and identical data frequencies of control variables. To overcome these problems, an alternative approach based on heuristics is suggested. To this end, we apply a 'classical' algorithm (OPTCON) and a heuristic approach (Differential Evolution) to three different econometric models and compare their performance. In this paper we consider scenarios of symmetric and asymmetric quadratic objective functions.

To do so, it analyses the non-linear solution of a New Keynesian (NK) model, in which slow-moving habits help match the cyclical properties of risk-premia. Our findings suggest that the presence of habits and swings in risk appetite can materially affect policy prescriptions. As in Ljungqvist and Uhlig, a counter-cyclical fiscal instrument can eliminate habit-related externalities. Alternatively, monetary policy can partially curb the associated overconsumption by responding to risk premia. Specifically, periods in which risk premia are elevated (compressed) merit a looser (tighter) policy stance. However, the associated welfare gains appear quantitatively small.","[De Paoli, Bianca] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Zabczyky, Pawel] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; European Central Bank,"De Paoli, B (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA.",bianca.depaoli@ny.frb.org,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Recent research highlighted several positive and negative channels through which the brain drain operates. This paper aims at evaluating the relative magnitudes of various brain drain channels and quantifying their global impact on migrants' sending countries. For this purpose, we develop a 10-region general equilibrium model of the world economy characterized by overlapping-generations dynamics. Our findings suggest that the short-run impact of brain drain on resident human capital is extremely crucial, as it affects not only the number of high-skilled workers available to domestic production, but also the sending economy's capacity to innovate/adopt modern technologies. This latter effect is particularly important in globalization, where capital investments are made in places with high production efficiencies. Hence, despite positive feedback effects, those countries facing prevalent high-skilled emigration are the most candid victims to brain drain.","[Marchiori, Luca] Cent Bank Luxembourg, Econ & Res Dept, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Marchiori, Luca; Shen, I-Ling; Docquier, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Shen, I-Ling] Milken Inst, Res Grp, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA; [Shen, I-Ling] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Docquier, Frederic] Fonds Natl Rech Sci, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,"Marchiori, L (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Luxembourg, Econ & Res Dept, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",luca.marchiori@bcl.lu; ishen@milkeninstitute.org; frederic.docquier@uclouvain.be,,"Marchiori, Luca/0000-0003-4256-2311; Docquier, Frederic/0000-0003-3581-6141",,,,,48,25,26,2,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Markets are segmented and national firms compete in both markets forming an international duopoly. Firms incur quality-dependent variable costs and goods sold domestically and abroad can have distinct qualities, while national quality standards are endogenously determined. International trade links give rise to cross-country externalities that result in inefficient national quality standards, either too lax or too tough relative to the global welfare-maximizing international standard. Trade flows are shown to be lower under Nash equilibrium minimum standards than under world optimum standards. Moreover, if firms specialize in goods of different quality levels, then world optimum standards are unattainable through reciprocal adjustments in national standards, in the absence of lump sum transfers. This suggests limitations in the effectiveness of international negotiations over minimum quality standards.","Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Petropoulou, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England.",d.petropoulou@sussex.ac.uk,,"Petropoulou, Dimitra/0000-0003-4570-3570",,,,,37,9,9,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Given the background of a global increase in coal-fired power plants and the consequent environmental impacts to be expected, the hypothesis that radical innovations are superior to incremental innovations and will thus be introduced to the market is reviewed on the basis of fossil fuel power plants. In this paper we examine the diffusion of incremental and radical innovations in the field of power plants and the basic obstacles confronting these innovations. For example, we compare Pressurized Pulverized Coal Combustion (PPCC) as a radical innovation and supercritical coal-fired power plants as an incremental innovation. PPCC failed due to technological uncertainty. We show in an ex-post analysis of the German R&D portfolio for power plants in the past three decades from an environmental viewpoint that, for radically innovative technologies, it was difficult to be accepted by possible investors. The future potential of radical innovations in the field of power plant technology is to be regarded as relatively low, especially due to technological uncertainty, market uncertainty and sunk costs. The conclusion for future R&D work in the sector of large-scale power plants is that an innovation is more likely to succeed if it follows established technological trajectories. In the context of energy market liberalization, hardly any radical innovations are expected in the technology of power plants. The findings of this paper may also be helpful to evaluate risks or probabilities of success of technologies being developed currently. We discuss for example the technological trajectories currently favored in CO2 capture.","[Rennings, Klaus] ZEW, Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Markewitz, Peter; Voegele, Stefan] Forschungzentrum Julich, Inst Energy Res Syst Anal & Technol Evaluat IEF S, Julich, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Rennings, K (通讯作者)，ZEW, Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, POB 103443, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",rennings@zew.de,"Vögele, Stefan/AAO-7167-2020","Vögele, Stefan/0000-0002-5804-0203",,,,,50,29,29,0,59,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We construct a simple Malthusian model with two sectors and multiple steady states, and use it to explain why European per capita incomes and urbanization rates increased during the period 1350-1700. Productivity growth can only explain a small fraction of the rise in output per capita. Population dynamics-changes of the birth and death schedules-were far more important determinants of steady states. We show how a major shock to population can trigger a transition to a new steady state with higher per-capita income. The Black Death was such a shock, raising wages substantially. Because of Engel's Law, demand for urban products increased, and urban centers grew in size. European cities were unhealthy, and rising urbanization pushed up aggregate death rates. This effect was reinforced by diseases spread through war, financed by higher tax revenues. In addition, rising trade also spread diseases. In this way higher wages themselves reduced population pressure. We show in a calibration exercise that our model can account for the sustained rise in European urbanization as well as permanently higher per capita incomes in 1700, without technological change. Wars contributed importantly to the Rise of Europe, even if they had negative short-run effects. We thus trace Europe's precocious rise to economic riches to interactions of the plague shock with the belligerent political environment and the nature of cities.","[Voigtlaender, Nico] UCLA Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Voigtlaender, Nico] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Voth, Hans-Joachim] Barcelona GSE, ICREA CREI, Barcelona, Spain; [Voth, Hans-Joachim] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ, Washington, DC USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research; ICREA; Barcelona School of Economics; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI),"Voigtländer, N (通讯作者)，UCLA Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA USA.",,"Voth, Hans-Joachim/D-7180-2013","Voth, Hans-Joachim/0000-0003-4518-3149",ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,114,142,153,2,92,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Traditional tests do not allow to distinguish between these different cases. This paper proposes and compares two alternative approaches. The comparison is based on Monte Carlo simulations. The first approach is based on windowed-estimate of the time-spectral density, while the second method is the wavelets theory. We show that the wavelets approach is particularly powerful to detect changes in cyclical properties, while the first approach fails in such a case. In contrast, the wavelets method fails to capture time-interaction effects, while the first approach is more powerful regarding this point. Hence the two methods are complementary. A first application on the SP500 returns shows that there are only changes in variance without altering the cyclical properties of the series. A second application on the US growth rate allows to conclude that there are simultaneous changes in the time and frequency domain. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we produce selection-corrected predictions of counterfactual individual earnings and use them to estimate a discrete-choice migration equation that allows for correlated errors across destinations and a rich structure of migration costs. We find that earnings significantly shape individual migration decisions, even in an episode in which Ecuadorians mostly chose Spain where earnings were lower than in the US, and they contribute to explaining the observed composition of migration flows. Moreover, our estimates show that changes in earnings at a particular destination have a larger effect on destination choice conditional on migration than on the scale of migration.

The paper argues that such social effects on welfare call for a reconsideration of how we assess global poverty. We argue for using a weakly-relative measure as the upper-bound complement to the lower-bound provided by a standard absolute measure. New estimates of poverty are presented. The absolute line is $1.25 a day at 2005 prices, while the relative line rises with the mean, at a gradient of 1:2 above $1.25 a day, consistently with national poverty lines. We find that the incidence of both absolute and weakly-relative poverty in the developing world has been falling since the 1990s, but more slowly for the relative measure. While the number of absolutely poor has fallen, the number of relatively poor has changed little since the 1990s, and is higher in 2008 than 1981.","[Chen, Shaohua; Ravallion, Martin] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mravallion@worldbank.org,,,,,,,42,62,72,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This research aims at empirically investigating the difference of poverty outcome between applying a fixed and an endogenous poverty line. Applying computable general equilibrium microsimulation (CGE-MS), this study has empirically proven that, if a fixed poverty line is applied, the poverty impact of economic shocks which significantly increase (decrease) price will always be underestimated (overestimated). This study empirically found that there is a 0.316 percentage point difference in the poverty outcome between applying the endogenous poverty line and the fixed poverty line when analyzing the impact on poverty in Indonesia of a doubling in the imported soybean price. Supposing the fixed poverty line, the poverty rate will increase by 0.167 percentage points, while supposing the endogenous poverty line, the poverty rate will increase by 0.483 percentage points. Therefore, applying either an endogenous or a fixed poverty line will have a different policy implication. This study strongly suggested that the endogenous poverty line should be applied when analyzing the poverty impact of shocks due to the precision in outcomes.","Univ Indonesia, Fac Econ, Inst Econ & Social Res LPEM, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Dartanto, T (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Fac Econ, Inst Econ & Social Res LPEM, Jl Salemba Raya 4, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia.",teguh@lpem-feui.org,"Dartanto, Teguh/GMX-4627-2022","Dartanto, Teguh/0000-0002-1737-3650",,,,,27,2,2,0,23,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Competition among generators leads to an endogenous shadow price of stored water, which facilitates the efficient intra-day and inter-season substitution of fuel. Overall welfare depends on storage capacity, the cost structure of non-hydro generators, and the characteristics of water inflows. If climate change reduces the long-run average level of inflows or leads to the introduction of a carbon tax then overall welfare will fall and the profitability of generators will rise. The welfare benefits from additional storage capacity will increase if climate change makes long-term inflows less predictable or leads to the introduction of a carbon tax. They will decrease if average inflows fall or the predictable seasonal cycle in inflows becomes less pronounced. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Different methods and techniques for handling this issue have been proposed. Complex proportional assessment is an analytical tool for solving multi-criteria decision making problems. Originally, the COPRAS method has been developed for decision making under a deterministic environment. Since uncertainty is an unavoidable property of decision making due to a lack of knowledge, this paper suggests an extended form of the COPRAS method used for group decision making problems in an uncertain environment where such uncertainty is captured through a generalized form of fuzzy sets - the so called interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. An algorithmic scheme for the COPRAS-IVIF method has been introduced thus examining its application with reference to two numerical examples. It seems that the recommended framework of COPRAS-IVIF can be satisfactorily implemented in decision making problems under ambiguous and ill-defined conditions.","[Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi; Hashemi, Shide Sadat] Inst Trade Studies & Res, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi/ABE-8871-2020","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X;",,,,,51,92,92,3,41,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

A newly developed approach to improving realism is the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model, which allows researchers to model the allocation of continuous amounts of a consumer good. Before implementing this model in overall frameworks, it is important to determine the accuracy of the forecasting. In this paper, an MDCEV model of household fleet choice based on data collected in a stated adaptation survey is presented. The model was used to predict the annual mileage of households with regard to 17 different types of cars, and the results of that forecast were compared to the actual data by calculating the residuals. The residual analysis showed that the model performed significantly better than a completely random model, but the share of wrongly allocated mileage, 70% of the total, remained high. However, the results of only one model were not sufficient to assess the procedure. The differences between two submodels, one with and one without public transport, regarding the distribution of the residuals indicated that model specification has a significant influence on performance. Therefore, more work on forecasting additional MDCEV models was necessary to have a basis for comparison. We compared two further MDCEV models to obtain a fuller understanding of their performance.

We propose a novel approach to panel unit root testing-sequential panel selection method (SPSM) by using panel Kapetanios et al. (KSS) test with a Fourier function, which is sufficiently efficient to control for structural breaks and nonlinearity as well as cross-sectional dependency. SPSM classifies the whole panel into a group of stationary and nonstationary series. The method also clearly determines how many and which series in the panel are stationary processes. Using the panel data obtained from 31 regions in China, we find out that the real gross domestic product per capita from 1979 to 2010 does not converge in 20 of the 31 regions in China.

The regulatory efforts of more developing countries in order to attract investments and enhance the level of effective competition in the industry are hindered by the absence of a sound legal framework, the weak level of regulation and the extended state interventionism. The main aim of this study is to examine the regulatory process in the telecommunications industry within the OECD countries and determine the extent to which it has affected the level of investment and economic growth. For this purpose, we use an updated data set for thirty OECD countries covering the period 1988-2010 and panel data econometric techniques.

Specifically, along the transition path (i) manufacturing becomes increasingly capital-intensive over time while (ii) there is an increase in the relative price and production share of services and (iii) aggregate labor share converges from above to a non-zero value. At the sectoral level (iv) labor share in manufacturing trends toward zero.

Under an independent monetary authority, inflation is higher, more volatile and more persistent and plays a significant role in achieving fiscal solvency.","Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Oikonomou, Rigas] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T1C3, Canada; London Business Sch, London, England",University of Cambridge; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of London; London Business School,"Oikonomou, R (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, 2953 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T1C3, Canada.",rigas.oikonomou@hec.ca,"Marcet, Albert/ABE-7882-2020; Scott, Andrew/K-3358-2015","Scott, Andrew/0000-0002-7785-1263; Faraglia, Elisa/0000-0003-1755-0618; Marcet, Albert/0000-0003-1042-5240",ESRC [ES/H02185X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,19,16,20,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing price elasticities in international trade flows between Germany and France and between Germany and the United Kingdom before and after the introduction of the Euro. Using disaggregated Eurostat trade statistics, we adopt a heterogeneous dynamic panel framework for the estimation of price elasticities. We suggest a Kalman-filter approach to control for unobservable quality changes which otherwise would bias estimates of price elasticities. We divide the complete sample, which ranges from 1995 to 2008, into two sub-samples and show that price elasticities in trade between EMU members did not change substantially after the introduction of the Euro. Hence, we do not find evidence for an increase in international price competition resulting from EMU.","[Holtemoeller, Oliver] Univ Halle Wittenberg, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Holtemoeller, Oliver; Zeddies, Goetz] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Holtemöller, O (通讯作者)，Univ Halle Wittenberg, Kleine Markerstr 8, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",oliver.holtemoeller@iwh-halle.de,"Holtemöller, Oliver/AAI-3439-2021","Holtemöller, Oliver/0000-0002-6768-8896",,,,,38,4,4,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2013,40.0,1,,,,,197,214,,10.1007/s10663-011-9182-3,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,074CW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313791100008,0

It also compares the marginal productivities of effort. In contrast, when the limited liability does not bind, I find that Kim's criterion is necessary and sufficient in the binomial model.

Resolving financial and trading frictions affects long-run policy significantly. Policy response to fluctuations in productivity is quantitatively different across model variants, mainly due to the idiosyncratic behavior of the money demand.

In particular, we evaluate how a rebalancing of the economy from investment-led to consumption-led growth would affect the economic dynamics after a shock occurs. Our findings suggest that a rebalancing would reduce the volatility of the real economy in the event of a technology shock, which provides support for policies aiming to increase the consumption share in China.","[Nuutilainen, Riikka] Univ Oulu, Bank Finland Inst Econ Transit, Oulu, Finland",University of Oulu,"Pääkkönen, J (通讯作者)，Govt Inst Econ Res, POB 1279, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.",jenni.paakkonen@vatt.fi,"Mehrotra, Aaron/KBB-8334-2024",,,,,,25,10,11,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Accompanying this unprecedented growth is a considerable increase in earnings inequality. Between 1988 and 2009 the variance of log earnings increased from 0.28 to 0.54, a 94% increase. Using a unique set of repeated cross-sectional data this paper examines the causes of this increase in earnings inequality. We find that the major changes occurred in the 1990s when the labor market moved from a centrally-planned system to a market-oriented system. The decomposition exercise conducted in the paper identifies the factor that drives the significant increase in the earnings variance in the 1990s to be an increase in the within-education-experience cell residual variances. Such an increase may be explained mainly by the increase in the price of unobserved skills. When an economy shifts from an administratively determined wage system to a market-oriented one, rewards to both observed and unobserved skills increase. The turn of the century saw a slowing down of the reward to both the observed and unobserved skills, due, to some extent, to the college expansion program that occurred at the end of the 1990s.

As a result, socially and economically destructive policies can receive widespread public support. Furthermore, because there is no private benefit of learning from experience, such policies can persist over time. We argue here that despite this otherwise dismal outlook on public policy, the theory of rational irrationality leaves two avenues for economically sensible reform: First, when the ex post costs of irrationality are higher than expected, rationally irrational voters will reduce their consumption of irrationality and demand more rational policies. Second, rationally irrational voters can be convinced to rationally update their policy preferences through the use of appealing rhetoric and persuasion by experts. We discuss these two avenues for reform using the example of the repeal of the 18th amendment, which, as we will show, relied on both updating as well as persuasive campaigning.","[Thomas, Michael D.; Thomas, Diana W.] Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Snow, Nicholas A.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Thomas, DW (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 3565 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",Michael.Thomas@USU.edu; Diana.Thomas@USU.edu; Snow.172@OSU.edu,"Thomas, Michael D/HNJ-2979-2023; Thomas, Diana/AAA-8434-2019","Thomas, Diana/0000-0002-7912-9928; Thomas, Michael/0000-0002-6055-0720",,,,,53,5,5,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2013,66.0,1,,,,,130,152,,10.1111/kykl.12014,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,066ZV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313262000007,0

The country level' constraints have been mostly considered in studies covering the decisions related to FDI locations. However, there is still little evidence of the outward FDI determinants at the aggregate level; this is precisely the focus of this paper. The recent emergence of multinational firms in developing countries makes even more interesting the analysis of these factors and how they relate to ownership advantages explaining outward FDI. Our analysis uses a sample integrated by 48 countries, including both developed and developing economies. Results show that a set of macroeconomic factors affect the cumulative process of capabilities accumulation that derives into outward investments, but this set of factors differs between the two groups of countries studied.","[Alvarez, Isabel] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Torrecillas, Celia] Univ Jaen, Jaen, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad de Jaen,"Alvarez, I (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",Isabel.alvarez@ccee.ucm.es; ctorreci@ujaen.es,"Alvarez, Isabel/K-4918-2018","Alvarez, Isabel/0000-0003-2016-0514",,,,,42,1,2,1,18,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

In this paper, we consider a two-type optimal non-linear income tax model, in which people care about both their relative consumption and their relative leisure. Increased consumption positionality typically implies higher marginal income tax rates for both ability types, whereas leisure positionality has an offsetting role. However, this offsetting role is not symmetric; concern about relative leisure implies a progressive income tax component (i.e., a component that is larger for the high-ability type than for the low-ability type). Leisure positionality does not modify the policy rule for public-good provision.","[Aronsson, Thomas] Umea Univ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Johansson-Stenman, Olof] Univ Gothenburg, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Umea University; University of Gothenburg,"Aronsson, T (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",Thomas.Aronsson@econ.umu.se; Olof.Johansson@economics.gu.se,,"Johansson-Stenman, Olof/0000-0003-4460-4765",,,,,54,20,20,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

We argue that the evidence points to the collapse in aggregate expenditure, concentrated on trade-intensive durable goods, as the main driver of the trade collapse. Inventory adjustment likely amplified the impact of these expenditure changes on trade. In addition, shocks to credit supply constrained export supply, further exacerbating the decline in trade. Most evidence suggests that changes in trade policy did not play a large role. We conclude that one benefit of the trade collapse is that it has stimulated research in neglected areas at the intersection of trade and macroeconomics.","[Bems, Rudolfs] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Johnson, Robert C.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Johnson, Robert C.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yi, Kei-Mu] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA",International Monetary Fund; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Bems, R (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",kei-mu.yi@mpls.frb.org,,,,,,,52,80,95,1,35,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4605-8,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

This is especially the case during crises, as during these episodes the relative cost of long-term borrowing increases. We construct a unique database of sovereign bond prices, returns, and issuances at different maturities for 11 emerging economies from 1990 to 2009 and present a set of new stylized facts. On average, these countries pay a higher risk premium on long-term than on short-term bonds. During crises, the difference between the two risk premia increases and issuance shifts towards shorter maturities. To illustrate our argument, we present a simple model in which the maturity structure is the outcome of a risk-sharing problem between an emerging economy subject to rollover crises and risk-averse international investors.","[Broner, Fernando A.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain; [Broner, Fernando A.] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Lorenzoni, Guido] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Schmukler, Sergio L.] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",Pompeu Fabra University; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Barcelona School of Economics; Northwestern University; The World Bank,"Broner, FA (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain.",fbroner@crei.cat; glorenzo@mit.edu; sschmukler@worldbank.org,"Broner, Fernando/A-8904-2013","Broner, Fernando/0000-0002-5507-9823",,,,,53,88,113,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

It consists of dividing a network into several lots, so as to multiply the number of calls for tender. On the one hand, gains should be obtained by increasing competition for the market and reducing the costs of obtaining accurate information. On the other hand, cutting a network into several parts is also expected to have negative consequences on production costs, in terms of lower returns to scale. Many industry stakeholders believe that the latter element more than compensates for the former. In this article, we estimate a translog cost function with a panel of 141 French urban public transport networks. Our main conclusion is that scale economies are exhausted for a production of about 3 million vehicle-kilometres per year. Therefore, as far as returns to scale are concerned, allotment would reduce the costs of public transport services for the main cities of our sample. A second dividend for allotment is then presented and implies that the assumed trade-off between returns to scale and increased competition is irrelevant.","[Croissant, Yves] Univ La Reunion, CEMOI, St Denis, France; [Roy, William] Univ Lyon, LET Transport Econ Lab, Lyon, France; [Canton, Joan] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of La Reunion; University of Ottawa,"Croissant, Y (通讯作者)，Univ La Reunion, CEMOI, St Denis, France.",yves.croissant@univ-reunion.fr,,"Croissant, Yves/0000-0002-4857-7736",,,,,47,11,12,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While some firms review their prices at fixed intervals of time, others prefer to perform price revisions in response to changes in economic conditions. Some theories have been suggested to explain this. However, empirical evidence on the relative importance of the factors that determine the different strategies of firms is virtually non-existent. In this paper, we help to fill this gap by investigating the factors that explain why firms follow time-dependent, state-dependent, or both time- and state-dependent price-reviewing rules. We find that the strategies of firms vary with firm characteristics that have a bearing on the importance of information costs, with the variability of the optimal price, and with the sensitivity of profits to non-optimal prices.","[Dias, Daniel A.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Marques, Carlos Robalo; Martins, Fernando] Banco Portugal, P-1100 Lisbon, Portugal; [Martins, Fernando] Univ Tecn Lisboa, ISEG, P-1100 Lisbon, Portugal; [Martins, Fernando] Univ Lusiada Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Banco de Portugal; Universidade de Lisboa,"Dias, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",ddias@illinois.edu; cmrmarques@bportugal.pt; fmartins@bportugal.pt,"Dias, Daniel A./Q-5148-2019",,,,,,36,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Our analysis exploits tariff changes across sectors after the Colombian trade reform. An additional advantage of our analysis is that our TFP measure does not include demand and price effects. We find that reduced trade protection makes plant survival depend more closely on productivity. Using a dynamic simulation, we find that enhanced selection increases aggregate productivity substantially. Trade liberalization also increases productivity of incumbent plants and improves the allocation of activity.

Our results show that if economic agents are able to perfectly anticipate the impacts of the reform, delaying its implementation is never optimal.

Generally, the platform will subsidize participation on a side of the market the higher is that side's positive cross-side externality to users on the other side of the market. However, in matching markets there also exists a negative own-side congestion externality that the platform internalizes by taxing users for its presence. Assuming a monopoly platform pricing model, the first contribution of this paper is to show that these positive cross-side and negative own-side externalities can be summarized by the matching elasticity derived from a general matching function that captures the efficiency of the platform's matching technology. The platform charges a lower price to a side of the market the higher is that side's matching elasticity. The second contribution of this paper is to show that the platform's pricing strategy only partially internalizes the efficiency of its matching technology, compared to the social optimum. In particular, we discuss the possibility that a monopoly matchmaker sets too high a price on the low-price side of the market and too low a price on the high-price side of the market, resulting in insufficient inequality in prices between sides of the platform.","[Goos, Maarten; Van Cayseele, Patrick; Willekens, Bert] Univ Louvain, Fac Econ & Business, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",,"Willekens, B (通讯作者)，Univ Louvain, Fac Econ & Business, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",bert.willekens@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,16,7,7,1,37,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Three probability models (logit, probit and scobit models) are used. The results show that four important factors explain the probability of trading price falling below their IPO price. A high first-day turnover ratio, a small price update, an optimistic stock market, and high average initial returns of other firms prior to an IPO issue all reduce the risk that the trading price will fall below the IPO price. The stock market returns have a non-linear significant effect on that probability.

This makes it possible to distinguish between prices under normal market conditions and under non-normal market conditions, those market conditions that can cause extreme price spikes. We expect that increased connectivity yields additional supply in the short-term and therefore will reduce the impact of price spikes. Our results indicate that the impact of price spikes and volatility decreased over time, that prices behave more random, and that the parameter estimates between various connected markets seem to have converged between the Belgian, Dutch, French, German and Nordic day-ahead markets over the years 2003 through 2010.

The actual complexity of innovation, we argue, is taken for granted. Our focus is on analyzing the very complexity of innovation, its dynamics and potential for practice. We take innovation as linked to creativity, by the processes of learning, thinking and knowing. Consequently, we analyze the complexity of innovation as a time-related process. We take the ensemble of two partners and their interaction as a basic dynamic unit for innovation. Modelling this unit within the new framework of complexity shows innovation to be a self-generative kind of process, depending on the conditions. That's why we call these conditions the conditions of possibility for innovation. These conditions, which are closely linked to facilitating the quality of interaction and relationships between the partners in interaction within the ensemble, may be shown to unravel innovation as a nonlinear generative process with potential nonlinear effects over time. For practice this means that we need to take the notion of architecting interaction as foundational for innovation. We show innovation to be a complex process at both the individual and the collective level. Architecting interaction at both levels, both within and between ensembles, is to be taken as the key for architecting the dynamics of innovation, with the promise of nonlinear effects over time. We mean the promise of effects like bootstrapping each other within small communities of learners, with effects like the 'butterfly effect' and the 'snowball phenomenon'. These effects are expected to bring the partners in interaction beyond their comfort zone into the Zone of Generativity. We argue here that, by architecting interaction and the conditions of possibility, we may encourage innovation as a generative process, thereby opening the space of the possible, with the promise of enabling these potential nonlinear effects. Henceforth, we may also speak about guiding innovation, guiding the very complex process of innovation.","[Jorg, Ton] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hughes, Stephanie Akkaoui] AKKA Architects, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Jörg, T (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",agdjorg@gmail.com; stephanie.hughes@akkaarchitects.com,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,222,230,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000026,0

Rather than asking whether PPP holds throughout the whole sample period, we examine, in this study, if PPP holds sometimes by employing Hamilton-type (1989) Markov regime switching models. When at least one of multiple regimes is stationary, PPP holds locally within the regime. There are indeed various reasons that we should expect that the persistence of real exchange rates changes over time. Employing five real exchange rates spanning more than 100 years, we find herein strong evidence that the strength of PPP varies during the sample periods and that there exist stationary regimes in which PPP holds. Throughout the article, we also make comparisons to previous Markov regime switching estimation results by Kanas (2006) on the same data series. The new Markov switching model selection criterion of Smith et al. (2006), which is devised especially for discriminating Markov regime switching models, unambiguously indicates a preference for the Hamilton-type Markov regime switching model employed in this study.

The population of the research included all the employees of Tejarat Banks located in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. Hence, 600 employees were selected using stratified and cluster random sampling. The instruments used were two questionnaires: Abili and Abilis' (2011) 24-item questionnaire measuring social capital and its three key cognitive, relational, and structural dimensions with Cronbach Alpha of 0.98 and Walton's (1973) 29-item quality of work life questionnaire with eight underlying constructs of safe and healthy working condition, future opportunity for continued growth and security, constitutionalism in the work organization, the social relevance of work life, work and the total life space, social integration in the work organization, immediate opportunity to use and develop human capacities, and adequate and fair compensation with Cronbach Alpha of 0.93. The results of path analysis using LISREL software indicated that dimensions of the quality of work life had a direct effect on social capital with the indices of 0.87. Furthermore, the model showed that out of the factors of the quality of work life the factor of constitutionalism had the highest direct effect on the cognitive construct of the social capital. Overall, the proposed model showed full fit.","[Madankar, Anahita; Nazem, Fattah] Islamic Azad Univ, Roudehen Branch, Dept Educ, Roudehen, Iran",Islamic Azad University,"Madankar, A (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Roudehen Branch, Dept Educ, Roudehen, Iran.",anahitamadankar@ymail.com; nazem@riau.ac.ir,"nazem, fattah/AAU-3376-2021",,,,,,57,1,1,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,241,247,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000028,0

However, after the significant deceleration of economic growth in the last quarter of 2012, the expectations of a recession have returned. After approximately one and a half year of waiting, the Slovak economy will be fully confronted with the second wave of the crisis. The economy cannot resist the second wave of the recession (which has already hit the euro area) forever. Significant slowdown hits the economy at a time when the euro area economy has started to improve gradually.

Using available financial data of listed firms in the 29 stock exchanges in Africa, the study finds similarities in the determinants of dividend policy in African firms with those in most developed economies. In particular, agency costs are found to be the most dominant determinant of dividend policy among African firms. The finding is non-synonymous with emerging capital markets which have a high concentration of private ownership and trading volumes. Agency cost theory may be important in both emerging and developed capital markets but the nature of the agency problem may be different in each case.

The model demonstrates that the prevailing regime of accumulation in a given economy depends on the type of currency misalignment, so if the real exchange rate is overvalued, then the regime of accumulation will be profit-led, but if the exchange rate is undervalued, then the accumulation regime is wage-led. Subsequently, the adherence of the theoretical model to data is tested for Brazil in the period 1994/Q3-2008/Q4. The econometric results are consistent with the theoretical non-linear specification of the investment function used in the model, so that we can define the existence of a real exchange rate that maximizes the rate of capital accumulation for the Brazilian economy. From the estimate of this optimal rate we show that the real exchange rate is overvalued in 1994/Q3-2001/Q1 and 2005/Q4-2008/Q4 and undervalued in the period 2001/Q2-2005/Q3. As a direct corollary of this result, it follows that the prevailing regime of accumulation in the Brazilian economy after the last quarter of 2005 is profit-led.","[Oreiro, Jose Luis] Univ Brasilia UnB, Natl Sci Council CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Araujo, Eliane] Univ Estadual Maringa, Maringa, Parana, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade Estadual de Maringa,"Oreiro, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia UnB, Natl Sci Council CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",joreiro@unb.br; elianedearaujo@gmail.com,"Oreiro, José Luis Da Costa/HRC-2082-2023","da Costa Oreiro, Jose Luis/0000-0001-8955-8868",,,,,16,14,18,0,12,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,3,,,SI,,381,396,,10.2298/PAN1303381O,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,148KC,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319242500008,0

On average, states with greater pre-shock educational attainment experienced larger drops. There was no clear trend in the response by family background. However, a negative effect is found even between siblings. The evidence suggests a demand-side story: the drop in household income seems to be the main determinant of the fall/slowdown in attainment.

These typically find large public sector premiums at the bottom of the wage distribution. This may imply that low skill workers are 'overpaid', prompting concerns over efficiency. We note several other potential explanations for this result and explicitly test whether the premium varies with skill, using Australian data. We use a quasi-differenced Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) panel data model which has not been previously applied to this topic, internationally. Unlike other available methods, this technique identifies sectoral differences in returns to unobserved skill. It also facilitates a decomposition of the wage gap into components explained by differences in returns to all (observed and unobserved) skills and by differences in their stock. We find no evidence to suggest that the premium varies with skill. One interpretation is that the compressed wage profile of the public sector induces the best workers (on unobserved skills) to join the public sector in low wage occupations, vice versa in high wage occupations.

This work builds a model able to derive these facts as the result of greater openness to global goods and financial markets. Emerging countries generate the observed high ratios of reserves to short term foreign debt to hedge against volatility of foreign capital inflow with the purpose of stabilising not the short term but the long term finance available to domestic firms. Numerical simulations of the model derive the rising level of reserves to short term foreign debt ratio and about half of the observed rise in GDP growth as a result of a falling cost of long term finance and the increasing competitiveness of domestic industry.,,,,marcello.spano@uninsubria.it,"Spanò, Marcello/AFN-7655-2022",,,,,,29,1,1,0,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,2,,,SI,,203,230,,10.2298/PAN1302203S,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,148KB,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319242400005,0

The economic development of Slovakia is no exception. The analysis of both unemployment as an economic and social phenomenon and unemployment trends is conducted in relation to the period of stabilization and relative economic growth, which followed after the transformation of economic systems in countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The main objects of this analysis are primarily trends in the economic development, trends in the job creation, and the impact of direct foreign investments on the development of unemployment. Migration of labour force abroad is another important variable entering the analysis. The focus is placed predominantly on the migration flows into foreign countries and also on their impact on the development of unemployment rate. From the previous analyses and observations of real processes occurring in this particular field we know that under certain circumstances high unemployment rate results in the growth of migration flows of labour force abroad. But during the studied period under the conditions of relatively quick economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe we can observe different trends when it comes to the connection between unemployment rate, economic growth and migration flows. Trends in the economic development during this period, in the development of unemployment rate and in the emigration flows and their causality do not match our knowledge and ideas about these phenomena and processes in the entrepreneurial, political or academic environment. Therefore, this study aims to conduct an analysis of the above mentioned phenomena and processes and offer a reasoned and adequate concept about the trends in their development.","Univ Alexsander Dubchek, Trencin 91150, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Vojtovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Alexsander Dubchek, Studentska 3, Trencin 91150, Slovakia.",sergej.vojtovic@tnuni.sk,,,,,,,58,29,29,0,42,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The economic fundamentals such as the terms of trade, the relative price of non-traded to traded goods, net foreign assets and real interest rate differentials are employed to assess the equilibrium exchange rate. Considering the drastic changes in Korea's trade pattern, the trade partner weights, which are used to compute the real effective exchange rate, are not fixed, but variable. The estimation results using the quarterly data from 1982Q1 to 2009Q4 indicate that the actual exchange rate of the Korean won was substantially overvalued for the period from 2005Q1 to 2007Q4, and substantially undervalued for the period from 2008Q2 to 2009Q3.

Among private inflows, portfolio investments display the biggest impact on the appreciation - almost seven times that of foreign direct investment or bank loans - while private transfers have the smallest effect.

Using data from the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (COMTRADE), we show that the bulk of export growth in the region has been in the intensive rather than the extensive margin. Concentration indices support the finding that the expansion of exports into new products and new trading partners has been limited. Latin America's bid to diversify its exports using FTAS (based on a static concept of comparative advantages) instead of more comprehensive strategies has had a negligible impact. Governments should therefore adopt a more dynamic approach to comparative advantages and introduce more active policies.

Simulation results suggest that the broad-based GHG policies in general have lower efficiency costs and result in less re-distributive effects. BTAs bring modest efficiency gains with adverse distributional consequences. The distributional impacts are smaller under broad-based GHG policies compared to that based on CO2 only. However, these are due to a wider variety of abatement options under multi-gas policies rather than the BTAs per se. The main difference between the two policies is distributional effects. First, CO2-only based policies have worse impacts on fossil fuel exporters such as Russia and relatively better outcomes for oil importers such as India and China, compared to that of multi-gas policies particularly when it involves large global emission reduction. Second, sectoral coverage under BTAs also influences the differential outcomes. For example, Brazil is worse impacted under GHG-based policies if agriculture is brought under BTAs as two-third of its emissions are non-CO2 based and agriculture is the primary source of these emissions.

A lockup prevents the shares of a company from being sold to the public for a specified or unspecified period of time. This paper presents a theory and provides empirical evidence for staged privatization under market forces. The theory is based on a specification of a lockup effect on demand, where the existence of this lockup effect is shown by our empirical analysis. With this theory, we can analyze how various factors, such as the lockup effect, demand elasticity, growth potential and business fluctuations, affect staged privatization, in particular, the equilibrium speed of privatization. Our paper is the first to analyze a market-oriented, multistage privatization process, instead of a fully government-controlled or centrally planned process. Interestingly, staged privatization resembles initial public offerings (IPOs). Hence, our study can shed light on IPOs from a unique angle. Our empirical analysis provides evidence in support of our theoretical findings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This classical question has received significant research attention since the collapse of the global financial services firm Lehman Brothers. Although most studies agree on the existence of Keynesian multiplier effects, several studies also demonstrate the existence of non-Keynesian effects. What explains this lack of consensus in the literature? In this paper, we aim to bridge the two views by estimating a near-vector autoregressive system that includes interaction terms of fiscal instruments, and the debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) or the primary-deficit-to-GDP ratios. Moreover, to embed the dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratio in the analysis, we explicitly incorporate the government budget constraint. By computing and comparing the impulse response functions, we find Keynesian effects when fiscal conditions are sound, and non-Keynesian effects when the primary deficit is large.","Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Policy Studies, Sanda, Hyogo 6691337, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University,"Kameda, K (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Policy Studies, 2-1 Gakuen, Sanda, Hyogo 6691337, Japan.",kameda@kwansei.ac.jp,,"KAMEDA, Keigo/0000-0002-7668-1602",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730269] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,30,10,11,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

Despite the conventional argument that input growth and technical progress are important factors to output growth, the empirical findings show a significant scale effect but a weak technical efficiency change.

When competition is intense, most of the gains from extra competition are captured with the entry of a small number of firms and subsequent gains from entry are small.

I exploit the variation in pre-reform uninsurance rates across counties to identify the causal effect of the reform on ER visits. My estimates imply that the reform reduced ER usage by between 5 and 8%, nearly all of which is accounted for by a reduction in non-urgent visits that could be treated in alternative settings. The reduction in emergency room visits is most pronounced during regular office hours when physician's offices are likely to be open. In contrast, I find no effect for non-preventable emergencies such as heart attacks.

The pricing test period (1996-2010) is divided into two sub-periods: 1996-2005 (the years preceding Poland's accession to the EU) and 2005-2010 (the years of Poland's membership in the EU). The algorithm for the description of returns combines previous research by Fama and French with the author's own considerations. The proposed model factors are defined based on Fama and French (1993,1995,1996). Consideration of local pricing boundary conditions of the Polish market and modification of the Fama-French model allow one to determine changes to components of systematic risk and risk premium. Based on the proposed procedure, the results offer additional investment recommendations apart from the Fama-French model. The distributions of systematic risk components are similar in the two tested periods; however, the values of risk premium components changed during Poland's membership in the EU. Using the Fama-French model and the proposed modification, this research leads to a number of conclusions that may be useful for investors and portfolio managers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Physical factors which determine human energy intake requirement, given economic conditions, such as gender and age structures of the population as well as occupation, are usually not incorporated. While this is appropriate in the situation of a continuous, stable development of demographic structure, it might lead to biased result if drastic and irregular demographic changes have taken place. This paper provides a case study of China of the impact of demographic dynamics on the change of physical requirement and energy intake demand. The unique population pyramid in China, resulted from the big famine in the early 19605 and then the One Child policy starting from the 1980s, has led to the irregular evolution of age groups and the consequent changes in the proportion of the big-eaters. As a result, given food price and income, the very age structure of the population at the time affects the overall weighted energy intake level of the population significantly. Using household survey data ranging from year 1991 to 2009, the index of Adult Male Equivalent Scale (AMES) is constructed to reflect the varying per capita physical requirement resulted from the demographic dynamic over the years in China. The AMES index, together with food price and income, has been applied to the per capita energy intake model. The empirical results show that the AMES index has statically strong impact on per capita energy intake, and the inclusion of the AMES index into the model has improved the model fitness. This finding sheds light on a possible way for improvement in projecting China's food demand in the future by incorporating the country's changing demographic factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Their users' needs regarding the extents and type of accounting information as well as the costs of their providing are widely discussed as the arguments for differential reporting for SMEs, although there is still more literature focusing on financial reporting of large enterprises. The standards setters try to decrease the reporting burden for SMEs, keeping the relevant information for their reports users, while considering harmonization goals in the same time. In such an attempt, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued an International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) designed for use by small and medium-sized entities (SMEs) the 9th of July 2009, however some national European standard-setters seem not to be keen to introduce them. The aim of our paper is to analyze, the attempts and difficulties to reach all these goals in the same time and to implement the IFRS for SMEs, such as drawn by the IASB, in the European countries.

Pegs (particularly to the US dollar) and managed floats tend to have lower volatility than independent floats. A deeper investigation shows that the peg effect operates almost entirely through currency networks (i.e. where two currencies are pegged to the same anchor currency), and the lower volatility of US dollar pegs reflects the size of the US dollar network. Managed floats show clear evidence of tracking the US dollar, further increasing the effective size of the US dollar network. Inflation undermines the currency-stabilizing effect of peg networks. Currencies in smaller peg networks have higher unweighted but not trade-weighted exchange rate volatility, which is consistent with anchors being chosen to minimize trade-weighted volatility. The size of the effective US dollar network revealed here is a plausible explanation of the rarity of basket pegs. Volatility also reflects a range of structural factors such as country size, level of development, population density, inflation differentials and business cycle asymmetry.","[Bleaney, Michael; Tian, Mo] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Bleaney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",Michael.bleaney@nottingham.ac.uk,"Tian, Mo/X-9280-2019","Tian, Mo/0000-0001-9084-0203",,,,,20,6,6,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

These results are robust to extensive work, wage and sickness absence history controls.

We find direct empirical support for this. In accordance with the theoretical framework we find also that long-term absences are independent of exposure to HIM, which is consistent with long-term absences entailing replacement labour costs and with short absences having a negative effect on longer absences.

We use the Slovenian statistical Household Budget Surveys (HBS) data for the reference years from 1998 to 2005. The HBS covers private households in placecountry-regionSlovenia with the basic socio and demographic data for the household members observed within the surveys, data on income, assets and final consumption. In the pro bit analysis we focus on the determinants of the undergraduate and postgraduate higher education participation separately for different age groups. Based on the results of the three pro bit models we find six different determinants of the undergraduate higher education participation. The first two most important determinants are the availability of internet access in a household and education of parents. On the postgraduate level of education we also find six important determinants of higher education participation, with the first most important being the availability of information-communication technology, followed by the personal income.","[Cepar, Ziga; Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Koper 6104, Slovenia",University of Primorska,"Cepar, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Cankarjeva 5, Koper 6104, Slovenia.",ziga.cepar@fm-kp.si; stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si,"Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372",,,,,26,2,2,0,10,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

But many students who take out a loan do not earn a degree (the dropout rate among college students is between 33 and 50 percent). We examine whether insurance, in the form of loan forgiveness in the event of failure to complete college, can be offered, taking into account moral hazard and adverse selection. To do so, we develop a model that accounts for college enrollment and graduation rates among recent U. S. high school graduates. In our model, students may fail to earn a degree because they either fail college or choose to leave voluntarily. We find that if loan forgiveness is offered only when a student fails college, average welfare increases by 2.40 percent (in consumption equivalent units) without much effect on either enrollment or graduation rates. If loan forgiveness is offered against both failure and voluntary departure, welfare increases by 2.15 percent, and both enrollment and graduation are higher.","[Chatterjee, Satyajit] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Ionescu, Felicia] Colgate Univ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia; Colgate University,"Chatterjee, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA.",satyajit.chatterjee@phil.frb.org; fionescu@colgate.edu,"Chatterjee, Satyajit/JNT-1743-2023",,,,,,32,23,40,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Technological learning is quite uncertain. Previous research showed that an optimization model with uncertain technological learning could generate technological bifurcations: various local optimal solutions of technology development strategies with very similar total costs but different environmental impacts. With a simplified energy system optimization model, this paper explores technological bifurcations and the effect of a carbon tax on the development and diffusion of new energy technologies. With a three-stage analysis, the main findings of this paper are (1) that technological learning, instead of its uncertainty, is an essential mechanism for technological bifurcations, and (2) a carbon tax can reduce carbon emission but not necessarily technological bifurcations. An implication from these findings is that with a carbon tax, there still could be potential for other policy interventions to reduce carbon emissions without much additional cost.

The refunding scheme reduces the intertemporal climate change problem into a static public goods problem.

I use this analytical model to provide intuition about the main distributional components. The model is calibrated with data from Mexico to obtain unambiguous price and quantity changes. I find that the distribution of the costs is driven by the way the revenue is recycled. In particular, the costs are distributed regressively when the revenue is recycled as a manufacturing tax cut and progressively when it is recycled as a food subsidy. Providing a food subsidy also generates higher welfare and lower carbon emissions than the manufacturing tax cut. To compare and test the robustness of the numerical findings for Mexico, I calibrate the model with data for a developed country, specifically the U.S.A. Despite differences in the magnitude of the changes in some variables, the general findings mentioned above also hold for U.S.A. data. These results suggest that, as found for the U.S.A. in recent studies, carbon taxes are not necessarily regressive. Rather, the way revenue is recycled is a major determinant of how the carbon tax costs are distributed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

An important potential threat against any school choice mechanism is the tendency of schools to circumvent the procedure via two kinds of strategic manipulation: manipulation via capacities and manipulation via pre-arranged matches. This paper studies the extent of the vulnerability of three prominent school choice mechanisms that have been adopted (or, considered for adoption) by some school districts in the US. We find that the highly debated Boston mechanism as well as the top trading cycles mechanism are immune to manipulation via capacities, unlike the student-optimal stable mechanism (SOSM). We show that SOSM is immune to manipulation via capacities if and only if the priority structure satisfies an acyclicity condition proposed by Ergin (Econometrica 70:2489-2497, 2002).

We find that countries whose pre-crisis current account balances were in excess of what could be explained by standard economic fundamentals have experienced the largest contractions in their external balance. We subsequently examine the contributions of real exchange rates, domestic demand and domestic output to the adjustment process (allowing for differences across exchange rate regimes) and find that external adjustment in deficit countries was achieved primarily through demand compression, rather than expenditure switching. Finally, we show that changes in other investment flows were the main channel of financial account adjustment, with official external assistance and ECB liquidity cushioning the exit of private capital flows for some countries.

The direct comparison between these two economies was motivated by the statement of the Singapore Government that its services sector, especially the retail sector, lagged behind Hong Kong's productivity levels. The results show that since 2005, Singapore's wholesale and retail sector performance in terms of labour productivity has been below Hong Kong's level, largely due to the poor performance of its retail sector arising from an influx of foreign workers. Results from total factor productivity analysis of these two economies also suggest that Hong Kong's better performance (since 2005) was largely due to its ability to employ more educated and trained workers with limited use of capital. The results suggest that polices that have worked in Hong Kong may not work in Singapore because its population is more diverse, which poses a challenge to policymakers in raising its productivity level.","Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Lee, BL (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",bl.lee@qut.edu.au,"Lee, Boon/K-5178-2019","Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575",,,,,40,0,1,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

The responsibility of social disengagement has often been attributed to pervasive busyness and the increasing pressure on time. In this paper we argue that computer-mediated interaction, and particularly online networking, can help mitigate this downward trend. We develop a logical framework for assessing the role of the Internet in the evolution of social participation. We analyze an economy where agents can develop their social interactions through two main modes of participation, one encompassing both online networking and face to face interactions, and the other solely based on physical encounters. We study the interdependence between the increase in the pressure on time and the variation in the relative performance of the two strategies of participation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In a calibrated matching model that generates empirically relevant labor market fluctuations conditional on exogenous fiscal policy, the Ramsey-optimal policy calls for extreme labor tax rate volatility. Purposeful tax volatility induces dramatically smaller, but efficient, fluctuations of labor markets by keeping distortions constant over the business cycle. We relate the results to standard Ramsey theory by developing welfare-relevant concepts of efficiency and distortions based on primitive matching frictions. Although the basic Ramsey principles of wedge smoothing and zero intertemporal distortions hold, tax smoothing depends on whether wages are set efficiently.","[Arseneau, David M.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA; [Chugh, Sanjay K.] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Chugh, Sanjay K.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Boston College; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Arseneau, DM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,50,55,58,1,24,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

This article examines the implications of the tipped minimum wage and shows that increasing it may lead restaurants to adopt a compulsory service charge in lieu of tipping to extract the economic rent enjoyed by waiters under tipping. Because servers are better off with tipping, this implies that increasing the tipped minimum wage in an attempt to increase servers' income may achieve the opposite result.

Indeed, qualitative stylized-facts can be generated with zero-intelligence traders (ZITs) but we stress that they are without any quantitative predictive power. In this paper we show that in most of the cases, such qualitative stylized facts hide unrealistic price motions at the intraday level and ill-calibrated return processes as well. To generate realistic price motions and return series with adequate quantitative values is out-of-reach using pure ZIT populations. To do so, one must increasingly constrain agents' choices to a point where it is hard to claim that their behaviour is completely random. In addition we show that even with highly constrained ZIT agents, one cannot reproduce real time series from these. Except in a few cases, first order moments of ZITs never equal real data ones. We therefore claim that stylized facts produced by means of ZIT agents are useless for financial engineering.","[Brandouy, Olivier] Sorbonne Grad Business Sch, GREGOR, IAE Paris, EA 2474, Paris, France; [Corelli, Angelo] Linkoping Univ, IEI Dept, Linkoping, Sweden; [Veryzhenko, Iryna] ENSAM Paristech, EA 2474, IAE Paris, GREGOR, Paris, France; [Waldeck, Roger] Telecom Bretagne, Inst Mines Telecom, Dept LUSSI, Brest, France",Linkoping University; Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology; heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM); IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique,"Brandouy, O (通讯作者)，Sorbonne Grad Business Sch, GREGOR, IAE Paris, EA 2474, Paris, France.",brandouy.iae@univ-paris1.fr; angelo.corelli@liu.se; iryna.veryzhenko@ensam.eu; roger.waldeck@telecom-bretagne.eu,"Waldeck, Roger/AAD-5977-2020","Waldeck, Roger/0000-0003-2031-9054; Corelli, Angelo/0000-0001-8936-8490",,,,,26,6,7,0,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

These preferences are taken as given, not derived from more primitive ones. Our aim is to establish an axiomatic foundation providing the link between observation of choices and a functional representation which is convenient, free of inconsistencies and can provide the basis for measurement. The dependence among preferences may take place in two conceptually different ways, expressing two different views of the nature of interdependent preferences. The first is Festinger's view that the evaluation of peers' outcomes is useful to improve individual choices by learning from the comparison. The second is Veblen's view that interdependent preferences keep track of social status derived from a social value attributed to the goods one consumes. Corresponding to these two different views, we have two different formulations. In the first, the decision maker values his outcomes and those of others on the basis of his own utility. In the second, he ranks outcomes according to a social value function. We give different axiomatic foundations to these two different, but complementary, views of the nature of the interdependence. On the basis of this axiomatic foundation, we build a behavioural theory of comparative statics within subjects and across subjects. We characterize preferences according to the relative importance assigned to gains and losses in social domain, that is pride and envy. This parallels the standard analysis of private gains and losses (as well as that of regret and relief). We give an axiomatic foundation of interpersonal comparison of preferences, ordering individuals according to their sensitivity to social ranking. These characterizations provide the behavioural foundation for applied analysis of market and game equilibria with interdependent preferences.","[Maccheroni, Fabio; Marinacci, Massimo] Univ Bocconi, Bocconi, Italy; [Rustichini, Aldo] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Bocconi University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Maccheroni, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Bocconi, Italy.",,,"MARINACCI, MASSIMO/0000-0002-0079-4176; MACCHERONI, FABIO/0000-0001-6338-6383",,,,,54,28,30,0,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In his paper, we propose game-theoretic models that incorporate farmers' decisions on land use and market choice into the biofuel manufacturers' supply chain design problem. A noncooperative bi-level Stackelberg leader-follower game model and a cooperative game model are developed respectively to address possible business partnership scenarios between feedstock suppliers and biofuel manufacturers. The models determine the optimal number and locations of biorefineries, the required prices for these refineries to compete for feedstock resources, as well as farmers' land use choices between food and energy. Using corn as an example of feedstock crops, spatial market equilibrium is utilized to model the relationship between corn supply and demand, and the associated price variations in local grain markets. With linear corn demand functions, we develop a solution approach that transforms the original discrete mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (DC-MPEC) into to a solvable mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The proposed methodology is illustrated using an empirical case study of the Illinois State. The computation results reveal interesting insights into optimal land use strategies and supply chain design for the emerging biofuel economy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

According to this conception, interference with these natural processes would be counterproductive. Ward, a confirmed Darwinian, coined the term artificial selection when he proposed an alternate conception that attributed most progress to the disciplined application of human intelligence. Ross adapted Ward's artificial-natural distinction to the problem of social order, arguing that random variation and survival of the fittest can generate social controls that preserve order in small communities, but that only artificial social controls can keep order in complex societies. Ross's distinction made its way into the Legal Foundations of Capitalism and Institutional Economics where Commons focused on the evolution of what Ross labeled artificial social controls - laws governing the wage bargain and the behavior of corporations. In the process Commons confronted the problem of deliberation, the problem of obtaining intelligent actions and decisions from passionate, biased humans organized in democratic societies.","SUNY Coll Brockport, Brockport, NY USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Brockport,"Chasse, JD (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Brockport, Brockport, NY USA.",,,,,,,,93,2,2,0,18,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This leads to worries over the sustainability of economic growth in these countries. Given this concern, we ask the following questions: Is there a force that would allow economic growth and declining population to coexist? Is there a mechanism that could reverse the decline in fertility? We argue that returns to human capital in production provide the key to understanding this relation. Our theoretical framework predicts that, when the degree of increasing returns to human capital in traditional production technologies falls, advanced economies switch their productive efforts from labor-oriented technologies that require a constant creation of young workforce toward human capital-oriented technologies that support an ageing population. We call this shift the endogenous efficiency-augmenting mechanism. This suggests that sustained economic growth and a declining population can coexist in the long run. Finally, we compare our model against the data and find: (i) The degree of increasing returns to human capital has been falling over time throughout the world along with population growth rates. (ii) Increasing returns to human capital and population growth rates are positively correlated. (iii) Predictions of our model are consistent with what the data reveal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose a univariate autoregressive growth equation is estimated on an unbalanced panel of OECD countries over the period 1960-2008. Our results suggest that the occurrence of a financial crisis negatively and permanently affects potential output. In particular, financial crises are estimated to lower potential output by around 1.5-2.4% on average, with most of the impact coming from the effect on capital. The magnitude of the effect increases with the severity of the crisis. These results are robust to the use of an alternative measure of potential output, changes in the methodology and in the sample periods.

We have developed indices of related export variety (REV) and of unrelated export variety (UEV) by using the informational entropy function for a sample of 97 countries using NBER & UN trade data for the period 1992-2005. We used these indices sequentially as dependent variables with the bank credit ratio and stock market capitalization ratio as independent variables. In addition, we include the education system, natural resources and four principal component factors characterizing the cost of doing business, political system, quality of governance and the degree of openness of the countries as control variables in our regressions. Our pooled regression models show that the financial system is an important determinant of both types of export variety for all countries but that, for the most successful developers, the banking system and the stock market play different roles, with the former being relatively more appropriate for REV and the latter for UEV. Such specialization of different forms of the financial system seems to confirm that stock markets are likely to be relatively more appropriate to fund the exploratory type of innovations which are required to increase UEV.","[Javaid, Muhammad Nadeem] Dawood Cooperat Housing Soc, Karachi Sch Business & Leadership, Karachi, Pakistan; [Saviotti, Pier-Paolo] GREDEG CNRS, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Saviotti, Pier-Paolo] Univ Paris 06, INRA GAEL, F-38040 Grenoble, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Sorbonne Universite; INRAE,"Javaid, MN (通讯作者)，Dawood Cooperat Housing Soc, Karachi Sch Business & Leadership, ST-03,Natl Stadium Rd, Karachi, Pakistan.",nadeem.javaid@ksbl.org; pier-paolo.saviotti@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,71,0,0,2,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We construct time series of markups allowing for fluctuations in capacity utilization and total factor productivity and use an aggregate production function that is more general than Cobb-Douglas. Including the constructed markup series in a bias-corrected panel vector autoregression with annual OECD data, we find that a positive shock to government spending tends to lower markups while raising output.

We utilized the theoretical insights from the So low (1956) growth model and its extension by Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992) and followed Senhadji's (2000) growth accounting procedure. We find that growth in Kenya, until the 1990s was mainly due to factor accumulation. Since then, TFP has made a small contribution to growth. Our findings imply that while variables like overseas development aid, foreign direct investment and progress of financial sector improves TFP, trade openness is the key determinant. Consequently, policy makers should focus on policies that improve trade openness if the long run growth rate is to be raised. (C) 2012 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We design an asset market where information arrives sequentially over time to investigate the sources of these phenomena. We find that prices react insufficiently to news surprises and under-reacting drifts outnumber over-reacting reversals substantially. Under-reaction decreases in magnitude when information announcement is perfectly public, but still persists. We reject behavioral explanations based on overconfidence and disposition effect. Contrary to common beliefs, over-reaction patterns are present in our results of predominant slow adjustment of prices to surprises. With the knowledge of intrinsic value, we find that the reversal phase in over-reaction patterns is simply a sluggish adjustment, too. We propose a price inertia theory of under- and over-reaction: when information arrives sequentially over time, the market is characterized by a slow convergence toward intrinsic value; when news surprises are of the same signs, prices falls behind newly updated intrinsic values, manifesting under-reacting drifts; when news surprises change signs, prices again do not adjust quick enough to catch up with the new intrinsic values, manifesting a temporal pattern of seemingly over-reacting reversals.

Using an extended Slacks-Based Measure (SBM) model incorporating an undesirable output, the CO2 reduction potential and marginal abatement costs are estimated for 29 provinces over the period 1995-2007. The CO2 Abatement Capacity Index (ACI) is constructed based on weighted equity and efficiency indexes. We find that there exists a large gap in potential reduction capability and marginal abatement cost among the eastern. middle and western regions. The eastern region has the least inefficient emission and the highest marginal abatement cost, while the western region has the largest potential reduction capability and the lowest marginal cost faced in reducing CO2 emissions. The difference in potential CO2 abatement among the provinces results from different industry structures, energy compositions and degrees of the openness of trade. The ACI ranking and the final allocation among provinces depend on the policy-makers' preferences regarding equity and efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Implications of adopting Special Products and Sensitive Products in Doha negotiations for world and China's agriculture,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Doha trade liberalization; Special Products and Sensitive Products; Poverty alleviation; General equilibrium model; Regional impacts,TRADE LIBERALIZATION; POVERTY,"This paper analyzes the potential impacts of the agreements of Special Products and Sensitive Products (SPs) in Doha negotiations on world and China's Agriculture. By linking a global trade model to a national policy model which itself is connected to a set of disaggregated household data, we are able to assess the effects of the inclusion of SPs into a Doha agreement on agriculture in China and the rest of the world and different farmers across China. Our results show that since the inclusion of SPs in a Doha agreement adds more protection in agriculture, the total quantity of resources used in world agriculture increases. Although increasing, it is important to note that the total rise is only a fraction of a percent of agricultural value added and the gains to rural income per capita are likewise small. Moreover, an important difference between the apparent benefits of SPs is highlighted when they are considered for one country alone and when they are made available to all WTO members. The benefits to agriculture in China (and other countries) from increases in protection resulting from SPs are typically offset when these flexibilities are made available to all countries. While there are some positive benefits for certain vulnerable groups in society (in China), we show that there are adverse effects on equity and the impacts differ largely among regions.

We advance an explanation of this fact based on an inter-temporal equilibrium multi-assets model of financial markets with an explicit and endogenous price dynamics. The market is driven by an exogenous stochastic process of dividend yields paid by the assets that we identify as market fundamentals. The model is rather flexible and allows for the coexistence of different trading strategies. The evolution of assets price and traders' wealth is described by a high-dimensional stochastic dynamical system. We identify the equilibria of the model consistent with a baseline assumption of procedural rationality. We show that these equilibria are characterized by excess covariance in prices with respect to the dividend process. Moreover, we show that in equilibrium there is a positive expected marginal profit in choosing more risky portfolios. As a consequence, the evolutionary pressure generates a trend towards more remunerative strategies, which, in turn, increase the variance of prices and the dynamic instability of the system.

This paper considers which (or which combination of) structural shocks can be consistent with the implications of such an interest rate differential shock that has been identified in previous studies. It is especially demand and confidence shocks, rather than supply or monetary policy shocks, which are found to generate effects similar to those produced by an unexpected widening of the interest rate differential and overall lead to longer-term gains from carry trade activity.

We use unique international data on the publications, citations, and affiliations of mathematicians to examine the impact of a large, post-1992 influx of Soviet mathematicians on the productivity of their U.S. counterparts. We find a negative productivity effect on those mathematicians whose research overlapped with that of the Soviets. We also document an increased mobility rate (to lower quality institutions and out of active publishing) and a reduced likelihood of producing home run papers. Although the total product of the preexisting American mathematicians shrank, the Soviet contribution to American mathematics filled in the gap. However, there is no evidence that the Soviets greatly increased the size of the mathematics pie. Finally, we find that there are significant international differences in the productivity effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and these international differences can be explained by both differences in the size of the emigre flow into the various countries and in how connected each country is to the global market for mathematical publications.

The case for both was based strongly on mainstream economic analysis but one was a failure and the other a success. The introduction of the local community charge, or 'poll tax' as it became known, was such a failure that not only did it have to be repealed but it was also a factor in the downfall of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister. The introduction of value added tax took more account of behavioral factors and was successful. The paper concludes that a wider approach based on behavioral as well as mainstream economics may have considerable advantages in developing tax policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The main merit of the paper is that we examine three stages in the regional mobility of refugees and labour immigrants: First, the settlement pattern of newly arrived immigrants, second, their subsequent mobility between regions and, third, their eventual exit from the regional labour market to abroad. The analyses apply to immigrants who arrived in Norway from 1995 to 2004. In all three stages, mobility is investigated with regard to its responsiveness to regional differences in wages and unemployment. The main finding is that, in all three stages, the geographical mobility of immigrants is sensitive to regional economic opportunities. In that sense, immigrants do grease the wheels of the labour markets, through all the three stages of mobility. The most robust results are found for regional unemployment differences. With regard to natives, we generally do not find any strong evidence for greasing the wheels effects. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that more imports go unreported at the destination country when tariffs are higher. Consistent with the tariff evasion hypothesis, this result implies that the trade creation effect of a free trade agreement may in fact be due to less underreporting. Further, this paper shows that the larger Canadian tariff preference margin for the U.S. is associated with more goods originating in third countries being transshipped through the U.S. territory for re-export. The preference margin is also positively correlated with the value of excess imports from the U.S., which qualify for preferential treatment.

Based on this, the experimental utility measure is connected with the econometric model Linear Expenditure System, and presents an experimental procedure for testing the utility maximization hypothesis, which will resolve a long unsettled perplexity in a fundamental stone of economics since Gossen proposed it in 1854.","Jinan Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"He, YQ (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",hyq5.27@163.com,,,,,,,48,0,1,1,8,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 23,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201229.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-29,0.0,,,36,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,977UD,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306689400001,0

In this paper, the Hodrick-Prescott filter is extended by assuming two kinds of variance for the system noise driving the trend component: the larger one adopted in a point of time causing a trend break, and the smaller one adopted for remaining sequences. The number and location of structural breaks are determined by information criteria. In the proposed method, extraordinary shocks themselves can be illustrated. A Monte Carlo study shows the efficacy of the proposed model. Empirical results suggest that except for the UK, extraordinary shocks in quarterly time series of industrial production are detected for remaining six developed countries. Finally, it is shown that the proposed method considerably outperforms the other competing methods in correctly detecting business cycles. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The Commission defines market power as the ability to profitably increase price above the competitive level for a significant period. Because comparing tariffs alone is generally meaningless for identifying good transportation alternatives, the Commission tends to rely on netback price and delivered price analyses to evaluate market power. When the applicant's tariff is a poor proxy for the competitive tariff, as evidenced by significant excess demand, using the tariff biases the analysis in favor of finding market power, a reverse cellophane trap. Estimating the competitive tariff to avoid this bias is complicated by the spatial aspect of transportation.

Weighted fictitious play is extended to detect two-period patterns in opponents' behavior and to comply with the cognitive laws of subjective perception. An analysis of the data from Nyarko and Schotter (2002) uncovers significant evidence of pattern recognition in elicited beliefs and action choices. The probability that subjects employ pattern recognition depends positively on a measure of the exploitable two-period patterns in an opponent's action choices, in stark contrast to the minimax hypothesis. A significant proportion of the subjects' competence in pattern recognition is the result of a subconscious/automatic cognitive mechanism, implying that elicited beliefs may not adequately represent the complete learning process of game players. Additionally, standard weighted fictitious play models are found to bias memory parameter estimates upwards due to mis-specification. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

First, it makes the incentive pay scheme low powered: the maximum variation of compensation across performance levels is compressed and the contract is less extreme compared to the case without renegotiation. This effect is stronger when the players are less patient. Second, renegotiation typically renders termination impossible; the contract relies on a low-morale mechanism to enforce mutual cooperation. Finally, renegotiation compels the players to resolve their conflicts by selecting a contract that maximizes the lowest possible surplus along the path of the contract. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We show that a nonlinear relationship between fractionalization and corruption exists: corruption is high in homogeneous or very fragmented countries, but low where fractionalization is intermediate. In fact, when ethnic diversity is intermediate, constituencies act as a check and balance device to limit ethnically-based corruption. Consequently, the relationship between fractionalization and growth rate is also non-linear: growth is high in the middle range of ethnic diversity, low in homogeneous or very fragmented countries.","[Piga, Gustavo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Terr, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Cerqueti, Roy; Coppier, Raffaella] Univ Macerata, Dept Econ, Macerata, Italy; [Cerqueti, Roy; Coppier, Raffaella] Univ Macerata, Financial Inst, Macerata, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Macerata; University of Macerata,"Piga, G (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Terr, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",gustavo.piga@uniroma2.it,,"CERQUETI, ROY/0000-0002-1871-7371",,,,,44,26,27,1,28,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

The actual occurrence of some of the elements, such as deflation and zero interest rates, was, however, rare in contemporary experience. As a result there has been a disconnect between what is theoretically understood by economists and the public discourse about Japans lost decades. The implications for policy are not very controversial in theory fiscal policy should work and monetary policy could work but not via interest rate transmission. But the length of time that Japan remained below its potential GDP fuelled a debate about the effectiveness of traditional policy measures. This gave rise to real questions about the first lost decade (19912001): why didn't policy work? Was this some new mystery ailment for which known remedies were ineffective? These questions are still debated and they remain important because the popular reading of Japans experience is ill-informed and is being mis-applied to current policy settings. This paper argues that Japans economic experience of the last two decades does not provide unambiguous evidence that demand stimulus policies are ineffective. The paper describes the ways in which economic theory has been changed by the lessons from Japan.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Australia Japan Res Ctr, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Corbett, J (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Australia Japan Res Ctr, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",jenny.corbett@anu.edu.au,,"Corbett, Jenny/0000-0001-9669-1843",,,,,57,1,2,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

J,"Dávila, J",,,,"Davila, Julio",,,The taxation of capital returns in overlapping generations models,JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Taxation of capital; Overlapping generations,BORROWING CONSTRAINTS; INCOME TAXATION; DEBT,"This paper shows that in the Diamond (1965) overlapping generations economy with production and capital savings, there is a period-by-period balanced fiscal policy supporting a steady state allocation that Pareto-improves upon the laissez-faire competitive equilibrium steady state (whether dynamically inefficient or efficient) without resorting to intergenerational transfers. The policy consists of taxing linearly (or subsidizing, in the dynamically efficient case) the returns to capital, while balancing the budget period by period through a lump-sum transfer (or tax, respectively) in second period. This intervention grants every generation the highest steady state utility attainable through markets (i.e. remunerating factors by their marginal productivities and without transfers) which under laissez-faire is not a competitive equilibrium outcome. A transition from the competitive equilibrium steady state to this other steady state is also Pareto-improving when the former is dynamically inefficient. The result disentangles from redistributive considerations the impact of the taxation of capital returns on steady state welfare, and thus provides a rationale for the taxation of capital returns that is based on efficiency considerations and not on redistributive goals.

Among the implications reviewed here was his claim that Darwinian principles applied to social entities as well as to biological phenomena. It is also argued that economists have additional reasons for taking Darwinian evolution seriously. Recent work on the evolution of altruism, cooperation and morality show that we are on the brink of developing an evolutionary-grounded theory of human motivation that breaks from the selfish utility-maximizer lambasted by Veblen. This new theory accepts a biological as well as a cultural foundation for moral dispositions. As noted here, the neglected British institutional economist John A.

However, what dominates in reality is a process of permanent changes, which sometimes proceed in a cascading manner rather than linearly. It must be acknowledged that the capitalist market economy by its very nature is involved in periodical crises. They must occur from time to time, yet the magnitude of the recent crisis is a result of inappropriate institutions and wrong macroeconomic policies based on neoliberalism. While the underlying causes of the crisis and the ways out of it at the era of interdependent global economy is discussed vividly in countless books and papers, yet it ought to be clear that the world is moving from one crisis to another. Thus, one must consider not only the economics of crisis, but also a kind of crisis of economics. There is a need for a New Pragmatism, based on the better understanding of economics as science, describing the economy as a system of forces and flows which contantly give feedback and influence each other.","[Kolodko, Grzegorz W.] Kozminski Univ, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Kolodko, GW (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, 59 Jagiellonska St, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland.",kolodko@tiger.edu.pl,,"KOLODKO, Grzegorz W./0000-0001-7015-5612",,,,,33,0,0,0,9,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

World economic situation since 2007/2008 has put an extra pressure on people's psycho-physical state of health. People are increasingly looking forward to new ways of relaxation and re-energizing themselves. Some modes of tourism, globally, due to the economic downturn, have slowed down, but the tourism sector itself has done remarkably well during the last two-three years by offering the new model i.e. facility generally called Wellness. Within tourism, wellness is relatively a new trend that has registered an impressive growth rate. World-wide more and more people are traveling to destinations that provide wellness facilities. The rise of 'wellness' concept can be attributed to two factors. First, the WHO has now long been pushing forward an integrated concept of well-being and fitness into its global health policy. Second, the overall education of people has increased the human awareness of personal health. Tourism service providers, especially the luxury hotels were quick to cash upon these facts and created a palette of wellness services such as spa and health treatments, occupational health therapy, beauty treatments, sports' facilities, spiritual activities, massages, and rehabilitation programs, etc. Since sufficient data on the subject have not yet emerged, the paper basically discusses some conceptual aspects of wellness tourism only.","[Koncul, Niko] Univ Dubrovnik, Dubrovnik, Croatia; [Koncul, Niko] Babin Kuk Dd, Dubrovnik, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik,"Koncul, N (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",niko.koncul@babinkuk.com,,,,,,,10,31,35,12,130,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Overall, we find that the level of capital openness increases capital flow volatility, and that countries with original sin experience additional volatility in their capital flows. When the data sample is limited to countries with high institutional quality the difference remains between the two groups-confirming that the different effects of capital openness on volatility should be attributed to differences in the international status of currencies rather than in institutional quality Emerging economies whose currencies are not internationalized should therefore be more cautious of capital account liberalization.","[Park, Bokyeong; An, Jiyoun] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP),"Park, B (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, 246 Yangjaedaero, Seoul, South Korea.",bypark@kiep.go.kr; jyan@kiep.go.kr,"Park, Bokyeong/AAK-8927-2020","Park, Bokyeong/0000-0001-7745-1430",,,,,21,3,4,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

The GDP per capita convergence should be expected according to the exogenous economic growth model and neoclassical trade theory. The presence of sigma-convergence and both absolute and conditional beta-convergence is tested for on a sample of 25 European Union countries (EU25). Results confirm the existence of beta-convergence of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity among EU25, but not among EU15 and CEE10 countries. sigma-convergence has been confirmed among EU25 and CEE10 countries, while GDP per capita has been diverging in the EU15 group of countries. Moreover, the results reveal that recent economic crisis has reversed long-term tendencies and led to income convergence within EU15 and divergence within CEE10. During the crisis, the income differences among the EU25 countries have increased, but the scope and duration of this effect has been limited and has not affected the long term convergence path. However, the obtained long term speed of convergence is significantly lower compared with the previous researches.","Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia",University of Kragujevac,"Stanisic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Djure Pucara 3, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia.",nstanisic@kg.ac.rs,"Stanisic, Nenad/W-2573-2019","Stanisic, Nenad/0000-0002-7070-4826",,,,,39,22,22,0,21,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

This is an incomplete description of monetary policy reactions when the parameters are not uniform over the conditional distribution of the interest rate. I use quantile regressions to estimate parameters over the whole conditional distribution of the federal funds rate. Inverse quantile regressions are applied to deal with endogeneity. Real-time data of inflation forecasts and the output gap are used. I find significant and systematic variations of parameters over the conditional interest rate distribution. Testing for structural changes in regression quantiles shows that these parameter variations cannot be explained by preference shifts of the Fed. Asymmetric interest rate responses can rather be related to expansions and recessions and are consistent with a recession avoidance preference of the Fed during the Volcker-Greenspan era.

The paper begins with describing the basic framework used in recent empirical cross-country growth research. Even though this literature was mainly inspired by endogenous growth theories, the neoclassical growth model is still the workhorse for cross-country growth empirics. The second part of the paper emphasises model uncertainty, which is indeed immense but generally neglected in the empirical cross-country growth literature. The most outstanding feature of the literature is that a large number of factors have been suggested as fundamental growth determinants. Together with the small sample property, this leads to an important problem: model uncertainty. The questions which factors are more fundamental in explaining growth dynamics and hence growth differences are still the subject of academic research. Recent attempts based on general-to-specific modeling or model averaging are promising but have their own limits. Finally, the paper highlights the implications of model uncertainty for policy evaluation.","Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Ulasan, B (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",Bulent.Ulasan@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,136,2,2,0,14,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,MAY 10,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201216.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-16,0.0,,,70,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,941TB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303987000001,0

Following the principle of the Rothbarth approach, the identification of the children's share requires the observation of adult-specific goods. Our method differs from this traditional approach in that it is compatible with economies of scale as well as with parents' bargaining.

The main goal of the associated transfers is to facilitate convergence of poor regions (in terms of per-capita income) to the EU average. We use data at the NUTS3 level from the last two EU budgetary periods (1994-1999 and 2000-2006) and generalized propensity score estimation to analyze to which extent the goal of fostering growth in the target regions was achieved with the funds provided and whether or not more transfers generated stronger growth effects. We find that, overall, EU transfers enable faster growth in the recipient regions as intended, but we estimate that in 36% of the recipient regions the transfer intensity exceeds the aggregate efficiency maximizing level and in 18% of the regions a reduction of transfers would not even reduce their growth. We conclude that some reallocation of the funds across target regions would lead to higher aggregate growth in the EU and could generate even faster convergence than the current scheme does.

Advocates claim that voluntary programs can help shore up poorly performing command-and-control environmental regulation in developing countries. Although literature on this issue is quite thin, research on voluntary environmental programs in industrialized countries suggests that they are sometimes ineffective because they mainly attract relatively clean plants free-riding on prior pollution control investments. We use plant-level data on some 59,000 facilities to identify the drivers of participation in the ISO 14001 certification program in Mexico. We use data on the incidence of regulatory fines to proxy for environmental performance. We find that regulatory fines spur certification: on average, a fine roughly doubles the likelihood of certification for 3 years. Hence, the program attracts relatively dirty plants and at least has the potential to improve environmental performance. We also find that plants that sold their goods in overseas markets, used imported inputs, were relatively large, and were in certain sectors and states were more likely to be certified.

Evidence from the Mexican transition This paper presents evidence for a causal effect of international migration on the functioning of democratic institutions in the sending country. It does so for the particular case of the Mexican democratization process, using data from municipal elections for the 20002002 electoral cycle. Estimating an instrumental variable probit model, it is found that migration significantly increases the probability of a party in opposition to the former state party PRI to win in a municipal election for the first time. A 1% point increase in the proportion of migrant households in a municipality is estimated to increase the probability of an opposition party victory in so far continuously state-party ruled town halls by more than half a percent. This result is robust to the inclusion of controls for party preferences and can be interpreted to be the result of improved democratic institutions.

There exists a stock return-inflation long run relationship, and the long run parameters are non-linear functions of those of the conditional error correction model. The OLS estimates of the latter model constitute the long run parameter estimates and their standard errors are estimated by delta methods. The long run model estimates so constructed can be biassed and inconsistent, and the delta method is derived assuming asymptotic normality, which does not hold in this investigation. In this paper, to overcome these limitations of the traditional methods, we employ the bias-corrected bootstrap method. As a consequence, the robust and reliable statistical inference can be made on the long run return-inflation relationship. The empirical results show that the expected inflation had no significant effect on real stock returns, while the observed inflation had a significant and negative effect. Furthermore, the data generating process of the returns-inflation relationship was not affected by the change in monetary policy regime in the early 1990s. These findings imply that Australian stocks have been very effective instruments for hedging against expected inflation. Because of the resilience of Australian economy to the current global financial and economic crisis, this finding has implications for long term domestic and foreign investors in Australia.

COOPER; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; OUTPUTS; ENERGY; MODELS,"The economic concept of weak and strong disposability has long dominated studies on DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) environmental assessment. This study reviews the two disposability concepts from their conceptual and methodological implications. In particular, this study is interested in the concept of weak disposability because the concept is believed to have an analytical capability to measure an occurrence of congestion. The two economic concepts on disposability, accepted by production economists, are replaced by natural and managerial disposability in this study. The natural disposability implies an environmental strategy by which a firm attempts to decrease an input vector to reduce a vector of undesirable outputs. Given the decreased input vector, a firm attempts to increase a vector of desirable outputs as much as possible. This type of strategy indicates negative adaptation. In contrast, the managerial disposability indicates an opposite strategy by increasing the input vector. This disposability expresses an environmental strategy by which a firm considers a regulation change as a new business opportunity. A firm attempts to improve its unified performance by utilizing new clean air technology and/or new management. The strategy indicates positive adaptation. Considering the two groups of disposability, this study compares between weak/strong disposability and natural/managerial disposability in terms of their conceptual and methodological differences, focusing upon the concept of congestion and technology innovation. Furthermore, using the concept of natural and managerial disposability, this study compares Japanese electric power firms with manufacturing firms. This study finds that the manufacturing firms outperform the electric power firms under natural disposability. An opposite result is found under managerial disposability. This empirical study also finds that the two groups of Japanese firms have attained desirable (good) congestion due to technology innovation. Based upon such empirical results, this study identifies two policy implications. One of the two implications is that the two groups of Japanese industries have attained a high level of technology innovation by a result of environmental regulation. The other is that the electric power industry operates more efficiently to reduce the CO2 emission than the manufacturing industries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although this self-protective behavior is very frequent in industrial economies, insufficient attention has been paid to its economic and environmental consequences. In this paper we show that such a behavior can make everyone worse-off. For this purpose, using as paradigmatic case a two-islands evolutionary model, we prove analytically that environmental self-protection may trap the system into an undesirable (Pareto-dominated) situation and discuss a few real-life examples in which this mechanism may have actually occurred. Although the proposed model is deliberately extremely simple, it may provide some interesting insights on an aspect that has been mainly ignored in the literature so far. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Beaudreau, BC",,,,"Beaudreau, Bernard C.",,,A humanistic theory of economic behavior,JOURNAL OF SOCIO-ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Utility theory; Humanistic psychology; Self-actualization,PSYCHOLOGY,"The past two decades have witnessed a growing interest in the humanistic approach to economics. In general, this has manifested itself in two ways, namely the development of humanistic models of behavior per se and secondly, in the form of addenda to the core utility model (CUM) such as identity, reciprocity, and warm-glows. While-promising, each suffers from major-shortcomings the-former-from its lack of a formal structure (mostly descriptive) and the latter from the lack of a general theory of behavior. This paper addresses these issues. Specifically, it presents a unifying humanistic theory of economic behavior which is consistent with basic humanistic principles (e.g. self-realization) and which is amenable to the study of economic issues. Agents are assumed to have a series of needs/identities/motives (NIMs) which they seek to fulfill. Moreover, each one of these needs corresponds to a specific set of neural mechanisms (frontal lobe, parietal lobe, etc.). Goods/services/activities are defined in hedonic terms and are assumed to address one or more NIMs. The corresponding optimization problem is presented and solved. The results are then used to rationalize various phenomena, including the Easterlin Paradox, Set-Point Theory, the Voter Paradox, among others. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We also show the effects of the product market competition and the implications of different and common outside input suppliers on the profits of the final goods producers. In-house input production reduces the price charged by the outside input supplier, and may make bi-sourcing as a profitable strategy. Under bi-sourcing, the final goods producers may be better off by outsourcing to a common input supplier than by outsourcing to different input suppliers. In the presence of bi-sourcing, the final goods producers may not have the incentive for cooperation in the product market. Our results show that even if the final goods producer's marginal cost of in-house input production is higher than the outside supplier's marginal cost of input production, bi-sourcing makes the consumers better off compared to complete outsourcing.

By purchasing rights to issue equity in crisis events at a pre-specified price from long-term investors, banks can ensure that they will have sufficient regulatory capital available when they need it most: in a crisis. By selling these rights (effectively, a form of crisis insurance) long-term investors can monetize their counter-cyclical investments strategies in banks and, thus, obtain an adequate return as long-term investors. Bank regulators, in turn, gain as they can thereby implement a more efficient (transparent and flexible) form of equity-capital regulation. The form of contingent capital we propose (capital access bond) reflects a balance between investors preferences, issuers constraints, and regulators objectives.","[Bolton, Patrick; Samama, Frederic] Columbia Univ, SWF Res Initiat & Amundi Credit Agr Grp, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Bolton, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, SWF Res Initiat & Amundi Credit Agr Grp, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,50,29,31,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

However, the perception of ECB transparency by the media and market participants is different. This study will examine the role of minutes/voting records as a possible cause of the differences in the perception of transparency between the academics and the media/market participants. As a proxy of how the media/market participants perceive Central Bank transparency, a content/thematic analysis of CNBC video clips was conducted for four central banks - ECB, FED, BOE, and BOJ. The result of the study yielded a three-dimensional 'footprint' of the importance of minutes/voting records as perceived by the media/market participants. In the ECB's case, the three-dimensional 'footprint' was extrapolated. The three-dimensional 'footprint' of the importance of minutes/voting records could be used to value the relative importance of minutes/voting records in transparency/disclosure indexes or as a 'quick' proxy for financial market participants to measure the transparency of Central Banks.

We also appraise the factors that lead labour market institutions rigidity, stressed by the search literature, to challenge the more widespread explanation of unemployment grounded on wage rigidity.

In this paper, we present a theory of the sovereign debt-restructuring process in which delay arises as individual creditors hold up a settlement in order to extract greater payments from the sovereign. We then use the theory to analyse recent policy proposals aimed at ensuring equal repayment of creditor claims. Strikingly, we show that such collective action policies may increase delay by encouraging free riding on negotiation costs, even while preventing hold-up and reducing total negotiation costs. A calibrated version of the model can account for observed delays and finds that free riding is quantitatively relevant: whereas in simple low-cost debt-restructuring operations, collective mechanisms will reduce delay by more than 60%, in high-cost complicated restructurings, the adoption of such mechanisms results in a doubling of delay.","[Pitchford, Rohan] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Wright, Mark L.

The data set covers the period between 1970 and 2007, and the empirical results, based on panel time-series data and analysis, confirm the anecdotal evidence which suggests that inflation has had a detrimental effect to growth in the region. All in all, we highlight the fact that excessive inflation has clearly offset the Mundell-Tobin effect and consequently the high costs that inflation has had on economic activity in the region.

The method is applied to gasoline demand in the United States and is applicable to other goods. The method uses shape restrictions derived from economic theory to improve the precision of a nonparametric estimate of the demand function. Using data from the U. S. National Household Travel Survey, we show that the restrictions are consistent with the data on gasoline demand and remove the anomalous behavior of a standard nonparametric estimator. Our approach provides new insights about the price responsiveness of gasoline demand and the way responses vary across the income distribution. We find that price responses vary non-monotonically with income. In particular, we find that low-and high-income consumers are less responsive to changes in gasoline prices than are middle-income consumers. We find similar results using comparable data from Canada.","[Blundell, Richard] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Horowitz, Joel L.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Parey, Matthias] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of London; University College London; Northwestern University; University of Essex,"Blundell, R (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England.",r.blundell@ucl.ac.uk; joel-horowitz@northwestern.edu; mparey@essex.ac.uk,"Blundell, Richard William/C-1552-2008","Blundell, Richard William/0000-0003-1588-2299; Parey, Matthias/0000-0001-9989-0565","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0817552] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,36,46,52,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

In this paper, we impose a carbon target concentration on a partial equilibrium model of the global energy sector. Specifically, we ask whether nuclear power can provide carbon-free energy as fossil fuel resources become costly due to scarcity and externality costs. We find that nuclear power can reduce the cost of generating clean energy significantly and relatively quickly. However, beyond a few decades the role of nuclear power may be considerably reduced as uranium becomes scarce and renewables become economical. The cost of carbon when nuclear power supplies a significant share of energy is much lower than that of other studies. A policy implication is that current political and regulatory impediments to the expansion of nuclear generation may prove to be costly if large volumes of clean energy need to be supplied over a relatively short period of time.","[Chakravorty, Ujjayant] Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada; [Chakravorty, Ujjayant] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada; [Magne, Bertrand] OECD, Environm Directorate, Paris, France; [Moreaux, Michel] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Sch Econ, IDEI Researcher, LERNA, Toulouse, France; [Chakravorty, Ujjayant] Univ Alberta, TSE, CESifo, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada",University of Alberta; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Alberta,"Chakravorty, U (通讯作者)，Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada.",ujjayant.chakravorty@ualberta.ca; bertrand.magne@oecd.org; michel.moreaux@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,64,8,10,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

For the case of a unionised mixed duopoly, there exists a dominant strategy only for the public firm that chooses Bertrand competition irrespective of whether the goods are substitutes or complements; there is no dominant strategy for a private firm. Thus, we show that regardless of the nature of goods, social welfare under Bertrand competition is always determined in equilibrium, wherein Bertrand competition entails higher social welfare than Cournot competition. Moreover, our main results hold irrespective of the nature of goods, with the exception that when a sufficiently large parameter of complements is employed, the ranking of a private firm's profit is not reversed, which is in contrast to the standard findings.","Pusan Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Pusan 609735, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Choi, K (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Pusan 609735, South Korea.",choipnu@pusan.ac.kr,"Choi, Kangsik/I-5231-2013",,,,,,43,11,13,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Our data reveal that wellbeing is perceived mainly in relative terms with the strength of relativism being higher for respondents in high-income countries. However, when the satisfaction of some 'basic needs' is at stake the absolutist concern becomes powerful. Personal characteristics such as gender and background of studies have a significant role in determining respondents' perception of wellbeing. Finally, additional insights emerge from our study. Interpersonal comparisons take place by looking both 'upward' and 'downward' along the income scale, not only income ranking but also the magnitude of reference incomes plays a role and the perception of wellbeing is more elastic to absolute rather than relative income.

Integrating such different markets can lead to significant changes. This paper considers two jurisdictions, one with a regulated monopoly selling at average cost and one with a competitive market, and compares three different institutional regimes: autarky, a mixed-market structure with trade and a fully integrated market, where electricity is sold everywhere at marginal cost. We show that, in the second regime, the regulated monopoly always exports toward the jurisdiction pricing at marginal cost, up to inducing productive inefficiencies. By contrast, a shift from the second to the third regime, i.e. integrated deregulation yields a decrease in overall consumption. We identify the exact conditions under which the shift from one regime to the other results in environmental gains. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Contrary to the existing literature, the model incorporates a nonhomothetic demand function whose price and income elasticities are endogenously determined by technology. Nonhomothetic preferences are modeled as the result of the hierarchical consumption of luxury and necessity goods. The nature of technical progress determines the consumption pattern and notably the magnitude of the substitution effect between necessities and luxuries. The model is applied to the case of trade between two economies with different development levels. It is shown in particular that the developing country can suffer a fall in utility as a result of technical progress in the developed country biased towards luxury goods. This configuration depends on the size of the development gap and reflects the fact that Southern goods are less attractive, the higher the range of goods consumed. This result suggests that there is an optimal level of development gap to avoid LDCs being harmed by technical progress in the North. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Biodiversity loss presents significant economic challenges. A great deal of economics is required to understand the issues, but a simple and important observation is that most species and ecosystems are not traded in markets, so prices are often absent and biodiversity is under-provided. Despite the formidable obstacles to high-quality economic analysis, economics has plenty to offer to biodiversity policy. First, economic valuation techniques can be employed to roughly estimate the value of the benefits provided by biodiversity and ecosystems. Second, assessing the ooptimum' amount of biodiversity involves recognizing that the conversion of natural capital into manufactured and human capital has so far generated vast amounts of wealth. While there may have been otoo much biodiversity' in the past, economic analysis suggests that this is a difficult position to hold now. Third, econometric techniques and carefully designed policy studies can assist in determining what policies are most suited to different contexts to cost-effectively reduce biodiversity loss. Fourth, political economy is helpful because international coordination is often requiredecosystems do not respect national borders and many biodiverse ecosystems are in poorer countries. This paper synthesizes the issues and proposes a research agenda, which includes improving the measurement and accounting of natural capital, improving valuation techniques and theory to provide greater guidance as to the ooptimum' biodiversity, and developing our understanding of the merits of different alternatives for government intervention to reduce biodiversity loss.","[Helm, Dieter; Hepburn, Cameron] New Coll, Oxford, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Helm, D (通讯作者)，New Coll, Oxford, England.",dieter@dhelm.co.uk; cameron.hepburn@new.ox.ac.uk,,"Hepburn, Cameron/0000-0003-0467-7441",,,,,59,31,32,1,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Generally these criticisms approach the concept in a too concrete and historically specific manner. Criticisms which claim that the dominance of finance is a transitory phenomenon were proved to be invalid, but this persistent aspect of monopoly capitalism needs to be explained on a theoretical level. On the other hand, the institutional aspect of the concept is still controversial. This article claims that the concept could be defined on a more abstract level by using Marx's notion of 'capital as commodity', and that the relationship that Hilferding's concept establishes between monopolisation and the dominance of finance could be more clearly expressed.

The definitions of these axioms carry through from the more commonly studied problem without disposability or acceptance thresholds. However, these are not compatible in the model that we study. We adapt the equal-division lower bound axiom and propose another fairness axiom called awardee-envy-freeness. Unfortunately, these are also incompatible with strategy-proofness. We characterize all of the Pareto-efficient rules that satisfy these two properties. We also characterize all Pareto-efficient, strategy-proof, and non-bossy rules. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This is because tournaments get closer to the first best by filtering common uncertainty. This paper shows that, surprisingly, tournaments are superior even when agents are liquidity constrained so that transfers to them cannot fall short of a predetermined level. The rationale is that, by providing insurance against common shocks through a tournament, payments to the agents in unfavorable states increase and payments in favorable states decrease which enables the principal to satisfy tight liquidity constraints for the agents without paying any ex ante rents to them, while simultaneously providing higher-power incentives than under piece rates. The policy implication of our analysis is that firms should adopt relative performance evaluation over absolute performance evaluation regardless of whether the agents are liquidity (wealth) constrained or not.","[Marinakis, Kosmas; Tsoulouhas, Theofanis] N Carolina State Univ, Poole Coll Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Tsoulouhas, T (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Poole Coll Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",fanis_tsoulouhas@ncsu.edu,"Marinakis, Kosmas/L-5690-2015; Tsoulouhas, Theofanis/P-9601-2019",,,,,,29,8,10,0,12,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

The empirical analysis shows that inter-industry technology spillover has a significant positive effect on the labor productivity of each industry. The elasticity of productivity effects of inter-industry technology spillover is not only larger than that of direct R&D input, but also increases over time. We group the industries into four major categories and find that the inter-industry technology spillover effect within the categories is, on average, greater than that between the four categories, indicating that technology spillover occurs more easily between similar industries. This research shows that the interindustry technology spillover effect in China has begun to increase, and the government should take advantage of this effect.","[Pan, Wenqing; Yang, Delin; Lin, Min] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Yang, DL (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",panwq@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; yangdl@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; linm@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,12,12,4,37,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2012,20.0,2,,,,,23,40,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01278.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,919TT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302352700002,0

We show that the conditional variance-covariance process underlying output growth and the change in the real price of oil exhibits significant non-diagonality and asymmetry. We also present evidence that increased uncertainty about the change in the real price of oil is associated with a lower average growth rate of real economic activity in Canada, consistent with the results in Elder and Serletis (2010, forthcoming) and Rahman and Serletis (forthcoming) for the United States and Elder and Serletis (2009) for Canada.

SVMs reduce most machine learning problems to optimization problems and optimization lies at the heart of SVMs. Lots of SVM algorithms involve solving not only convex problems, such as linear programming, quadratic programming, second order cone programming, semi-definite programming, but also non-convex and more general optimization problems, such as integer programming, semi-infinite programming, bi-level programming and so on. The purpose of this paper is to understand SVM from the optimization point of view, review several representative optimization models in SVMs, their applications in economics, in order to promote the research interests in both optimization-based SVMs theory and economics applications. This paper starts with summarizing and explaining the nature of SVMs. It then proceeds to discuss optimization models for SVM following three major themes. First, least squares SVM, twin SVM, AUC Maximizing SVM, and fuzzy SVM are discussed for standard problems. Second, support vector ordinal machine, semi-supervised SVM, Universum SVM, robust SVM, knowledge based SVM and multi-instance SVM are then presented for nonstandard problems. Third, we explore other important issues such as l(p)-norm SVM for feature selection, LOOSVM based on minimizing LOO error bound, probabilistic outputs for SVM, and rule extraction from SVM. At last, several applications of SVMs to financial forecasting, bankruptcy prediction, credit risk analysis are introduced.","[Tian, Yingjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Fictitious Econ & Data Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yong] Univ Nebraska, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Liu, Xiaohui] Brunel Univ, Sch Informat Syst Comp & Math, Ctr Intelligent Data Anal, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Nebraska System; Brunel University,"Tian, YJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Fictitious Econ & Data Sci, 80 Zhongguancun E Rd, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",tyj@gucas.ac.cn; yshi@gucas.ac.cn; xiaohui.liu@brunel.ac.uk,"Tian, Yingjie/HJO-9048-2023; Liu, Xiaohui/B-5046-2013","Tian, Yingjie/0000-0002-4675-0398;",,,,,131,110,120,14,196,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The results of this comparison depend strongly on whether under the overall monetary-fiscal regime long-run real interest rates are independent of inflation. If this is the case (i.e. superneutrality prevails) there exists in our model a unique and stable steady state under either monetary policy rule. By contrast, if superneutrality fails there is scope for much richer dynamics, characterized by multiple steady states and globally indeterminate dynamics. The paper offers a classification of such constellations and argues that under both monetary policy rules uniqueness and stability of steady states can be restored, provided the long-run inflation target and the feedback of the interest rate targeting rule are appropriately chosen.

Improving energy efficiency has been considered as a major way for reducing transport energy use, whereas its effectiveness might be affected by the rebound effect. This paper estimates the direct rebound effect for passenger transport in urban China by using the linear approximation of the Almost Ideal Demand System model and simulation analysis. Our empirical results reveal the existence of direct rebound effect for passenger transport in urban China. A majority of the expected reduction in transport energy consumption from efficiency improvement could be offset due to the existence of rebound effect. We have further investigated the relationship between the magnitude of direct rebound effect and households' expenditure. It was found that the direct rebound effect for passenger transport tends to decline with the increase of per capita household consumption expenditure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show how the frequently used Boston Mechanism fails these key requirements and describe how an alternative, the Deferred Acceptance Algorithm, leads to stable matchings but fails to be non-manipulable in general. A third mechanism, the Top Trading Cycle, is efficient and non-manipulable when only one side of the match acts strategically.

We find that high-performance firms react to a depreciation by increasing significantly more their markup and by increasing less their export volume. This heterogeneity in pricing-to-market is robust to different measures of performance, samples, and econometric specifications. It is consistent with models where the demand elasticity decreases with firm performance. Since aggregate exports are concentrated on high-productivity firms, precisely those that absorb more exchange rate movements in their markups, heterogeneous pricing-to-market may partly explain the weak impact of exchange rate movements on aggregate exports.","[Berman, Nicolas] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; Sci Po Paris, Ctr Etud Prospect & Informat Int, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Paris, France",,"Berman, N (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,50,295,324,4,125,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

For example, individual church donations may be kept anonymous, while the total amount raised is publicized. This presents a puzzle in light of recent evidence that anonymity reduces contributions. We offer an explanation for this puzzle in the context of a model of costly signaling with two types of agents: conditionally cooperative (good) and uncooperative (bad). We consider costly participation in a community activity (e.g., tithing) as a signal of an individual's type. By signaling the presence of one more good type, this may lead other good types to contribute more in future, more important, collective goods problems (CGP's). Thus, if good types also value others' contributions more than bad types, good types gain more from sending the signal. But if those who do not signal face exclusion, the signal would need to be made very costly to dissuade bad types from signaling. In contrast, if the institution is anonymous, so that it reveals only the total number of signals, then while signals cannot be used to exclude bad types, even an inexpensive signal may succeed in revealing the total number of good types. This information helps good types maximize the conditional cooperation component of their utility in the CGP, and under specified conditions, can increase expected CGP contributions. We characterize conditions under which an anonymous signaling institution increases expected welfare. We provide examples of institutions that may yield such benefits, including religion, music and dance, voting, charitable donations, and military traditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we carry out an empirical assessment of the relationship between trust in television and trust towards the prime minister. Many Italian commentators argue that television does not exert any particular bias on public opinion. If the assumption of television's irrelevance were true, one could reasonably expect to find no significant relationship between trust in TV and trust in Mr Berlusconi as prime minister. Contrary to this hypothesis, our empirical analysis shows that trust in television was the strongest predictor of trust in the Italian prime minister in Spring 2011, thus suggesting that Mr Berlusconi's media empire played a key role in the building of his political consensus.","[Sabatini, Fabio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Fac Econ, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Sabatini, Fabio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, European Res Inst Cooperat & Social Enterprises E, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome,"Sabatini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Fac Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",fabio.sabatini@uniroma1.it,,"Sabatini, Fabio/0000-0002-1228-3322",,,,,44,5,5,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2012,65.0,1,,,,,111,131,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00529.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,882EA,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299543200006,0

We propose to merge an endogenous growth model of learning by doing with a New Keynesian one with sticky wages. We show that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of working time is a key parameter for the shape of the inflation-growth nexus. When it is set equal to zero, the inflation-growth nexus is weak and hump-shaped. When it is greater than zero, inflation has a sizable and negative effect on growth. Endogenizing the length of wage contracts does not lead to inflation superneutrality in the presence of a fixed cost of wage resetting. Adopting various semiparametric and instrumental-variable estimation approaches on a cross-country/time-series data set, we show that increasing inflation reduces real economic growth, consistent with our theoretical model with a positive intertemporal elasticity of substitution of working time.","[Vaona, Andrea] Univ Verona, Dept Econ Sci, I-37129 Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Vaona, A (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Econ Sci, Palazzina 32 Sci Econ Ex Caserma Passalacqua,Vial, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",andrea.vaona@univr.it,,,,,,,68,34,34,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Based on theoretical considerations, we explore technological spillovers between the sectors of an economy. Large-scale corporations usually focus on certain sectors but make use of a wide range of technological knowledge from other sectors.

However, our conclusions may as well be generalized to cover all the autonomous public healthcare centres. In this paper we discuss the sources of soft budget constraints, inherent to the legal form of autonomous public healthcare centres. We start with presenting the concept of soli budget constraints and point out the relationships between the concept and the insolvency of hospitals operated by local authorities and of the local authorities. The second part deals with the mechanisms of soft budget constraints development. The third part presents the nature and principles of financial governance of autonomous public healthcare centres.

There is little evidence, however, that countries have increased risk sharing despite widespread financial liberalization. We show that the key to understanding this puzzling observation is that conventional wisdom assumes frictionless international financial markets, while actual markets are far from frictionless: financial contracts are incomplete and contract enforceability is limited. When countries remove official capital controls, default risk is still present as an implicit barrier to capital flows. If default risk were eliminated, capital flows would be six times greater, and international risk sharing would increase substantially. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Most empirical studies on the wage curve ignore possible spatial interaction effects between the regions which are the primary units of research. This paper reconsiders the western German wage curve with a special focus on the geography of labour markets. Spillovers between regions are taken into account. The paper tests whether the unemployment rate in the larger surrounding region also affects wages. In addition, agglomeration effects and effects of local monopsony are assessed. The main database is a random sample of 974,179 employees observed over the period 1980-2004 and covering 326 NUTS3 units (districts). This rich data set is used to estimate a dynamic wage curve according to the two-step approach of Bell et al. (2002). In the first step one controls for individual heterogeneity and in the second step one allows for spatial effects of unemployment across regions on wages. We check the sensitivity of this wage elasticity to various spatial weight matrices as well as allowing for the endogeneity of unemployment. We also estimate the wage elasticity for various population groups. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Instead of defining groups of countries with different growth characteristics a priori, based on, for example, geographical location, we use a finite mixture panel model and endogenous clustering to examine cross-country differences and similarities in the effects of growth determinants. Applying this approach to an annual unbalanced panel of 59 countries in Asia, Latin and Middle America and Africa for the period 1971-2000, we can identify two groups of countries in terms of distinct growth structures. The structural differences between the country groups mainly stem from different effects of investment, openness measures and government share in the economy.

Twin studies suggest that economic outcomes and preferences, once corrected for measurement error, appear to be about as heritable as many medical conditions and personality traits. Consistent with this pattern, we present new evidence on the heritability of permanent income and wealth. Turning to genetic association studies, we survey the main ways that the direct measurement of genetic variation across individuals is likely to contribute to economics, and we outline the challenges that have slowed progress in making these contributions. The most urgent problem facing researchers in this field is that most existing efforts to find associations between genetic variation and economic behavior are based on samples that are too small to ensure adequate statistical power. This has led to many false positives in the literature. We suggest a number of possible strategies to improve and remedy this problem: (a) pooling data sets, (b) using statistical techniques that exploit the greater information content of many genes considered jointly, and (c) focusing on economically relevant traits that are most proximate to known biological mechanisms.","[Benjamin, Daniel J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Benjamin, Daniel J.; Glaeser, Edward L.; Laibson, David I.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cesarini, David] NYU, Ctr Expt Social Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Cesarini, David] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Chabris, Christopher F.] Union Coll, Dept Psychol, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA; [Glaeser, Edward L.; Laibson, David I.; Hebert, Benjamin] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gudnason, Vilmundur; Smith, Albert Vernon] Iceland Heart Assoc, IS-201 Kopavogur, Iceland; [Harris, Tamara B.; Launer, Lenore J.] NIA, Lab Epidemiol Demog & Biometry, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Purcell, Shaun] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Johannesson, Magnus] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Magnusson, Patrik K.

The latter allows for a structural break in the cointegrating relation. Further, dynamic GLS estimation shows a statistically significant relation between exports and imports+, although, we reject strong current account sustainability.

For example, in the United States the recently introduced Child Tax Credit (CTC), which goes to almost all children, costs almost $1 billion each week, or about 0.4% of GNP. The United Kingdom has even more generous transfers and spends an average of about $30 a week on each of about 8 million childrenabout 1% of GNP. The typical rationale given for these transfers is that they are good for our children and here we investigate the effect of such transfers on household spending patterns. In the United Kingdom such transfers, known as Child Benefit (CB), have been simple lump sum universal payments for a continuous period of more than 20 years. We do indeed find that CB is spent differently from other incomeparadoxically, it appears to be spent disproportionately on adult-assignable goods. In fact, we estimate that as much as half of a marginal dollar of CB is spent on alcohol. We resolve this puzzle by showing that the effect is confined to unanticipated variation in CB so we infer that parents are sufficiently altruistic toward their children that they completely insure them against shocks.

The analysis is focused on possibilities of application of different methods, widely used for the assessment of both the company`s, national and regional competitiveness, as well as on identification of advantages and disadvantages of such methods. The article also involves introduction of methodological guidelines on the assessment of urban competitiveness from the national and international perspective, based on results of theoretical and empirical analysis. The empirical study is based on analysis of the sample of Kaunas, the second largest city of Lithuania. From the national perspective the assessment of Kaunas city competitiveness is based on comparing it with other major cities of Lithuania - the country`s capital Vilnius and Klaipeda, by employing statistical data of 2007-2010. The availability of official data at the regional level revealed that the assessment of international competitiveness of the cities, located in regions which, based on the territorial statistics units nomenclature, are attached to the third level (NUTS 3), should be equaled to the regional competitiveness itself. Measurement of Kaunas city and region competitiveness from the international perspective is based on statistical data of 2007-2011. The identification of specifics of measurement the urban competitiveness at the national and international level, presented in the article, is one of the ambitions to promote the methodological background for urban governance and improvement of competitiveness of Lithuanian cities.

The objective of this econometric study is to validate the theoretical prediction that doctors under unregulated fees may make choices about the length of patient consultations independent of their personal leisure decision. Indeed, according to our empirical results, the bidirectional link between leisure choice and consultation length - verified with fixed fees - does not hold any longer under unregulated fees.

This negative correlation expected between these two variables being contradicted by the positive correlation observed pointed out by Gibson and confirmed by further studies - Keynes refers to the so-called Gibson's paradox. I. Fisher proposed an explanation of this paradox with the slowness of the adjustments of interest rates to the rate of inflation. However, F.R. Macaulay showed that, since the delays of influence found by Fisher go up far in the past, this implies a necessary correlation between the price level and the weighted average of past rates of change in the price level calculated by Fisher. This arises the following question: does the correlation between interest rates and the price level result from a fisherian behaviour of agents or, on the contrary, do Fisher's results spurious since due to the correlation between price level and interest rates? However, Macaulay's criticism loses its relevance when the speed of adjustment is high (i.e. delays of influence are short), as observed during periods of hyperinflation and after the world war II. With respect to this debate, the merit of the Allais' Hereditary and Relativist (HR) theory is to suggest a synthesis with the psychological rate of interest i hypothesis. Depending on past values of the rate of change in price level and production, the rate i, which equals the rate of forgetfulness, represents the general trend of market interest rates. When the memory is long (i.e. the rate of forgetfulness is weak), the psychological rate of interest is necessarily correlated with the price level and then explains the positive correlation which may be more or less stable due to the production effects - between market interest rates and the price level. But when the memory is short (i.e. the rate of forgetfulness high), the HR theory implies both the disappearance of the correlation between interest rate and the price level and the existence of a positive correlation between interest rate and the rate of change in the price level, which is often observed.","[Durand, Jean-Jacques] Univ Rennes 1, CREM, UMR C6211, Fac Sci Econ, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Prat, Georges] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Rech CNRS, EconomiX FRE 3257, F-92001 Nanterre, France",Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Nanterre,"Durand, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CREM, UMR C6211, Fac Sci Econ, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France.",jean-jacques.durand@univ-rennes1.fr; georges.prat@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,7,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Kazakhstan is a country rich in natural resources and a key role in providing its economic growth belongs to oil production, and this situation grounds the necessity of achieving maximal positive return from the investments in oil & gas industry. Socioeconomic indices of Kazakhstan's economy in general and of certain petroleum regions are analyzed, along with the indices of large oil-producing companies. After analyzing the mutual impact of petroleum companies and national economy we construct the model for estimation of multiplicative effect of their activities and provide recommendations on the development of oil-producing industry.","[Egemberdieva, Saule; Azatbek, Tolkyn] LN Gumilyov Eurasian Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Astana, Kazakhstan",L.N.

Mandated severance pay matters only if binding real wage rigidities imply inefficient separation under employment at will. In such a case, large enough severance payments reduce job destruction, and increase job creation and social efficiency, under very mild conditions. Furthermore, mandated severance pay never results in inefficient labor hoarding. Whenever separation is jointly optimal, the parties agree to end the match with a spot severance payment below the statutory one. The marginal effect of mandated severance pay is zero when its size exceeds that which induces the same allocation that would prevail in the absence of wage rigidity. The results hold under alternative micro-foundations for wage rigidity.","Queen Mary Univ London, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Fella, G (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, London, England.",G.FELLA@QMUL.AC.UK,,"FELLA, GIULIO/0000-0002-0151-3348",,,,,48,4,4,1,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The model allows a full analysis of the information and dependence structure. An important result is that the widespread notion that greater correlation in outcomes calls for more competition is not robust. First, when the dependence structure is effort-sensitive, the optimal incentive scheme in general mixes elements of relative evaluation and joint evaluation. Second, under limited liability, higher equilibrium correlation tends to make joint performance evaluation more desirable. Examples are provided regarding incentives in firms, finance and innovation.

In such markets consumers often turn to reputation measures to guide purchase decisions. As Australia does not have a longstanding cuisine style of its own, and given Australia has been open to substantial immigration inflows since federation, it represents an especially appropriate market to study regarding the impact of individual restaurant reputation and collective cuisine reputation on meal prices. The following study uses the hedonic price approach to investigate the implicit price of individual reputation indicators, cuisine type reputation indicators and other objective indicators in the market for restaurant meals. The empirical findings presented suggest that both individual restaurant reputation and cuisine type reputation are important. Other important factors are shown to include the quality of the restaurant wine list, the availability of private dining rooms, and whether or not there is an outdoor dining option.","Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Fogarty, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",James.Fogarty@uwa.edu.au,,,,,,,21,5,6,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These are coupled with intermediate goods transactions, in a system of vertically integrated manufacturing and services sectors. These externalities, the so-called pecuniary knowledge externalities, are the main source of changing technological conditions experienced by downstream producers. A distinguishing feature of the taxonomy lies in its derivation from a particularly dynamic context of changing production functions. The taxonomy is empirically derived, examining effects generated by technological knowledge in a system of intermediate goods transactions and taking into account peculiar characteristics of sectors in European economies. The results allow for a classification of sectors in five groups. An analysis of these classes confirms previous evidence that technological characteristics of sectors across classes differ.","[Gehringer, Agnieszka] Univ Turin, Dept Econ S Cognetti de Martiis, Turin, Italy; [Gehringer, Agnieszka] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ Policy, Gottingen, Germany",University of Turin; University of Gottingen,"Gehringer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ S Cognetti de Martiis, Turin, Italy.",agnieszka.gehringer@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,55,9,9,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

In this paper, we focus on the role of the host country's human capital in affecting the organization of offshore production. Acknowledging that an input is produced offshore only after training the host labor, we propose that this training cost depends on the human capital gap between the home and the host country. Our model finds that a sourcing firm prefers to offshore production internationally only if the human capital gap between the home and the host country is below a threshold. Secondly, as the human capital gap increases, the probability for international outsourcing vis-a-vis intra-firm trade increases. Finally, as opposed to conventional wisdom, our model shows the possibility of outsourcing inputs of a high-tech good when the human capital gap between the home and the host is high.","World Bank, Dev Res Grp DECRG, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Goswami, AG (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp DECRG, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",agrover1@worldbank.org,,,,,,,18,2,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We find that there is an earnings premium for sex workers who sell unprotected sex and that more attractive sex workers charge a higher premium for unprotected sex. This result is consistent with more attractive people being better placed to bargain with others and with male clients being more likely to overvalue the returns to immediate sexual gratification and to engage in risk taking activities in the presence of attractive sex workers.

Using the concept of housing affordability it studies so-called housing-induced poverty in the Czech Republic. It combines this concept with the concept of relative poverty defined by Eurostat. The results show that households living in apartments with rent are the most vulnerable to poverty. The next part of the paper deals with the impact of the prospective end of regulated tenancies in the Czech Republic. It focuses on the changing level of the rents, and their influence on the number of households which are at risk of poverty. Micro-simulation models based on the EU-SILC micro data for the Czech Republic were employed in the research. Based on the results of these micro-simulation models it is assumed that the number of households at risk of poverty will increase significantly owing to the deregulation process. The paper highlights the development of the number of households at risk of poverty between the years 2008 to 2010, and discusses individual factors influencing the number of households at risk of poverty presently, as well as factors that will influence it after 2010.","[Jahoda, Robert; Spalkova, Dagmar] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Jahoda, Robert] Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Research Institute for Labour & Social Affairs,"Jahoda, R (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",robert.jahoda@vupsv.cz; dasa@econ.muni.cz,"Špalková, Dagmar/H-6423-2013; Jahoda, Robert/D-9180-2012; Špalková, Dagmar/JWO-4070-2024","Špalková, Dagmar/0000-0001-6977-1426;",,,,,27,6,6,0,21,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Paying for inherently interesting tasks, paying for prosocial behavior, paying too much, paying too little, and providing too many options can all be counterproductive. At the same time, proper design of the decision-making environment can be a potent way to induce certain behaviors. After presenting the empirical evidence, I discuss the relative role of beliefs, preferences, and technology in the anomalous impacts of incentives.

Rather than trusting the asymptotic distributions, this article uses simulation techniques to establish the small sample distributions of these tests, conditional on the stationary and nonstationary processes. The empirical results indicate that the tests have stable finite-sample sizes and higher size-adjusted powers such that the two estimated processes can be distinguished from each other. Thus, for six of the nine countries, their series are more likely to come from the estimated Autoregressive (AR) stationary process than from the nonstationary process. Noticeably, the testing results are rather different from those using the asymptotic distributions, in which only three countries support the real interest rate parity.","[Lee, Cheng-Feng] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Kaohsiung 80778, Taiwan; [Tsong, Ching-Chuan] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou 545, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Chi Nan University,"Lee, CF (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, 415 Jiangong Rd, Kaohsiung 80778, Taiwan.",jflee@cc.kuas.edu.tw,,,,,,,47,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our results clearly identify the long-run money demand relationship among real narrow money (or real broad money), real income, and nominal interest rates for China. The estimated long-run income elasticity and interest semi-elasticity are, respectively, 0.884 (0.915) and -0.034 (-0.002), using the real M1 (M2) equation. Our estimates of the long-run elasticity are consistent with previous studies, but they are towards the lower end of existing estimates.

The paper states that an increase in home military spending affects economic growth through three channels, including the crowding-out effect, the spin-off effect, and the resource mobilization effect. The net effect which depends on these three channels is ambiguous. Hence, we demonstrate that there exists an optimal defence burden that maximizes the economic growth rate. Furthermore, the optimal defence burden depends on the degree of risk preference. Namely, the optimal defence burden of the risk-loving agent is more than that of the risk-neutral agent, and in turn is more than that of the risk-averse agent. At the same time, we prove that the relationship between the volatility in military spending and economic growth also depends on the degree of risk preference. In addition, we show that greater volatility in foreign military spending leads to a decrease in home aggregate consumption, and hence speeds up economic growth in the home country.","[Lee, Cheng-Te] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Int Trade, Taipei 11114, Taiwan; [Lin, Po-Sheng] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University; National Chengchi University,"Lee, CT (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Int Trade, 55 Hwa Kang Rd, Taipei 11114, Taiwan.",lzd4@faculty.pccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,30,8,9,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Analyses based on standard OLG models predict that these changes will increase the capital-labor ratio. Hence, rates of return to capital decrease and wages increase, which has adverse welfare consequences for current cohorts who will be retired when the rate of return is low. This paper argues that adding endogenous human capital accumulation to the standard model dampens these forces. We find that this adjustment channel is quantitatively important. The standard model with exogenous human capital predicts welfare losses up to 12.5% (5.6%) of lifetime consumption, when contribution (replacement) rates to the pension system are kept constant. These numbers reduce to approximately 8.7% (4.4%) when human capital can endogenously adjust. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We use data from a phone survey administered to a sample (N = 614) of adult Canadians, proposing a policy consisting of subsidizing and enforcing the use of acoustic devices that would reduce the likelihood that whales become entangled in fishing nets. A follow-up question asked respondents how certain they were about their answer to the main dichotomous-choice question, which allows us to investigate how the treatment of uncertainty affects value measures. A mean willingness to pay of about $81/year per respondent is estimated when accounting for the degree of certainty with which respondents expressed their willingness to pay. We also analyse payment vehicle effects using a split-sample approach whereby some respondents were asked a dichotomous-choice question about a tax contribution while others were asked about a voluntary donation instead.","[Lyssenko, Nikita; Martinez-Espineira, Roberto] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Econ, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland,"Martínez-Espiñeira, R (通讯作者)，Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Econ, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",rmartinezesp@mun.ca,"Martinez-Espineira, Roberto/A-5804-2008","Martinez-Espineira, Roberto/0000-0001-8022-1230",,,,,87,19,22,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This model assumes that local downstream manufacturers require two inputs to make their final products. One input is produced by a supplier shared by both manufacturers; another is produced by an exclusive supplier for each manufacturer. We show that vertical integration of each downstream firm with its exclusive supplier enhances the input demand for the common supplier, leading to an increase in the common supplier's input price due to the elimination of the double marginalization. Moreover, downstream firms that require a smaller quantity of inputs from the common supplier, for instance, those with efficient production technology or smaller downstream demand, are more likely to vertically integrate because vertical integration yields a smaller increase in input price. Thus, the cause of firm-size heterogeneity is important to consider when investigating the relationship between firm size and the tendency to vertically integrate.","[Matsushima, Noriaki] Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan; [Mizuno, Tomomichi] Nagasaki Univ, Fac Econ, Nagasaki, Japan",Osaka University; Nagasaki University,"Matsushima, N (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.",nmatsush@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp; rinri@sun.ac.jp,"Matsushima, Noriaki/D-1819-2012; MIZUNO, Tomomichi/AAH-7019-2020","Matsushima, Noriaki/0000-0002-7865-3875; MIZUNO, Tomomichi/0000-0003-0846-833X","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22243022, 24530248] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,51,5,5,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The main idea of this analysis is to answer the question of whether the Global Economic Crisis had a significant impact on the efforts of CEECs to stay on the path of real convergence. The Balassa-Samuelson effect explains less than 1.5 percentage points on average of inflation differential relative to the euro area and around 1 percentage point of the total domestic inflation. The results are robust across the model specification and estimation method. Most of the results point out that the Balassa-Samuelson effect has not changed considerably during the crisis even though it is lower compared to that in the earlier stage of transition (for the period up to 2004).,,,,mirjana.palic@nbs.rs,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,7,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,4,,,,,475,499,,10.2298/PAN1204475M,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,020GX,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309798100005,0

Although such heterogeneity naturally causes inequality, this complication is commonly avoided by assuming that transfers redistribute steady-state wealth. I show that this steady-state assumption drives short-run results. Without redistribution, the equilibrium is indeterminate, and the labor-market structure that is imposed to support the expansive result is theoretically inconsistent. On a more positive note, I propose a labor-market formulation under which the expansive effects of government spending might arise.","Norges Bank, NO-0107 Oslo, Norway",Norges Bank,"Natvik, GJ (通讯作者)，Norges Bank, NO-0107 Oslo, Norway.",gisle-james.natvik@norges-bank.no,,,,,,,24,4,4,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Of course, several studies have endeavored to examine the determinants of FDI in this region. This study contributes to the literature by examining a possible determinant of FDI that has received less attention in the literature: real exchange rate (RER) movements. This paper examines this relationship with a view to determining the extent to which real exchange rate movements stifle FDI inflows in selected SSA countries, employing the Granger causality and simultaneous estimation techniques. The use of simultaneous equation is informed by the theoretical and empirical inconclusiveness on the relationship between movements in RER and FDI. The Granger Causality test further provides insight on the causal direction of the variables. Whereas the causality tests suggest statistical dependence between RER movements and FDI for a few of the countries, the regression analyses show a statistically significant relationship between these variables. While the inclusion of pre-reform period in the study may have contributed to these results, the general picture emerging is that FDI flows are sensitive to REER movements in SSA.","[Ogun, Oluremi; Egwaikhide, Festus O.] Univ Ibadan, Dept Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Ogunleye, Eric K.] Fed Secretariat, Off Chief Econ Adviser President, Abuja, Nigeria",University of Ibadan,"Ogun, O (通讯作者)，Univ Ibadan, Dept Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria.",r_ogun@yahoo.com; fegwas@ya-hoo.com; eric.oleye@gmail.com,"Ogun, Oluremi/O-6071-2019","Ogun, Oluremi/0000-0002-6367-8324",,,,,32,2,3,0,8,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

The details of land modeling for common stabilization policy scenarios are, for the first time, presented, contrasted, and assessed. While we find significant differences in approaches across modeling platforms, all the approaches conclude that land based mitigation - agriculture, forestry, and biomass liquid and solid energy substitutes - could be a steady and significant part of the cost-effective portfolio of mitigation strategies; thereby, reducing stabilization cost and increasing flexibility for achieving more aggressive climate targets. However, large fossil fuel emissions reductions are still required, and there are substantial uncertainties, with little agreement about abatement magnitudes. Across the scenarios, land mitigation options contribute approximately 100 to 340 GtC equivalent abatement over the century, 15 to 40% of the total required for stabilization, with bioenergy providing up to 15% of total primary energy. Long-run land climate modeling is rapidly evolving with critical challenges to address. In characterizing current capability, this paper hopes to stimulate future research and the next generation of land modeling and provide a point of comparison for energy and climate policies considering bio-energy, reduced deforestation and degradation, and cost containment.

One reason for this is the inherent difficulties in identifying and isolating direct performance measures for individuals. Additionally, most traditional work environments contain a multitude of exogenous factors impacting individual performance, but controlling for all such factors is generally unfeasible (omitted variable bias). Moreover, instead of asking individuals about their self-reported stress levels, we observe workers' behaviour in situations that can be classified as stressful. For this reason, we have stepped outside the traditional workplace in an attempt to gain greater controllability of these factors using the sports environment as our experimental space. We empirically investigate the relationship between stress and performance, in an extreme pressure situation (football penalty kicks) in a winner take all sporting environment (FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Cup competitions). Specifically, we examine all the penalty shootouts between 1976 and 2008 covering in total 16 events. The results indicate that extreme stressors can have a positive or negative impact on individuals' performance. On the other hand, more commonly experienced stressors do not affect professionals' performances.","[Savage, David A.; Torgler, Benno] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Torgler, Benno] CREMA Ctr Res Econ Management & Arts, CH-4052 Basel, Switzerland; [Torgler, Benno] CESifo, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Ifo Institut,"Savage, DA (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",david.savage@qut.edu.au,"Torgler, Benno/W-4556-2019; Savage, David A./AAP-6101-2020","Torgler, Benno/0000-0002-9809-963X; Savage, David/0000-0002-2110-4023",,,,,52,17,22,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results show a significant increase in industrial concentration in 1995 to 1999, which coincided with the period of the economic crisis in Indonesia. After 1999, the industrial concentration exhibits a slightly decreasing long-term trend. Furthermore, the industrial concentration for all subsectors tends to converge to the same value in the long run. Additionally, results show that higher industrial concentration yields a higher price-cost margin.

This article estimates these varying binding constraints in 16 countries in East and Southeast Asia and Latin America, and explores their differences across countries, regions and periods. I show that the East and Southeast Asian countries, which are recognized to be successful in export-oriented industrialization, are less constrained by the foreign exchange availability with reinforced export capacity than the Latin American countries, which had carried some inertia of import substituting industrialization policy until the 1980s. In addition, the economic growth turns out to be more constrained by the domestic savings in recent years, which can be a reflection of capital account liberalization policies typically implemented in the late 1980s and 1990s, and/or a diminishing return to export-led growth. In either case, this might be a factor underlining the recent reconsideration of export-oriented development strategy to balance past excessive dependence on the external demand in several countries in East and Southeast Asia.","Seton Hall Univ, John C Whitehead Sch Diplomacy & Int Relat, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA",Seton Hall University,"Suzuki, Y (通讯作者)，Seton Hall Univ, John C Whitehead Sch Diplomacy & Int Relat, 400 S Orange Ave, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA.",yui.suzuki@shu.edu,,,,,,,15,2,3,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The focus of this article is on the interrelationship of the demands for slot machine and horse race wagering at a racino. Wagering demand models were estimated for the two racino products; slot machine gaming and pari-mutuel horse racing. Horse race and slot machine wagering both decreased when a competing casino entered the racino's market area. As in earlier studies, slot machine customers did not, on net, bet on horse racing but horse racing customers did bet on slot machines. Pari-mutuel horse race wagering fell 21% after slot machines were introduced and 16% following the introduction of table games. On the other hand, slot machine wagering increased 13% in the presence of live horse racing and 14% in the presence of import simulcast horse racing. Slot machine wagering fell 8% with the introduction of table games. This has important policy implications if stakeholder shares of table game revenue are different than their corresponding slot machines shares. Those with lower table game shares may lose net gaming revenue if table games do not produce enough revenue to offset the expected loss of slot machine revenue.","Thalheimer Res Associates Inc, Lexington, KY 40507 USA",,"Thalheimer, R (通讯作者)，Thalheimer Res Associates Inc, 107 W Short St, Lexington, KY 40507 USA.",rthal@gte.net,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper examines the gasoline consumption demand of Greek households using cross-sectional micro-data from a country-wide Household Budget Survey (HBS) during the period 2004/05. The two-step Heckman modeling methodology is adopted to jointly estimate the probability of selecting to use private vehicle and the amount of using it. In this way, it can help to identify and better explain factors for which some private vehicle owners/holders do (not) actually consume that mode. The results offer valuable insight into the existence of feedback relationship between the decision-making mechanisms of selecting to use private vehicle and amount of usage, in terms of the amount of money spent for gasoline consumption. They also indicate the statistically significant impact of region-specific fixed effects, which implies that unobserved or omitted factors associated with each Region have a different impact on the decision to choose and the amount of using private vehicle. The income variable has a statistically significant positive impact on the selection and usage of a private vehicle. The estimated income elasticity suggests that a private vehicle travel is relatively inelastic (normal and necessity good). Its value reflects the increased car dependence and it is within the range of other income elasticities found in the literature. The male gender of household head, the amount of cars owned, the participation of family members in the labour market, the family size (a single-parent or couples with at least one child older than 18 years-old) and the expenditure on communication and tourism increase the probability of private vehicle gasoline consumption. The latter finding verifies that private vehicle constitutes an important means of transport during vacation. The use of communication devices, especially a mobile phone, reinforces the use of private vehicle, as it weakens the need for short-range activity planning in advance and the range and extent of social networking. On the contrary, the high population densities, the connection to the internet and the aging of household head reduce the probability of private vehicle gasoline consumption. The above results signify the role of personal and intra-household constraints, mostly related to size and aging structure, on the selection and use of a private vehicle. The expenditure on most other transport categories, such as an urban public transport, taxi, coach and rail negatively and statistically significantly affect private vehicle gasoline consumption. This outcome stresses the competitive relationship between the private vehicle and other transport modes which are mainly used in urban areas (urban bus, metro, and taxi). The study findings suggest the design of more sustainable leisure travel services, focussed on upgrading the quality of public transport modes servicing tourist resort areas. Policy measures to manage private vehicle use must be spatially targeted, accounting for the local climate, residential densities, infrastructure and accessibility conditions and the service quality of alternative modes in each Region. These measures can be supplemented with the adoption of suitable information and communication technologies to reduce the demand for private vehicle travel and increase the level of public transport services, as well as investments in clean vehicle technologies.","Ctr Planning & Econ Res KEPE, Athens 10672, Greece",,"Tsekeris, T (通讯作者)，Ctr Planning & Econ Res KEPE, 11 Amerikis, Athens 10672, Greece.",tsek@kepe.gr,"Tsekeris, Theodore/H-5838-2019",,,,,,35,0,0,0,32,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Analysing five cross-sections for Indonesia's 26 provinces for five survey years between 1930 and 2000 we show that throughout the twentieth century economic factors were more important in the explanation of interprovincial migration patterns in Indonesia than planned migration policy aimed at the redistribution of the population. In addition, our regression analysis demonstrates that the urban primacy of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, had a strong effect on the direction and size of migration flows. Our findings thus suggest that the costly government-supported migration is not very successful and that a strongly centralized government induces migration flows to the capital. These findings have policy implications for other developing countries.","[van Lottum, J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge Grp Hist Populat & Social Struct, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Marks, D.] Univ Utrecht, Ctr Global Econ Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Cambridge; Utrecht University,"van Lottum, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge Grp Hist Populat & Social Struct, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",jv266@cam.ac.uk,,"van Lottum, Jelle/0000-0003-0534-4745",,,,,24,31,39,3,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Because of data limitations, most studies in this literature use broad measures of disability, which may obscure important differences among children with limiting health conditions. This paper presents new evidence on the labor supply of women with disabled children, exploiting disability information provided by 2000 US Census. This large nationally representative sample allows us to test for differences across different types of disabling conditions. We find that accounting for this heterogeneity in conditions is important. Using a broad definition of disability results in small differences between women with and without a disabled child. When we use a more detailed classification, we find larger labor supply reductions for mothers of children with physical disabilities or limitations in their ability to care for themselves. There is less evidence that having a child with either mental or emotional limitations or a sensory impairment is negatively related to employment or weekly hours. We also test for heterogeneous effects related to child age and maternal education. We find no clear pattern with respect to age and some evidence that the relationship between child disability and maternal labor supply is stronger for less educated mothers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These included actions that presuppose a good outcome, that reflect hubris or that involve excessive risk taking. This paper explores a related form of magical thinking whereby individuals believe that asking for too much in situations of uncertainty may be punished by the universe and may decrease the probability of the desired outcome. It was found that many participants irrationally forgo the greedy option under uncertainty, even though it dominates other options and their behavior is not observed. It is suggested that some participants fear being magically punished for greediness and it is shown that the avoidance of greedy actions under uncertainty is related to the belief that one should not tempt fate. This phenomenon may have implications for various types of economic decisions such as charity donation, insurance purchase and bargaining. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

First, we take a direct measure of the value of cash transactionsthe flow of cash withdrawn from bank accounts relative to total non-cash paymentsas the dependent variable in the money demand equation. This allows us to avoid unrealistic assumptions on the velocity of money and the absence of any irregular transaction in a given year, overcoming two severe critiques to the traditional CDA. Second, in place of the tax burden level, usually intended as the main motivation for non-compliance, we include among the covariates two direct indicators of detected tax evasion. Finally, we control also for the role of illegal production considering crimes like drug dealing and prostitution, whichjointly with the shadow economycontributes to the larger aggregate of the non-observed economy and represents a significant component of total cash payments.

This paper studies dramatic changes in public health insurance eligibility for immigrant and native children from 1998 to 2009 and finds that children's nativity status is crucial to understanding the impacts of recent eligibility expansions. I document a significantly higher degree of take-up (and less crowding out of private insurance) among first- and second-generation immigrant children than among children of U.S. natives. Eligibility expansions increased immigrant children's use of preventive and ambulatory care and decreased emergency care in hospitals, while estimated effects for children of natives are negligible. My results also suggest improvements in some health measures that would be expected to respond to preventive and ambulatory care. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The literature has built upon estimating the degree of this dislike as well as its causes. The use of self-reported measures of satisfaction or well-being as a proxy for utility has been one of the empirical strategies used to this end. In this survey, we review the papers that estimate or examine the relationship between inequality and self-reported happiness to conclude that inequality correlates negatively with happiness in Western societies. Some of the surveyed papers identify particular sources of heterogeneity on preferences over inequality. The evidence for non-Western societies is more mixed and less reliable.

The development of cities in the United States in recent decades is linked quite essentially to the dynamics and contradictions of U.S. capitalism, including a policy agenda that has been pro-capital and anti-urban. The penultimate section of the paper shows that neoclassical theory - with its focus on choice - provides a deeply inadequate explanation of urban inequality. And yet neoclassicism, along with its cruder relative, neoliberalism, has continued to shape the narrative of U.S. cities. The final section argues for a multidisciplinary economics that recognizes that a rich urban economics requires insights from political science, sociology, geography, and other academic disciplines.","[Koechlin, Tim] Vassar Coll, Int Studies Program, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA",Vassar College,"Koechlin, T (通讯作者)，Vassar Coll, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA.",tikoechlin@vassar.edu,,,,,,,36,4,4,1,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Edgeworth (1925) argues that total utilitarianism leads to a lower economic performance and a larger population size than average utilitarianism. Following works show that while his intuition holds in a static framework, the result is unclear in a dynamic setting of endogenous growth. We show that if population dynamics is stochastic, Edgeworth's conjecture may or may not hold. In particular, which utilitarian criterion implies larger economic and population growth rates depends on the value of the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, the features of the random process driving demographic change and the magnitude of the (linear) dilution coefficient. We also characterize the size of the range of parameter values supporting Edgeworth's conjecture; such a range is wide if the dilution parameter is large enough while it is particularly narrow (but still non-empty) if the parameter is small.

On average, dictators transfer substantially more to recipients who are publicly known to share the same group identity, compared to transfers given to recipients who are publicly known to be outgroup matches. However, there is substantially less ingroup favoritism if the dictator is informed that the recipient is unaware of the shared group membership. Moreover, dictators tend to ask less often for information about a recipient's identity if disclosure would imply that the dictator's identity is also disclosed to the recipient. The evidence supports the view that ingroup favoritism is partly belief-dependent, in addition to the notion that shared group identity per se changes charity preferences. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In spite of stable GDP growth, overall net job creation was disappointing and firm dynamics were sluggish. The firm size distribution has remained skewed towards small firms, because of stagnation of incumbents and entrants starting small, typically as one-person firms (i.e. self-employment). Churning is limited, especially amongst large firms, and very few firms manage to grow. Post-entry, small firms are the worst performers in terms of job creation, even if they survive. Moreover, the association between productivity, profitability and job creation is feeble, pointing towards weaknesses in the re-allocative process. Weak net job creation thus appears to be due to insufficient firm dynamism rather than excessive job destruction.

Empirical results indicate that GDP, real exchange rate, financial development and macroeconomic uncertainty are positively related to inward FDI in E&E sector in the long run. However, corporate income tax and social uncertainty have a negative impact on inward FDI in E&E sector. Furthermore, the Granger causality results also indicate that all explanatory variables Granger-cause FDI in the long-run, but in the short-run only macroeconomic and social uncertainties Granger-cause FDI. The impact of social uncertainty is found tote greater than macroeconomic uncertainty.

The results show that both public and private hospitals have experienced a productivity growth and a negative evolution in efficiency and quality changes between 2006 and 2010. The average annual productivity growth rates of public and private hospitals are 4.1% and 2.8% respectively; the average annual reduction rates of efficiency are 1.8% and 1.2% respectively; the quality declines on average by 2.5% and 7.2% per year respectively.

The VAT gap is calculated as the difference between the theoretical VAT liability ascertained from the national accounts and the VAT revenues accrued by the financial authorities. Although VAT gap is not caused by tax evasion only, it could serve as its indicator. Further, it provides a review of scientific papers and various studies that analyse factors influencing the size of the VAT gap, and summarizes the results of these empirical studies. The main purpose of this article is to perform a regression analysis of potential variables explaining the VAT gap in 24 EU Member States in two selected years (2002 and 2006) for which data on the VAT gap was available. Two factors common for both examined years affecting the VAT gap in the surveyed countries were found, being the final consumption of households and non-profit organizations in each state, with a positive impact on the VAT gap, and the share of VAT in GDP, reducing the VAT gap. Other identified variables that would explain the size of the VAT gap were the share of the shadow economy and the standard VAT rate, with a positive impact, and GDP per capita, the share in intra-community trade, final consumption of restaurant and hotel services, and the number of VAT rates, having a negative impact on the VAT gap.","Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zidková, H (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",hanazidkova@email.cz,"Zídková, Hana/D-8151-2015","Zídková, Hana/0000-0003-3661-6993",,,,,18,20,22,3,30,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Individuals who in 1991 worked in manufacturing industries that experienced high subsequent import growth garner lower cumulative earnings, face elevated risk of obtaining public disability benefits, and spend less time working for their initial employers, less time in their initial two-digit manufacturing industries, and more time working elsewhere in manufacturing and outside of manufacturing. Earnings losses are larger for individuals with low initial wages, low initial tenure, and low attachment to the labor force. Low-wage workers churn primarily among manufacturing sectors, where they are repeatedly exposed to subsequent trade shocks. High-wage workers are better able to move across employers with minimal earnings losses and are more likely to move out of manufacturing conditional on separation. These findings reveal that import shocks impose substantial labor adjustment costs that are highly unevenly distributed across workers according to their skill levels and conditions of employment in the pre-shock period.","[Autor, David H.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; Ctr Econ Policy Res, Sofia, Bulgaria; Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; US Social Secur Adm, Woodlawn, MD USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Zurich; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Autor, DH (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,"Dorn, David/0000-0002-1827-4734","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1227334] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,71,285,355,16,139,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We argue that this may lead to estimation bias as damage data and the selection into the database may correlate with GDP. We build a comprehensive database of disaster events and their intensities from primary geophysical and meteorological information. In contrast to insurance data, our GeoMet data reveal a substantial negative and robust average impact effect of disasters on growth. The worst 5% disaster years come with a growth damage of at least 0.46 percentage points. That average effect is driven mainly by very large earthquakes and some meteorological disasters. Poor countries are more strongly affected by geophysical disasters; rich more by meteorological events. International openness and democratic institutions reduce the adverse effect of disasters.

We create a database of Chinese finance for OFDI and compare our results to the existing literature and available data on Japan, Korea and other Asian nations. We estimate the total value of China's OFDI finance from 2002 to 2012 at US$140bn. As a percentage of total OFDI, China's lending is roughly three times higher than Japan's, the previous global leader in OFDI finance. We identify two major reasons for China's high (31 percent) ratio of OFDI lending to total OFDI. First, China has a greater incentive to give OFDI loans than Japan or Korea ever did because its borrowers are state-owned so it can more easily channel funds to targeted areas. Second, China has a greater capacity to give OFDI loans because it has significantly higher savings and foreign exchange reserves than Japan and Korea.","[Gallagher, Kevin P.; Irwin, Amos] Boston Univ, Pardee Sch Global Studies, Global Econ Governance Initiat, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Gallagher, KP (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Pardee Sch Global Studies, Global Econ Governance Initiat, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",kpg@bu.edu; aeirwin@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,33,40,4,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2014,22.0,6,,,,,1,21,,10.1111/cwe.12089,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AU0WI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345342500001,0

While previous empirical work, spearheaded by Hong et al.

I address this shortcoming by using data from the Consumer Expenditure Quarterly Interview Survey, which contains information on individual holdings and the buying and selling of financial assets, as well as expenditure variables that imply variation in the level of social activity. This finding supports a new explanation for the active-investing puzzle in which informal communication tends to promote active rather than passive strategies (Han and Hirshleifer, 2012).

This article provides microeconometric evidence on the direct effect of ethnic divisions on productivity. In team production at a plant in Kenya, an upstream worker supplies and distributes flowers to two downstream workers, who assemble them into bunches. The plant uses an essentially random rotation process to assign workers to positions, leading to three types of teams: (i) ethnically homogeneous teams, and teams in which (ii) one or (iii) both down-stream workers belong to a tribe in rivalry with the upstream worker's tribe. I find strong evidence that upstream workers undersupply non-coethnic down-stream workers (vertical discrimination) and shift flowers from non-coethnic to coethnic downstream workers (horizontal discrimination), at the cost of lower own pay and total output. A period of ethnic conflict following Kenya's 2007 election led to a sharp increase in discrimination. In response, the plant began paying the two downstream workers for their combined output (team pay). This led to a modest output reduction in (i) and (iii) teams-as predicted by standard incentive models-but an increase in output in (ii) teams, and overall. Workers' behavior before conflict, during conflict, and under team pay is predicted by a model of taste-based discrimination. My findings suggest that interethnic rivalries lower allocative efficiency in the private sector, that the economic costs of ethnic diversity vary with the political environment, and that in high-cost environments firms are forced to adopt second best policies to limit discrimination distortions.","[Hjort, Jonas] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Hjort, Jonas] BREAD, Washington, DC USA",Columbia University,"Hjort, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,61,112,141,3,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The first channel is that education makes workers more productive on a given task, as in a conventional human capital framework. The second channel is based on the idea that education helps workers get assigned to higher-paying occupations where output is more sensitive to skill. A third and final channel is that workers are more productive and earn more when they are matched to a job related to their field of study. Using data from the 2005 National Graduate Survey and the 2006 Canadian Census, I find that channels two and three account for close to half of the conventionally measured return to education. The results indicate that the return to education varies greatly depending on occupation, field of study and the match between these two factors.","Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Lemieux, T (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",thomas.lemieux@ubc.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Bank of Canada Fellowship Program,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR); Bank of Canada Fellowship Program,"This presidential address was delivered at the 2014 annual meeting of the Canadian Economic Association in Vancouver, British Columbia.

We employ a three-stage least squares model that explains changes in fuel use as a function of changes in three fuel prices. This model is repeated across sub-samples of data aggregated at the plant level and operating holding company level. We expect that plants and holding companies reduce fuel use when fuel prices rise. Several fuel substitution effects within and across plants and holding companies are demonstrated, as well as several frictions. At the plant level, higher prices of natural gas lead to less natural gas consumption, less coal consumption, and more fuel oil consumption. At the operating holding company level, results demonstrate the inelasticity of coal use and the increases of natural gas in response to higher coal prices. Subsamples demonstrate heterogeneity of results across different plants. Results emphasize that technological, market, and regulatory frictions may hinder the performance of energy policies.

Our study is based on a new dataset that spans all regions. It incorporates a number of important credit episodes seldom covered in the literature, including for example, defaults and restructurings in India and China. As the first paper employing this data, our aim is to illustrate some of the broad insights that can be, gleaned from such a sweeping historical database. We find that serial default is a nearly universal phenomenon as countries struggle to transform themselves from emerging markets to advanced economies. Major default episodes are typically spaced some years (or decades) apart, creating an illusion that this time is different among policymakers and investors. A recent example of the this time is different syndrome is the false belief that domestic debt is a novel feature of the modern financial landscape. We also confirm that crises frequently emanate from the financial centers with transmission through interest rate shocks and commodity price collapses. Thus, the recent US sub-prime financial crisis is hardly unique. Our data also documents other crises that often accompany default: including inflation, exchange rate crashes, banking crises, and currency debasements.","[Reinhart, Carmen M.; Rogoff, Kenneth S.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Reinhart, CM (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Rogoff, Kenneth/G-1894-2018",,,,,,169,10,12,1,20,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

As such, behavioral responses that adapt to the new and evolving climatic conditions are also likely. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) have an important role to play. IAMs are a unique class of models that integrate global biophysical and economic systems in order to explore issues with potentially significant interactions and feedbacks between the two systems, such as potential future impacts from climate change. Climate risks to forestry, pasture, and livestock are potential risks that need to be understood and weighed. Those risks are defined by both the nature of climate change as well as society's adaptive capacity. This paper reviews and characterizes climate change adaptation modeling of forestry and pasture land use by IAMs, as well as economic modeling. The paper discusses what needs to be modeled or considered, what we have learned from the literature available, and issues and opportunities for future research. The literature is sparse, and in an early stage, but has already yielded insights regarding adaptation's potential for reducing risks, and possibly generating societal benefits. Empirical modeling will be important going forward to identify adaptation options and provide an observation based grounding for JAM modeling. Relevant empirical modeling to date is limited but highlights that there are many potential facets to adaptation related to these sectors that need to be considered by IAMs in some form. Data deficiencies will also need to be overcome and IAM model development advanced. This paper is part of a research initiative, and special issue of this journal, to improve adaptation modeling in climate impacts research. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate that sociocultural adaptation among international students in China is largely shaped by the nature of the interaction with host nationals. In particular, among international students, those who experienced higher levels of social interaction with host nationals and received more social support were better poised for sociocultural adaptation. Rather contrary to similar research in the Western context, the study finds that international students from East Asia actually experienced more sociocultural difficulties in China than their counterparts from Western countries.

In this domain, the role of unemployment insurance (UI) is probably underestimated and its statistical assessment remains insufficient. And yet, when considering a possible separation, it is likely that workers who are close to retirement, and thus their employers if they wish to reduce their workforce, care about UI. In particular, they are likely to care about whether or not, potential benefit duration is long enough to cover the time until retirement. This paper provides evidence in support of this hypothesis for some worker profiles. The analysis is conducted using data from the French employment agency over the period 2001 to 2005. It is based on a natural experiment: on January 1, 2003, the potential benefit duration of UI entrants was sharply reduced. Econometric analysis of the age patterns of UI inflow reveals that the age incentives provided by UI rules greatly influence labor market behaviors: dismissals of insiders close to retirement are often scheduled so that they can receive benefits until retirement. We estimate that the reform increased the mean age at job termination of workers dismissed close to retirement by 4 months. Our findings confirm that UI rules have an impact on inflow into unemployment and that UI is viewed by some employers and/or some workers as an early retirement scheme rather than as insurance against the risk of job loss. Thus, addressing the issue of older workers' participation in the labor market requires consideration of the joint impact of UI and retirement system rules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study shows that in a simultaneous competitive bidding process, the winner's curse of overpaying rarely occurs but may arise in the target firm initiated sequential negotiations; and if the merger is successful then the outcome is never value destroying for the combined firm. Thus the acquirer's overpayment cannot be considered as the 'winner's curse' that results from the post-announcement competitive bidding but rather than the result of the target's strengthened bargaining power in the sequential negotiations. The implications and intuition of such value-destroying mergers thus differ substantially from that of existing pre-emptive mergers and acquisitions models that use a simultaneous bidding mechanism. The results also imply that the 'acquisition premium' accrues to the target firms.","[Dong, Baomin] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng 475000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Frank Yong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Dept Finance, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Henan University; University of International Business & Economics,"Dong, BM (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Jinming Rd, Kaifeng 475000, Henan, Peoples R China.",baomindong@vip.163.com; frankwang@uibe.edu.cn,"Dong, Baomin/AAV-7741-2021","Dong, Baomin/0000-0002-4787-021X",,,,,44,1,1,1,29,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We find that targeting crime reductions through increases in high school graduation rates entails large efficiency and welfare gains.

We distinguish between the cases of strong convergence, where the implied cointegrating vector is [1, -1], and weak convergence, where long-run homogeneity is relaxed. To address cross-sectional dependence, we employ a bootstrap methodology to derive the empirical distribution of the fraction of rejections. We find supporting evidence of U.S. states sharing a common stochastic trend consistent with a definition of convergence based on long-run forecasts of state incomes being proportional rather than equal.

The industrial sectors of the developed world involve a number of different practices and processes utilising a range of different technologies. Consequently, given the derived demand nature of energy, it is vital when modelling industrial energy demand that the impact of technical progress is appropriately captured. However, the energy economics literature does not give a clear guide on how this can be achieved; one strand suggests that technical progress is 'endogenous' via asymmetric price responses whereas another strand suggests that it is 'exogenous'. More recently, it has been suggested that potentially there is a role for both 'endogenous' technical progress and 'exogenous' technical progress and consequently the general model should be specified accordingly. This paper therefore attempts to model OECD industrial energy demand using annual time series data over the period 1962-2010 for 15 OECD countries. Using the Structural Time Series Model framework, the general specifications allow for both asymmetric price responses (for technical progress to impact endogenously) and an underlying energy demand trend (for technical progress and other factors to impact exogenously, but in a non-linear way). The results show that almost all of the preferred models for OECD industrial energy demand incorporate both a stochastic underlying energy demand trend and asymmetric price responses. This gives estimated long-run income elasticities in the range of 034 to 0.96; estimated long-run price-maximum elasticities in the range of -0.06 to -1.22; estimated long-run price-recovery elasticities in the range of 0.00 to -0.27; and estimated long-run price-cut elasticities in the range of 0.00 to -0.18. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that when modelling industrial energy demand there is a place for 'endogenous' technical progress and an 'exogenous' underlying energy demand trend; consequently, it is argued.that, any modelling strategy should start by including both and only imposed restrictions if accepted by the data.

An enriched perspective rooted in Veblenian evolutionary economics (VEE) is used to construct a theoretical framework in order to analyze the processes at play in the formation and reinforcement of habits. The empirical study explores more specifically the synchronic processes strengthening the car-using habit. In addition to underlining the shortcomings of a 'decision theory' perspective to address urban transportation behaviors, we find that synchronic habits can have a significant effect on behavioral inertia. Our results suggest the existence of positive feedback between the development of synchronic habits, qualitative perceptions of driving times, and reinforcement of the car-using habit. The paper points out also that the diachronic dimension of habits would constitute another promising domain for further research on behavioral inertia in transportation.","[Brette, Olivier] Univ Lyon, EVS, CNRS, INSA Lyon, Lyon, France; [Buhler, Thomas] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS TheMA, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Lazaric, Nathalie] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS GREDEG, F-06189 Nice, France; [Marechal, Kevin] Univ Libre Bruxelles, CESSE ULB Belgian Natl Fund Res FNRS, Brussels, Belgium",Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Franche-Comte; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Brette, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, EVS, CNRS, INSA Lyon, Lyon, France.",olivier.brette@insa-lyon.fr; thomas.buhler@univ-fcomte.fr; lazaric@gredeg.cnrs.fr; kevin.marechal@ulb.ac.be,"Brette, olivier/HNR-7906-2023","Brette, olivier/0000-0003-4779-7486",,,,,102,24,25,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This creates a potential conflict with more traditional concerns for productive efficiency. In the case of Italy, together with input-oriented instruments, output-based incentives have been applied to indicators of quality for over a decade. Using micro-data from the largest Italian distribution company, we conduct an assessment of the effects of this regulatory framework. The aim of this work is threefold. First, we measure performance in terms of cost-efficiency and find that similar cost-reducing efforts were exercised in all distribution units. Second, we measure performance with respect to the overall regulatory framework. Using quality-related rewards and penalties, we find that more cost-efficient areas were also more successful in earning rewards/avoiding penalties: favorable external conditions have similar, positive effects on both cost and quality performance. Using the cost of the energy not supplied, we find no evidence of a conflict between cost efficiency and social cost efficiency. Results indicate, however, that itis preferable to use social costs when measuring a single unit's performance. From these results we derive specific policy indications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our results demonstrate that in large, uniform markets using the Men-Proposing Deferred Acceptance Algorithm, each woman's best response to truthful behavior by all other agents is to truncate her list substantially. In fact, the optimal degree of truncation for such a woman goes to 100% of her list as the market size grows large. In general one-to-one markets we provide comparative statics for optimal truncation strategies: reduction in risk aversion and reduced correlation across preferences each lead agents to truncate more. So while several recent papers focused on the limits of strategic manipulation, our results serve as a reminder that without preconditions ensuring truthful reporting, there exists a potential for significant manipulation even in settings where agents have little information.

P.; Singhal, Monica",,,Tax Morale,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BEHAVIOR; EVASION,"There is an apparent disconnect between much of the academic literature on tax compliance and the administration of tax policy. In the benchmark economic model, the key policy parameters affecting tax evasion are the tax rate, the detection probability, and the penalty imposed conditional on the evasion being detected. Meanwhile, tax administrators also tend to place a great deal of emphasis on the importance of improving tax morale, by which they generally mean increasing voluntary compliance with tax laws and creating a social norm of compliance. We will define tax morale broadly to include nonpecuniary motivations for tax compliance as well as factors that fall outside the standard, expected utility framework. Tax morale does indeed appear to be an important component of compliance decisions. We demonstrate that tax morale operates through a variety of underlying mechanisms, drawing on evidence from laboratory studies, natural experiments, and an emerging literature employing randomized field experiments. We consider the implications for tax policy and attempt to understand why recent interventions designed to improve morale, and thereby compliance, have had mixed results to date.","[Luttmer, Erzo F.

The CRA's endogenous rating fee is shown to be decreasing in the accuracy of the rating. The CRA provides a rating only when the investors' regulatory benefit exceeds a minimum threshold. The regulatory reliance on ratings unambiguously reduces rating quality. Strategic rating inflation is more likely for complex financial securities with high fixed evaluation costs, and regulatory reliance on ratings expands the class of assets where rating inflation can occur. The ratings solicited by issuers who are more exposed to negative balance sheet shocks are more likely to be inaccurately optimistic. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses the 2007-2010 State Council URBMI Household Survey data to evaluate the efficacy of major health insurance programs in improving the accessibility, affordability and appropriateness of healthcare among migrant workers. Based on the instrumental variable (IV) estimation that accounts for the endogeneity of insurance participation, we find that the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) is most effective in promoting physical exams and improving self-rated health status for migrant workers, while the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) and commercial insurance show significant benefits in boosting preventive care utilization. However, the current programs are not effective in alleviating the financial burden of healthcare and promoting formal medical utilization among migrant workers, possibly due to the lack of systematic financing scheme for outpatient treatment and the segmentation between insurance platforms. Our study provides implications on reforming China's medical insurance system and migrant health policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, the consequences are not only present on the macroeconomic level but also affect microeconomic issues such as a firm's growth and workforce. This exploratory study realises a microeconomic issue and investigates the linkage between aging workers and employment growth. More precisely, it aims to analyse the potential effect that age composition of a firm's workforce may have on a firm's employment growth. The study applies a linked employer employee dataset of 2100 German firms, covering the time period from 2001 to 2006. We used quantile regression techniques to address the aging effect in the context of extreme employment growth events. The empirical investigation shows that, on average, employment growth slows down as the average age of the workforce increases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The unique equilibrium is such that players exploit noncooperatively the resource when it is abundant, and they revert to conflict when it becomes scarce.

Conventional economic analysis views cutting emissions as a cost, creating a collective action problem. However, decarbonization can improve productivity and provide co-benefits that accord with multiple national policy objectives. We track China's progress in reducing the emissions intensity of the economy, and construct a macro scenario with China's carbon emissions peaking in the 2020s. Investment in greater energy productivity and economic restructuring away from heavy industries can bring productivity gains, and decarbonization of energy supply has important co-benefits for air pollution and energy security. Combined with lower climate change risks and the likelihood that China's actions will influence other countries, this suggests that cutting carbon emissions is not only in China's self-interest but also in the global interest. To properly identify the true costs and benefits of climate change action requires new thinking in economic analysis.","[Teng, Fei] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Ctr Contemporary Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Jotzo, Frank] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Tsinghua University; Australian National University,"Jotzo, F (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",tengfei@tsinghua.edu.cn; frank.jotzo@anu.edu.au,"teng, fei/M-1720-2015; teng, fei/HNI-1377-2023","teng, fei/0000-0003-0371-1142; Jotzo, Frank/0000-0002-2856-847X",,,,,29,21,21,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2014,22.0,5,,,SI,,37,54,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12083.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AP6TT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342211400004,0

These developments point to the possibility that the determinants of rural education have changed. In this paper we examine empirically the determinants of rural high school attainment between 2002 and 2007. Using data from a nationwide household survey and a multilevel regression model with and without instrumental variables, we estimate the relationship between rural high school attainment and individual, family, and community level variables. We find that the size and significance of household income and other individual and household variables declined, while community characteristics and local public expenditures on schools continued to have a significant impact in both years. When we carry out the estimation using instrumental variables, the coefficients on parental education are no longer significant. We conclude that policy changes plus rapid income growth in rural China has brought about substantial change in the determinants of high school attainment, and that the widely observed correlation between parental and child education may be due to unobserved characteristics.

In Spain, a similar pattern was observed: in fact, potential growth estimates were trending upwards, implying that output gaps remained relatively contained. However, the Spanish economy was progressively accumulating other internal and external imbalances. Standard potential growth estimates, which consider inflation as the only indicator of macroeconomic imbalances, therefore provided misleading signals to the policymakers. In this paper we apply to Spain a new methodology to obtain sustainable growth rates, as an alternative measure to potential growth. Sustainable growth is defined as the output growth that does not widen macroeconomic imbalances, identified through a wide set of domestic and external indicators. We find that sustainable growth rates are more stable than potential growth resulting in an output gap that is substantially larger (in absolute value) both before and after the crisis. Another attractive feature of the results is that our measure of output gap turns out to be more robust to revisions than standard measures when 'The Great Recession' emerged.","[Alberola, Enrique; Estrada, Angel; Santabarbara, Daniel] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Estrada, A (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain.",aestrada@bde.es,,,,,,,20,1,3,1,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

However, unlike public goods, very few experiments address the issue of the provision of club goods, and no studies have specifically explored a field case. In this experiment, a membership fee is introduced to improve the successful provision of a threshold collective good. The experiment began in the laboratory with students, and moved progressively through controlled stages to the field with farmers belonging to an association managing an irrigation system. In the laboratory, the experiment reveals that the club good setting significantly increases the successful provision rate of the threshold collective good, and is significantly robust in the intercultural comparison. However, in the field, the club good setting fails to significantly improve the provision of the collective good. The cooperative behavior of farmers explains this difference. In contrast to students, farmers have a high level of cooperation that is sustained over a long period of time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The model is composed of a core unit-where the dynamics of income, credit and aggregate demand are determined-and a set of sectoral accounts that ensure its stock-flow consistency. In order to grasp the role of credit and banks on the functioning of the economic system we make an explicit distinction between planned and realized variables, thanks to which, while maintaining the ex-post accounting consistency, we are able to introduce an ex-ante wedge between current aggregate income and planned expenditure. Private banks are the only economic agents capable of filling this gap through the creation of new credit. Through the use of numerical simulation we discuss the link between credit creation and the expansion of economic activity, also contributing to a recent academic debate on the relation between income, debt and aggregate demand.","[Bernardo, Giovanni] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Bernardo, Giovanni] New Econ Fdn, Great Transit Project, London SE11 5NH, England; [Campiglio, Emanuele] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Pisa; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Campiglio, E (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",g.bernardo@ec.unipi.it; e.campiglio@lse.ac.uk,"Bernardo, Giovanni/AAG-9196-2021","Bernardo, Giovanni/0000-0001-5984-0168",,,,,35,5,6,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2014,41.0,3,,,SI,,381,405,,10.1007/s10663-013-9239-6,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AL4OW,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339113300002,0

Results based on panel regressions on 1,260 country-product pairs suggest that, after controlling for tariffs, systematic cross-country cost-of-living differences, and product-specific unobservables, sanitary and phytosanitary measures contribute to raise the price of African foodstuffs by 14%. At the product level, rice and other cereals, some types of meat (e. g. poultry) and edible oils tend to fetch high ad-valorem equivalents.

In recent years, several countries also reduced their income tax rates on R&D output with the purpose to foster R&D activity. Previous papers have shown that all three tax instruments are effective in raising the quantity of R&D related activity. We in turn assess the impact of corporate tax incentives on the quality of R&D projects, i.e., their innovativeness and earnings potential. Using rich data on corporate patent applications to the European patent office, we find that a low tax rate on patent income raises the average profitability and innovation level of the projects undertaken in a country. The effect is statistically significant and economically relevant and prevails in a number of sensitivity checks.

This paper answers this question by exploring the enforceability of different types of FTAs through comparing minimum discount factors that are necessary to sustain them in an infinitely repeated game framework. The authors search for the globally welfare maximizing trade agreements that are sustainable under different conditions. The results depict that transportation costs, differences in country sizes and comparative advantages are all obstacles for having a multilateral FTA. Accordingly, international development policies conducted for the removal of such obstacles should be the main goal toward achieving a multilateral FTA, which is shown to be the first-best solution to the maximization problem of global welfare.","[Yilmazkuday, Demet; Yilmazkuday, Hakan] Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Yilmazkuday, D (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",dyilmazk@fiu.edu; hyilmazk@fiu.edu,"Yilmazkuday, Hakan/GXZ-6757-2022","Yilmazkuday, Hakan/0000-0002-8629-6230; Yilmazkuday, Demet/0009-0006-1685-3413",,,,,30,9,9,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In order to trace the effects of one variable on another, we calculate Generalized Impulse Response Functions (GIRFs). The computed impulse response functions demonstrate asymmetric effects of positive versus negative and small versus large energy consumption shocks on output growth and vice versa. Specifically, we find that negative energy shocks have a greater effect on output growth than positive energy shocks, and that big negative energy shocks affect output much more than small negative energy shocks. Similarly, we find that positive output shock has a greater effect on energy consumption whereas negative shocks have almost no effect on energy consumption. The results of this study have clear and important implications for energy economists and policymakers in Turkey. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Berg, N; Kim, JY",,,,"Berg, Nathan; Kim, Jeong-Yoo",,,Prohibition of Riba and Gharar: A signaling and screening explanation?,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Islamic; Bank; Norms; Piety; Devout; Loyalty; Screening; Signaling,MODEL; COMPETITION; SACRIFICE; NORMS,"The emergence of Islamic Banks (IBs) with Sharia boards that restrict the set of permissible products and enforce prohibition of riba and gharar raises basic questions about how IB clients benefit when choosing from a restricted menu of possibly higher-cost cash flows. Norms that restrict choice sets, or impose otherwise harsh requirements, would seem to act as a barrier to religious identification by raising costs for IB clients. Contrary to this intuition, our model demonstrates that premium costs associated with restrictions on the set of financing options considered to be Sharia-compliant provide a signaling and screening technology that benefits IB clients who are highly pious. By revealing what would otherwise remain private information about the intensity of religious piety, this signaling technology simultaneously provides a screening service that enables high-piety types to separate themselves and concentrate both social and commercial interactions with others who are similarly pious. Iannaccone (1992) demonstrates a rationale for harsh norms as a mechanism for reducing free-riding in the supply of club goods. In contrast, our model shows that piety can be signaled by the act of choosing to become an IB client and bearing the costs of its restricted choice set and premium pricing for otherwise identical cash flows. Signaling and screening provide a new rationalization for prohibition of riba and gharar as a stable institution. Signaling piety is especially valuable in environments where piety is uncertain and otherwise difficult for others to observe. The model predicts that IBs' Sharia-compliance criteria will tend to be stricter and IB premiums larger in places where the proportion of highly pious Muslims is small. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In a publishing game played by researchers and editors, we assume that quality screening by editors depends on their ability to properly process the flow of submissions. When too many papers arrive, this ability declines and editors may reject good papers or accept papers with little contribution to scientific knowledge. In this game, a separating equilibrium always exists in which only good researchers submit their papers to the journal. Each paper is accepted and the quality of the journal reaches its highest level. However, when the researchers' reward for each publication exceeds a given threshold, two hybrid equilibria are also feasible. In these equilibria, authors of low-quality papers submit their papers to the journal and, as the flow of papers exceeds the editors' capacity of perfect assessment, the selection process becomes imperfect. This creates an opportunity for authors to submit poor quality papers, a behaviour which contributes to the congestion of the editorial process. The various strategies implemented by the editors to oppose congestion are then discussed.","[Besancenot, Damien] Univ Paris 13, CEPN, F-93420 Villetaneuse, France; [Besancenot, Damien] Univ Paris 13, IFRIS, F-93420 Villetaneuse, France; [Faria, Joao R.] Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Huynh, Kim V.] Univ Paris 02, F-75006 Paris, France; [Huynh, Kim V.] LEMMA, F-75006 Paris, France",Universite Paris 13; Universite Paris 13; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Besancenot, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, CEPN, 99 Rue Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93420 Villetaneuse, France.",besancenot.damien@univ-paris13.fr; rfaria2@utep.edu; kim.huynh@u-paris2.fr,"Faria, João Ricardo/AAG-5304-2021; besancenot, damien/Q-5893-2019","FARIA, JOAO RICARDO/0000-0001-6484-3566",,,,,30,0,0,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In the equilibrium of a global coordination game, where players choose the timing of their decision, a player who has sufficiently high beliefs about the state of the economy undertakes an investment without delay. This decision (potentially) triggers an investment by the other player whose beliefs would have led to inaction otherwise. Endogenous timing has two distinct effects on coordination: a learning effect (early decisions reveal information) and a complementarity effect (early decisions eliminate strategic uncertainty for late movers). The experiments that we conduct to test these theoretical results show that the learning effect of timing has more impact on the subjects' behavior than the complementarity effect. We also observe that subjects' welfare improves significantly under endogenous timing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the automata are subjected to implementation and perception errors. The computational experiments examine whether and how the distribution of outcomes and genotypes of the coevolved automata change with different levels of errors. We find that the complexity of the automata is decreasing in the probability of errors. Furthermore, the prevailing structures tend to exhibit low reciprocal cooperation and low tolerance to defections as the probability of errors increases. In addition, by varying the error level, the study identifies a threshold. Below the threshold, the prevailing structures are closed-loop (history-dependent) and diverse, which impedes any inferential projections on the superiority of a particular automaton. However, at and above the threshold, the prevailing structures converge to the open-loop (history-independent) automaton Always-Defect (ALLD). Finally, we find that perception errors are more detrimental than implementation errors to the fitness of the automata. These resultsshow that the evolution of cooperative automata is considerably weaker than expected.","Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Ioannou, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",c.ioannou@soton.ac.uk,"Ioannou, Christos/AAN-8975-2020","Ioannou, Christos/0000-0001-7928-9158",,,,,38,8,10,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

A positive oil market-specific demand shock is associated with significant decreases in aggregate bond index real returns for 8 months following the shock. A positive innovation in aggregate demand has a negative effect on real bond return that is statistically significant and becomes more adverse over 24 months. Structural shocks driving the global oil market jointly account for 27.1% of the variation in real bond returns at 24 month horizon. A spillover index from rolling SVAR models is used to identify the interdependence between the oil market and bond returns. The mean for this spillover index is 0.381 over 2001:01-2011:12 and 0.476 over September through December 2008 during the height of the global financial crisis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed framework combines Bayesian inference with partial identification results. The method is applicable to models with finite space of observed states. We demonstrate the method on Rust's model of bus engine replacement. The estimation experiments show that the parametric assumptions about the distribution of the unobserved states can have a considerable effect on the estimates of per-period payoffs. At the same time, the effect of these assumptions on counterfactual conditional choice probabilities can be small for most of the observed states.","[Norets, A.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Tang, X.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Pennsylvania,"Norets, A (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,,,,,,62,30,31,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We use micro data for housing and labor markets in the 103 Italian province capitals to estimate the price of relational amenities and construct monetary indices of quality of relational life. We focus on time spent with friends, active participation in associations and frequency of going out for leisure activities as relational amenities, while controlling for standard amenities such as weather, environment, services, and socio-demographic characteristics. We find that individuals are willing to pay a positive and significant monetary price to live in cities where people spend more time with their friends.

We find that research productivity drops off very quickly with class rank at all departments, and that the rank of the graduate departments themselves provides a surprisingly poor prediction of future research success. For example, at the top ten departments as a group, the median graduate has fewer than 0.03 American Economic Review (AER)-equivalent publications at year six after graduation, an untenurable record almost anywhere. We also find that PhD graduates of equal percentile rank from certain lower-ranked departments have stronger publication records than their counterparts at higher-ranked departments. In our data, for example, Carnegie Mellon's graduates at the 85th percentile of year-six research productivity outperform 85th percentile graduates of the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, and Berkeley. These results suggest that even the top departments are not doing a very good job of training the great majority of their students to be successful research economists. Hiring committees may find these results helpful when trying to balance class rank and place of graduate in evaluating job candidates, and current graduate students may wish to re-evaluate their academic strategies in light of these findings.","[Conley, John P.] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Onder, Ali Sina] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany; [Onder, Ali Sina] Uppsala Ctr Fiscal Studies, Uppsala, Sweden",Vanderbilt University; University of Bayreuth,"Conley, JP (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",j.p.conley@vanderbilt.edu; ali-sina.oender@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Onder, Ali Sina/0000-0002-6646-409X",,,,,8,55,64,2,32,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Moral hazard arises because the agent gets private random non-contractible benefits, or incurs private random non-contractible costs, if the project is implemented. This contracting problem is pervasive, when project and benefits are interpreted broadly. Even when the agent is risk-neutral, we show that the principal's optimal contract always insufficiently discourages the agent from implementing negative NPV projects and also insufficiently encourages the agent to implement positive NPV projects. We also show that the principal's residual claim always increases in the project's NPV, a result that is generally unobtainable for optimal contracts in effort-based moral hazard problem settings.

The recent theoretical findings have pointed out that the real exchange rate series exhibit asymmetric nonlinear behavior. A unit root test applied to analyze the PPP hypothesis therefore, should also take into account this asymmetry inherent in the real exchange rate. Different unit root tests that consider the presence of these data features have been developed in the time series literature. However, a true attempt to test the PPP hypothesis should take a panel data approach. To this end, we propose a nonlinear heterogeneous panel unit root test where the alternative hypothesis allows for symmetric or asymmetric exponential smooth transition autoregressive nonlinearity and provide its finite sample properties. We apply our test to the real exchange rates of the 15 European Union countries against the US dollar. While the results of the linear and symmetric nonlinear heterogeneous panel unit root tests are against the PPP hypothesis, the asymmetric nonlinear heterogeneous panel test that we propose gives support for the PPP hypothesis as expected. Therefore, the conclusions drawn from the linear panel unit root tests or the nonlinear panel unit root tests that do not take asymmetry into account might be misleading. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The seller proactively encourages entry and subjects incumbents to a spectrum cap. In this framework, a simultaneous multi-round auction (SMRA) gives rise to an exposure problem that distorts efficiency and yields low revenue. We consider three remedies and rank their performance: a combinatorial Vickrey auction, a SMRA with exit option that allows the entrant to annul his bid, and a SMRA with call option that lifts the spectrum cap if entry failed to occur and then allows the successful incumbent to acquire stranded spectrum at a fixed price.

The job gap - when considering the officially unemployed, the underemployed, and those who have given up looking for work - is well above twenty million workers. This issue is reminiscent of the Great Depression of the 1930s, when there were calls for federal assistance in finding jobs for those unemployed, including direct job creation. As a result, emergency workers were employed by the federal government, under the especially created Works Progress Administration (WPA), and became an important part of the economic recovery. In addition to these well-known civilian works programs, this paper will consider new recruits to the military as emergency workers following the US entry into WWII.

Time aggregation that is based on a comparison of monthly labor market states leads to an underestimation of total worker flows by approximately 10%, which is larger than the prediction of a standard correction approach. Multiple labor market transitions within a month induce a procyclical bias in the job-finding rate but not in the separation rate. Rather, during upswings, workers are more likely to change jobs with short intervening transition periods. Relative to previous findings, this reconsideration of German worker flows reveals that the job-finding rate plays a larger role in explaining unemployment fluctuations, although the additional dynamics of the time aggregation bias are shown to be less significant.

This departure consists of a focus on greater national autonomy, a return to some of the macroeconomic policies of earlier eras, and increased state involvement in the economy through interventions and social programs. While these policies have resulted in improved social indicators, they also have provided space for a set of transformative initiatives, including experiments with worker co-management, cooperatives, and participatory planning, all of which seek alternatives to the capitalist organization of the economy. Although the Venezuelan experience could be considered sui generis, especially with the economy's dependence on oil, a critical evaluation of the policies implemented in Venezuela would contribute to discussions on the alternatives to both neoliberal policies and capitalism in general.

Post-Soviet Ukrainian historiography has adopted Western terminology and theories while switching references from the class struggle to the national renaissance.","Humboldt Univ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Portnov, A (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",historiansinua@gmail.com,,"Portnov, Andrii/0000-0003-1913-8811",,,,,52,1,1,0,7,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

This paper examines this issue rigorously. It argues that in the case of subsidization for intra-service handset replacement, the handset subsidy regulation can achieve efficiency. Surprisingly, however, the paper demonstrates that in the environment of subsidization for inter-service handset replacement, the handset subsidy regulation is irrelevant in that it has. no effect on consumer's replacement decision and carriers' incentive for quality enhancing investments. This result implies that the effective charge regulation rather than the handset subsidy regulation can attain efficiency.","Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Seoul 100715, South Korea",Dongguk University,"Rhee, K (通讯作者)，Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Pildong 3Ga 26, Seoul 100715, South Korea.",krhee@dongguk.edu,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

We provide a clear definition of the inconvertible credit money system by differentiating four monetary regimes. It is argued that the dynamic between changes in the quantity of money and prices should be explained on a sectoral level. A key element in explaining this dynamic is found in the decomposition of the MELT into the monetary expression of value (MEV) and the value expression of labor time (VELT). In so doing, Marxian value theory is shown to supersede the quantity theory of money because it can explain not only the general price level, but individual prices as well.","[Rieu, Dong-Min] Chungnam Natl Univ, Taejon 305764, South Korea; [Lee, Keonbeom] Hanshin Univ, Dept Business Adm, Coll Global Cooperat, Osan, South Korea; [Ahn, Hyeon-Hyo] Daegu Univ, Dept Social Studies, Coll Educ, Gyongsan, South Korea",Chungnam National University; Hanshin University; Daegu University,"Rieu, DM (通讯作者)，Chungnam Natl Univ, Daehakro 99, Taejon 305764, South Korea.",rieudm@cnu.ac.kr,,"Rieu, Dong-Min/0000-0003-4353-7820",,,,,14,7,8,2,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

It provides a review of the economics literature in this area to elucidate the implications of recent policy changes on efficiency, costs, and quality. Our review reveals that there has been some convergence in policies adopted across countries to improve financing incentives and encourage efficient use of health services. In the case of risk pooling, all countries with competing pools experience similar difficulties with selection and are adopting more sophisticated forms of risk adjustment. In the case of hospital competition, the key drivers of success appear to be what is competed on and measurable, rather than whether the system is public or private. In the case of both the success of performance-related pay for providers and issues resulting from wait times, evidence differs within and across jurisdictions. However, the evidence does suggest that some governments have effectively reduced wait times when they have chosen explicitly to focus on achieving this goal. Many countries are exploring new ways of generating revenues for health care to enable them to cope with significant cost growth, but there is little evidence to suggest that collection mechanisms alone are effective in managing the cost or quality of care.","[Stabile, Mark] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Stabile, Mark] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Thomson, Sarah] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Observ Hlth Syst & Policies, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; European Observatory on Health Systems & Policies,"Stabile, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,"Stabile, Mark/0000-0002-8327-2786",,,,,110,27,29,1,46,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

This type of systemic change implied radical reforms of property rights, of transactions between economic agents, and of economic regulation. This article focuses on two issues which are important for any newly (re) established polity. The first is the quality of governance associated with the constitutional changes which will influence the behaviour and expectations of economic agents.

Our analysis focuses on the former rather than the latter. Under a very general setting of concave industrial revenue and asymmetric convex costs, we show that each firm typically makes more profit in the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the leader-follower price-quantity competition, one of the basic competition forms, than in the SPNE of the leader-follower price competition and that each firm always makes more profit under simultaneous move price-quantity competition than under simultaneous move price competition. We establish a generalized framework for endogenous timing in duopoly games which is capable of embodying and overcoming the inconsistency across the existing three frameworks in the field. We highlight the advantages of a 3-period general framework.","[Zhu, Quan-tao; Wu, Xin-wang] Guangxi Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Sun, Laixiang] Univ London, Dept Financial Management & Studies, SOAS, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Sun, Laixiang] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100810, Peoples R China",Guangxi Normal University; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Peking University,"Zhu, QT (通讯作者)，Guangxi Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China.",davidqtzhu@gmail.com; flourishwu@aliyun.com; ls28@soas.ac.uk,"SUN, LAIXIANG/ABB-2622-2021","SUN, LAIXIANG/0000-0002-7784-7942",,,,,24,1,1,0,26,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We find that the average propensity for terrorism risk concern is affected by actual risk levels. Country and individual heterogeneity contribute substantially to the variation of observed risk perception. Singles and individuals with white collar jobs are less likely to mention terrorism as one of the most pressing issues their country faces, while political positioning towards the right makes it more likely to be concerned about terrorism. As far as competing risks are concerned, we find that the likelihood terrorism is mentioned, decreases with spending on pensions as a percentage of GDP being higher. Finally, based on the Bayesian framework, we also examined the formation of terrorism risk perceptions, and decompose the observed country-level time series of terrorism activity into a long- and a short-run component. We concluded that the observed risk perception variation is only explained by the long-term trend of terrorism activity countries face.","[Drakos, Konstantinos] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Athens, Greece; [Drakos, Konstantinos] Network Econ Anal Terrorism Athens, Athens, Greece; [Mueller, Catherine] Univ Sussex Brighton, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Sussex,"Drakos, K (通讯作者)，76 Patiss St, Athens 10434, Greece.",kdrakos@aueb.gr,,,,,,,48,9,9,2,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

More specifically, we implement local risk minimization and a minimum variance hedge approximation based on an extended Girsanov principle that generalizes Duan's (1995) delta hedge. Since the minimal martingale measure fails to produce a probability measure in this setting, we construct local risk minimization hedging strategies with respect to a pricing kernel. These approaches are investigated in the context of non-Gaussian driven models. Furthermore, we analyze these methods for non-Gaussian GARCH diffusion limit processes and link them to the corresponding discrete time counterparts. A detailed numerical analysis based on S&P 500 European call options is provided to assess the empirical performance of the proposed schemes. We also test the sensitivity of the hedging strategies with respect to the risk neutral measure used by recomputing some of our results with an exponential affine pricing kernel.

Two main results emerge. First, trade integration is beneficial for welfare by inducing higher productivity, but unemployment can temporarily rise during the transitional adjustment. labor market rigidities reduce gains from trade, even though they can mitigate short-run employment losses. Second, consistent with the data, the model predicts that stronger trade linkages lead to increased business cycle synchronization. The strength of this effect, however, depends on the labor market characteristics of the integrating partners. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using the complete selling history of 125,135 sellers on Eachnet.com (an eBay equivalent in China), we show that sellers with a longer successful selling record enjoyed more repeat business, reached more buyer regions, sold in more product categories, and had a higher completion rate even before Eachnet introduced a centralized feedback system. Since the centralized feedback system, the difference between reputable and non-reputable sellers has decreased in terms of repeat business but enlarged in terms of market expansion. These findings suggest that while reputation can facilitate trade through buyer experience and word-of-mouth, it is not as effective as centralized feedback.

In equilibrium, the sender resolves the trade-off between using the costly signal versus relying on the noisy grade to distinguish himself. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition loosely, that the grade is sufficiently informative relative to the dispersion of (marginal) signaling costs across types under which the presence of grades substantively alters the equilibrium predictions. Specifically, separating equilibria do not survive stability-based refinements. Instead, the prediction depends on the prior distribution over the sender's type. For example, with two types it involves full pooling when the distribution places sufficient weight on the high type and partial pooling otherwise. Finally, the equilibrium converges to the complete-information outcome as the distribution tends to a degenerate one resolving a long-standing paradox within the signaling literature.

One side (developers) is always informed about all prices and therefore forms responsive expectations. In contrast, we allow the other side (users) to be uninformed about prices charged to developers and to hold passive expectations. We show that platforms with more market power (monopoly) prefer facing more informed users. In contrast, platforms with less market power (i.e., facing more intense competition) have the opposite preference: they derive higher profits when users are less informed. The main reason is that price information leads user expectations to be more responsive and therefore amplifies the effect of price reductions. Platforms with more market power benefit because higher responsiveness leads to demand increases, which they are able to capture fully. Competing platforms are affected negatively because more information intensifies price competition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting holdup problem provides firms with a strategic incentive to overaccumulate capital so as to reduce their marginal productivity and thus the bargained price. In equilibrium, this strategic incentive can outweigh the usual distortionary effects of holdup problems that on their own would lead to underinvestment, thus resulting in the economy to overinvest. In a setting with both capital and labor, the holdup problem in capital markets interacts with holdup problems in labor markets. This presents firms with a trade-off that has non-trivial equilibrium effects and that depending on the substitutability of capital and labor and the firm's bargaining power in each market can mitigate or exacerbate the overinvestment result.

Notwithstanding, we provide sufficient conditions on the voters' preference intensities to remove this sort of insincerity. On the contrary, if the candidate gets a positive share of the votes, a voter might skip him solely on the basis of his ordinal preferences.

Nevertheless European power generation is still widely based on fossil fuels. The carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) could be part of an approach to achieve ambitious CO2 reduction targets without large scale transformations of the existing energy system. In this context the paper investigates on how far the CCS-technology could play a role in the European and most notably in the German electricity generation sector. To account for all the interdependencies with the European neighboring countries, the embedding of the German electricity system is modeled using a stochastic European electricity market model (E2M2s). After modeling the European side constraints, the German electricity system is considered in detail with the stochastic German Electricity market model (GEM2s).

It is the first study applying methods based on discrete choice experiments to a developed country nursing workforce. It is also the first to focus on the transition through university training and into work. This is particularly important as junior nurses have the lowest retention levels in the profession. We sample 526 individuals from nursing programmes in two Australian universities. Flexible and newly developed models combining heteroscedasticity with unobserved heterogeneity in scale and preference weights are estimated. Overall, salary remains the most important feature in increasing the probability that a job will be selected. Supportive management/staff' and quality of care' follow as the most important attributes from a list of 11 nonpecuniary characteristics.

We show that, under parallel trade, R&D investment can rise only when the South government takes into full account its impact both on investment and on the firm's decision to supply the regulated country. This arises because of a complete withdrawal from price regulation. When policy choices are endogenized, indeed the South wants to achieve this level of full commitment when it is large in size. When instead it is smaller in size, the South chooses an intermediate form of commitment whereby it anticipates its effect only on local distribution and delivery, but not on global R&D investment. As a response to these credible levels of price control commitments, the North reacts by allowing parallel imports from the South. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Instead, the average observed ratio from the balance sheet accounts of the System of National Accounts is a factor of 2.6-6.6, depending on whether natural resource stocks are included in the balance sheet. The clear implication is that the System of National Accounts wealth accounts are incomplete, with the most obvious omission being human capital. Estimating the value of human capital using the lifetime income approach for a sample of 13 (mostly high-income) countries yields a mean share of human capital in total wealth of 62 per cent-four times the value of produced capital and 15 times the value of natural capital. But for selected high-income countries in the sample there is still an average of 25 per cent of total wealth that is unaccounted for-it is neither produced, nor natural, nor human capital. This residual intangible wealth is arguably the 'stock equivalent' of total factor productivity-the value of assets such as institutional quality and social capital that augment the capacity of produced, natural, and human capital to support a stream of consumption into the future.","[Hamilton, Kirk] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Liu, Gang] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Statistics Norway,"Hamilton, K (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.e.hamilton@verizon.net; liu@ssb.no,,,,,,,31,13,14,5,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Based on the Markov Regime-switching model of Hamilton (1989), we show that this happens during the recent financial crisis regime, characterized by a higher mean and volatility of credit spreads. It is also true for Ireland and Portugal, also bailed out by their EU partners and IMF. We show that, for Greece and Portugal, the shift of credit spreads to their higher mean-volatility regime occurred before the collapse of Lehman brothers, thus discounting a higher price of sovereign credit risk for these two countries. In contrast to Ireland, this regime shift has not been triggered by a rating downgrades for Greece and Portugal. In this higher volatility regime, credit ratings seem to significantly influence future changes in credit spreads independently of economic fundamentals, for Greece and Portugal. For Ireland, they constitute the main factor of determining credit spreads. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The model predicts that parity promotes peace: in the pure-strategy equilibrium, agents with relatively symmetric conflict capabilities agree to resolve the conflict by using a random device: however, with sufficiently asymmetric capabilities, conflicts are unavoidable because the stronger agent prefers to fight. The results of the experiment confirm that the availability of the random device partially eliminates conflicts when agents are relatively symmetric: however, the device also reduces conflict between substantially asymmetric agents.

More specifically, the paper examines the extent to which these cycles relate to each other over time. Business cycle components of output are extracted by adopting the Hodrick-Prescott, Baxter-King and the Christiano-Fitzgerald filters. The degree of business cycle co-movements is determined by evaluating the cross-correlation of the cyclical components of output in selected countries. We also implement the bound-testing approach proposed by Pesaran, Shin and Smith (2001) to investigate the long-run and short-run relations among the business cycle components of output. The study covers the period from 1960 to 2010. The empirical results suggest that there are two distinct cycles in the OECD countries: the Euro-area cycle, which includes the business cycles of Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, and the world cycle, which consists of the business cycles of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Consistent with recent empirical evidence, our model provides a theoretical case of a non-linear pattern between life expectancy and economic growth. However, it is also shown that the emergence of such a pattern critically depends on the existence of intergenerational transfers in form of bequests. Specifically, we find that rising life expectancy unambiguously decreases growth if bequests are operative, whereas there exists an inverted-U shape relationship in economies where bequests are inoperative.

While numerous papers have tested this proposition, the literature has remained divided over the appropriate measure for redistribution. Revisiting the original contribution by Meltzer and Richard in 1981, the present paper argues that the median voter hypothesis implies that relative redistribution should increase in line with inequality. However, an empirical test based on 110 observations from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) finds no support for the hypothesis. By contrast, voters' actual preferences offer a better guide to understanding redistributive outcomes. The findings challenge the narrow concept of human motivation that underpins rational choice, and point to the importance of fairness orientations that have been emphasized in behavioral economics.","ILO Reg Off Asia & Pacific, Bangkok 10200, Thailand",,"Luebker, M (通讯作者)，ILO Reg Off Asia & Pacific, POB 2-349, Bangkok 10200, Thailand.",luebker@ilo.org,,,,,,,85,34,37,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Using a small open economy model with a non-traded sector, I show how these subsidies impact the steady state levels of macroeconomic aggregates such as consumption, labor supply, and aggregate welfare. These subsidies can lead to crowding out of non-oil consumption, inefficient inter-sectoral allocations of labor, and other distortions in macroeconomic variables. Across steady states, aggregate welfare is reduced by these subsidies. This result holds for a country with no oil production and for a net exporter of oil. The distortions in relative prices introduced by the subsidy create most of the welfare losses. How the subsidy is financed is of secondary importance. Aggregate welfare is significantly higher if the subsidies are replaced by lump-sum transfers of equal value. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This shows, on one hand, that CPPI and DPPI are completely independent of any choice of a particular model for the dynamics of asset prices. They even make sense beyond the class of semimartingale sample paths and can be successfully defined for models admitting arbitrage, including some models based on fractional Brownian motion.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; ELECTRICITY; SCALE; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM,"This study compares Photovoltaic (PV) power stations between Germany and the United States to examine which country more efficiently provides renewable energy in their usages. For the comparative analysis, this study utilizes Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a methodology to evaluate the performance of PV power stations from the perspective of both solar and land usages. A total of one hundred sixty PV power stations (eighty in Germany and eighty in the United States) are used for this comparison. The demand for sustainable energy and energy security has been rapidly increasing over the past decade because of concerns about environment and limited resources. PV solutions are one of many renewable technologies that are being developed to satisfy a recent demand of electricity. Germany is the world's top installer and consumer of PV power and the United States is one of the top five nations. Germany leads the way in installed PV capacity even though the nation has less solar resources and land area. Due to limited solar resources, low insolation and sunshine, and land area, the United States should have a clear advantage over Germany. However, the empirical result of this study exhibits that PV power stations in Germany operate more efficiently than those of the United States even if the latter has many solar and land advantages. The surprising result indicates that the United States has room for improvement when it comes to utilizing solar and land resources and needs to reform the solar policy. For such a purpose, Feed-In Tariff (FIT) may be an effective energy policy at the state level in the United States because the FIT provides investors such as utility companies and other types of energy firms with financial incentives to develop large PV power stations and generation facilities for other renewable energy. It may be true that the FIT is a powerful policy tool to promote PV and other renewable installation and support a reduction of an amount of greenhouse gases. However, the FIT poses a large financial burden to consumers with a massive increase in renewable energy installation like in Germany and Spain. Therefore, it is necessary for the United States to consider how to align a policy with a speed of technology innovation to balance between the benefit and the cost derived from the policy implementation on renewable energy. In addition, this study discusses policy issues regarding cost allocation due to FIT among stakeholders related to the electric power industry. At the end, this study proposes a new type of wholesale electricity market that provides simultaneous trading on electricity and greenhouse gas emissions by fully utilizing modern computer science technology that exists in universities and national laboratories of the United States.

This research closes the loop on two developing literatures, one seeking cultural explanations for economic development and the other seeking to account for differences in firm performance from differences in how firms are managed. Theoretically, we expect individualist culture to improve management practices because it formalizes the labor relation. Results show that higher individualism is strongly associated with more sophisticated management practices. Several robustness checks confirm our findings. In a direct test, culture is a much more important determinant of management practices than are key formal institutions. Moreover, a formal test shows that management practices are indeed an important mediator in the empirical link between culture and per-capita income. The evidence presented in this paper moves us forward in opening up the black box of culture-performance linkages, helping us to understand better the channels through which culture can affect economic prosperity.

It is the first to empirically investigate the extent to which PIT mimicry varies along the tax schedule and the first to include nations which are not part of the OECD. We use data on international personal income tax schedules from the world tax indicators to estimate marginal and average tax rates at various multiples of per capita gross domestic product (GDP). These tax rates are then used to estimate the extent to which countries respond to their neighbors' PIT policy. We find evidence of PIT mimicry using a balanced panel of 53 countries over 24 years.

Domestic tax revenue could play a significant role in funding such expenditures. However, to date tax revenue collection in SSA has only averaged about 15% of GDP. In this paper we employ cluster analysis to enhance our understanding in the variations in tax effort performance amongst SSA countries. Past studies of tax effort performance in SSA have resorted to economic events or factors to explain the tax effort performance. We argue here that it is necessary to consider historical events to provide a fuller explanation.

If such a distribution exists, the government is satisfying its intertemporal budget constraint. One key finding is that historical fiscal policy would bring the current high-debt ratio back to its normal level of 0.35 over the coming decade. Forecasts of continuing increases in the ratio over the decade make the implicit assumption that fiscal policy has shifted dramatically. In the variant of the model that matches the forecast, the government would not satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint if the policy was permanent.

Using as controls authorities that were proposed but never approved by Congress, we find that the TVA led to large gains in agricultural employment that were eventually reversed when the program's subsidies ended. Gains in manufacturing employment, by contrast, continued to intensify well after federal transfers had lapsed-a pattern consistent with the presence of agglomeration economies in manufacturing. Because manufacturing paid higher wages than agriculture, this shift raised aggregate income in the TVA region for an extended period of time. Economists have long cautioned that the local gains created by place-based policies may be offset by losses elsewhere. We develop a structured approach to assessing the TVA's aggregate consequences that is applicable to other place-based policies. In our model, the TVA affects the national economy both directly through infrastructure improvements and indirectly through agglomeration economies. The model's estimates suggest that the TVA's direct investments yielded a significant increase in national manufacturing productivity, with benefits exceeding the program's costs. However, the program's indirect effects appear to have been limited: agglomeration gains in the TVA region were offset by losses in the rest of the country. Spillovers in manufacturing appear to be the rare example of a localized market failure that cancels out in the aggregate.

A comparison group was drawn from NYC VITA sites where the program was not offered. Propensity score weighting was used to balance the two groups. Study participants (N = 353) were surveyed via telephone halfway through the program, and again 8 months after the program ended. 70 percent of $aveNYC participants surveyed received the match. The majority of those who received the match continued to save some portion of the money. At the second survey, there was no significant difference between groups in savings amount: this finding may be due to measurement limitations. $aveNYC participants were less likely than comparison group members to have skipped paying bills or taken out a loan during the study period, and were more likely to have withdrawn money from savings.

The sign and magnitude of energy substitution have been widely debated, and the results are divergent. This paper applies the translog cost function specification to estimate factor share equations based on the energy and non-energy inputs, whose coefficients are used to observe the energy degree of substitutability with the other traditional inputs for power industry in China. The results suggest that energy is the least price sensitive among three production factors. The four types of input elasticities (cross-price, Morishima's, Allen and McFadden's shadow elasticity of substitution) show that there are substantial substitution possibilities between energy and capital, while energy and labor have weak substitution. The findings imply that for power industry in China, to reduce energy consumption, more capital should be invested. With respect to labor, though, it appears less energy-saving potential.

Information sharing between the service receiver and provider is also vital in terms of equipment investment in long-term partnerships, and is affected by the level of trust that each party holds for the other within the outsourcing process. Conceptual model is useful in explicating important government-business partnering strategies - the model highlights not only the economic benefits that the IS-outsourcing relationship brings based on social exchange theory characteristics, but also suggests many additional relevant elements.","Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taipei, Taiwan",Ming Chuan University,"Yu, TY (通讯作者)，Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taipei, Taiwan.",yutaiyi@gmail.com,"Yu, Tai-Yi/GNM-8279-2022; Yu, Tai-Yi/GSO-1462-2022",,,,,,30,1,4,0,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A common view is that long-run responses still might be large if micro-estimates are downward biased owing to optimization frictions. In this paper we estimate the taxable income elasticity at a very large kink point of the Swedish tax schedule using the bunching method. During the period of study the change in the log net-of-tax rate reached a maximum value of 45.6%. Interestingly, we obtain a precise elasticity estimate of zero for wage earners at this large kink. We also conclude by the means of numerical simulations that, even though the kink point we study is very large, income effects are unlikely to bias our estimates. The size of the kink allows us to derive tighter bounds on the long-run elasticity than previous studies. If wage earners on average tolerate 1% of their disposable income in optimization costs, the upper bound on the long-run compensated taxable income elasticity is 0.39. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Conditional on predetermined supply and demand elasticities, we retrieve yearly shifts in regional supply and demand. The relative impact on price from each supply and demand shift is determined through an equilibrium displacement model (EDM). This procedure is applied on a yearly basis for the world salmon market in the period 2002 to 2011. The results indicate a large variation in demand and supply growth both over time and between regions. While average annual price impacts from supply or demand shifts from most regions are not statistically significant, price impacts from supply or demand shifts for specific periods are detected in all but one region. This indicates that the use of smooth trend indicators is likely to be inappropriate for measuring supply and demand shifts and their impacts on price. The procedure presented in this article can be a useful instrument for determining the relative impacts of supply and demand shifts on price in any market with unstable price behaviour.","UiT, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Sch Business & Econ, N-9014 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Brækkan, EH (通讯作者)，UiT, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Sch Business & Econ, N-9014 Tromso, Norway.",eivind.h.brakkan@uit.no,"Hestvik Brækkan, Eivind/ABD-7248-2021","Braekkan, Eivind Hestvik/0000-0002-3286-9865",,,,,55,10,10,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A unique set of controls are used to estimate the determinants of WTP for this particular manifestation of superficiality. Both parametric and nonparametric measures of mean WTP are also derived. To the extent that a driver's demand for superficiality represents a market failure, e.g., due to imperfect information, or, in a normative sense, the influence of wasteful social norms, our welfare measures represent estimates of the potential social deadweight loss associated with the purchase of this particular good. In this case, potential social deadweight loss is defined as total surplus from the market for dented-bumper repair that remains untransferred' to markets for non-(or less)superficial goods. Best-guess estimates of the annual potential deadweight loss from dented-bumper repair in the US fall in the range of $122000 to $609000, depending upon the estimated number of superficially dented bumpers per year.","Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Caplan, AJ (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",arthur.caplan@usu.edu,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The respective evaluations of China's OFDI are indicative of the important role played by non-financial OFDI. At the same time, Chinese firms prefer to invest in high-tech industries in developed countries while also focusing on the extraction of natural resources around the world. The empirical findings show that the host country's economic size has a significantly positive effect in terms of promoting Chinese OFDI. Chinese firms favour a complex-vertical platform in the developed countries while they prefer a market potential foreign direct investment (FDI) surrounding the host developing countries and an export-platform FDI in the petroleum exporting countries based on the surrounding market potential effect and spatial effect. The fuel extraction motive plays a key role in China's OFDI in line with the realities of Chinese FDI strategies in recent years.","Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Chang, SC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan.",scchang@ba.ntust.edu.tw,,,,,,,79,57,60,7,145,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

A broad set of the most popular linear and nonlinear GARCH-type models is used to investigate this relevancy. Our in-sample and out-of-sample results show that volatility of commodity returns can be better described by nonlinear volatility models accommodating the long memory and asymmetry features. In particular, the FIAPARCH model is found to be the best suited for estimating the VaR forecasts for both short and long trading positions. This model also gives for all four commodities the lowest number of violations under the Basel II Accord rule, given a risk exposure at the 99% confidence level. Several implications for commodity market risks, policy regulations and hedging strategies can be drawn from the obtained results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Younger workers who received the flyer were significantly more likely to begin contributing to the plan relative to their peers in the control group. Many workers do not participate in their employers' supplemental retirement savings programs, even though these programs offer substantial tax advantages and immediate returns due to matching contributions. From a survey of new hires, we find that many workers choose not to contribute to the plan because they have other financial priorities. However, some nonparticipants lack the financial literacy to appreciate the benefit. These findings indicate that simple informational interventions can nudge workers to participate in retirement saving plans and enhance individual well-being and retirement income security.","[Clark, Robert L.; Morrill, Melinda Sandler] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Maki, Jennifer A.] FTI Consulting, Ctr Healthcare Econ & Policy, Washington, DC 20005 USA",North Carolina State University,"Morrill, MS (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",Robert_Clark@ncsu.edu; Jen.Maki@fticonsulting.com; Melinda_Morrill@ncsu.edu,,"Morrill, Melinda/0000-0002-1479-1996; Maki, Jennifer/0000-0003-3142-9769",,,,,29,29,37,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We augment these data with information on prices and novel estimates of quality. We organize the empirical analysis around a version of the endogenous growth model with expanding variety, in which inputs are allowed to be heterogeneous in terms of quality. In line with this framework, we find three main results. First, new imported inputs have a strong positive effect on product creation in Europe. Second, they work through a combination of mechanisms, allowing countries to benefit from both wider and better sets of intermediate products.

However, the effectiveness of monetary policy can be restored by the imposition of capital controls. We derive the optimal response of monetary policy to a global liquidity trap in the presence of capital controls.

Theoretically, it is clear that there exists a certain degree of substitutability between SE and MR, since both can provide a cushion against socio-economic risks. However, market regulation is an inefficient means to provide protection, since it might reduce productivity and the employment level. Still, to be politically viable efficiency-enhancing deregulation policies must come along with appropriate fiscal measures (social protection spending) to compensate the losers of reforms or to accommodate any temporary negative effect on aggregate demand. This implies that the political determinants of MR and SE should be jointly analyzed to explain both the multiplicity of stable combinations of MR and SE empirically observed, and the strong political resistance often encountered in the implementation of structural reforms. The focus of this paper is a theoretical and empirical (using microdata from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP)) investigation on the socio-economic, institutional and cultural factors which shape voters' preferences for MR and SE and determine the relative salience of the two political issues. Such an analysis should provide fundamental pieces of information to carry out a proper analysis of the political process to give account of the multiplicity of combinations of MR and SE empirically observed.

When bequests are luxuries the marginal utility of bequests declines more slowly than the marginal utility of consumption. This is essentially lower risk aversion. As a retiree approaches death, her expected remaining lifetime utility is increasingly composed of bequest utility, and thus generates progressively lower risk aversion. A retiree responds by increasingly favoring the higher-return risky asset. Compared to standard preferences, luxury bequests elevate a retiree's average exposure to the risky asset, but the difference is small in early retirement. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Often, however, this phenomenon takes on only moderate proportions. This article addresses issues of rural households' income diversification in the case of Poland. It investigates returns from rural households' income strategies using propensity score matching methods and extensive datasets spanning 1998-2008. Results suggest that returns from combining farm and off-farm activities were lower than returns from concentrating on farming or on self-employment outside agriculture. This differential is stable over time although returns from diversification have relatively improved after the accession of Poland to the European Union. This is also visible in the fact that since 2006, returns from combining farm and off-farm activities have equalized with returns from relying solely on hired off-farm labour, thus smoothing away the difference observed before the accession. Further, over the analysed period, households pursuing a diversification strategy performed better than those relying solely on unearned income. Finally, in general, incomes in households combining farm and off-farm activities were higher than in those combining off-farm income sources.","[Falkowski, Jan; Jakubowski, Maciej; Strawinski, Pawel] Univ Warsaw, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Falkowski, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland.",jfalkowski@wne.uw.edu.pl; mjakubowski@wne.uw.edu.pl; pstrawinski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Fałkowski, Jan/ABE-9726-2020; Jakubowski, Maciej/AAG-7807-2020; Strawinski, Pawel/X-7785-2019","Fałkowski, Jan/0000-0001-6921-6342; Jakubowski, Maciej/0000-0002-2512-3133; Strawinski, Pawel/0000-0003-2247-1658",,,,,64,2,2,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Using a Markov switching error correction model, we re-examine this relationship in the US housing market and find two distinctive regimes: one with a long-run relation between house price and rent predicted by the present value models and the other in which the relation is nonlinear. Furthermore, we find evidence that deviations of house prices from the present value models' predictions are caused by the overreaction of house prices to movements in rents rather than speculative bubbles attributable to extraneous factors.","[Kim, J.

Much progress has been made in understanding the problem over the ensuing four decades. The study takes issue with those who confine the concept to the process of bailing out loss-making socialist firms. It shows how the syndrome can appear in various organizations and forms in many spheres of the economy and points to the various means available for financial rescue. Single bailouts do not as such generate the SBC syndrome. It develops where the SBC becomes built into expectations. Special heed is paid to features generated by the syndrome in rescuer and rescuee organizations. The study reports on the spread of the syndrome in various periods of the socialist and the capitalist system, in various sectors. The author expresses his views on normative questions and on therapies against the harmful effects. He deals first with actual practice, then places the theory of the SBC in the sphere of ideas and models, showing how it relates to other theoretical trends, including institutional and behavioural economics and theories of moral hazard and inconsistency in time. He shows how far the intellectual apparatus of the SBC has spread in theoretical literature and where it has reached in the process of canonization by the economics profession. Finally, he reviews the main research tasks ahead.","[Kornai, Janos] Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kornai, Janos] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary",Harvard University; Corvinus University Budapest,"Kornai, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",janos.kornai@uni-corvinus.hu,,,,,,,95,25,25,0,14,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Contrasting to the previous studies, this paper plans to explore the industry synergetic evolution mechanism based on industry convergence and technology progress. We use self-organization method and Haken Model to establish synergetic evolution equations, and select technology progress and industry convergence as the key variables of industry evolution system. Besides, patent licensing data of China's listed ICT companies are collected to measure industry convergence rate, and DEA Malmquist index method is applied to calculate technology progress level. In the empirical analysis, simultaneous equation estimation method is adopted to investigate the synergetic industry evolution process. Our main findings are that (1) technology progress is an order parameter, which dominates industry system evolution. Moreover, industry convergence is a control parameter, which is influenced by technology progress; (2) Development of technology progress is the core factor for causing evolution of industry system, and industry convergence is the outcome of technology progress; (3) Especially, it is important that the dominated role of technology progress will be sustained, even though in the environment of convergence, and so companies also need to focus on self-innovation rather than only to adapt to the new industry evolution trend.","[Li, Yaya; Zhao, Yulin; Wang, Fang] Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Li, Yongli] Harbin Inst Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology,"Li, YY (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Gongda Rd 25, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",yizhi19881107@126.com; yongli.0440004@gmail.com; ylzhao@whut.edu.cn; wf87586519@163.com,"Zhang, Bo/JVD-9890-2024; Li, Yaya/GPC-6058-2022","Li, Yaya/0000-0002-1921-8478; Li, Yongli/0000-0002-1979-9057; LI, Yongli/0000-0002-5617-8866",,,,,36,5,6,9,68,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We start by situating love historically in the neoliberal culture and then examine the six main love styles as well as the five critical factors through the process of circular and cumulative causation. We then scrutinise the contradictions of neoliberal capitalism involving the nurturance gap, disembedded economy and freedom constraint which inhibit the generation of holistic love capital. The path dependent nature of love is then linked to relational phases and instabilities, especially involving serial monogamy in the United States.

While the use of such models to disaster situation, which may quite differ from the ordinary economic setting, has been critiqued (for recent example, see Albala-Bertrand, 2013), there are still valuable reasons for the use of such models. In particular, such models can be used in order to quickly provide a ballpark estimate of the system-wide impact for recovery plan and finance and/or to evaluate disaster countermeasures in the pre-event period. This paper presents how these methodologies have evolved to incorporate with disaster-specific feature and discusses how far they still need to go from the current stage. This paper also serves as a preface to this special issue, which encompasses several papers devoted to the use of macroeconomic data and models to assess economic losses from disasters.","[Okuyama, Yasuhide] Univ Kitakyushu, Grad Sch Social Syst Studies, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan; [Santos, Joost R.] George Washington Univ, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Washington, DC USA",University of Kitakyushu; George Washington University,"Okuyama, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Kitakyushu, Grad Sch Social Syst Studies, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan.",okuyama@kitakyu-u.ac.jp,"Santos, Joost/AAH-1466-2019","Okuyama, Yasuhide/0000-0003-1602-996X",,,,,53,152,173,7,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

For the same degree of competition (identical aggregate demand and supply), we can observe different demand structures. Do they have an impact on the auction efficiency and revenue-raising properties? It is essential to understand better the impact of competition structure on performance in order to draw recommendations for the design of multi-unit auctions. Theoretical results demonstrate on a simple case contrasting a uniform-price auction of two bidders with a demand of 6 units each, and an auction of 6 bidders with a demand of two units each, that there are multiple equilibria leading to different performance outcome. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of these two auctions. Results support that with a constant competition degree, the seller gets higher expected revenue with a lower variance when he faces a large number of bidders with small individual demands. We show that this result is attained with no significant effect on allocative efficiency.","[Preget, Raphaele] INRA, LAMETA, UMR 1135, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Preget, Raphaele] INRA LAMETA, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Thoyer, Sophie] Montpellier SupAgro, LAMETA, UMR 1135, F-34000 Montpellier, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Préget, R (通讯作者)，INRA, LAMETA, UMR 1135, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",preget@supagro.inra.fr; thoyer@supagro.inra.fr,,"PREGET, Raphaele/0000-0003-2650-148X",,,,,19,0,1,0,9,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Literature analysis suggests that various drivers can have an influence on retail bank customer intentions to purchase financial services online. This study investigated key drivers that affect customer intentions to purchase financial services online in a transitional economy. A survey data were collected from 185 adult visitors of several popular websites in Lithuania. Hypotheses were tested using correlation and regression analyses. The findings suggest that usefulness, easy to use, security, trust and confidentiality are key drivers that influence customer intention to purchase financial services and therefore are important in Internet banking. The research demonstrates how these five drivers affect customer intention to purchase financial services online in transition economy, and reveals relationships among the drivers. The results that were obtained supported all five hypotheses. Usefulness and easy to use emerged as the main reasons for using financial services online. Security, trust and confidentiality drivers also appear to be important factors affecting customer intentions to purchase financial services by the Internet. This study is of interest to bank managers, as they can apply the key drivers offered in this study to evaluate a usage of financial services and to increase customer intention to purchase financial services online. This study is limited to one transitional economy under investigation and further research needs to be extended to other economies.

The result shows that there is evidence that education has a positive impact on labour productivity. Education is an instrument to boost labour productivity.

The main intuition is that the cartel has an incentive to contract output and that the firms outside the cartel react to this by expanding output. If the outsiders are more efficient than the cartel firms, average production costs go down. We model collusion in a market structure with imperfect substitute goods. Even for relatively moderate differences in efficiency, total welfare may increase due to this market-induced rationalization, whereas the cartel remains profitable. We discuss why the effect can be relevant for sectors where new, superior products are developed.

The sample consists of 222 MPs from the House of Representative in Malaysia. The data was collected through questionnaire surveys. A total of 67 completed questionnaires returned.

The econometric methodology applied here is based on the dynamic conditional correlation model proposed by Engle (2002). Further, we applied several Lagrange multiplier (LM)-robust tests to test whether there were structural breaks in series' dependency structures during the period of interest. Events theoretically classified as relevant to the crisis upshots as well as the interactions between the moments of the series were used as indicator functions to the referred structural breaks. The main conclusion of this study is that one can indeed observe contagion within almost all pairs of sectors' indices. Thus, we conclude that the dependency structure of the sectors of interest has faced structural changes during the years of 2007 and 2008. Hence, diversification strategies as well as the risk analysis inherent to the portfolios' management may have been drastically affected.","[Arruda, Bruno P.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Valls Pereira, Pedro L.] Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Arruda, Bruno P.; Valls Pereira, Pedro L.] CEQEF FGV, Ctr Quantitat Studies Econ & Finance, Sao Paulo, Brazil",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Getulio Vargas Foundation; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Pereira, PLV (通讯作者)，Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",pedro.valls@fgv.br,"Pereira, Pedro L.

For 1984-1997, when the saving rate was relatively stable, the forecasts are generally unbiased and efficient. For 1998-2007, when the saving rate experienced significant declines, the forecasts are generally biased (over-predicting) but still efficient. Evidence of efficiency or weakly' rationality implies that the Federal Reserve forecasts were generated under symmetric (asymmetric) loss for 1984-1997 (1998-2007). Under asymmetric loss where the forecast errors of the same magnitude but of different signs possess different costs, biased forecasts may still be optimal if the bias is strictly due to asymmetric loss. As such, for 1998-2007, the Federal Reserve staff may have assigned high cost (loss) to under-predictions but little or no cost to over-predictions due to, perhaps, perceiving the unusual declines in the saving rate as temporary.","Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business & Management, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah,"Baghestani, H (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business & Management, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",baghesta@msn.com,,"Baghestani, Hamid/0000-0003-4568-1682",,,,,6,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The results show the primary source of economic growth was the accumulation of physical capital in the period investigated, followed by the growth of multifactor productivity. The contribution of labour was marginal in most cases. These growth accounting results are consistent with those of development accounting, which show that substantial backwardness (compared with Germany) prevailed only in capital intensity and multifactor productivity in the 10 CEE countries.

Urgent responses have been conducted since March 11, 2011, including controlling the consequences of the nuclear accident, dealing with the short-term power shortages, and a comprehensive review of Japan's long-term national energy policy. Nationwide discussions and reviews of these issues are still continuing. Even today, more than 2 years after March 11, many problems remain unsolved and Japanese society has to face uncertainty and challenges about its energy future. In the current difficult situation, Japan needs to achieve 3Es (energy security, environmental protection, and economic efficiency) plus S (safety) and M (macro economy protection) simultaneously, taking account of the new realities following the Fukushima accident. This paper tries to identify the energy-related challenges that Japan has to face and tries to recommend the concept of the energy best mix policy for Japan, by describing the present status of energy issues in Japan and the national debate on energy policy.","[Koyama, Ken] Inst Energy Econ, Tokyo 1040054, Japan",,"Koyama, K (通讯作者)，Inst Energy Econ, Chuo Ku, Inui Bldg Kachidoki,1-13-1 Kachidoki, Tokyo 1040054, Japan.",kkoyama@tky.ieej.or.jp,,,,,,,0,12,14,0,37,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

The focus is on communication structures where the set of players forms a circle, so that the possibilities of cooperation are represented by the connected sets of nodes of an undirected circular graph. Single-valued solutions are considered which are the average of specific marginal vectors. A marginal vector is deduced from a permutation on the player set and assigns as payoff to a player his marginal contribution when he joins his predecessors in the permutation. We compare the collection of all marginal vectors that are deduced from the permutations in which every player is connected to his immediate predecessor with the one deduced from the permutations in which every player is connected to at least one of his predecessors. The average of the first collection yields the average tree solution and the average of the second one is the Shapley value for augmenting systems. Although the two collections of marginal vectors are different and the second collection contains the first one, it turns out that both solutions coincide on the class of circular graph games. Further, an axiomatization of the solution is given using efficiency, linearity, some restricted dummy property, and some kind of symmetry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We set forth the hypothesis that buffet restaurants' practice of collecting the price in advance, rather than at the end of the meal, encourages overeating. Viewing advance payment as a token of disrespectful treatment, we first establish this result theoretically by extending two recent and competing models on buffet behaviour to take account of the customer's treatment experience. We then report the results of two experiments conducted in a sushi restaurant which support our hypothesis. The experiments reveal, ceteris paribus, that paying for the buffet meal after eating reduces sushi consumption by about 4.5 units, as compared to paying before eating. The result bears a straightforward and simple policy implication: To help reduce obesity, buffet restaurants should be banned from collecting the price in advance.","[Mealem, Yosef] Netanya Acad Coll, Netanya, Israel",,,gidyan@colman.ac.il,,,,,,,6,8,10,1,105,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article explains this development as a result of the liberalisation of international capital markets. First, central banks accumulate reserves in order to protect the economy from detrimental effects of sudden stops in capital flows and flow reversals. Second, central banks use the accumulation of reserves as a substitute for capital controls. Changes in reserves are a form to manage net capital inflows. They permit the central bank to preserve some leeway for an independent monetary and financial policy despite the classic policy trilemma. The empirical analysis of a large panel data set supports the hypothesis that the accumulation of reserves is the consequence of a fear of capital mobility suffered by central banks.

The critical institutionalist reconciliation of these definitions conceptualizes institutions as an emergent process by which the internal and necessary relations of social structure as collective action, mediated through agency, results in the control, expansion, and liberation of the individual action of social actors in transactions. In short, an institution is the emergent process of social structure actualized in transactions (social action). Institutions, therefore, not only have a structural existence, but also an actual existence as they are the process of the emergence of the actual (in transactions) from the structural. Institutions are multi-level processes and cannot be reduced to structures, actions, behaviors, or patterns of behaviors. In this part, I demonstrate the significance of this reconciliation in two areas. The first is its ability to further differentiate the institutional definition of economics as the science of social provisioning from the mainstream definition of economics as a relationship between ends and scarce means by decomposing the institutional definition into its productive and distributive processes. The second is its usefulness in modeling the interaction of non-economic social institutions with economic institutions at varying levels of detail. I also introduce critical institutional analysis, and use as a method, for model-building and use it to build models of communal, feudal, and industrial capitalist economies.","Univ Missouri Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Tauheed, LF (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",,,,,,,,29,4,8,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

I present statistical evidence that the response of the two asset prices have indeed been unusually large relative to the past experience with nonconventional monetary policy (NCM) even after allowance is given for the rise in global economic activity and asset prices. I also point out that the rally has been led by speculative trading by foreign investors, while domestic investors have largely stayed on the sidelines. I discuss possible reasons for such foreign investor behavior. Simply put, the unprecedented political pressure raised hopes of the adoption of bold measures by the Bank of Japan. I discuss, however, the possibility that the room for further action by the Bank is quite limited apart from what might be called a targeted helicopter drop of money. I also point out the possibility that investor behavior may have not been based on economic fundamentals. The asset price volatility since April 2013 is interpreted in the light of such discussions.","[Ueda, Kazuo] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Ueda, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo, Japan.",ueda@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,13,21,24,0,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

It attempts to show that, during market integration processes, when changes in productive structures are expected, the changes in national technological specialization are less linked to technological cumulativeness and opportunity. The paper uses patent data for 15 European, 6 Asian and 4 Latin American countries. It concludes that market integration is associated with elevated rhythms of catching up and converging, but also with higher levels of concentration of technological structures. Besides that, there is evidence that the concentration of innovative efforts is not always persistent. A reasonable part of the newly built competences is not the consequence of cumulative processes; therefore, there are reasons to think that quite a large part of mobility is strongly associated with productive structural change.

An important result is that when interactions are significant multiple steady states emerge.

To overcome endogeneity problems, I use the minimum distance from each province to a main economic centre as an instrument for foreign investment inflows. The instrumental variable approach shows that the direction of influence is from greater foreign investment to better institutions. These results hold after controlling for various additional covariates, and are also robust to various alternative measures of institutions.

We use laboratory experimental methodology to elicit the preferences and observe the choices of the target population of a proposed government policy. We recruited 256 subjects in Montreal, Canada; 72 percent had income below 120 percent of the Canadian poverty level. The combination of survey measures and actual decisions allows us to better understand individual heterogeneity in responses to different subsidy levels. In particular, participants chose between various cash alternatives and educational subsidies, for themselves and for a family member, allowing for the construction of two measures of willingness to invest in education. Two behavioral characteristics, patience and attitude toward risk, are key to understanding the determinants of educational investment for the low-income individuals in this experiment. The decision to save for a family member's education is somewhat different from that of investing in one's own education. Patient participants were more likely to save for a family member's education, but in contrast to investing in one's own education, a subject's attitude toward risk played no role.

This article assesses the relevance of these conflicting incentives for Dutch pension funds and insurance firms over the period 1995 to 2009. Using a unique and extended data set, we observe a significant positive relationship between capital and asset risk for insurers, indicating that risk-management incentives dominate in the Dutch insurance industry. Risk-shifting incentives, however, also seem relevant, as stock insurers take more investment risk than their mutual peers. For Dutch pension funds, we conclude that overall neither risk-shifting nor risk-management incentives seem to dominate. Interestingly, we find that professional group pension funds take significantly less investment risk than other types of pension funds. This finding is in line with expectations, as in professional group pension funds potential incentive conflicts between pension fund participants and the employer are effectively internalized.","[Gorter, Janko; Bikker, Jacob A.] DNB, Strategy Dept, Supervisory Policy Div, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bikker, Jacob A.] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, NL-3584 EC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Gorter, J (通讯作者)，DNB, Strategy Dept, Supervisory Policy Div, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.k.gorter@dnb.nl; j.a.bikker@dnb.nl,,,,,,,44,7,7,2,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Six governance measures are included in our analysis (Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law and Control of Corruption) as have been defined by the World Bank. The empirical findings reveal a high nonlinear relationship between countries' carbon dioxide emissions and the examined governance measures. The results reveal significant differences on the number of governance measures influencing countries' carbon dioxide emission levels. It is evident that these differences are subject to countries' specific regional and development variations. Finally, it appears that increasing the quality of countries' different governance factors does not always result to lower carbon dioxide emission levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from a world sample suggests that genetic distance, interpreted as long-term cultural and biological divergence, is an important factor in understanding health inequalities across countries. Specifically, the paper documents a remarkably robust negative link between genetic distance to the United States and population health as measured by life expectancy at birth and the adult survival rate even after accounting for an extensive set of possible confounders, such as GDP per capita and various climatic factors. Consistent with the interpretation that genetic distance is related to population health indirectly through human barriers to the diffusion of modern health technologies, the evidence indicates that the gene gradient emerges at the onset of the international epidemiological transition.

Consistent with international trade theories, the size of a region's economy (GDP, income, and population) has a significant and appropriately signed effect on the extensive and intensive margins. However, the effects work dominantly through the intensive margin rather than the extensive margin.

We estimate a simultaneous equations system to account for the potential residential self-selection problem. While most previous studies focus on a specific region, this paper uses national samples from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey. The estimation results indicate that residential density has a statistically significant but economically modest influence on vehicle usage, which is similar to that in previous studies. However, the joint effect of the contextual density measure (density in the context of its surrounding area) and residential density on vehicle usage is quantitatively larger than the sole effect of residential density. Moving a household from a suburban to an urban area reduces household annual mileage by 18%. We also find that a lower neighborhood residential density induces consumer choices toward less fuel-efficient vehicles, which confirms the finding in Brownstone and Golob (2009).

When only consumption is constrained by liquidity, fast money supply can hasten output growth unless seigniorage revenue is wasted and production externalities do not exist. We find that even though money growth normally promotes economic growth, it does not improve welfare when capital stock is over-accumulated.

That transformation has already produced some of the most significant changes in the operation of the portfolio of electricity generation since WWII. Further implications are likely. To that end, we present results from numerical modeling of different United States (U.S.) power sector futures. These futures assess questions affecting today's natural gas and electric power markets, including the impacts of: forthcoming EPA rules on power plants, decarbonization options such as a clean energy standard (CES), potential improvements in key generation technologies, expanded use of natural gas outside of the power generation sector, and higher costs for natural gas production-assumed to arise from more robust environmental and safety practices in the field. The simulations were done using the ReEDS model looking out to the year 2050. ReEDS is a capacity expansion model that determines the least-cost combination of generation options that fulfill a variety of user-defined constraints such as projected load, capacity reserve margins, emissions limitations, and operating lifetimes. The baseline scenario shows strong growth in natural gas generation, leading to a roughly 2.5-fold increase in gas demand by 2050. Many other scenarios also see strong growth in gas-fired generation, highlighting questions about portfolio diversity, climate change, and research and development prioritization.

As Ecuador is strongly integrated financially and commercially with the United States, the exchange rate pass-through should be zero. However, we sustain that rising rates of imports from trade partners other than the United States and subsequent real effective exchange rate depreciations are causing the pass-through to move away from zero. Here, in the framework of the Vector Error Correction Model, we analyse the impulse response function and variance decomposition of the inflation variable. We show that the developing economy of Ecuador is importing inflation from its main trading partners, most of them emerging countries with appreciated currencies. We argue that if Ecuador recovered both its monetary and exchange rate instruments, it would be able to fight against inflation.

We find that teams play the Nash equilibrium strategy significantly more often, and their choices are more often a best response to stated first order beliefs. Distributional preferences make equilibrium play less likely. Using a mixture model, the estimated probability to play strategically is 62% for teams, but only 40% for individuals.

Based on the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model, the LAISS model is a flexible functional form for imposing and testing properties of demand for the inputs of production. Own and cross price elasticities are derived for aggregate capital, labor, and energy, and compared to the translog cost function. Both models reduce to estimating a system of input share equations on input prices and output, with output normalized by the Stone's input price index in the LAISS model. Results indicate that all inputs are substitutes in both models, but elasticities differ. A log likelihood dominance criterion shows that the LAISS model dominates the translog cost function for this dataset Results suggest that inputs are substitutes, and that an energy import tariff would increase demand for labor and capital.

We first analyze intergenerational gross mobility. Until the end of the 1980s, intergenerational flows toward the non-farm sector are high in Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea, flows toward the farm sector are more often observed in Ghana and Uganda, and Madagascar displays less mobility in either direction. The pace of change in occupational structures and the magnitude of labor income dualism between the farm and non-farm sectors appear to explain those differences. We then net out structural change across generations and establish the first measurement of intergenerational net mobility in those five African countries. Ghana and Uganda stand out as relatively more fluid societies. Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea come next while Madagascar shows a particularly high reproduction of occupations. Educational mobility accounts for the Madagascar exception to a large extent, but not for the differences between the other countries. Spatial dualism of employment, i.e. the geographic segregation of farm and non-farm jobs, accounts for most of those remaining differences. We argue that the main determinants of intergenerational mobility, namely income and employment dualisms, likely reflect a historical legacy of different colonial administrations.","[Bossuroy, Thomas] World Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Cogneau, Denis] Paris Sch Econ IRD, Paris, France",The World Bank; Paris School of Economics,"Cogneau, D (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",cogneau@pse.ens.fr,"Cogneau, Denis/JCO-4775-2023",,,,,,49,30,34,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Theory suggests two opposite effects. If labour is used to appropriate resources violently, higher wages may lower conflict by reducing labour supplied to appropriation. This is the opportunity cost effect. Alternatively, a rise in contestable income may increase violence by raising gains from appropriation. This is the rapacity effect. Our article exploits exogenous price shocks in international commodity markets and a rich dataset on civil war in Colombia to assess how different income shocks affect conflict. We examine changes in the price of agricultural goods (which are labour intensive) as well as natural resources (which are not). We focus on Colombia's two largest exports, coffee and oil. We find that a sharp fall in coffee prices during the 1990s lowered wages and increased violence differentially in municipalities cultivating more coffee. This is consistent with the coffee shock inducing an opportunity cost effect. In contrast, a rise in oil prices increased both municipal revenue and violence differentially in the oil region. This is consistent with the oil shock inducing a rapacity effect. We also show that this pattern holds in six other agricultural and natural resource sectors, providing evidence that price shocks affect conflict in different directions depending on the type of the commodity.","[Dube, Oeindrila] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Vargas, Juan F.] Univ Rosario, Bogota, Colombia",New York University; Universidad del Rosario,"Dube, O (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,"Vargas, Juan/P-1787-2019","Vargas, Juan/0000-0001-8090-8091",,,,,96,453,527,4,144,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In each period a representative voter chooses among heterogeneous candidates with known policy preferences. The elected candidate chooses the policy to implement, and how much rent-seeking to engage in, when in office. As the voter decides both which candidate to elect and, subsequently, whether the candidate is retained, this framework integrates elements of electoral competition and electoral accountability. I show that, in the best stationary equilibrium, when utility functions are concave over policy, non-median candidates are elected over candidates with policy preferences more closely aligned with the voter. In this equilibrium, there are two candidates who are elected at some history, and the policies these candidates implement in office do not converge. This divergence incentivizes candidates to engage in less rent-seeking, increasing voter welfare.","Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Van Weelden, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,49,31,36,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

This important question has typically been addressed exploiting the classic dichotomy of fixed versus flexible exchange rate regimes assuming perfect capital mobility. However, the role of capital controls cannot be neglected, particularly in developing countries. This paper analyzes the effects of capital controls on fiscal performance by focusing on dual exchange rate regimes. In a model in which the fiscal policy is endogenously determined by a nonbenevolent fiscal authority, dual regimes induce politicians to have higher fiscal deficits than under fixed and flexible regimes operating under perfect capital mobility. The model also shows this effect increases as fiscal authorities become more impatient. Dynamic panel regressions confirm that dual regimes lead to higher fiscal deficits than fixed and flexible regimes operating under unified rates. Using a dummy for pre-electoral year as an indicator of fiscal authorities' shortsightedness, we also confirm that dual exchange rate has a more adverse effect on fiscal deficits as the authorities become more impatient.

Thus, for example, increases in the relative weight of countries with low emissions tend, ceteris paribus, to increase the inequality, even when the vector of international per capita emissions remains unchanged. This effect, strictly associated with share variations, is assessed in this paper by means of a simple decomposition methodology. This methodology allows us to ascertain what part of the time variation of the inequality is attributable to the variations in the shares and/or the variations in the environmental variable analysed and, in turn, suggests extending the analysis to the group components of inequality (Shorrocks, 1980). This proposition is used empirically to assess international inequalities in CO2 per capita and the Kaya factors for a variety of sub-periods during the 1971-2007 period and for various satisfactory inequality indices.

An owner's time preference and risk attitude will determine the importance he places on payoffs in the different states. It is a well-known problem in the literature that under incomplete asset markets, a conflict about the firm's objective function tends to arise among its owners. In this paper, we take a new approach to this problem, which is based on non-cooperative bargaining. The owners of the firm play a bargaining game in order to choose the firm's production plan and a scheme of transfers which are payable before the uncertainty about the future state of nature is resolved. We analyze the resulting firm decision in the limit of subgame-perfect equilibria in stationary strategies. Given the distribution of bargaining power, we obtain a unique prediction for a production plan and a transfer scheme. When markets are complete, the production plan chosen corresponds to the profit-maximizing production plan as in the Arrow-Debreu model. Contrary to that model, owners typically do use transfers to redistribute profits. When markets are incomplete, the production plan chosen is almost always different from the one in a transfer-free DrSze (pseudo-)equilibrium and again owners use transfers to redistribute profits. Nevertheless, our results do support the DrSze criterion as the appropriate objective function of the firm.","[Britz, Volker] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Herings, P.

However, while most banks struggle to meet the stringent capital requirements of regulators, co-operative banks are in particular need of cautious capital-related decisions given their little ability to accommodate profit-driven equity investors. In fact, co-operative banks' single greatest source of capital is their annual surplus. This paper first highlights that capital protection rules related to Hungarian co-operative banks are more liberal than those of other European co-operatives. This is followed by an analysis of Hungarian co-operative banks' decisions on the distribution of annual surplus among their members. In doing so, the annual reports of 99 co-operative banks representing 73% of all Hungarian co-operatives are used, complemented with confidential data on the ownership structure of each co-operative. The study shows that a co-operative with a low number of members and a high amount of average subscribed capital per member is likely to distribute high dividends. This phenomenon is explained by the different nature of co-operatives according to the number of members.

Using a calibrated two-sector general equilibrium model, we find that agricultural TFP growth: (i) accounts for the majority of output and employment reallocation toward non-agriculture; (ii) contributes (at least) as much to aggregate and sectoral economic growth as non-agricultural TFP growth; and (iii) influences economic growth primarily by reallocating workers to the non-agricultural sector, where rapid physical and human capital accumulation are currently taking place.

Specifically, we study whether people are more or less likely to lie when the content of the lie is personal, when they base decisions on intuition, and when they are in a market context. We also study how aversion to lying depends on personal characteristics, including age, gender, cognitive ability, personality and social preferences. Our main finding is that non-economic aspects of the choice situation are crucial in understanding aversion to lying. In particular, we find that people are less likely to lie when the content of the message is personal. We also find large effects from priming the participants to rely on intuition, but, interestingly, in this case the effect only applies to males. Finally, we find that people who are highly motivated by social preferences are more averse to lying, but there is no significant relationship between lying behavior and other personal characteristics.

The study uses the most popular measures of return mentioned in financial academic publications. Moreover, a relatively long time horizon, lasting from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2010 was taken into consideration. The non-parametric methods utilized in the study were traditional contingency tables combined with a new approach discussed in the literature on the subject and related to the estimation of stochastic kernel. The obtained results have revealed the existence of weak and limited performance persistence within the total time horizon and in several sub-periods. The significance of the phenomenon depended on the applied measure of return. Furthermore, performance dependence in successive periods was related to the market situation. In general, the character of the occurrence of performance persistence may be connected with the size and the level of development of the Czech investment fund industry.","Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ Warsaw UKSW, PL-01938 Warsaw, Poland",Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw,"Filip, D (通讯作者)，Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ Warsaw UKSW, Woycickiego Str 1-3 Bl 3, PL-01938 Warsaw, Poland.",d.filip@uksw.edu.pl,,"Filip, Dariusz/0000-0002-6905-1004",,,,,32,3,3,0,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In this study, we estimate the variations of TE between 1980 and 2009 in 23 low-income countries and 18 high-income countries, and demonstrate that TE has increased in both country groups in view of the deployment of mobile communication networks and Internet technologies. For low-income countries, we also prove that the causal relation is from the deployment of mobile networks and Internet technologies towards the increase of TE. More specifically, by estimating the stochastic production frontier for a flexible transcendental logarithmic production function under the assumption of fixed effects, we show that the increase in TE per additional mobile phone and Internet subscriber is the highest in Latin American and Asian countries, but the accrued TE increase in response to Internet usage is the largest in high-income countries due to an overly higher Internet diffusion. Having established that modern information and communication technologies improve the TE, we conclude discussing policies that lead to the spread of such technologies, particularly in low-income countries.

Our theoretical framework suggests two distinct channels in which wage volatility affects growth: a positive direct way and a negative indirect way. The direct effect stems from precautionary savings, whereas the indirect effect works through the mediating role of government size. In the empirical part, we use a 3SLS approach to analyze a panel of 20 high-income OECD countries and find strong evidence for the existence of both effects. These results carry general and specific implications. In general, ignoring indirect effects operating through government size may mask the real net effects of volatility on growth, which could result in misleading conclusions. Specific to wage volatility, our results suggest that the net effect on economic growth depends on both government size and the wage premium from working in the private sector. Within our sample, we find evidence for both - countries for which wage volatility is beneficial to growth and others for which it is detrimental. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Our aim is to reconstruct the neoclassical theory of inflation to obtain a model which generates non-periodical oscillations of price level. This model is considered to be a realistic approximation of actual price level evolution. We start our analysis with the Fisherian equation of exchange. The assumption on non-variability of the velocity of money circulation parameter is relaxed in favour of dependence on expected inflation. The resulting model of inflation is a two-equation model where price evolution depends on production dynamics which is assumed to be an exogenous variable. After that, the two-equation model is re-formulated as an autonomous system to a model where production dynamics is determined by a Kaldorian type's model. By adding Kaldor's model to the two equation system, we create a four equation model. Both our models are able to generate more complex dynamics, i.e. non-linear cycles and chaos, which we examine by generating time series from numerical example and analyse them with the help of an advanced non-linear method.","[Kodera, Jan; Quang Van Tran] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Vosvrda, Miloslav] AS CR, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kodera, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",kodera@vse.cz; vosvrda@utia.cas.cz,"Vosvrda, Miloslav/G-8956-2014; Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022","Vosvrda, Miloslav/0000-0001-9821-9059;",,,,,26,1,1,1,10,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

China and India drive the results for the effect of BRIC countries' liquidity on real oil price and global oil production. China and India and Brazil and Russia reinforce one another on the effect of liquidity on global real aggregate demand. Due to the difference between countries as commodity importers/exporters, the liquidity of Brazil and Russia increases significantly with a rise in real oil price and that of China and India decreases significantly with a rise in real oil price. It is shown that the strong rebound in oil price during 2009 is mostly due to strong effects of shocks to liquidity in the BRIC countries.

The model yields the prediction that if, for instance, the production of lending services is labor intensive while the provision of deposit services is physical-capital-intensive, banks located in a foreign nation with a relatively larger labor endowment will export lending services while banks based in a domestic country with a relatively larger endowment of physical capital will export deposit services. These efficiency-based trade flows indicate that domestic borrowers and savers will be net recipients of credit and deposits, respectively, with foreign banks obtaining funds that permit them to act as net lenders to the domestic nation by borrowing from domestic banks in a global wholesale interbank funds market. A key implication of the model, therefore, is that attainment of profit-maximizing intra-industry flows of banking-service trade requires the smooth functioning of this interbank market.","Baylor Univ, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Baylor University,"VanHoose, D (通讯作者)，Baylor Univ, Hankamer Sch Business, 1 Bear Pl 98003, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",David_VanHoose@baylor.edu,,,,,,,26,2,2,3,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Under certain conditions, our game-theoretic model predicts that the donor reduces the proportion of restricted transfers in total transfers as the moral hazard behavior of the recipient declines. Using foreign aid transfers (i.e., project aid and program aid) and panel data covering the period 1991-2007, we find econometric support for the prediction of the model. Our results suggest that some variables that affect the size of foreign aid may have no effect on the composition of aid.","[Amegashie, J.

We start by drawing an original distinction between weak and strong stakeholders where, as long as only material payoffs are considered, firms are interested in cooperating only with the latter. Then, arguing that the motivations and preference systems of economic agents are complex and irreducible to mere rational self-interest, we consider agents endowed with conformist preferences: that is, agents that obtain positive ideal utility by conforming with some ideal principles that they are willing to fulfill conditionally on the expected behavior of others. Given conformist preferences, we show that: (a) strong stakeholders may have incentives to punish firms who do not cooperate with the weak ones; (b) both strong stakeholders and firms may have incentives to cooperate in the long term and to ensure that weak stakeholders receive a fair proportion of the surplus generated by the firm's activity.
