The context was a technology-based workplace in the U.K. with around 500 members of staff, 57 of whom took part in a BEV experience project in 2010. Several months later, we recruited a diverse sample of 21 staff to complete semi-structured interviews. Following a multi-method approach, we elicited details about their perceptions and valuation of BEVs, experiences with BEVs, and social interactions relating to BEVs. Participants reported a wide variety of perceptions of BEV attributes, including environmental benefits and functional drawbacks. The majority of participants indicated that their BEV perceptions were highly influenced by at least one social interaction. We use the reflexive layers of influence conceptual framework to categorize social influence according to three processes: diffusion, the sharing of BEV-related information; translation, the discussion of uncertain BEV benefits and drawbacks; and reflexivity, the relating of BEV technology to self-concept. Findings suggest that participant perceptions change in part through social negotiation of meaning, lifestyle and identity. Neglect of social influence processes will underestimate the potential for shifts in consumer preferences regarding emerging pro-environmental technologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using the downscaled climate projections for 2060 from seven leading global climate models we then predict the geographical shifts in areas suitable for banana production. We repeat this process for conventional and organic banana production. Approximately half of the existing conventional plantations included in the analysis are located in areas predicted to become unsuitable for banana production by 2060. The overall extent of areas suitable for conventional banana cultivation is predicted to decrease by 19%, but all countries are predicted to maintain some suitable areas. The extent of areas suitable for organic banana cultivation is predicted to nearly double due primarily to climatic drying. Several countries (e.g.. Colombia and Honduras) are predicted to experience large net decreases in the extent of areas suitable for banana cultivation. Some countries (e.g.. Mexico) are predicted to experience large net increases in the extent of suitable areas. The shifts in the location of areas that will be suitable for banana cultivation are predicted to occur mainly within areas outside of protected areas and that are already under agricultural production.

Existing research shows that significant differences exist in the institutional setup of WUAs in China, and that WUAs have not been universally successful in saving water and improving farm incomes. This paper aims to examine the underlying causes of differences in WUA performance by analyzing the impact of WUA characteristics on the productivity of irrigation water. Explanatory variables in our analysis are derived from Agrawal's user-based resource governance framework Applying a random intercept regression model to data collected among 21 WUAs and 315 households in Minle County in northern China, we find that group characteristics, particularly group size and number of water users groups, and the existing pressure on available water resources are important factors in water productivity. Resource characteristics, i.e. resource size and degree of overlap between the WUA boundaries and natural boundaries, do not significantly affect water productivity in our research area.

These public service firms are financed by fixed and variable subsidies and fees-for-services paid by users. Standard economic models, such as the profit maximization and cost minimization model, are not suitable for describing the production structure and the economic behavior of these firms. Productivity and efficiency measures derived from these models therefore are not accurate. This paper derives a model that fits this type of firm and its economic context. It derives the exact mathematical relationships between public value, services delivered, (money) revenues, costs, service prices, resource prices and subsidies. In an empirical setting the model can be used as a reference to calculate productivity and efficiency scores. The usability of the model is demonstrated by an application to Social Labor Services in the Netherlands.","[Blank, Jos L.

The first scenario doubles the irrigated area in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, compared to the baseline, but keeps total crop area constant. The second scenario increases both rainfed and irrigated crop yields by 25% for all Sub-Saharan African countries. The two adaptation scenarios are analyzed with IMPACT, a partial equilibrium agricultural sector model combined with a water simulation module, and with GTAP-W, a general equilibrium model including water resources. The methodology combines the advantages of a partial equilibrium approach, which considers detailed water-agriculture linkages, with a general equilibrium approach, which takes into account linkages between agriculture and nonagricultural sectors and includes a full treatment of factor markets. The efficacy of the two scenarios as adaptation measures to cope with climate change is discussed. Due to the limited initial irrigated area in the region, an increase in agricultural productivity achieves better outcomes than an expansion of irrigated area. Even though Sub-Saharan Africa is not a key contributor to global food production (rainfed, irrigated or total), both scenarios help lower world food prices, stimulating national and international food markets.

Accordingly, the EU Biodiversity Strategy requires the member countries to assess their ecosystems and the economic value of their ecosystem services by 2020. This paper takes up and extends the subjective well-being approach to valuing changes in natural land cover, which provides information on willingness-to-pay for landscape amenities such as scenic views or recreational opportunities. Results at the NUTS 2 level for European countries indicate (a) that marginal willingness-to-pay estimates tend to be higher for natural areas that are scarcer, and (b) that a nonlinear relationship between land cover and well-being is preferred to a linear relationship indicating decreasing benefits from individual landscape amenities.

This paper combines recreational choice modelling and economic valuation with GIS based techniques to allow an assessment of the spatial diversity of the value of forest recreation services. The data for the analysis is a national study of the car borne recreational use of Danish forest sites. A random utility framework is used and a comparison between the standard fixed coefficient model and a mixed logit model is made. The results show that the different specifications of the random utility models reveal similar preferences for the measured forest attributes in terms of sign and magnitude. The spatial predictions, however, reveal a considerable difference in the spatial pattern of economic benefits from recreation between the two models. These results have implications for current ecosystem service mapping initiatives as they emphasise the need to account for spatial heterogeneity in preferences, and aggregate demand and environmental attributes and infrastructure.

Evidence from Belgian firm-level data,JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY ANALYSIS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ageing; Old labour productivity and employability; Panel data analysis,PRODUCTIVITY; RETIREMENT; WORKFORCE; WAGES,"The Belgian population is ageing due to demographic changes, so does the workforce of firms active in the country. Such a trend is likely to remain for the foreseeable future. And it will be reinforced by the willingness of public authorities to expand employment among individuals aged 50 or more. But are older workers employable? The answer depends to a large extent on the gap between older workers' productivity and their cost to employers. To address this question we use a production function that is modified to reflect the heterogeneity of labour with workers of different age potentially diverging in terms of marginal products. Using unique firm-level panel data we produce robust evidence on the causal effect of ageing on productivity (value added) and labour costs. We take advantage of the panel structure of data and resort to first-differences to deal with a potential time-invariant heterogeneity bias. Moreover, inspired by recent developments in the production function estimation literature, we also address the risk of simultaneity bias (endogeneity of firm's age-mix choices in the short run) using (1) the structural approach suggested by Ackerberg et al. Structural identification of production functions. Department of Economics, UCLA, (2006), (2) alongside more traditional system-GMM methods (Blundell and Bond in J Econom 87:115-143, 1998) where lagged values of labour inputs are used as instruments. Our results indicate a negative impact of larger shares of older workers on productivity that is not compensated by lower labour costs, resulting in a lower productivity-labour costs gap. An increment of 10 %-points of their share causes a 1.3-2.8 % contraction of this gap. We conduct several robustness checks that largely confirm this result. This is not good news for older individuals' employability and calls for interventions in the Belgian private economy aimed at combating the decline of productivity with age and/or better adapting labour costs to age-productivity profiles.","[Vandenberghe, V.; Rigo, M.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Econ Sch Louvain, Dept Econ, IRES, B-1348 Brussels, Belgium; [Waltenberg, F.] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Econ, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Waltenberg, F.] Univ Fed Fluminense, Ctr Estudos Desigualdade & Desenvolvimento CEDE, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Rigo, M.] Cent European Univ, Dept Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universidade Federal Fluminense; Universidade Federal Fluminense; Central European University,"Vandenberghe, V (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Econ Sch Louvain, Dept Econ, IRES, 3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Brussels, Belgium.",vincent.vandenberghe@uclouvain.be; waltenberg@economia.uff.br; rigom@ceu.hu,"Vandenberghe, V./L-9544-2013","Vandenberghe, V./0000-0002-1645-1127",,,,,38,25,29,1,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In this paper we report on a dynamic commons experiment, representing a forest, performed with different types of communities of resource users in Thailand and Colombia, as well as student participants. We find that all groups overharvest the resource in the first part of the experiment and that there is no statistical difference between the various types of groups. In the second part of the experiment, participants appropriate the common resource after one of three possible regulations is elected and implemented. There is less overharvesting after the rules are implemented, but there is a significant amount of rule breaking. The surprising finding is that Colombian villagers break the rules of the games more often than other groups, and even more so when they have more trust in members of the community. This observation can be explained by the distrust in externally proposed regulations due to the institutional and cultural context. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We employ disaggregated data on sales by Norwegian multinationals' affiliates from 1999 to 2005 that allow such affiliates to be categorized as either efficiency-seeking (vertical) or market-seeking (horizontal) FDI. While the environmental stringency of a host country and its enforcement are found to have no effect on the average investment, we find a significant negative effect on multinationals with vertical motives. Compared to those located in lenient countries, the efficiency-seeking affiliates in more environmentally regulated countries receive less investment from their parent companies in terms of (i) equity capital, (ii) capital stock, and (iii) assets. We further find that the total exports from affiliates to parent companies in Norway decrease with the level of enforced environmental stringency in the host countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this survey we assess the footprint of consumption of 187 countries using eight indicators of environmental pressure in order to determine whether or not this phenomenon occurs. We use input-output analysis with a new high resolution global Multi-Region Input-Output table to calculate each trading pair's balance of trade in biophysical terms of: GHG emissions, embodied water, and scarcity-weighted water content, air pollution, threatened species, Human Appropriated Net Primary Productivity, total material flow, and ecological footprint. We test three hypotheses that should be true if ecologically unequal exchange occurs. One: The inter-regional balance of trade in biophysical terms is disproportional to the balance of trade in financial terms. We find this is true, though not strongly so. Two: Exports from developing nations are more ecologically intensive than those from developed nations. We find this is true. Three: High-income nations disproportionately exert ecological impacts in lower income nations. We find this is false: high income nations are mostly exporters, not importers, of biophysical resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This data includes a systematic profile of the countries' coastline with respect to economic and natural environments, such as marine biodiversity related indicators. Tourist demand is modelled using a system of simultaneous structural equations estimated by a 3SLS routine. We identify two tourist demand segments, denoting different preferences for the worldwide coastal destinations. International tourists choose their coastal destination because they have a strong preference for the cultural and natural environments. This, in turn, depends on the destination of country's coastal habitat abundance and marine biodiversity. We label this segment of coastal tourism, as greens. Alternatively, domestic tourists have a preference for beach characteristics, in particular beach length. This in turn depends on anthropogenic pressure, the built environment and climatic variables. For this reason we interpret this tourism segment as beach lovers. This information is, in turn, of high significance for stimulating coastal tourism demand as well as for identifying market based policy instruments with the objective to finance the conservation of environmental and cultural capital hosted at the coastal communities.

Seven metaphor clusters performance metaphors, action metaphors, communication metaphors, governance mechanism metaphors, social learning as a paradigm, social learning as a form of cognition and social learning as a wheelbarrow full of frogs, were identified from the sustainability and natural resource management (NRM) literature. Rather than seeking to define social learning rigidly, and thus limiting its potential utility to open up spaces for innovation in NR governance, social learning can be positioned in future discourse so that it holds a cluster of revealing and concealing features. This position shifts responsibility for clarity and rigour.away from the concept, useful because of its fluidity, to the user of the concept who must then articulate the way(s) in which they choose to use it. This shift is consistent with reflexive, systems practice for systemic and adaptive governance and invites practitioner responsibility rather than conceptual reification. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Some of the resultant propositions are general in the sense that they apply to environmental governance at all levels of social organization. Others are specific to the international level or to what we generally think of as international environmental governance. The basic message is that institutions are important determinants of human-environment relations but that they typically operate in conjunction with a variety of other drivers in a pattern best described as complex causation. As we move deeper into the Anthropocene, an era characterized by human domination of biophysical systems, the need to improve our understanding of environmental governance has become increasingly urgent.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Young, OR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",Oran.Young@gmail.com,,,,,,,58,52,56,1,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Despite Britain's domestic position as a world productivity leader, Japanese firms enjoyed a 70 percent productivity advantage over both British and Chinese competitors. The divergent performance of Japanese and British investments in China is explained by differences in management practice. Japanese firms had domestic experience with employment institutions similar to China's and applied labor management strategies that functioned well under these institutions. British firms lacked the institutional experience necessary to adapt management strategies to Chinese institutions.","Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Business, Singapore 119245, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Zeitz, P (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Business, Mochtar Riady Bldg 6-43,15 Kent Ridge Dr, Singapore 119245, Singapore.",zeitzp@gmail.com,"Zeitz, Peter/B-5937-2016","Zeitz, Peter/0000-0002-2845-1597",,,,,43,7,9,0,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,,,J ECON HIST,J.

We distinguish between the effects of spatial sorting based on individual heterogeneity, interactions-based productivity effects, and consumer amenities while controlling for interactions between the labor and housing market. In line with previous literature, we find a positive effect of cultural diversity on average housing prices. After controlling for spatial sorting, the effect of cultural diversity on housing prices is negative. The negative impact of cultural diversity on local housing markets is likely driven by a causal effect between the presence of immigrants and neighborhood quality that outweighs a positive effect of immigrant-induced diversity in consumption goods.","[Bakens, Jessie; Mulder, Peter; Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bakens, Jessie; Nijkamp, Peter] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Bakens, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.bakens@vu.nl; p.mulder@vu.nl; p.nijkamp@vu.nl,"Mulder, Peter/AAE-1682-2022; Mulder, Peter/R-5057-2017","Mulder, Peter/0000-0002-9578-9299; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132",,,,,41,39,40,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

This paper also provides insights concerning the convergence in efficiency across regions. The companies are divided in three regions (Europe, Asia and North America), and in the three main construction activities (Buildings, Heavy Civil and Specialty Trade). We analyze a sample of 118 companies worldwide between 1995 and 2003. Data envelopment analysis is used to estimate efficiency, and the Malmquist index is applied for the evaluation of productivity change. Both methods were complemented by bootstrapping to refine the estimates obtained. A panel data truncated regression with categorical regressors is used to explore the impact of location and activity in the efficiency levels. The results reveal that the efficiency of North American companies is higher than the European and Asian counterparts. Other important conclusion points to a convergence in efficiency levels across regions as in North America productivity remains stable, whereas in Asia and Europe productivity improves.","[Horta, I.

Design/methodology/approach - To ascertain the reaction of UK consumers to organic certification logos commonly used in the UK, this study makes use of three methods: focus groups, a consumer survey and a willingness to pay experiment (choice experiment). Findings - These three approaches reveal that UK consumers associate certain benefits with organic foods but are generally unaware of how the industry is regulated. With regards to trust of the logo, the standards they think underlie the logo and the inspection system that they think is associated with the logo, UK consumers rate the Soil Association and Organic Farmers and Growers logos more highly than the EU logo or products labelled with just the word organic. They appear willing to pay a premium for the additional assurance that these two logos provide, suggesting that where they are recognised, certification logos are valued. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, no previous studies exist on whether UK consumers recognise and trust different organic certification logos. These findings show that where such logos are recognised they can help to give some assurance to the UK consumer and this is reflected in a willingness to pay a premium for foods labelled with the Soil Association and Organic Farmers and Growers certification logos, as opposed to no logo or the (less well known) EU logo.","[Gerrard, Catherine; Smith, Laurence] Organ Res Ctr, Newbury, Berks, England; [Janssen, Meike; Hamm, Ulrich] Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, Witzenhausen, Germany; [Padel, Susanne] Organ Res Ctr, Socioecon Resource Accounting Grp, Newbury, Berks, England",Universitat Kassel,"Gerrard, C (通讯作者)，Organ Res Ctr, Newbury, Berks, England.",catherine.g@organicresearchcentre.com,"Padel, Susanne/M-7044-2017; Hamm, Ulrich/AAI-6552-2020; Hamm, Ulrich/F-7886-2013; Janssen, Meike/AAA-5767-2022","Smith, Laurence/0000-0002-9898-9288; Padel, Susanne/0000-0001-7762-5592; Hamm, Ulrich/0000-0001-7444-3451; Janssen, Meike/0000-0002-7734-9409",European Community; [207727],European Community;,"This publication was generated as part of the CERTCOST project agreement no. 207727 (www.certcost.org), with financial support from the European Community under the 7th Framework Programme.

Design/methodology/approach - A total 196 oil samples of different origin and types (corn, olive, canola and grape-seed oil) were collected randomly from Boushehr port of Iran and a total 27 oil samples were also collected from frying pans used to deep-fry local food items at different restaurants in Boushehr city. Findings - The PVs ranged from 1.38-13.74, 3.90-20.00, 0.83-2.99, 0.67-11.95 and 0.00-9.96 mequiv/kg found in refined olive oil, virgin olive oil, canola oil, grape-seed oil and corn oil, respectively. The results showed that PVs of 18.37 percent of imported oil and 62.96 percent of frying oils from restaurant exceeded the maximum acceptable limits set by Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran (ISIRI) (2-20 mequiv/kg for different types of oils). P-anisidine value ranged from 0.89-27.56 mequiv/kg in imported oils and 2.21-30.76 mequiv/kg found in frying oil from restaurants. The TOTOX value increased linearly with peroxide values and p-anisidine values. It ranged from 0.89-76.62. Originality/value - Fried foods are very common in Iranians' diet. A major portion of the edible oils in Iran are imported from other countries through Boushehr port. ISIRI has set maximum acceptable limit for PVs in different oils imported to the country. The possible effects of storage on oil oxidation are the original criteria of this research.

In a sector already characterized by a large number of standards, the authors seek to ask what CSR schemes apply to agribusiness, and how they can be systematically compared and analysed. Design/methodology/approach - Following a deductive-inductive approach the authors develop a model to compare and analyse CSR schemes based on existing studies and on coding qualitative data on 216 CSR schemes. Findings - The authors confirm that CSR standards and guidelines have entered agribusiness and identify a complex landscape of schemes that can be categorized on focus areas, scales, mechanisms, origins, types and commitment levels. Research limitations/implications - The findings contribute to conceptual and empirical research on existing models to compare and analyse CSR standards. Sampling technique and depth of analysis limit this research, but the authors offer insights into patterns of CSR standard development in agribusiness and point to important research avenues. Practical implications - These findings can help agribusiness managers to select and analyse CSR standards and other forms of CSR guidance. Social implications - Standard and guidance setting activities can be expected to have real-life effects on CSR outcomes. These effects need to be better understood by policy makers and stakeholders. The authors' meta-analysis contributes to further research on who or what influences standard development. Originality/value - Models to compare CSR schemes are rare and often focus on a small number of cases. The authors provide decision makers and researchers with insights into structural conditions through a meta-analysis of a larger number of CSR schemes.","[Poetz, Katharina] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Haas, Rainer] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Mkt & Innovat, Vienna, Austria; [Balzarova, Michaela] Lincoln Univ, Fac Commerce, Christchurch, New Zealand","University of Copenhagen; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Lincoln University - New Zealand","Poetz, K (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",kpo@foi.dk,"Balzarova, Michaela/ISS-2186-2023",,,,,,76,23,27,0,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, four types of composite flour biscuits were prepared using barley, wheat, and chickpea flour in various proportions. Wheat biscuits served as a control. Sensory characteristics of biscuits were studied by carrying out organoleptic evaluation using a nine point hedonic scale. Standard methods were used to estimate nutrient composition of biscuits. Biscuits were stored in glass jars to study their storage stability. Changes in sensory characteristics, fat acidity and free fatty acids were studied using standard methods during the storage period. Findings - Results of the study revealed that type-ill biscuits had highest score for their colour, appearance, aroma, taste, texture and overall acceptability and were liked very much by the judges. The results showed that crude protein content of all types of composite flour biscuits was significantly higher than that of the control biscuits. A non-significant difference was observed in the fat content of composite flour biscuits. The mean crude fibre and ash content of composite flour biscuits was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the control biscuits. The composite flour biscuits had a significantly lower amount of total carbohydrate and energy than the control biscuits. Type-I biscuits contained higher total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre as compared to other types of biscuits. The most acceptable type-III biscuits were stored in glass jars for a period of two months. The shelf-life study of biscuits revealed that for up to 60 days of storage the overall acceptability of biscuits was in the category of like moderately. Chemical analysis of biscuits during storage showed that fat acidity and free fatty acid content of stored biscuits increased with the advancement of the storage period. Originality/value - This research paper is original.","[Sharma, Chanchal; Punia, Darshan; Khetarpaul, Neelam] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Foods & Nutr, Hisar, Haryana, India",CCS Haryana Agricultural University,"Punia, D (通讯作者)，CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Foods & Nutr, Hisar, Haryana, India.",darshanpunia@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,14,7,7,2,55,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper explores the direct economic consequences of immigration on host nations' productivity performance at a sectoral level in two very different European countries, Spain and the UK. Whilst the UK has traditionally seen substantial immigration, for Spain the phenomenon is much more recent. Our findings from a growth accounting analysis show that migration has made a negative contribution to labour productivity growth in Spain and a negative but negligible contribution in the UK. This difference is driven by a positive impact from migrant labour quality in the UK. This finding broadly holds across all sectors, but we note considerable variation in magnitudes. Labour productivity growth has a neutral contribution from migrant labour in construction and personal services in the UK, whilst in every case in Spain the effect is negative, most strongly in agriculture. Using an econometric approach to production function estimation we observe a positive long term effect on total factor productivity from migrant workers in the UK and a negative effect in Spain. Our findings suggest that either the UK is better at assimilating migrants or is more selective in terms of who is permitted to migrate.","[Kangasniemi, Mari] Labour Inst Econ Res, Helsinki 00530, Finland; [Mas, Matilde; Serrano, Lorenzo] Ivie, Valencia, Spain; [Mas, Matilde; Serrano, Lorenzo] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Robinson, Catherine] Swansea Univ, Dept Econ, WISERD, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",University of Valencia; Swansea University,"Kangasniemi, M (通讯作者)，Labour Inst Econ Res, Pitkansillanranta 3 A, Helsinki 00530, Finland.",Mari.Kangasniemi@labour.fi,"Mas, Matilde/I-2337-2012; Serrano, Lorenzo/ABC-7372-2021","Mas, Matilde/0000-0003-1151-099X; Serrano, Lorenzo/0000-0002-9404-1457; Robinson, Catherine/0000-0001-8861-4880",,,,,33,30,34,1,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In principle, it can improve commodity producers' environmental performance, even in countries where state regulation is weak. But eco-certification will have limited environmental benefits if, as one would expect, it disproportionately selects for producers already meeting certification standards. Rigorous evaluations of the environmental effects of eco-certification in developing countries that control for selection bias are virtually nonexistent. To help fill this gap, we use detailed farm-level data to analyze the environmental impacts of organic coffee certification in central Costa Rica. We use propensity score matching to control for selection bias. We find that organic certification improves coffee growers' environmental performance. It significantly reduces chemical input use and increases adoption of some environmentally friendly management practices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Several factors were perceived as drivers of the crisis, however, its dynamics and consequences for natural resources and the environment remain largely unknown, particularly in Brazil. Combining grounded theory and case study methodologies, this research explores and contrasts the perspectives of highly knowledgeable stakeholders on how the GFC impacted sustainable forest management in the Brazilian Amazon, using the State of Para as a case study. Our findings indicate that the GFC cannot be considered as a unique phenomenon impacting SFM and that it is intimately linked to other political, social and environmental events unfolding within Brazil and at the global level. Decreased deforestation was perceived to have occurred due to restrained production, increased risk aversion, increased public awareness and enhanced government efforts towards law enforcement. The forest-based exporting segment was seen to suffer the most severe impacts of the crisis. Environmentally friendly initiatives were perceived to offer forest product differentiation in the market; while investments in non-market-oriented initiatives were restrained. Our results suggest that in times of economic crisis, forest policy-makers need to focus on both formal and informal forest economies in order to promote sustainable forest management objectives.

We also show that to find returns-to-scale at an interior point of a face is a much easier problem than to find all vertices of this face.,"[Forsund, Finn R.] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Krivonozhko, Vladimir E.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Syst Anal, Moscow, Russia; [Lychev, Andrey V.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Moscow, Russia",University of Oslo; Federal Research Center Computer Science & Control of RAS; Institute Systems Analysis of Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS),"Forsund, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway.",finn.forsund@econ.uio.no,"Krivonozhko, Vladimir Egorovich/G-8626-2014; Lychev, Andrey V./ABA-6414-2021; Krivonozhko, Vladimir/GZH-0469-2022","Lychev, Andrey V./0000-0003-1532-1141; Krivonozhko, Vladimir/0000-0003-0583-2829",,,,,26,7,8,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

I extend this insight by demonstrating that when demand elasticity and transportation cost are positively enough correlated, uniform pricing generates higher profits than mill pricing.

However, landscape-scale goals such as increased habitat connectivity are difficult to deliver with site-based prioritization metrics. Assessing alternative ways to re-connect landscapes is a complex task, requiring knowledge of how biodiversity will respond over time to alternative conservation actions, such as replanting, managing areas of natural regrowth or protecting existing habitat. It also presents computational challenges since projects must be assessed as combinations rather than individually. We investigated practical aspects of ecological metric design to achieve desired spatial configurations. Realistic, mock bids were submitted by members of the local community in a simulated tender exercise for enhanced cassowary habitat near Mission Beach, Australia. Optimization heuristics helped solve the problem within a reasonable time. Our results demonstrate that integrating whole-landscape assessment models with market-based instruments can feasibly address the inherent complexity when pursuing whole-landscape ecological benefits through cost-efficient and innovative means. Our methodology redresses asymmetries in knowledge about biodiversity in delivering conservation incentive payments, and is justified when policy goals demand a high level of rigor. (C) 2012 CSIRO.

The main tradition of western political and philosophical thought suggests that extensive economic globalization and democratization over this period should have reduced appetites for war far below their current level. This view is clearly incomplete: at best, confounding factors are at work. Here, we explore the capacity to wage war. Most fundamentally, the growing number of sovereign states has been closely associated with the spread of democracy and increasing commercial openness, as well as the number of bilateral conflicts. Trade and democracy are traditionally thought of as goods, both in themselves, and because they reduce the willingness to go to war, given the national capacity to do so, but the same factors may also have been increasing the capacity for war, and thus its frequency.","[Harrison, Mark] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Harrison, Mark] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Harrison, Mark] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wolf, Nikolaus] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",University of Warwick; University of Birmingham; Stanford University; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Harrison, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",,"; Harrison, Mark/F-5749-2010","Wolf, Nikolaus/0000-0002-7461-2910; Harrison, Mark/0000-0002-7020-9761",ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,69,29,37,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

I argue for a revision and rejection of this position in favour of realism and reasoned critique. Looking into the ontological presuppositions and considering an epistemology appropriate for ecological economics to meaningfully exist requires rejecting the form of methodological pluralism which has been advocated since the start of this journal. This means being clear about the differences in our worldview (or paradigm) from others and being aware of the substantive failures of orthodox economics in addressing reality. This paper argues for a fundamental review of the basis upon which ecological economics has been founded and in so doing seeks improved clarity as to the competing and complementary epistemologies and methodologies. In part this requires establishing serious interdisciplinary research to replace superficial transdisciplinary rhetoric. The argument places the future of ecological economics firmly amongst heterodox economic schools of thought and in ideological opposition to those supporting the existing institutional structures perpetuating a false reality of the world's social, environmental and economic systems and their operation.

Sustainable management is conceptualized with three illustrative practices that impact water quality, carbon sequestration, and soil erosion: fertilizing with a broiler litter product, expanding riparian buffers, and no-till cropping. Data for a choice experiment are collected using a mail survey of residents living near a large, unpreserved agricultural parcel in an urban-influenced area of Delaware. Results identify substantial benefits for land preservation, the use of broiler litter, and riparian buffers but not for conservation tillage. Results also suggest that the estimated household benefits of all three sustainable management practices combined are similar in magnitude to the benefits from land preservation alone. Based on model results, policy and future research may wish to examine possibilities for subsidizing sustainable management practices in urban-influenced areas as a more cost-effective means of providing benefits similar to those realized through land preservation.

A comparison of production and consumption perspectives may have relevant policy implications. We deal with the domestic technology assumption and primarily the aggregation bias that may result when calculating indirect emission using different sector aggregations in the analyses (e.g. 16, 30, 50). Extended Input Output Analysis provides analyses of the emissions embodied in domestic consumption and domestic production by considering the structure of intermediate inputs and environmental efficiency in each production sector. Our empirical findings show that different sectoral aggregation significantly biases the amount of emissions for the consumption perspective, though differently in the two countries. Italy surprisingly show consumption/production ratios around or lower than one, but in line with some major work at EU level. Our results thus suggest that special attention must be paid when interpreting the EE-IOA of country estimated amounts of embodied emissions, both in domestic final demand and those directly associated with the production sectors when the sectoral aggregation level has a low definition as considered in some recent similar studies.

This paper contributes to the literature on the child quantity-quality trade-off with new county-level evidence for Prussia in 1816, several decades before the demographic transition. We find a significant negative causal effect of education on fertility, which is robust to accounting for spatial autocorrelation. The causal effect of education is identified through exogenous variation in enrollment rates due to differences in landownership inequality. A comparison with estimates for 1849 suggests that the preference for quality relative to quantity might have increased during the first half of the nineteenth century.","[Becker, Sascha O.] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Becker, Sascha O.; Cinnirella, Francesco; Woessmann, Ludger] Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Cinnirella, Francesco; Woessmann, Ludger] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany",University of Warwick; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Becker, SO (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",s.o.becker@warwick.ac.uk; cinnirella@ifo.de; woessmann@ifo.de,"Becker, Sascha O./B-2463-2012; Cinnirella, Francesco/AAD-7443-2021","/0000-0002-0672-4865; Cinnirella, Francesco/0000-0001-8037-9230",ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,33,34,34,3,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2012,6.0,1,,,,,29,44,,10.1007/s11698-011-0061-8,0.0,,,16,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,870FK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000298654300002,0

Previous research has shown that along with the growing importance of networking, the value creation logic is also changing from traditional chains to dynamic networks. The objective of this study is to define the characteristics of value nets and to analyze the suitability of the value net as a value creation and business model in the food industry. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilizes a case research as a method and analyzes a value net from the Finnish food industry. The empirical data comprises 29 individual semi-structured interviews conducted with the personnel of four case companies. Findings - The findings of the study suggest that the value net as a business model and value creation model is also suitable for food sector companies. The value net has several characteristics that were found to be significant and useful for food companies. Moreover, food companies can obtain remarkable benefits by utilizing value nets. Practical implications - The results of the study carry implications for managers and practitioners in terms of shedding light on the value net as a value creation model and business model in the food industry. Managers need to be aware of the developments in value creation logic and recognize that value can no longer be added in a sequential chain, but the perspective should move towards networks in which value is co-created by the network actors. Originality/value - Thus far, studies on value nets have concentrated mainly on the ICT sector and there is a limited amount of research on the food industry. The food sector, therefore, offers a new empirical context in which to conduct research on value nets. Food companies are focusing more and more on value creation and networking, and the research of value nets is therefore highly relevant to the business development of the food industry.","Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business, Lappeenranta, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Kähkönen, AK (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business, Lappeenranta, Finland.",anni-kaisa.kahkonen@lut.fi,"Kähkönen, Anni-Kaisa/AAO-5434-2021","Kahkonen, Anni-Kaisa/0000-0003-0061-4830",,,,,60,17,17,5,56,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The researchers surveyed international students at one Southeastern and one Southwestern university in the USA regarding their perceptions of university foodservice, divided into six factors, i.e. service and sanitation, food dislikes, selection and taste, drinks, value, and crowding. A two-way MANOVA test was performed using SPSS Version 17.0 to identify any significant differences between the six factors, time in the USA, and universities. Findings - MANOVA testing indicated that there was a significant difference between length of time in the USA and the ratings of the service and sanitation factor. The group that had been in the USA for less than six months rated the service and sanitation factor higher than the group who had been in the USA for over a year. Research limitation/implications - Campus administrators and food service operators need to consider that the interaction and socialization provided by the on-campus dining experience may be an important step of the adaption process for international students.

Based on a comprehensive comparative analysis of net international investment position, current account and the debt level in some sectors of the economy, the paper found that there is a trend towards a divergence process instead of the intended real convergence process in the EU countries. In addition, in line with the present significant deterioration of public finance, the paper provides a comparative analysis across the individual countries in the eurozone. The study came to the conclusion that countries that lost their competitiveness had external deficits, which caused fiscal deficits, including public debt. Since the creation of the European Union these countries have ignored the rules set out in the Stability and Growth Pact, which has led to fiscal unsustainability. In order to put the economy on a balanced, sustainable and strong economic growth path in the EU countries, a credible fiscal consolidation plan, structural reforms and a proactive policy in the decision-making process, including improvement of governance on all levels of the European Union, are needed.","[Sipko, Juraj] Paneuropean Univ, Bratislava, Slovakia",Pan-European University,,jurajsipko@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,1022,1031,,,,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500096,0

Design/methodology/approach - This research used a structured questionnaire administered to a convenience sample of 216 respondents. By using logistic regression, a consumer risk coping framework incorporating marketing strategies was successfully developed to test the impact of brand and quality assurance, price reduction, availability in all stores and endorsement from an independent organization, which may not act alone but combine with each other during food purchase. Findings - The research confirms that consumers adopt risk coping strategies in time of food risk concern and their coping strategies include marketing elements such as brand and quality assurance, price reduction, availability in all stores and endorsement from an independent organization. Practical implications - The framework helps marketers to predict the effect of their marketing plan by incorporating consumers' risk coping strategies, in turn to improve consumers' purchase intention when perceived food safety risk exists.

The latter are reflected in the indigenous Buen Vivir ideology, based mainly on relations with the community, the environment and food sovereignty. The empirical analysis shows that both Buen Vivir features and factors such as income and unemployment status are significant in the models explaining SWB. Accordingly, economic policies should take into account the Buen Vivir ethos, that seems to be important for the SWB of the Ecuadorian people. This supports the conservationist political position, which focuses on protecting the environment and people's traditional livelihoods, rather than the extractive view, which regards people's welfare as merely dependent on income.

The paper investigates synergetic potentials of multiple:criteria and multiple-perspective evaluation of agricultural activity through a study of the dairy sector in Slovenia. Socioeconomic and emergy evaluation was performed on nine farm types, formulated to represent the diversity of the country's dairy sector. The results indicate larger discrepancies in the performance of the farm types when defined by socio-economic or emergy based indicators. Standard socio-economic evaluation favours larger conventional systems that are cost efficient and financially independent. Emergy analysis however, favours less productive organic farms, which show greater ability to exploit free local resources and produce less stress on the local environment. Socio-economic and emergy indicators show that small conventional farm types are the poorest performers overall. Analysis of emergy flows reveals for all farm types a high dependency on the wider socio-economic system, suggesting that within the current economic system agriculture itself has little ability to affect its sustainability. The paper suggests a complementarity in the evaluation approaches. Their joint application can improve the quality of the decision-making process in various stages of planning in agriculture and land use.

I used methods for discourse analysis (Alceste and Iramuteq) on 6308 abstracts of papers published in four journals namely Ecological Economics, theJournal of Environmental Economics and Management, Environmental Values, and Environmental and Resource Economics, published between 1989 and 2013. The results suggest that the discourses of ecological economics and environmental economics have grown closer over time. The semantic classification of co-occurrent terms used in Ecological Economics indicates increasing significance of the notions of ecosystem services and of monetary valuation. I argue that this trend is parallel to Costanza's career-path, which suggests the rise of a tacit recognition of the New Environmental Pragmatic scientific approach. I conclude with some of the implications for EE of promoting this kind of discourse to such an extent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reviews empirical studies of the innovation impact of four main types of policy instruments in two high-emitting sectors. The conclusions are threefold. (1) Policy plays a key role for the development and diffusion of environmental innovation in the studied sectors. (2) Different types of instruments promote different types of innovations: general economic instruments has primarily encouraged incremental innovation, general regulatory instruments has enforced improvements based on modular innovation, and technology-specific instruments appears to have been needed to support the development and deployment of radically new technologies. (3) All types of policy instruments face challenges in design and implementation: understanding the selection impact of the chosen instruments, implementing increasing stringency levels, committing to an appropriate scale, and safeguarding policy stability.

The method, developed for the purpose of facilitating knowledge brokerage, builds on participatory modelling approaches and applications and was used in several events involving both researchers and policy makers. The paper presents and discusses examples of how different types of participatory interaction with causal loop diagrams ('system maps') produced different insights on issues related to sustainable consumption and enabled participatory reflection and sharing of knowledge. Together, these insights support a systemic understanding of the issues and thus the method provides instruments for coping with complexity when formulating policies for sustainable consumption. Furthermore the paper discusses the ability of the method - and its limits - to connect mental models of participants through structured discussion and thus bridge boundaries between different communities.

By means of using a continuous version of the distribution dynamics approach, the key conclusions are that the reduction in disparities is very weak and, therefore, persistence is the main characteristic of the HCE distribution. In view of these findings, a preliminary attempt is made to add some insights into potentially main factors behind the HCE distribution. The results indicate that whereas per capita income is by far the main determinant, the dependency ratio and female labour participation do not play any role in explaining the HCE distribution; as for the rest of the factors studied (life expectancy, infant mortality, R&D expenditure and public HCE expenditure share), we find that their role falls somewhat in between.","[Villaverde, Jose; Maza, Adolfo; Hierro, Maria] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Villaverde, Jose] Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Limerick, Ireland",Universidad de Cantabria; University of Limerick,"Villaverde, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",villavej@unican.es; mazaaj@unican.es; hierroma@unican.es,"Maza, Adolfo/H-5265-2019","Maza, Adolfo/0000-0002-7299-3449; Villaverde, Jose/0000-0002-5393-091X",,,,,45,8,8,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The evidence, broken down to cover five sub-periods, points to a growth process resembling that of mushrooms more than that of yeast. In addition, it is argued that a yeast-like (even) pattern of productivity growth rates invites one to search for a general purpose technology at work, whereas mushroom-like progress leads one to dismiss the idea that a small number of technologies spilled over to a large number of manufacturing processes. The era under investigation coincides with the peak of the use of steam power and the infancy of electricity. The evidence makes it unlikely that steam in Sweden was a general purpose technology with the potential to affect the progress in productivity across industries in a yeast-like fashion. The rampant spread of electricity may have contributed to the yeast-like pattern in the last sub-period preceding the First World War.","Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Prado, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",,"Prado, Svante/AAS-9306-2020","Prado, Svante/0000-0002-5046-3340",,,,,66,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

More specifically, we are interested in answering the following questions. What volume of water was required for exports of agricultural and food products? How did this variable evolve over time? Which factors drove this evolution? In short, we wish to understand the impact on water resources of Spain's entry into world agriculture and food markets. Firstly, we examine virtual water trade flows in the long run. Secondly, we attempt to disentangle certain major driving forces underlying these trajectories. In order to establish the role played by trade in the final net balance of water, a Decomposition Analysis (DA) is applied. Our findings show the great pressures that the first globalisation imposed on not only domestic but also foreign water resources. Trade volumes as well as trade patterns were essential factors driving rising virtual water flows, while yield improvements contributed smoothly to moderation in the expansion of water flows.

The standard approach to testing the scope economies is to apply the cost function. However, the cost function approach often entails the difficulty of obtaining reliable data on input prices, especially the input prices of capital for higher education institutions. This paper proposes a duality approach based on the input distance function. The scope economies are tested under a necessary and sufficient condition by retrieving the costs of joint and separate production from the input distance function. We apply the testing procedure to data pertaining to 218 Japanese private universities in 1999 and 2004.

Econometric estimation of these functions typically involves factoring out one of the outputs or inputs and estimating the resulting equation using maximum likelihood methods. A problem with this approach is that the outputs or inputs that are not factored out may be correlated with the composite error term. Fernandez et al. (J Econ 98:47-79, 2000) show how to solve this so-called 'endogeneity problem' using Bayesian methods. In this paper I use the approach to estimate an output distance function and an associated index of total factor productivity (TFP) change. The TFP index is a new index that satisfies most, if not all, economically-relevant axioms from index number theory. It can also be exhaustively decomposed into a measure of technical change and various measures of efficiency change. I illustrate the methodology using state-level data on U.S. agricultural input and output quantities (no prices are needed). Results are summarized in terms of the characteristics (e.g., means) of estimated probability density functions for measures of TFP change, technical change and efficiency change.","Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"O'Donnell, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",c.odonnell@economics.uq.edu.au,,"O'DONNELL, Christopher/0000-0002-0107-7371",,,,,21,66,73,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In this paper, we use a new database to examine the industry structure and location patterns of the New York art market, which consists largely of small, independent, relatively unknown galleries. We find that Manhattan galleries are highly spatially concentrated, and that clustering reflects both agglomeration economies and preferences over location-specific amenities. New galleries are more likely to open in neighborhoods with existing gallery clusters, and proximity to other galleries increases establishment lifespan. New galleries also locate in neighborhoods with high population density and more affluent households, consistent with location models of luxury retail. The results are not consistent with the hypothesis that galleries locate in cheap, bohemian neighborhoods.","[Schuetz, Jenny; Green, Richard K.] Univ So Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Schuetz, J (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 650 Childs Way,Ralph & Goldy Lewis Hall 224, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jschuetz@price.usc.edu; richardkg@price.usc.edu,,,,,,,48,10,10,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The traditional surface irrigation system such as furrow remains the most common irrigation technique covering almost 80% of the agricultural area. The system has low water use efficiency and enhances soil erosion. If the furrow system can be modified and improved to a level that can increase the efficiency and save water, significant benefits will occur. Therefore, the objective of this study was to modify the furrow system to a furrow bed system and evaluate its water use efficiency in comparison to the drip irrigation system. The experiment was conducted in plots of 2x3 m in the Agricultural Experiment Station of Sultan Qaboos University, Oman. Each plot had either a drip irrigation system or furrow bed of 60 cm width. The plots were divided randomly using complete block design with two treatments (water source was freshwater and treated wastewater and irrigation method was furrow bed and drip) and three replications. Wheat was sown and all required parameters for soil and plants were measured. Plants were irrigated daily by drippers or every five days by furrows based on crop evapotranspiration value. From soil salinity data, it was found that both methods added some salts to the root zone with less salts found in the furrow bed method due to the heavy leaching that occurred during irrigation. However, the general data did not show a significant difference (p<0.05) in soil salinity between both irrigation method. Since treated wastewater has some extra nutrients compared to freshwater, plant growth was better with treated wastewater and almost all growth parameters were higher with treated wastewater compared to freshwater. Wheat irrigated by drip gave better biological yield compared to furrow bed irrigation. Generally, all measured data collected from both irrigation methods did not show any significant difference (p<0.05). Water productivity data gave better results with furrow bed compared to drip method. This indicates the higher efficiency of furrow bed compared to old method of furrow irrigation. However, drip irrigation could be better in reducing evaporated water whereas furrow bed is an easy method in getting good yield with low cost and high productivity.","[Al-Busaidi, A.; Al-Abri, M.; Ahmed, M.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Dept Soils Water & Agr Engn, Muscat, Oman",Sultan Qaboos University,"Al-Busaidi, A (通讯作者)，Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Dept Soils Water & Agr Engn, POB 34,Al Khoud 123, Muscat, Oman.",,"Ahmed, Mushtaque/H-3739-2019","Ahmed, Mushtaque/0000-0002-8664-7790",,,,,17,1,1,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-45-3,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1054.0,,,,,,103,110,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1054.11,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357663400011,0

This study examines whether there are any beneficial effects of magnetic treatment of different irrigation water types on water productivity and yield of cucumber. Therefore, the present work was carried out to study the response of growth, yield, and other chemical parameters of cucumber irrigated with magnetized water under greenhouse comparison with tap water. Based on results of our experiment plants irrigated with magnetic water exhibited significant increase in most vegetative features, while the magnetic treatment showed no significant effect on the irrigation water's pH or EC nor on the soil's physical characteristics. Moreover, the magnetized water treatment significantly increased yield compared to plant irrigated with tap water. On average, the increase in yield reached 28.24% compared to tap water treatment. The magnetic treatment also showed significant increase in fruit fresh weight, fruit dry weight, plant height, leaf area and leaf moisture content by 20, 3, 3, 5 and 1%, respectively, compared to tap water, whereas the fruit firmness for those treatments irrigated by magnetic water reduced significantly by more than 6.5% as compared to tap water. The overall results showed that utilization of magnetized water can lead to improved quantity of cucumber crops. Using magnetic water for irrigation could be a promising technique for agricultural improvements but more investigation is required on different crops.","Abu Dhabi Food Control Author, Div Res & Dev, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",,"Al-Shrouf, AM (通讯作者)，Abu Dhabi Food Control Author, Div Res & Dev, POB 1972, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",,,,,,,,18,3,3,2,17,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-45-3,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1054.0,,,,,,111,117,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1054.12,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357663400012,0

A company which wants to survive and successfully develop is forced to deal with development trends which are influencing the company and its outside environment. Continuous changes in micro and macro perspectives create the necessity to constantly search for ways to ensure that the company succeeds at the market. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for the analysis and evaluation of various factors necessary in order to begin the company's expansion. This task is quite difficult and it is necessary to consider and efficiently analyze factors of macro environment by utilizing PESTEL analysis. Main aim of this paper is to execute an analysis of these factors and propose general decision making framework for companies from various sectors. Firstly, analysis of determined factors will be executed by DEMATEL method in order to find out possible causal relations among the criteria. Consequently, the weights and ranking of individual PESTEL criteria will be computed by AHP method.","[Dockalikova, Iveta; Kashi, Katerina] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Dockalíková, I (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",iveta.dockalikova@vsb.cz; katerina.kashi@vsb.cz,"Dočkalíková, Iveta/Y-3743-2019; Kashi, Kateřina/I-5128-2018","Dočkalíková, Iveta/0000-0001-8206-817X; Kashi, Kateřina/0000-0003-0637-4946",,,,,10,3,3,6,42,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,334,344,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700033,0

This concept has been embedded in Czech society by the local subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNC's). CSR is a strategy whereby the corporations take responsibility for the economic, social and environmental consequences of their business activities. In so doing, they undertake to limit/eliminate the negative impact which they have on their 'stakeholders. The aim of this paper is to identify and analyze the extent to which the local subsidiaries of MNC's really do implement and utilize the CSR concept in favour of stakeholders. The local trends are characterized in terms of quantity and quality. Year by year, a growing number of businesses formulate a CSR strategy and develop CSR projects. The quality of these projects is also constantly being improved upon. They focus on disadvantaged communities, the sustainability of CSR activities, in addition to quantifying the benefits for business, as well as for society as a whole. Philanthropy continues to occupy its place in CSR projects. However, the austerity measures contained in successive budgets give greater encouragement to those practices which connect companies' core business activities with CSR activities.","[Dvorakova, Zuzana; Quigley, Martin John David] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Human Resources Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dvorakova, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Human Resources Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",zdvorak@vse.cz; martin.guigley@vse.cz,"Jimenez-Diaz, Alex Andres/JFS-8393-2023",,,,,,14,1,1,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,364,373,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700036,0

French consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for citrus fruit and the factors affecting WTP are also determined. Design/methodology/approach - An online consumer survey was conducted in France to collect data on consumer perceptions and preferences for fresh fruits from different countries. The contingent valuation method is used to estimate consumer WTP for fresh citrus fruit. A double hurdle model is used to determine the factors that have substantial impact on consumer preferences. Findings - Results show that fresh fruit from China was perceived as the lowest quality, the least safe, and the cheapest among the fruit from various countries. French consumers had the highest stated WTP for fresh fruit from France, followed by fruit from Spain. In addition, consumer WTP for country of origin varies by type of fruit. Research limitations/implications - The contingent valuation method does not require consumers to purchase the product being evaluated, which may overestimate consumer stated WTP. Practical implications - More domestically produced fresh fruit may be provided to satisfy consumer demand for fruit produced in their own countries. As second in consumer stated WTP, Spain should take advantage of the lower price high quality perceptions of their fresh fruit to gain a larger market share in France. Lower rated countries, such as China, Brazil, and Israel, need to improve consumer perception of the fruit from their countries to gain a better position in the fresh fruit market of France.

This is essential with the exponential growth of the world's population in order to achieve food security and sustainable agriculture. Both of these are main goals of the European Union Horizon 2020 program. There are a number of different ways to try to accomplish this. One way is through the accurate forecasting of the factors that highly influence plant growth and production. Such factors are typically climatic and edaphologic factors. This is particularly true today because of the impending impacts of climate change. This phenomenon leads to abrupt climatic and edaphologic changes which alter the normal function of the plant's ecological cycles. Knowing and understanding present climatic and edaphologic conditions and how those might change in the future, allows for effective and efficient management of agricultural and other natural ecosystems. In this paper, we present the conceptual model of how this is intended to be accomplished. Specifically in this study, models are developed to help provide valuable information regarding the climatic and edaphologic changes for an agricultural and forested ecosystem, specifically a vineyard and a pine stand. A system will be developed that will be composed of a main station and wireless sensors. One station will be placed in each study site with a number of sensors that will be embedded with probes that will record the abiotic factors of interest on a continuous daily basis. These measurements will be more frequent during the growing season. To record all necessary abiotic factors, the sensors will be placed above and below the ground adjacent to the plants of interest. The time-series data to be recorded will be used afterwards for the forecasting analysis that will be done based on non-linear physical models ( specifically chaos theory) and neural networks. These models will forecast the short-term climatic and edaphologic changes. In addition, the major biotic factors for growth and production at the studied sites will be measured and combined with the abiotic factors. This will help in the understanding of how the forecast climatic and edaphologic changes can affect the future productivity of the vineyards and the sustainability of the pine forests. This will enable viticulturists and forest managers to be proactive and take the appropriate corrective management actions to improve production and/or quality.","[Iakovoglou, V.; Zaimes, G.

Using the Gibbs sampler we can simulate the posterior probability distribution without having to express its density in the analytical form. If we can express the posterior distribution of individual parameters estimated using the conditional probability distributions, then we can gradually generate values of the individual parameters from the conditional distributions. It is the indirect way to simulate the posterior distribution of cluster, without analytical calculation and explicit expression of the probability density. This process was a great contribution to the development of the present Bayesian statistical methods. The paper aims at explaining the usage of the Gibbs sampler and at the same time introducing various methods of obtaining the required information from simulations.

It ascertains the parental risk reduction behaviour operationalised as parental additional willingness to pay (aWTP) for special child products. It investigates the interrelationships between parental risk perceptions and risk reduction behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - Altogether, 771 questionnaires were sent to 17 day-care centres in Lower Saxony, Germany. A total of 238 questionnaires were completed. The Perceived Food Risk Index was used to identify the main dimensions of parental risk perception of mycotoxins. Open and closed questions measured aWTP for risk reduction and parental risk estimates. Findings - The respondents believed that mycotoxins posed a moderate health risk for children in Germany. However, parental risk assessment was found to be subjected to an optimistic bias. Nevertheless, the parents were willing to pay a premium to protect their children's health against mycotoxins. Parental risk perception of mycotoxins could be described by two dimensions named Dread and Control. Dread and Control predicted aWTP for risk reduction as well as being involved in the genesis of optimistic bias. Research limitations/implications - Information regarding mycotoxins provided in the questionnaire probably influenced parental responses. This limits the generalisation of the findings. Originality/value - This research provides initial findings regarding parental risk perceptions of mycotoxins and its impact on risk reduction behaviour.

Grain soaking in hulling and cooking processes for the purpose of pericarp softening and water absorption is an ordinary practice. The rate of grain-water absorption varies with soaking. Water temperature affects the state of water absorption. Experiments indicated that the water absorption process of seeds consists of two phases. The rate of water absorption of the initial and secondary phases is high and low respectively. The main problem of all existing mathematical models for water absorption, such as the Peleg model, is that none of them assess for the second phase. Therefore, in this study the viscoelastic model, which is able to analyze water absorption in the second phase for crops, was used to predict the water absorption of beans during soaking. The model was carried out to predict the moisture content of three cultivars of bean ('Talash', 'Sadri' and 'Mahali Khomein'). The experiments were carried out at three temperatures (5, 25 and 45 degrees C) in triplicate using distilled water. The amount of water absorption by various seeds was determined 5, 10, 15, 30 min and one hour after immersion. The tests were followed at intervals of one hour for gelatinized seeds. The viscoelastic and Peleg models of moisture absorption were fitted to experimental data. Constants of both models were determined by data-fitting using MATLAB software for each sample at each temperature. To compare the viscoelastic model to the Peleg model, three parameters: the coefficient of determination (R-2), chi-square (chi(2)) and root mean square error (RMSE), were used. The results showed that the viscoelastic model was sufficiently accurate to predict the moisture content of the beans during soaking and there was no significant difference between the two models (P<0.05).","[Shafaei, S.

We find that urban proximity significantly enhances efficiency in the Eastern region, while its effect is lower and less significant for the Central region and not significant at all for the Western region. In addition, urban effects vary across the urban hierarchy. We find that provincial-level cities have a deteriorating impact on technical efficiency, while lower-level cities enhance technical efficiency in most regions.

However, the planting and maintenance of urban trees come at a cost. We estimate the discounted cost of net carbon reductions associated with planting and caring for street trees in New York City (NYC) over 50-and 100-year horizons. Depending on the species planted, the cost of reducing carbon, averaged across planting locations, ranges from $3133 to $8888 per tonne carbon (tC), which is higher than current cost estimates of forest-based carbon sequestration. The London plane tree is the most cost-effective species because of its long life span and large canopy, and the marginal cost of carbon reduction for the species ranges from $1553 to $7396/tC across planting locations. The boroughs of Staten Island and Queens have planting locations with the lowest average costs of carbon reduction ($2657/tC and $2755/tC, respectively), resulting from greater reductions in energy consumption in nearby buildings, which have fewer stories and more residential use than buildings in the other boroughs.

However, scientific results cannot be applied straightforwardly in practical decision making. We deploy Kant's term power of judgment - the human capacity to apply general insights to specific, contingent situations - to show that this problem is systematic rather than coincidental: decision making requires the power of judgment to make use of scientific knowledge. Power of judgment, in turns, can be supported by heuristics. Against this background, we focus on sustainability politics and outline a heuristic for framing and analyzing sustainability problems. Because time is a key factor in relation to sustainability we distinguish three distinct concepts of time and argue that the economic concepts of stocks and institutions can be used to foster power of judgment with respect to these time concepts. Based on these concepts, the heuristic serves to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and practical decision making in sustainability politics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Descriptive analysis shows that even with easy-to-adopt conservation practices such as contour cultivation, we do not observe high rates of adoption without subsidy or monetary incentives. Multivariate analysis shows that households with larger plots, more fertile land and male and younger decision makers are more likely to use contour cultivation. Households relying more heavily on agricultural income tend to continue to use contour cultivation. The findings suggest that the trends in China's agriculture sector ( increasing off-farm employment, aging and more female farmers on farm) are not conducive to the use of soil conservation practices.

The U.S. electricity generation sector faces uncertainties that include future demand, the costs of supply, and the effects of regulation policies. National policies that aim to promote clean energy sources may have different impacts for different areas of the country, so it is important to understand the regional effects in addition to the larger national picture. The primary purpose of this paper is to shed some light on the uncertainties associated with the outcomes of possible regulations. The study does not intend to make predictions of the probability or direction of environmental policy in the U.S. Rather, we examine a number of different scenarios and explore their possible impacts on the future of energy system. We focus on future projections for electricity generation mix, electricity costs, emissions and emissions abatement costs under different scenarios. We have examined the key regulations through analyzing various assumptions using the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) model and the Environmental Protection Agency's Nine Region MARKAL Database (EPAUS9r). We have analyzed how command-and-control regulations and market-based environmental policy approaches could change the mix of fuels used for electricity generation, the amount of CO2 emissions, and the cost of electricity in different parts of the U.S. In particular, we explore how some proposed features of different policies designs affect those outcomes and identify underlying causes of uncertainty about such outcomes. The analyzed policies lead to 6-25% reduction in total CO2 emissions by 2035. The policies also result in modest increases on electricity costs nationally, but this masks a wide variety of effects across regions. The relationship between the policy's effects on costs depends on the design of the policy, regional resource endowments, and the existing generation mix of the region. Generally, the regions with existing high electricity marginal costs would tend to see only minor costs increases and the regions with low electricity marginal costs would see substantial costs increases. Modeling results illustrate that different regions have different preferences in environmental regulations policies and design.

While the scheme is represented as the most efficient and cost effective means of reducing emissions, the government has also committed to ensuring equity in burden sharing, particularly through the use of household compensation methods and by minimising the disadvantages faced by energy-intensive trade-exposed industries thereby committing to these industries' continued developments. Treasury modelling used to determine the required level of household compensation has remained relatively uncontested. We question the conclusion of equity in burden sharing on the basis of this modelling. The modelling reflects fairly standard conventional economic theory in terms of market structures, the determination of prices and outputs, and the characterisation of factor markets. The behavioural assumptions overstate the consumer and producer substitution possibilities, failing to consider the possibility of technical reswitching, and ignore the impact that oligopolistic market structures would have on price increases and infrastructure investment. The full ramifications of compensation for overall government expenditure and therefore the capacity of the government to continue to fund a range of elements of the social wage, the potential for unemployment and transitioning workers to less carbon-intensive industries, are also overlooked.

Since the presence of a cdf is frequently encountered in the likelihood-based analysis with limited-dependent and qualitative variables as elegantly shown in the classic book of Maddala (Limited-dependent and qualitative variables in econometrics. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1983), the proposed methodology is useful in the framework of the stochastic frontier analysis. We apply the formula to the maximum likelihood estimation of the SFA models with a censored dependent variable. The simulations show that the finite sample performance of the maximum likelihood estimator of the censored SFA model is very promising.

For the first time for China, the roles of rural transformation and technical progress are examined whilst structural breaks are taken into account. We employ Bai and Perron (Econometrica 66:47-68, 1998; J Appl Econom 18:1-22, 2003a; Econom J 6:72-78, 2003b) methods which allow for multiple structural breaks at unknown dates and can be applied for both pure and partial structural changes. We also evaluate the robustness of our results by employing alternative production functions and two capital series. Two structural breaks near the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989 and the implementation of further reforms and opening-up measures in 1995 were identified for both capital series. We found the contribution of rural transformation to total factor productivity to be significant and positive across all regimes.

One option is to improve material efficiency reducing the amount of metal required to meet services. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to explore why opportunities to improve material efficiency through upstream measures such as yield improvement and lightweighting might remain underexploited by industry. Established input-output techniques are applied to the GTAP 7 multi-regional input-output model to quantify the incentives for companies in key steel-using sectors (such as property developers and automotive companies) to seek opportunities to improve material efficiency in their upstream supply chains under different short-run carbon price scenarios. Because of the underlying assumptions, the incentives are interpreted as overestimates. The principal result of the paper is that these generous estimates of the incentives for material efficiency caused by a carbon price are offset by the disincentives to material efficiency caused by labour taxes. Reliance on a carbon price alone to deliver material efficiency would therefore be misguided and additional policy interventions to support material efficiency should be considered.

This paper elaborates a transaction costs analysis framework to examine the evolution and performance of water markets and allocation policy reforms. This analysis rests on three pillars: i) a synthesis of three theoretical traditions of institutional analysis (Williamson, North, and Ostrom) often considered independently; ii) a framework to examine the types and interactions of transaction costs in market-based water allocation over time; and iii) an illustrative analysis of three large river basins - the Colorado, Columbia and Murray-Darling - with varying levels of success in market-based water policy reforms. The resulting framework accounts for water's complexity as an economic good. This framework and the case studies lead to the identification of several policy implications including the need for: a multiphase sequencing of reform, strategic investment in institutional transition costs, and institutional choices that preserve future flexibility to adjust water rights and diversion limits to manage social and environmental externalities.

The analysis is composed of two parts. First, an amenity value threshold for continued public access to the Estate was estimated. Based on a stated value of the Estate (i.e. 700 pound million) and assuming a discount rate of 3.5% the Estate should never have been considered for sale. However, assuming a discount rate of 5% then the associated critical amenity value was estimated to be approximately 5 pound million. Second, travel cost methods were employed to value public access to the Forest of Dean as a proxy for the Estate. An on-site survey was conducted that yielded estimates of consumer surplus that exceed the critical amenity value of the Estate by two orders of magnitude even when we employ a discount rate above that typically used in public policy decision making. Therefore, we conclude that the policy to divest the Estate for 700 pound million was not 'a good deal' and as such the resulting policy reversal was an economically sensible decision.

Areas in the landing zone that are to be avoided are assigned weights and collateral damage risk is calculated as the weighted integral of the bivariate normal distribution over the undesirable areas in the scene. Optimum location of a drop consists of determining the angle of aircraft approach and (x, y) target. A series of non-linear optimization algorithms is presented along with their relative success in finding the optimal location in the airdrop problem. Specifically, two algorithms which leverage off of the bivariate normal probability distribution nature of airdrops are demonstrated to outperform other techniques in terms of speed and accuracy. The effects of changing airdrop parameters on expected collateral damage are discussed to lend advice to airdrop planners.

During the nineteenth and early twentieth century, many banks operated under liability rules which obligated shareholders to bear larger costs of bank insolvency in the form of contingent, or even unlimited, liability. This article examines the empirical relationship between the size of banks' contingent liability and their risk-taking behaviour using data on British banks from 1878 to 1912. We find that banks with more contingent liability appear to have taken less risk. We also find evidence that the risk-reducing effects of contingent liability were larger for banks with higher leverage, suggesting that contingent capital mitigated the moral hazard problem at banks.","[Grossman, Richard S.; Imai, Masami] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Grossman, Richard S.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Wesleyan University; Harvard University,"Grossman, RS (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",,,,,,,,48,18,18,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors focus on some key determinants of farmers' contracting choices using milk producer survey data. Different semi parametric and semi non parametric discrete choice models are applied to investigate the type of contracts, duration, number of contractors, incentives provided in the contract and business history of farmers and buyers. Findings - Main results confirm that contract-specific investment is a strong predictor explaining contract choice and contract design. Although trust is an important factor, the authors' estimations however report some counterintuitive results. Farm size is also significantly associated with contracts and contractual arrangements. Vulnerability to opportunistic behaviour also depends on partner change switching costs and farmers' bargaining power.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a combination of literature review, Delphi approach and case study research, the paper examines part of the meat supply chain that consists of three industrial slaughterhouses, two cold rooms, three factories and more than 20 supermarkets and it then presents a framework to assess the performance of the industry in the region. Findings - The methodology suggests indices for strategic and tactical levels in a meat industry as a case study. The proposed framework for the performance measurement of the chain was applied in strategic and tactical levels in which the ranking of indices are also among the achievements of this study. Results show that there are six main criteria required to measure the meat industry's performance.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop and optimize the process variables for blended nectar based upon papaya (Carica papaya) and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). Design/methodology/approach - The nectar based upon papaya and bottle gourd was prepared with varying levels of papaya/bottle gourd juice concentration (1.5:1-4:1), sugar concentration (12-21 per cent), citric acid concentration (0.30-0.50 per cent) and optimized using response surface methodology. A central composite rotatable design (CCRD) with three levels for three independent variables was used for optimization studies. The responses measured were pH, TA, TSS, flavor and taste of the developed nectar. Responses were numerically optimized in combination with design expert software. Findings - The models developed for all responses were significant without significant lack of fit. Papaya/bottle gourd juice concentration ratio, sugar concentration and citric acid level were optimized at 2.47:1, 20.95 and 0.30 per cent, respectively, in order to obtain a pH, titrable acidity and TSS of 3.99, 0.348 and 20.80, respectively, with hedonic scale sensory ratings of 7.43 and 7.18 for flavor and taste, respectively, of the nectar. Practical implications - The commercial production of such nectar using these optimized conditions may add new dimension to the health beverage industry. Social implications - Development of such health-promoting mixed fruit nectars will boost demand of healthy beverage foods in society. Originality/value - The product can be developed successfully using these optimized conditions. Since both papaya and bottle gourd have beneficial nutritional and medicinal properties, the development of nectar using these fruits with high sensory acceptance can prove a boon for market promoting health foods.","[Yadav, Baljeet S.; Yadav, Ritika B.; Narang, Mohit K.] Chaudhary Devi Lal Univ, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Sirsa, India",Chaudhary Devi Lal University,"Yadav, BS (通讯作者)，Chaudhary Devi Lal Univ, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Sirsa, India.",baljeetsingh.y@gmail.com,"Yadav, Ritika B/IAR-9693-2023","Yadav, Ritika B/0000-0002-9704-6309; Yadav, Baljeet/0000-0003-1503-3473",,,,,28,3,4,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Our research sheds light on two central issues regarding employment-contingent health insurance: whether such insurance locks people who experience a health shock into remaining at work; and whether it puts people at risk for insurance loss upon the onset of illness, because health shocks pose challenges to continued employment. We study how men's dependence on their own employer for health insurance affects labor supply responses and health insurance coverage following a health shock. We use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) surveys from 1996 through 2008 to observe employment and health insurance status at interviews 2 years apart, and whether a health shock occurred in the intervening period between the interviews. All employed married men with health insurance either through their own employer or their spouse's employer, interviewed in at least two consecutive HRS waves with non-missing data on employment, insurance, health, demographic, and other variables, and under age 64 at the second interview are included in the study sample. We then limited the sample to men who were initially healthy. Our analytical sample consisted of 1,582 men of whom 1,379 had ECHI at the first interview, while 203 were covered by their spouse's employer. Hospitalization affected 209 men with ECHI and 36 men with spouse insurance. A new disease diagnosis was reported by 103 men with ECHI and 22 men with other insurance. There were 171 men with ECHI and 25 men with spouse employer insurance who had a self-reported health decline. Labor supply response differences associated with ECHI-with men with health shocks and ECHI more likely to continue working-appear to be driven by specific types of health shocks associated with future higher health care costs but not with immediate increases in morbidity that limit continued employment. Men with ECHI who have a self-reported health decline are significantly more likely to lose health insurance than men with insurance through a spouse. With the passage of health care reform, the tendency of men with ECHI as opposed to other sources of insurance to remain employed following a health shock may be diminished, along with the likelihood of losing health insurance.","[Bradley, Cathy J.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Healthcare Policy & Res, Massey Canc Ctr, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Neumark, David; Motika, Meryl] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Neumark, David] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neumark, David] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Virginia Commonwealth University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Bradley, CJ (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Healthcare Policy & Res, Massey Canc Ctr, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",cjbradley@vcu.edu; dneumark@uci.edu; mmotika@uci.edu,,,"NCI NIH HHS [R01-CA122145, R01 CA122145] Funding Source: Medline",NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),,,11,19,22,3,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

We examine contingent valuation studies that implemented scope tests to determine what they imply about the adequacy of response to scope. We find that in the vast majority of studies, the magnitude of response cannot be assessed. Only three studies permit such an assessment: Samples and Hollyer (1990), Diamond et al. (1993) and Chapman et al. (2009). The first two papers find that responses to their surveys did not vary adequately with scope. The third study passed the standard scope test, but we show that the magnitude of response in this study is inadequate by straightforward methods of assessment and cannot be explained by diminishing marginal utility or substitution. More research is needed on this issue, including wider application of adding-up tests on incremental parts, as well as the development of other methods that permit an assessment of the magnitude of response or other tests of rationality.

In a panel of 211 European regions observed from 1980 to 2005, the estimated speed of convergence is substantially higher, on average, than the legendary 2 percent found in many cross-section studies.

Depending on the seller's business model, some remain free in the long run, while others switch to pay mode at some point in time. I characterize the relation between buyers and a new service seller when the former are uncertain about the latter's business model and need to incur a one-time sunk cost before enjoying the new service. I derive a natural signaling equilibrium where the seller plays a lock-in-and-switch strategy, while buyers play a wait-and-see strategy. Specifically, a high-cost seller starts by pricing at zero and waits for a sufficient number of consumers to adopt the new service, at which point the seller switches to pay mode. In this gradual separation equilibrium, the signal is given not by the price level (which always starts at zero) but rather by the duration of the introductory offer. Finally, I show the equilibrium entails diffusion even though consumers are identical and equally aware of the new service's existence.","[Cabral, Luis] New York Univ, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Cabral, Luis] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Cabral, Luis] CEPR, London, England",New York University; New York University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Cabral, L (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",lcabral@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,47,4,5,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Official energy statistics show that the amount of energy consumed in service industries is quite small, and this is explained in the theoretical literature by the presumed intangibility of services. Our hypothesis, however, is that the energy consumed by services has been underestimated. After identifying and analyzing the full range of sources of energy consumption in service industries, we show that official energy statistics account for only a part of this consumption. Our work is based on a thorough rereading of the economics literature on services (especially concerning the definition of services and the specificities of the service provision process), done in light of our knowledge about energy consumption. Eventually, using the 2007 French national transportation and travel survey, we estimate one of the overlooked sources of energy consumption, the one pertaining to mobility. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We depart from the pollution haven hypothesis and the resource curse. The pollution haven hypothesis states that multinational enterprises move their dirty operations to countries with weak environmental regulation. The resource curse holds that economic growth in countries abundant in natural resources is reduced. We find that more polluting firms are relatively more often located in countries with weak environmental regulation. However, multinational enterprises do not have a significant impact on environmental regulation in the host country. It appears that it is mainly the quality of institutions that drives both the pollution haven and the resource curse. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose an empirical study was carried out in two National Parks of Northern Greece. Three scenarios were proposed differing in the management options (regulatory, market-based and community-based scenarios) and the payment mechanism. Our empirical results show that social capital variables, especially social norms and social trust, have a strong influence both on the decision of individuals to pay and the specific amount stated. Specifically, we find that social norms have a positive influence for the willingness to pay (WTP) of individuals of a state-tax and an entrance fee (regulatory and market-based scenario respectively). Furthermore, social trust has a positive impact for the WTP through an entrance fee and a community tax (market-based and community-based scenario respectively). We also find a higher WTP of individuals towards the market based scenario where participation of citizens is higher compared to the current management status. Concerning the impact of demographic factors, we find that income does not influence the specific amount stated by individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A network of Anglo-Scandinavian shippers and traders, members of a merchant elite, controlled important places on river routes. That Lincolnshire was an area of light manorialization and many sokemen had an invigorating effect on its economy.

In competitive environments, firms make strategic decisions that not only depend on the features of the market, but also on their beliefs regarding the reactions of their rivals. Structurally modeling these interactions requires formulating and estimating a discrete game, a task which, until recently, was considered intractable. Fortunately, two-step estimation methods have cracked the problem, fueling a growing literature in both marketing and economics that tackles a host of issues from the optimal design of ATM networks to the choice of pricing strategy. However, most existing methods have focused on only the discrete choice of actions, ignoring a wealth of information contained in post-choice outcome data and severely limiting the scope for performing informative counterfactuals or identifying the deep structural parameters that drive strategic decisions. The goal of this paper is to provide a method for incorporating post-choice outcome data into static discrete games of incomplete information. In particular, our estimation approach adds a selection correction to the two-step games approach, allowing the researcher to use revenue data, for example, to recover the costs associated with alternative actions. Alternatively, a researcher might use R&D expenses to back out the returns to innovation.","[Ellickson, Paul B.; Misra, Sanjog] Univ Rochester, William E Simon Sch Business Adm, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Misra, S (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, William E Simon Sch Business Adm, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",paul.ellickson@simon.rochester.edu; misra@simon.rochester.edu,,,,,,,44,10,16,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We find that a time lag between the announcement and the implementation of an emissions quota induces an increase in emissions in the period between the policy's announcement and implementation. Since a binding constraint on emissions restricts energy use during the implementation phase, more of the resources must be extracted outside of it. We call this the abundance effect. In the case of multiple resources that differ in their pollution intensity, a second channel emerges: since cleaner sources are relatively more valuable when the policy is implemented, it is optimal to conserve them before the cap is enforced. This ordering effect tends to induce a switch to dirtier resources before the policy is implemented, compounding the increase in emissions via the abundance channel. Using the announcement lag in Title IV of the 1990 CAAA as a case study we are able to empirically show that the abundance effect and ordering effect are both statistically and economically significant. We discuss a number of alternative policy options to deal with these undesirable side effects of policy announcements. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We use these new data, along with other evidence on GDP per capita, air fares, exchange rates, and indexes of technological change in the travel industry, in an attempt to explain the long-term rise in overseas travel.","[Dupont, Brandon] Western Washington Univ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Gandhi, Alka] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Weiss, Thomas] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Weiss, Thomas] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Western Washington University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Kansas; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Dupont, B (通讯作者)，Western Washington Univ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",,,"Dupont, Brandon/0000-0001-7213-8066",,,,,49,9,9,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Yet food production, itself an ecosystem service, is critical to the survival of humanity and dominates much of the world's terrestrial and marine environments. There is a need to address the under-estimation of ecosystem services in farmland and develop concepts, policies and methods to evaluate them. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework and consult with agro-industry experts to identify the impacts of different agricultural practices on ecosystem services. We also identify the ecosystem services crucial to the long term functioning of agroecosystems in Australia. Our results demonstrate that the regulating ecosystem services are the most relevant to all of the agriculture sectors we examined. Most concern is the recognised impact that the agricultural sector has had on ecosystem services provision. Results from our survey indicate that the agricultural sector in Australia negatively impacts on all regulating and supporting ecosystem services, despite the importance of these services in the process of agricultural production. We conclude with various policy arguments for better and more explicit recognition of ecosystem services in the management of agroecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We adapt the models developed by Kumbhakar and Hjalmarsson (J Appl Econom 10:33-47, 1995) and Kumbhakar and Heshmati (Am J Agric Econ 77:660-674, 1995), making the same distinction between persistent and residual inefficiency, but in our case across sub-companies comprising a firm, rather than over time. The proposed model is important in a regulatory context, where datasets with a sub-company structure are commonplace, and regulators are interested in identifying and eliminating both persistent and sub-company varying inefficiency. Further, as regulators often have to work with small cross-sections, the utilisation of sub-company data can be seen as an additional means of expanding cross-sectional datasets for efficiency estimation. Using an international dataset of rail infrastructure managers we demonstrate the possibility of separating firm inefficiency into its persistent and sub-company varying components. The empirical illustration highlights the danger that failure to allow for the dual-level nature of inefficiency may cause overall firm inefficiency to be underestimated.","[Smith, Andrew S.

Furthermore, the poorer a country, measured in terms of capital stock at a given point in time, the later it should switch to the renewable substitute, and the more likely it will be unsustainable.

Their main purpose reduces to the attempt to attract the attention of new customers and possible investors in order to raise sales and improve profits. We approach ethics in corporation as a discipline with practical and measurable outputs. To arrive to quantifiable variables we link the company ethics with measurable and attainable goals and suggest to employ the approach of Kaplan and Norton (1992), who proposed the definition of key performance indicators to measure vaguely defined phenomena. Linking with the experience of our German partners, our paper contributes to current stream of literature in highlighting pragmatic ethics as an important part of corporate social responsibility.

Design/methodology/approach - A revealed preference approach is adopted, using weekly scanner sales panel data made available by Nielsen and the Swedish Retail Institute (HUI). The pricing of labelled coffee is studied over the 2005-2008 period. Hedonic estimates are obtained for what consumers pay for different product characteristics. Findings - Results point to a considerable premium of 38 percent to be paid for Fair Trade labelled coffee in Sweden, underlining high public awareness reflected in the retailers' pricing policy. This estimate is clearly higher than numbers obtained in earlier studies focusing on Italy and the UK. Originality/value - The study provides information on the existing price differences between labelled and conventional coffee. Its main contribution is the analysis of previously unavailable data material. Based on the obtained estimates, it is possible to identify the relative impact on the market price of the different coffee attributes. The calculations provide a tool for further policy-relevant analysis of the market in Sweden, but are also useful from an EU-wide point of view.

Design/methodology/approach - A deductive approach of reasoning was employed to address the positivism research philosophy through the survey research strategy. Quantitative data were collected from 264 potential Vietnamese consumers through a self-administered structured questionnaire and analysed using frequencies, descriptive statistics, chi squared test, principal components analysis, t-tests and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Findings - Potential Vietnamese consumers' willingness to purchase organic foods was linked positively to health and safety whilst the females appreciated their nutritional value. Environmental and sustainability concerns did not influence purchasing decisions. Because of their perceived superior quality, potential Vietnamese consumers were not price sensitive towards organic foods. Research limitations/implications - This study lacks the qualitative depth and the employment of quota sampling technique to select respondents may impact external validity. Practical implications - The findings can benefit organic foods sellers and retailers in developing appropriate sales and marketing strategies by differentiating between organic foods and conventional foods to target and attract potential Vietnamese consumers, and to expand the existing organic foods market in Vietnam. Originality/value - The present paper supplements the knowledge gap by identifying and analysing potential Vietnamese consumers' perceptions of organic foods in order to assist organic foods sellers and retailers to understand potential Vietnamese consumers and expand their organic foods market in Vietnam.","[Ineson, Elizabeth M.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [Yap, Matthew H.

The usual willingness-to-pay measure was replaced by the willingness-to-stay (WTS) longer on the island for bird-watching, given changes in the site attributes. Results of the valuation study were presented to stakeholders and policy-makers using an innovative method. In particular, CM results were incorporated into a modeling tool which simulated the impact of alternative policy packages. For each selected scenario, users were able to understand birders' WTS and its impact on the local economy. The tool provided a fast and clear way of communicating relevant information, resulting in a more informed and inclusive deliberative process. Furthermore, we were able to see how results were used by the final users and came to the conclusion that local managers had preconceived ideas which did not match birders' preferences. This work led to a shift regarding prior beliefs about the relevance of bird-watching activities on the local economy as well as management actions likely to promote it The underlying participatory approach was found to be an essential feature for the success of this science and policy interaction.

Due to the gendered nature of climate change as an issue, it is important to study the representation of women in the negotiations and to examine its normative and functional implications. Theoretically, I propose to look at institutional, socioeconomic, and cultural factors as potential explanations for the variation in the proportion of women in state delegations across countries. I examine this variation by drawing on a dataset containing all member state delegations to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations from 1995 to 2011. The theoretical arguments are then tested on these data using a fractional probit model. This is the first comparative study of women's descriptive representation in international environmental negotiations. It contributes to our understanding of the variation in women's representation both over time and across countries. In particular, I find that women's representation is higher in countries that enjoy a higher level of development and a higher degree of political gender equality. The effects of other institutional and socioeconomic factors such as the level of democracy or gender-equal development remain statistically insignificant. Cultural factors measured by regional proxies show that Eastern Europe and Latin America are positively and the Middle East negatively linked with women's descriptive representation in delegations.","Univ Bremen, BIGSSS, D-28334 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Kruse, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, BIGSSS, POB 330440, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.",jkruse@bigsss.uni-bremen.de,"Kruse, Johannes/E-1129-2013","Kruse, Johannes/0000-0002-6666-9335",,,,,58,17,18,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This study examines whether environmental behaviours, beliefs and attitudes are associated with space heating energy use in the UK in order to test for evidence of a green hypocrisy. In the UK, the largest proportion of household energy use is for space heating. We find that environmental behaviours are negatively correlated with heating expenditures, while environmentally friendly attitudes and perceptions are not associated with lower heating expenditure. Further, the effect of these attitudes and behaviours does not change as income increase. There seems to be little evidence of a green hypocrisy amongst the UK public with respect to space heating.

However, unobserved inefficiency heterogeneity has been little explored. In this work, we propose to capture it through a random parameter which may affect the location, scale, or both parameters of a truncated normal inefficiency distribution using a Bayesian approach. Our findings using two real data sets, suggest that the inclusion of a random parameter in the inefficiency distribution is able to capture latent heterogeneity and can be used to validate the suitability of observed covariates to distinguish heterogeneity from inefficiency. Relevant effects are also found on separating and shrinking individual posterior efficiency distributions when heterogeneity affects the location and scale parameters of the one-sided error distribution, and consequently affecting the estimated mean efficiency scores and rankings. In particular, including heterogeneity simultaneously in both parameters of the inefficiency distribution in models that satisfy the scaling property leads to a decrease in the uncertainty around the mean scores and less overlapping of the posterior efficiency distributions, which provides both more reliable efficiency scores and rankings.","[Galan, Jorge E.; Veiga, Helena; Wiper, Michael P.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Galan, Jorge E.; Veiga, Helena; Wiper, Michael P.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Inst Flores de Lemus, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Veiga, Helena; Wiper, Michael P.] BRU UNIDE, P-1600083 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Galán, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, C Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",jegalan@est-econ.uc3m.es,"Wiper, Michael/Y-9643-2019; Veiga, Helena V/H-2919-2015","Wiper, Michael/0000-0002-4367-7519; Veiga, Helena V/0000-0002-6810-7950; Galan, Jorge/0000-0001-5022-7842; WIPER, MICHAEL PETER/0000-0002-6316-397X",,,,,39,17,18,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We find that organizational workers increase total factor productivity and improve the profitability of high-productivity firms. R&D workers account for a large share of intangible capital; however, the returns to R&D are low. Investments in organizational competence are more likely to result in more rapid productivity growth.

Although promoting bilateral environmental convergence is a stated priority, cooperation between the EU and Brazil in this policy field is largely under-researched, raising interesting questions as to whether the current state of play could support EU claims for the normative orientation of its external environmental policy. Through an analysis of partnership activities in the fields of deforestation and biofuels, we suggest that while normative intentions may be regarded as a motivating force, critically viewing EU foreign environmental policy through a 'soft imperialism' lens could offer a more holistic understanding of the current state of bilateral cooperation. While the normative power thesis can be substantiated with regard to deforestation, we argue that by erecting barriers to shield its domestic biofuels production, the EU is placing trade competitiveness and economic growth above its normative aspirations. Subsequently, the partial adoption of sustainable development as an EU norm leads to policy incoherence and contradictory actions.","[Afionis, Stavros; Stringer, Lindsay C.] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Afionis, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",S.Afionis@leeds.ac.uk,"Afionis, Stavros/AES-5062-2022","Stringer, Lindsay/0000-0003-0017-1654; Afionis, Stavros/0000-0002-0434-5108",ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,82,10,11,4,57,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

After determining the extent of the accident impact in the different countries,! find that neither the Three Mile Island (TMI) nor the Lucens accidents had a worldwide negative effect on construction starts, while Chernobyl did. Three Mile Island had a lasting impact in the United States, however. I show that the effect of Chernobyl wore off in certain geographical clusters, after ten to thirty years. An accident is likely to have a negative and long lasting impact in the country where it happened, and possibly in countries affected by the direct consequences. I find that nuclear capacity enlargement shows a significant lock-in effect, but it was also driven by primary energy consumption and energy security considerations in the past five decades.

Nowadays, the most prominent representatives are nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) and parametric stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), both introduced in the late 1970s. Researchers have been attempting to develop a method which combines the virtues-both nonparametric and stochastic-of these oldies. The recently introduced Stochastic non-smooth envelopment of data (StoNED) by Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (J Prod Anal 38(1):11-28, 2012) is such a promising method. This paper compares the StoNED method with the two oldies DEA and SFA and extends the initial Monte Carlo simulation of Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (J Prod Anal 38(1):11-28, 2012) in several directions. We show, among others, that, in scenarios without noise, the rivalry is still between the oldies, while in noisy scenarios, the nonparametric StoNED PL now constitutes a promising alternative to the SFA ML.","[Andor, Mark] Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Div Environm & Resources, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Hesse, Frederik] Univ Munster, Finance Ctr Munster, D-48143 Munster, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Munster,"Andor, M (通讯作者)，Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Div Environm & Resources, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",andor@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,47,36,38,0,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs), now common in Southern Africa, present an opportunity to address these goals simultaneously. This paper proposes a theoretical spatial land allocation model that enables analysis of alternative scenarios for realising rural development and biodiversity conservation within TFCAs. The model includes socioeconomic and ecological factors such as income, fencing, connectivity, predation and disease costs and allows for clarification of opportunities and tradeoffs in land use. The model demonstrates alternative spatial options for diversification in land use, whilst accommodating the connectivity requirements and endogenous effects of wildlife on other land uses. The model is illustrated using several scenarios which include changes in key parameters, and limitations on total land allocated per land use. Illustrated scenarios show that land allocated to different land uses varies with output prices and costs such as fencing and wildlife damages, resulting in different spatial land use allocations. In addition, total revenue also changes when limitations are placed on land allocated to wildlife and tourism uses. The model can be used to reconcile interests where conservation and agricultural development activities compete for land. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Publicly financed schools include entirely public schools and schools that are privately managed but publicly funded. Families with a lower socioeconomic status may self-select into public schools, so a direct efficiency comparison between the two school types could lead to flawed conclusions because of the possible school selection bias. In this paper, we suggest using a propensity score matching approach in order to correctly analyze the impact of school ownership on student performance. After tackling the self-selection problem, we use a stochastic parametric distance function framework to compare student efficiency and productivity in both school types across ten Spanish regions using PISA 2006 data. Furthermore, we propose two original measures to analyze the impact of school ownership on academic performance across regions: the average treatment effect on the treated on the production frontier and the average treatment effect on the treated assuming school inefficiency. We find that, on average, private government-dependent schools are more productive than public schools, although efficiency results across regions are highly divergent.","[Crespo-Cebada, Eva; Pedraja-Chaparro, Francisco] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Av Elvas S-N, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain; [Santin, Daniel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 6, Pozuelo De Alarcon 28223, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura; Complutense University of Madrid,"Pedraja-Chaparro, F (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Av Elvas S-N, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain.",ecreceb@unex.es; pedraja@unex.es; dsantin@ccee.ucm.es,"Santín, Daniel/I-7784-2016","Santín, Daniel/0000-0002-1654-1659; Pedraja Chaparro, Francisco/0000-0003-3527-7811; Crespo-Cebada, Eva/0000-0002-0516-9345",,,,,73,51,58,0,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This is an alarming claim deserving serious attention. It is also a highly surprising claim, since recent conflict research tends to find the opposite: incidences of violent conflict are becoming less frequent. We argue that Harrison and Wolf's claim is incorrect. We show empirically that interstate wars are in fact becoming less frequent. Other data on tensions between states below war, such as the Interstate Crises Behavior data, also suggest a decline in conflict between states. We detail how Harrison and Wolf's analysis is misleading, highlighting how their findings primarily arise as a likely artefact of their uncritical use of the Militarized Interstate Disputes (MIDs) data, and explaining why MIDs cannot be interpreted as wars'. Given that Harrison and Wolf's basic premise is wrong, and wars are not becoming more frequent, we should be sceptical of their conclusions. We briefly revisit their suggested explanations for why wars may become more frequent in light of what we know about long-term trends in warfare and research on interstate war.","[Gleditsch, Kristian Skrede; Pickering, Steve] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Gleditsch, Kristian Skrede] Peace Res Inst Oslo, Oslo, Norway",University of Essex; Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO),"Gleditsch, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",,"Pickering, Steve/E-9948-2012; Gleditsch, Kristian Skrede/C-7070-2008","Gleditsch, Kristian Skrede/0000-0003-4149-3211; Pickering, Steve/0000-0002-1357-2994",,,,,44,17,19,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Design/methodology/approach - A fixed effects model together with a factor analysis and ordinary least square are used to analyse household purchase data for 2,000 households in 2006-2010 combined with survey questionnaire data from 2008. Findings - A small but statistically significant correlation between increasing organic budget shares and decreasing meat budget shares is found. People include food-related behaviour such as the purchase of organic food and reduced meat consumption as ways to mitigate climate change. However, other behavioural modifications such as reduction of car usage and household heating are perceived as more important strategies. Research limitations/implications - Other food-related mitigation strategies could be investigated. The climate effect of different diets - and how to motivate consumers to pursue them - could be investigated. Individual as opposed to household data would supplement the analyses. Practical implications - Demand-side policies aiming at climate-friendly consumption could be a central factor in combating climate change. Already, food-related mitigation strategies such as lowered meat consumption are established practices among a group of organic consumers. As some consumers believe that climate change can be mitigated by consuming organic food, the authors propose that this is taken into account in the development of organic farming. Originality/value - The authors propose a shift from analysing the climate-friendliness of production to addressing the climate- friendliness of consumption using consumption of organic food as a case. The authors link stated concerns for climate changes with actual food-related behaviour.","[Heerwagen, Lennart Ravn; Andersen, Laura Morch; Christensen, Tove; Sandoe, Peter] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Heerwagen, LR (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",lh@life.ku.dk,"Andersen, Laura Morch/K-8279-2013; Christensen, Tove/E-6774-2015; Sandoe, Peter/E-8758-2015","Andersen, Laura Morch/0000-0001-8763-1670; Christensen, Tove/0000-0003-1741-8190; Sandoe, Peter/0000-0003-0397-3273",,,,,37,15,16,3,55,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

There are six main approaches for Customer Lifetime Value Modeling which are based on advanced statistical, econometric and data mining algorithms. Authors describe profoundly three of these approaches (Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value models, probability models and persistence models) on theoretical basis and compare their results on real-world data from an online fashion retailer. Managerial implications of usage of different models are discussed. Companies need to decide what business goals are they trying to achieve with CLV analysis and predictions.

These plans were created by author of this paper and published in Statistical Papers. These new plans we shall compare with the corresponding Dodge-Romig AOQL plans for inspection by attributes from economical point of view. From the results of numerical investigations it follows that under the same protection of consumer the AOQL plans for inspection by variables are in many situations more economical than the corresponding Dodge-Romig attribute sampling plans (saving of the inspection cost is 70% in any cases). Dependence of the saving of the inspection cost on acceptance sampling characteristics is analyzed in this paper.","Univ Econ Prague, Dept Math, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Klufa, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Math, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",klufa@vse.cz,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,678,686,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700067,0

In the paper LCR and NSFR measurement in time is proposed to assess changes in systemic liquidity risk in Poland. Estimations of two Basel ratios for years 1996-2012, based on the data on aggregate banking system from National Bank of Poland, reveal that both ratios gradually deteriorated throughout most of this period. The ratios stabilized in 2008 - probably a combined result of banks' reaction to financial crisis abroad and new regulations. It seems that on average Polish banks can meet Basel's liquidity requirement. However, reverse stress test for LCR uncovers that currently an average Polish bank would withstand a run-off of no more than 20% retail deposits - while fifteen years earlier similar stress test would show that banks were able to endure even 60% run-off rate. Also, net cash capital surplus present in the system at the beginning of the analysed period has practically disappeared, even if favourable Basel weights for mortgage loans are taken into account.","Gdansk Univ Technol, Politech Gdanska, Wydzial Zarzadzania & Ekon Politech Gdanskiej, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Kochanski, B (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Politech Gdanska, Wydzial Zarzadzania & Ekon Politech Gdanskiej, Ul G Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",blazej.kochanski@wp.pl,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,9,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,718,731,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700071,0

At the country level institutional fostering of selected products can be made using different strategies for promotion of local and international brands produced in the country. Effectiveness of country's positioning efforts depends on wise selection of brands for promotion and on applying different positioning strategies depending on categories of brands. Magnitude of brand equity of country's products largely affects nation brand value and country's living standards; consequently this factor is important for ensuring rapid development of the country. The paper suggests a novel approach for two-dimensional disaggregation of products into categories depending on the shelf-life period of products and their perishability, and on their geographical distribution. The categories of products represent their shelf-life extending from perishable products to long shelf-life industrial products, and their geographical distribution: domestic, regional and global. Brands are analysed using in the transition markets of the Eastern Europe the two-dimensional framework. It is demonstrated that most of local brands in the region belong to the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) category, which is not a high value-adding, thus is not generating substantial sales cash flows. A number of industrial brands is scarce, and marketing decisions in countries of the Eastern Europe for positioning brands of this category are made mostly by foreign investors.","[Markevicius, Nikolajus] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Econ & Finance Management, Inst Econ & Business, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Podviezko, Askoldas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Podviezko, Askoldas] Mykolas Romeris Univ, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Mykolas Romeris University,"Markevicius, N (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Econ & Finance Management, Inst Econ & Business, Ateities Str 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania.",bochakolita@gmail.com; askoldas@gmail.com,"Podviezko, Askoldas/F-6197-2010",,,,,,15,0,0,0,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1006,1015,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700098,0

Design/methodology/approach - Using log price/demand monthly and annual import data elasticities were determined across the total UK nut market and for individual species. These were compared to an empirical model to develop an understanding of the market. Data were principally from FAOSTAT and HMRC databases. Findings - The UK imports are 5 per cent of the global nut trade, predominantly shelled with little internal production. Across ten species and 12 years price/demand regression models (1999-2010) were significant (R-2 = 0.75) with an elasticity of -2.06 (less import of higher cost nuts). Consistent model deviations were found for some nuts indicating non price demand effects. Macadamias were imported at 23 per cent of expectation relative to their price point. Monthly (2007-2010) and annual (1999-2010) elasticities were compared for individual nuts. Pistachio and cashew showed normal negative elasticities (-1.5 to -1.0) for both time scales. However, walnuts had negative (-2.2) elasticity using monthly data but positive (+1.0) using annual data. Research limitations/implications - These data suggest detailed analyses of the individual nut supply demand market and consumer preferences are needed to explain different market behaviour over time and among nut species. Practical implications - Nut importers and producers may be able to use this data to better develop value for their product in consumer eyes and hence provide an improved value chain. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates how a broad empirical elasticity modelling approach to an agrifood market may increase the understanding of market needs.","[McNeil, David L.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Sch Agr Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [McNeil, David L.] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Ctr Value Chain Res, Chatham, Kent, England",University of Tasmania; University of Kent,"McNeil, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Sch Agr Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",david.mcneil@utas.edu.au,"McNeil, David/C-2426-2014","McNeil, David/0000-0002-1831-7335",,,,,19,4,4,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the sustainability and the development of olive growing and extra-virgin olive oil production in the Emilia Provinces (northern Italy) using the origin-based quality virtuous circle as a conceptual framework. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 11 personal interviews and one focus group with six olive producers were conducted to assess the product potential and the willingness to set up rules for value creation and preservation of local resources. A survey of 100 extra-virgin olive oil consumers was performed to examine the product perception and consumers' willingness to pay. Findings - The origin-based quality virtuous circle was used as a conceptual framework to deal with the different aspects involved in the development and sustainability of the GI system. The results show that the value creation and preservation process of extra- virgin olive oil production in the Emilia Provinces has good potential, although many problems still exist, such as a lack of technical and agronomic expertise, and the lack of organisation among the producers. These weaknesses should be addressed to enhance the potential for sustainable development of the GI system. Practical implications - The creation of a GI organisation, such as a Consortium, may play a central role in coordinating collective action, such as providing technical assistance, managing the internal rules and controls system along the supply chain, and the marketing and communication strategies. Social implications - The future development of olive production, by reducing the risk of land abandonment, would contribute to landscape protection and improvement of the geological structure of the Emilia hilly areas, which are under serious threat of soil erosion and landslide events. Originality/value - This study represents the first attempt to evaluate the economic and development potential of olive growing and extra- virgin olive oil production in non-specialised areas, using the origin-based quality virtuous circle as a conceptual framework.","Univ Parma, Dept Food Sci, I-43100 Parma, Italy",University of Parma,"Menozzi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Parma, Dept Food Sci, I-43100 Parma, Italy.",,"Menozzi, Davide/ABH-4514-2020","Menozzi, Davide/0000-0002-5241-1587",joint grant of the said Provinces; Emilia-Romagna Region,joint grant of the said Provinces; Emilia-Romagna Region(Regione Emilia Romagna),"This research has been supported by the Project Studio sullo sviluppo dell'olivicoltura da olio in Emilia-Romagna, nelle province di Modena, Reggio Emilia, Parma e Piacenza, which is funded by the joint grant of the said Provinces and the Emilia-Romagna Region.

A transition to alternative energy-efficient technologies could reduce this energy consumption considerably. To quantify the influence of factors that drive consumer choices for light bulbs, we conducted a choice-based conjoint field experiment with 183 participants. We estimated discrete choice models from the data, and found that politically liberal consumers have a stronger preference for compact fluorescent lighting technology and for low energy consumption. Greater willingness to pay for lower energy consumption and longer life was observed in conditions where estimated operating cost information was provided. Providing estimated annual cost information to consumers reduced their implicit discount rate by a factor of five, lowering barriers to adoption of energy efficient alternatives with higher up-front costs; however, even with cost information provided, consumers continued to use implicit discount rates of around 100%, which is larger than that experienced for other energy technologies.

Whole fruits were scanned by the x-ray CT technique and then used for non-destructive tests. The Matlab software was used for segmentation of the internal structure of the CT-scanned fruit images to the three parts of peel, aril and seed. Linear regression equations were applied in order to estimate the whole fruit volume and its internal components. Results indicated that the fruit cultivar has a significant effect on the amount of fruit volume and its components, especially the amount of juice content (p<0.05). The fruit size had a significant effect on some fruit biophysical properties, but not on the ratio of juice to fruit volume. A high correlation was observed between extracted image features from x-ray images and experimental measurements. The actual volume of whole fruit, peels, arils, seed and juice was estimated by x-ray imaging to be nearly 97.8, 97.2, 95.1, 93.5 and 94.4%, respectively for the 'Rabab Malas' cultivar. Correspondingly, it was nearly 97.3, 94.7, 94.4, 91.8 and 91.9% for 'Rabab Torsh'.

There is the assumption according to which economic performance in the sense of the amount of gross domestic product per head of population is understood as the result of numerous aspects, whilst one of these is also the quality of the entrepreneurial environment and the enforceability of an agreement in this environment. If this is truly the case, there should be a relationship between gross domestic product per head of population (i.e. living standard) and the outcomes of insolvency proceedings as a means of verifying the enforceability of agreements. This relationship should exist especially if we understand the enforceability of agreements as one of the aspects that determine general entrepreneurial risks in a given environment. The authors therefore devote considerable attention to a structured selection of surveyed countries, analysis of individually used time and thematic series, which subsequently undergo regression analysis and interpretation of results, especially with regard to the specific significance of creditor yields from insolvency proceedings.","[Smrcka, Lubos] Univ Econ, Dept Business Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Arltova, Marketa; Hnilica, Jiri] Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Smrcka, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Business Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",smrckal@vse.cz; arltova@vse.cz; hnilica@vse.cz,"Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018; Hnilica, Jiri/J-8098-2015","Hnilica, Jiri/0000-0002-3429-1593; Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171; Arltova, Marketa/0000-0001-7313-6927",,,,,10,1,1,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,1375,1385,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700134,0

This analysis is undertaken for Spain during a significant sodo-economic period, from 1980, the beginning of the democratic era, to 2007, the onset of the current economic crisis. To this end, we construct water consumption series linked to a time series of input-output tables generated for the Spanish economy, and we develop a structural decomposition analysis to study mainly changes in water consumption embodied in final demand. We find that the growth in Spanish demand (all other things being constant) would have implied an increase in water consumption almost three times the growth actually observed. However, this demand effect is largely offset by technology and intensity effects, mainly due to changes in agricultural crops. Given the importance of the demand growth, the final demand effect is also analyzed in detail, broken down by categories as well as level and composition. Household demand and the increase of exports appear as key explicative factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Inefficiency, misuse and even corruption threaten the stewardship of those newly established health funds. This article examines a tricky situation faced by China's largest SHI program: the basic health insurance (BHI) scheme for urban employees. BHI accumulated a 406 billion yuan surplus by 2009, although the reimbursement level was still low. Using a provincial level panel database, we find that the huge BHI surpluses are related to the (temporarily) decreasing dependency ratio, the steady growth of average wages, the extension of BHI coverage, and progress in social insurance agency building. The financial situations of local governments and risk pooling level also matter. Besides, medical savings accounts result in about one third of BHI surpluses. Although these findings are not causal, lessons drawn from this study can help to improve the governance and performance of SHI programs in developing countries.","[Liu, JunQiang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Chinese Publ Adm Res, Sch Govt, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tao] Southwest Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Liu, JQ (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Chinese Publ Adm Res, Sch Govt, 135 Xingangxi Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",jq.liu123@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,6,6,1,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Participation in PES programs is voluntary, so effective program design requires careful consideration of farmers' preferences. This study quantifies such preferences using a choice experiment. The study site is the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, an internationally recognized 'biodiversity hotspot.' We assess preferences for four payment approaches: constant and variable annual cash payments to individual farmers, a constant annual cash payment to a village fund on behalf of farmers, and an upfront manure fertilizer payment. We find that the manure fertilizer payment was statistically significant in motivating farmer participation while the group payment was non-significant In addition, the relationship between the likelihood of participation and the stringency of conditionality is surprisingly non-linear. In a test of external validity, average willingness to accept (WTA) values are found to be similar to the average opportunity cost of maintaining land uses consistent with conservation objectives.

The DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) framework has been used to identify relevant information in a number of ecosystem contexts but suffers limitations in terms of its definitional clarity and conceptual foundations, which undermine comparability between studies. These limitations are addressed in the DPSWR (Driver-Pressure-State-Welfare-Response) framework, which defines information categories based on a synthesis of concepts in DPSIR and its predecessors so as to more clearly identify the object of measurement in each category and isolate information relating to social systems. Consequently, its categories dealing with social systems are better suited to assessing anthropocentric trade-offs in environmental decision-making, such as through cost-benefit analysis. A conceptual input-output analysis is used to highlight measurement issues connected with the inter-relations between information categories, particularly with regard to scale, and the application of the framework is illustrated by reference to issues affecting marine ecosystems included in a Europewide study for the European Commission. However, DPSWR's definitions are designed to be sufficiently general as to support application in other ecosystem contexts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While the auction mechanism has been the subject of a number of studies, less attention has been paid to the post-bidding contract phase. As contracts involving natural resource management are usually incomplete, trust becomes crucial for the effectiveness of the programme. We test the effect of communication between auctioneer and bidders on bidding behaviour and contract fulfilment using experimental economics. We combine a repeated reverse auction with an effort-level game and use a bilateral chatting tool as treatment variable. Without communication, auctioneers tended to select the lowest-priced bidders, who invested substantially less than the socially optimal level of effort when fulfilling their contract to provide the public good. Relational contracting proved important, with effort levels and profits tending to be higher when auctioneers and bidders entered into consecutive contract relationships. In the communication treatment there was no evidence of price competition, as auctioneers were more likely to accept high-priced bids. However, an overall higher price level did not lead to efficiency losses, since contractors realised higher effort levels in return, establishing a 'social gift exchange'. Our results demonstrate the importance of trust-based relationships between the auctioneering institution and landholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This article seeks to contribute to clarifying this. First, the authors argue that a higher degree of ENGO access to official negotiations and a larger number of ENGOs actively participating during bargaining processes can facilitate outcomes of environmental negotiations. The authors then analyze quantitative data on international environmental regimes and their members' commitment levels from 1946 to 1998 and obtain robust support for their claims. However, the rationale on the introduced explanatory factors also implies that the impact of ENGO access on states' commitment levels should vary conditional on the number of ENGOs actively participating. The paper finds evidence for such an interaction, although the results go against our expectations.","[Boehmelt, Tobias; Betzold, Carola] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Böhmelt, T (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Haldenggsteig 4, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",tobias.boehmelt@ir.gess.ethz.ch,"Böhmelt, Tobias/N-5347-2014","Bohmelt, Tobias/0000-0002-7661-8670; Klock, Carola/0000-0003-2987-7570",,,,,98,29,32,2,63,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

It investigates the hypothesis that advanced knowledge and technology dedicated to pollution abatement played a minor role in that process while relatively unadvanced forms of knowledge and technology played the main role. New qualitative evidence in this somewhat well-known case is considered: interviews with electric power plant R&D managers, plant-level compliance data, and the changes undergone by boiler manufacturer, coal mining and railroad companies in the supply chain. Advanced knowledge dedicated to pollution abatement like the type now being emphasised for carbon capture and storage (CCS) played a minor role, while unadvanced knowledge and technology played the main role. While there are clearly limits to how far this unadvanced knowledge and technology finding can be generalised to GHG emission control, the specific aspects of the SO2 case that might be broadly informative of the response to GHG emissions are elaborated. In any case, the paper shows how 'innovation' in pollution control can be inexpensive and effective without involving very much advanced knowledge and technology for pollution control.

The data come from both a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) and a field experiment conducted in a real market setting. The results show that in a static setting (first month) predictions of a standard DCE study and real market shares are statistically similar for the various profiles of corporate social responsibility. However, as time evolves real market shares present some dynamic patterns that are not mirrored by the standard DCE predictions. The overall conclusion is that differences between real market behavior and DCE data can be attributed to the lack of learning experience or adaptation in DCE surveys rather than to the hypothetical nature of the experiments.

We estimate a structural model of entry, location and format choice across a large number of markets in the presence of zoning restrictions. The paper contributes to the literature in three ways: First, the paper demonstrates that the omission of zoning restrictions in the extant literature on entry and location choice leads to biased estimates of the factors affecting market potential and competitive intensity. Second, the cross-market variations in zoning regulations helps us test and provide evidence for the theory that constraints on spatial differentiation will lead to greater product differentiation. Finally, we provide qualitative insight on how zoning impacts retail entry and format variety; in particular we evaluate the impact of prototypical zoning arrangements such as centralized, neighborhood, and outskirt zoning on entry and format variety.","[Datta, Sumon] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Sudhir, K.] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Yale University,"Datta, S (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sdatta@purdue.edu; k.sudhir@yale.edu,"Datta, Sumon/AAL-8995-2020",,,,,,35,21,36,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

In this paper, we develop a methodology for environmental policy deliberation that is grounded in institutional theory and theories explaining the cognitive practices of individuals in action situations. The methodology has three stages. First, we outline the problem setting on the basis of the stakeholders' mental model analysis. Second, more specific research problems and proposed solutions are formulated collaboratively with researchers from different fields. Third, the hypotheses are tested and challenged in a workshop with the interviewed stakeholders and re-formulated into final institutional recommendations.

This paper presents an econometric analysis of the propensity of noncitizens living in HUD-sponsored housing to naturalize. Providing housing and other forms of public assistance to noncitizens is controversial but the fact of the matter is that, under current rules, many qualify for aid so, facing that fact, an important contribution of this research is to identify the type of program that works best in the context of broader national objectives.

Here we focus on the value of residential ecosystems for biodiversity conservation and explore the social and ecological factors that influence wildlife-friendly garden management. Using a stratified sampling design across the UK city of Leeds, this interdisciplinary study develops and applies a mixed method approach, including questionnaires, interviews and ecological surveys across multiple spatial scales. We quantify wildlife-friendly gardening using two measures: (i) the number of wildlife-friendly features within gardens (the wildlife resources index, WRI); and (ii) the frequency of winter bird feeding. Wildlife-friendly gardening is influenced by a combination of garden characteristics and management intensity, householder demographics, wider environmental activity and landscape context. Residents reveal a range of motivations for wildlife-friendly gardening, notably personal well-being and a moral responsibility to nature. Respondents expressed a duty to maintain neighbourhood standards, revealing that social norms are a considerable barrier to uptake of wildlife-friendly activities, but also provide an opportunity where neighbour mimicry results in diffusion of wildlife-friendly practices. Community-driven initiatives that engage, educate and empower residents are better placed to encourage wildlife-friendly gardening than top-down financial incentives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The authors achieve this purpose by comparing how different managers of food brands prioritise and evaluate their brands, in relation to a theoretical ideal framework. Design/methodology/approach - A survey of 77 managers of domestic and international brands. Findings - Beliefs and priorities are similar between managers. What differs is how they measure and monitor their brands. Managers of high performing brands, for example, in general measure brand equity to a greater extent than other managers, and they focus significantly more on monitoring typical brand equity elements such as brand awareness, uniqueness, and feelings. Also managers of international brands measure and monitor more intensively than those of domestic brands. Practical implications - Weaker and domestic brands could learn from the better-performing brands, by becoming more oriented towards key brand equity elements when performing monitoring, rather than focusing mainly on perceived quality.

Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire was used to ask a sample of 200 young consumers about their impulse buying behaviour in cafeterias. The resulting data were submitted to an in-depth four-stage quantitative analysis. Findings The results show that there is not a unique profile of impulse buying behaviour and that young consumers can be effectively segmented in five groups according to their impulsive buying behaviour of snack foods using the eight factors revealed in the exploratory factor analysis. A new segment of health/nutrition-conscientious impulsive consumers was uncovered and characterized. Research limitations/implications The major constraints of this study are the use of a non-probability convenience sampling design and sample size. Future studies should include other products and a more heterogeneous sample. The study represents a good starting point for further debate on impulsive buying behaviour. Practical implications Most of the research done in this area has focused on the supermarket environment, neglecting other types of retail store. Companies could benefit from the current study as it provides them with information that can be used to improve their marketing strategies directed towards this specific market. Additionally, the findings can also help the development of public health policies better tailored to prevent overweight and obesity associated with snack food consumption. Originality/value The study extends the current body of knowledge by examining the applicability and relevance of external motivators of impulse buying behaviour to a significantly different retail environment.","[Duarte, Paulo; Raposo, Mario] Univ Beira Interior, NECE Res Ctr Business Studies, Covilha, Portugal; [Ferraz, Marlene] Univ Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior; Universidade da Beira Interior,"Duarte, P (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, NECE Res Ctr Business Studies, Covilha, Portugal.",pduarte@ubi.p,"Raposo, Mário Lino Barata/C-8186-2012; Duarte, Paulo/B-3914-2011","Raposo, Mário Lino Barata/0000-0001-6213-5355; Duarte, Paulo/0000-0001-8449-5474",Portuguese Science Foundation,Portuguese Science Foundation(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"Research supported by the Portuguese Science Foundation through NECE-Research Unit in Business Sciences Program (multiyear funding of R & D Unit of the FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology, Ministry of Education and Science, Portugal).",,73,24,33,6,75,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Data sources include application material, questionnaire surveys among the pupils, parents, and staff at the participating schools, follow-up telephone interviews with the staff, as well as interviews with suppliers. Data are analysed using principal components analysis and logistic regression. Findings - An econometric analysis suggests that price, school size, demand-stimulating activities related to the schools' support and the users' feeling of ownership, as well as internal professionalism and leadership in the implementation of the school lunch program are important for the viability of the program. These components may, to some extent, compensate for the gap between cost and users' willingness to pay for school lunches. Social implications - The study contributes to increase awareness of the many determinants and barriers for the viability of school lunches. Experience from the study demonstrates a significant challenge in making user requirements for quality, product diversity and willingness to pay meet with the costs of supplying school lunches.

COO has not been discussed in the context of pepper; however pepper's quality highly depends on the heritage. This paper aims to explore this aspect. Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted in an organic grocery store in Bonn, Germany. The first part of the face to face interviews at the point-of-sale were carried out for understanding consumers' attitudes towards different extrinsic quality cues. The second part covered the product-country-image of pepper as well as consumers' knowledge regarding COO and pepper quality. Third, the contingent valuation method is used to analyze organic consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). Fourth a blind-tasting of black pepper from different origins and production methods was conducted. Findings - The study reveals that organic consumers are able to experience taste differences due to COO though only a minority expects those taste differences. Thus, also concerned and involved consumers are not sufficiently informed on COO information to rely on their purchase decision of pepper. As a result consumers are not willing to pay a significant higher price for COO labeled pepper. Originality/value - This study is the first which combines face-to-face interviews regarding attitudes, image and knowledge with a blind tasting of pepper and an investigation of consumers' WTP for pepper from different origins and processing characteristics.","[Kloeckner, Heike; Langen, Nina; Hartmann, Monika] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Klöckner, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany.",heike.kloeckner@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Hartmann, Monika/J-8224-2017","Hartmann, Monika/0000-0002-3631-164X",,,,,60,16,16,2,47,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 1.165 Salmonella spp. strains isolated from commercial broiler breeders and laying hens (cloacal swabs, dragging swabs and faeces) and from one-day-old chicks (liver, spleen and cecum) and 310 strains isolated from raw chicken meat were serotyped between 2006 and 2010. Findings - The results showed a decline in the isolation of S. Enteritidis (SE) of poultry and chicken meat in the studied period. The most prevalent serovar isolated from raw chicken meat was Minnesota (n = 73; 23.02%), followed by Mbandaka (n = 33; 10.41%) and Enteritidis (n = 30; 9.46%). The decrease in frequency of isolation of SE may be related to the broiler breeder hens vaccination and to the National Program for the Reduction of Pathogens of the Brazilian Agriculture Ministry and Food Supply, established in 2003. Originality/value - The results reinforce the importance of improving bio-safety programs for the control and eradication of Salmonella spp. in the poultry industry.","[Kottwitz, Luciana B.

Research in economics and marketing has identified two key types of learning rules: belief and reinforcement. It has been shown that players use either one of these learning rules or a combination of them, as in the Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA) model. Accounting for such learning may help in understanding and predicting the outcomes of games. In this research, we demonstrate that players not only employ learning rules to determine what actions to choose based on past choices and outcomes, but also change their learning rules over the course of the game. We investigate the degree of state dependence in learning and uncover the latent learning rules and learning paths used by the players. We build a non-homogeneous hidden Markov mixture of experts model which captures shifts between different learning rules over the course of a repeated game. The transition between the learning rule states can be affected by the players' experiences in the previous round of the game. We empirically validate our model using data from six games that have been previously used in the literature. We demonstrate that one can obtain a richer understanding of how different learning rules impact the observed strategy choices of players by accounting for the latent dynamics in the learning rules. In addition, we show that such an approach can improve our ability to predict observed choices in games.","[Ansari, Asim; Netzer, Oded] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Montoya, Ricardo] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile",Columbia University; Universidad de Chile,"Ansari, A (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",maa48@columbia.edu; rmontoya@dii.uchile.cl; on2110@columbia.edu,"Montoya, Ricardo/F-8238-2016; Montoya, Ricardo/AHC-5839-2022; Montoya, Ricardo/L-2418-2018","Montoya, Ricardo/0000-0002-0360-805X; Montoya, Ricardo/0000-0002-0360-805X;",,,,,54,10,11,3,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We find that institutional conditions and market opportunity structures in consuming countries have been important sources of standards variation, for example in the cases of Fairtrade. UTZ Certified and the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C). In turn, supplier structures in producing countries as well as their linkages with traders and buyers targeting particular consuming countries have been key mechanisms of standards transmission and selection. Unlike prior research, which has emphasized the role of global actors and structures in promoting - and hindering - sustainability initiatives, we argue that national economic and institutional conditions in consuming and producing countries have not only served as important drivers of standards multiplicity and co-evolution, but also as catalysts for the entire global sustainability movement.

This paper addresses the multi-level governance problem of coherently addressing key interactions between four Earth sub-systems - climate change, freshwater use, land use and biodiversity - taking into account concerns over problem shifting. After discussing possibilities for regional downscaling of the boundaries, we explore challenges for the EU region to coherently address this particular set of interacting Earth sub-systems and reduce the risk of problem shifting. This analysis demonstrates that Earth system interactions can be governed, but that they likely require comprehensive packages of governance responses across both sub-systems and levels. Three overarching governance functions are tentatively identified that directly or indirectly address Earth system interactions: reduction of system stress, risks and vulnerabilities; triggering and navigation of transformation of economic activity: and development of a diversity of options. Finally, the paper briefly discusses political and institutional challenges for developing, enabling and stabilising these governance functions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the standard two-stage game for the analysis of international environmental agreements where countries announce their participation at the first stage and abatement levels are chosen at the second stage. We modify the game to consider altruism in the participation decision, i.e. countries consider, to a certain extent, the net benefits for other countries in their decisions. We study two types of altruism: impartial altruism, where countries show a concern for all other countries, and community altruism, where the concern extends only to coalition partners. We use the stability of coalitions model (STACO) to illustrate the impacts of both types of altruism on the stability of a climate agreement. We find that a limited degree of altruism is sufficient to stabilise the Grand Coalition such that a globally efficient climate policy can emerge while in the absence of altruism only a fraction of countries would join a climate agreement and the benefits of cooperation would largely remain unexploited. Our results indicate how moving beyond national interests can support the success of international climate agreements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the conventional nested fixed point algorithm, most of the information obtained in the past iterations remains unused in the current iteration. In contrast, the IJC algorithm extensively uses the computational results obtained from the past iterations to help solve the DDP model at the current iterated parameter values. Consequently, it has the potential to significantly alleviate the computational burden of estimating DDP models. To illustrate this new estimation method, we use a simple dynamic store choice model where stores offer frequent-buyer type rewards programs. Our Monte Carlo results demonstrate that the IJC method is able to recover the true parameter values of this model quite precisely. We also show that the IJC method could reduce the estimation time significantly when estimating DDP models with unobserved heterogeneity, especially when the discount factor is close to 1.","[Ching, Andrew T.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Imai, Susumu] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Ishihara, Masakazu] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY USA; [Jain, Neelam] City Univ London, Dept Econ, London EC1V 0HB, England",University of Toronto; Queens University - Canada; New York University; City University London,"Ching, AT (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",aching@rotman.utoronto.ca; imais@econ.queensu.ca; mishihar@stern.nyu.edu; neelam.jain.1@city.ac.uk,"Ishihara, Masakazu/GOG-9830-2022; Ishihara, Masakazu/ABH-7873-2020",,,,,,51,15,24,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Yet many of the world's major irrigation regions are in arid and semi-arid regions that face climate change projections of hotter and drier weather. A growing body of analysis assesses irrigated agriculture impacts of climate change in such regions. Most published literature focuses on reductions in the mean-levels of freshwater supplies: less information is available on the potential impacts from changes in the reliability and quality of those diminishing water supplies. This article investigates the combined impacts on irrigated agricultural food supply from reduced, more variable and more saline water supply for a representative semi-arid irrigation region. Results indicate that understanding the potential impacts of climate change on agricultural production requires an understanding of not only how production may adapt to changes in mean water supplies, but also how it may respond to changes in water supply variability and salinity. We illustrate, using an Australian, Murray Darling Basin semi-arid region example, that ignoring these combined water-related climate effects lead to results that overlook thresholds where the structure of production and cost incurred fundamentally change above certain levels of variability and salinity.

We show that this claim is untenable. Not a single empirical example adduced as evidence of the putative coalition shows that a coalition actually existed. The Maghribi traders made use of the formal legal system in order to enforce agency agreements in long-distance trade. A subset of the traders did form a web of trusted business associates that contributed to informal contract enforcement, but this was very different from the hypothesized coalition, in neither being exclusive nor having a clearly defined membership. The Maghribi traders combined reputation-based sanctions with legal mechanisms, in ways that resemble the practices of medieval European merchants. We find no evidence that the Maghribi traders had more 'collectivist' cultural beliefs than their European counterparts.","[Edwards, Jeremy; Ogilvie, Sheilagh] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Edwards, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,"Ogilvie, Sheilagh C/J-6693-2012","Ogilvie, Sheilagh/0000-0001-8807-3826",,,,,55,56,64,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Currently, risky levels of private and public debts coexist with vast amounts of savings that do not know where to go. Long-term climate-oriented financial products could enhance investors' confidence in low-carbon projects (LCP) and channel to them large amounts of private savings. The paper outlines a financial architecture, the cornerstone of which is an agreement on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) integrated into a project's appraisal and acting as a surrogate for a carbon price. This SCC would be the value of carbon certificates issued by the government and delivered to banks to issue credit facilities reducing the risk-adjusted costs of LCPs. These carbon certificates could be gradually transformed into legal reserve assets of the banks after verification of the reality of the projects. Finally, the paper considers whether such certificates would be recognized as genuine international reserve assets, backed by the rising value of carbon over time. It shows how emerging countries could then diversify their foreign exchange reserves through an asset based on the international recognition of climate as a global public good.","[Hourcade, J.

The model is applied to the western corn rootworm (WCR) invasion in the UK. The invasion is never eradicated due to the high dispersal capacity of WCR, particularly under climate change conditions. The lowest expected welfare losses arise with a laissez faire policy against the invasion. The effectiveness of NIS control programmes that require participation by land managers is shown to depend greatly on their learning and imitation dynamics. Control programmes might fail completely if there is global knowledge of the burdens of compliance - e.g. through the media - and the land managers can foresee the future consequences of new actions. This is due to coordinated noncompliance occurring across the landscape. If the agents need to experience compliance to learn its consequences or communicate only locally, potential noncompliant behaviour spreads more slowly than the invasion front and trails behind it. In conclusion, negative opinions of land managers over NIS control programmes and their media coverage can strongly undermine programmes. Identification and management of these factors may increase the odds of success of the programmes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Carrasco, L.

However, what determines the shape of an environmental Kuznets curve, such as the height and the turning point of the curve, has not been thoroughly studied. A good understanding of the determinants is vital to those interested indevelopment, especially in the developing world, where income growth is a high priority, yet environmental pollution also needs to be carefully controlled. This study analyzes the impact of economic structure, development strategy and environmental regulation on the shape of the environmental Kuznets curve by an analysis of a panel dataset at the city level obtained from China. The results show that economic structure, development strategy and environmental regulation can all have important implications for the relationship between environmental quality and economic development but that the impact can vary at different development stages.

Benefits included park-based employment, tourism revenue sharing, integrated conservation and development projects, and resource access agreements. Losses were caused by park-protected animals raiding crops and preying on livestock. Local perceptions of benefit and loss associated with the park were collected from focus groups and a household survey. Valuation data were derived from interviews, the survey, and measurement of crop losses. Eight villages accrued an annual net benefit as a result of the park, while 17 villages accrued a net loss. Net benefitting villages were located near park-based employment and resource access associations involved in beekeeping. Households within 0.5 km of the park boundary accrued the highest losses, while benefits distributed up to 15 km away. The Ugandan Wildlife Authority (UWA) needs to focus benefits closer to the park boundary to support those who lose most from park-protected animals, and away from areas with park-based employment to more evenly distribute benefits around the circumference of the park. Attitudes toward the park appear to be shaped by loss aversion, suggesting UWA and conservation agencies should focus on loss mitigation, rather than benefit provision. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The inventories included estimates of energy-related and non-energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (converted to CO2-equivalent, CO(2)eq) associated with the production and consumption of commodities, grouped in three main sectors: energy, industrial processes and agriculture. Input-output (10) analysis, emissions embodied in bilateral trade (EEBT) approaches and the basic methods of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines were used to perform the estimates. The results of the study illustrated that the total CO(2)eq emissions associated with consumption in Estonia in 2005 were 18% higher than those associated with production, primarily due to the net import of CO(2)eq emissions from countries outside of the European Union.

The objective is to develop a parsimonious method for identifying behavioral heterogeneity caused by life-constraint heterogeneity and separating it from that caused by preference heterogeneity. We estimate, for two different recreational activities, with two independent data sets, how much behavioral heterogeneity can be attributed to life-constraint heterogeneity. We develop and estimate a stacked latent-class approach to life constraints, assuming individuals have many correlated life constraints. First, at the bottom of the stack, a latent-class life-constraint model is specified and estimated; then life-constraint class becomes a covariate in a behavioral latent-class model of participation and site selection. We find, with both simple statistics and behavioral models, that life-constraint classes explain a significant amount of the observed behavioral heterogeneity. Prediction is a critical reason to distinguish the influence of current constraints from the influence of current preferences: it is easy to directly observe life-constraint levels. Stacked latent-class models have many potential applications, besides ours. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It focuses on strike endurance and pit-level variations in strike endurance by examining the contrasting quantity and quality of the material and moral resources available to the strikers at different collieries and in different communities. Powerful local variables in building or inhibiting strike commitment included pre-strike pit-level production, industrial relations, and the impact of debates about the economics and finances of coal-getting; incomes gained for households during the strike by married women in part-time and full-time employment; expenditure saved by households in local authority housing where rents were in effect deferred by sympathetic local authorities; communal attitudes to pits, jobs, and redundancies; the character and weight of political tradition; and the cultural as well as economic role of women. By focusing on developments at community and colliery level the article challenges dominant narratives of the strike, which remain wedded to high politics, the strategy of the union leadership, changes in energy supply and policy, and public order.","Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Phillips, J (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,,52,8,8,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The supply of cleared forest land was derived by using a two-period utility maximization model when the carbon sequestration of a private forestholder is credited. The land demand was derived from the profit maximization problem of a cash-crop farmer. The model was applied to data from the humid Chaco eco-region of Paraguay. The results indicate that taxes on cash-crop and forestry incomes may in fact be ineffective in curbing forest loss. Carbon payments, however, would effectively reduce forest clearing. In the context studied, a carbon payment of (sic)30 per ton of carbon would limit deforestation to 10% of existing forest cover. A reversible carbon crediting system, in which a forestholder can redeem a credited forest, seems to substantially increase, at least in the short run, the effectiveness of carbon payments. Carbon payments could also complement the tax on cash-crop income in curbing tropical forest loss. An effective policy to combat tropical deforestation should, therefore, jointly consider forestry and cash-crop sectors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The aim is to obtain insights around the use of fruit in a range of eating occasions, and to identify the ways that various fruit types are incorporated into the diet. Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal study obtained detail about eating occasions using 24-hour dietary recall over a three-month period. A total of 25 women aged between 35-66 years with a moderate to high annual household income took part. There were 5,791 eating occasions reported, of which 29 per cent contained fruit. Findings - Individual fruit types were integrated into the diet in varying ways. Diversity was observed within and between participants in terms of the foods and beverages that were typically consumed during eating occasions that contained fruit. The paper documents contextual characteristics of eating occasions that featured individual fruit types. Research limitations/implications - The study comprised a small, relatively homogeneous sample population, and no quantities of fruit consumed were measured. However, the longitudinal design enabled a broad range of eating occasions containing fruit to be captured for each participant. Originality/value - The findings help build a more comprehensive understanding of how fruits are incorporated into the diet. The approach can be applied to a larger and more diverse sample population to explore fruit consumption further. Typical usage patterns for individual fruit may then be used to develop effective suggestions for promoting fruit consumption.","[Bava, Christina M.; Jaeger, Sara R.] Plant & Food Res Ltd, New Zealand Inst, Auckland, New Zealand; [Dawson, John; Marshall, David W.] Univ Stirling, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Dawson, John] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Worch, Thierry] OP&P Prod Res BV, Utrecht, Netherlands",New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd; University of Stirling; University of Edinburgh,"Jaeger, SR (通讯作者)，Plant & Food Res Ltd, New Zealand Inst, Auckland, New Zealand.",sara.jaeger@plantandfood.co.nz,"Jaeger, Sara R/IAO-6411-2023; Jaeger, Sara R/R-2648-2016; Bava, Christina M/B-2540-2008; Dawson, John/HDM-6702-2022; Roigard, Christina/Q-4779-2017","Jaeger, Sara R/0000-0002-4960-5233; Roigard, Christina/0000-0001-8281-9092; Worch, Thierry/0000-0002-7200-5519","New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [C06X0403]","New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology(New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology)","The assistance with data entry provided by Sokleang Chheang, Amy Paisley, Lauren Axten, Michelle Ji Yeon, Georgina Carvel, and Callum Finn is acknowledged.

Piracy of products, technologies and trademarks is a highly profitable business undermining the rightful owners of Intellectual Property (IP) rights and thus it diminishes the benefits of innovation. The research explores the trends in IP protection at international level and generates some conclusions for innovation management purposes.","[Blaga, Petruta; Bolos, Mihaela Daciana] Petru Maior Univ Targu Mures, Targu Mures 540088, Romania","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures",,petruta.blaga@upm.ro; mihaela.bolos@science.upm.ro,"Blaga, Petruta/B-3360-2013; Blaga, Petruta/AAK-7304-2020; Natea, Mihaela Daciana/AAB-4991-2020","Blaga, Petruta/0000-0001-6405-8509; Natea, Mihaela Daciana/0009-0006-0104-6459",,,,,12,0,0,0,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,183,191,,,,,,9,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500017,0

Design/methodology/approach - Survey data for Germany are taken from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement (SHARE) database. Food-at-home (FAH) expenditures of the generation 50+ are explained within a multiple regression analysis first. Then, a double-hurdle approach based on the probit model and a truncated regression are utilized for reproducing the existence of food-away-from-home (FAFH) expenditures and the share of FAFH expenditures on consumption expenditures across households. Available information on socio-demographic variables, income and the health status of the respondents are introduced as regressors in the multivariate analyses. Findings - FAH expenditures in the generation 50+ in Germany follow the theoretical expectations underlying Engel functions. With a rising income level, FAH expenditures increase as well but the income share of FAR expenditures declines as does the share of FAH expenditures in total food expenditures. Apart from income, the share of FAH expenditures in food expenditures rises with age, household size, and it is highest for the lowest education level. Moreover, it is higher for West than for East German households. Becoming a pensioner increases absolute FAH expenditures, but does not affect the FAH expenditure share significantly. Very different results are provided by the Engel-curve analysis for food away from home. A rising income raises FAFH expenditures, whereas becoming a pensioner lowers it. The age variable is insignificant. Practical implications - The estimated Engel curves suggest that food at home grows less with rising income than food away from home. In particular, the determinants of the per-capita FAFH expenditures reveal important determinants of expenditures of the generation 50+ in a highly dynamic consumption category. The results have important marketing implications. Originality/value - Despite the growing economic importance of the generation 50+ in industrialised countries, empirical evidence on how this age group behaves in its food expenditure pattern is often lacking. This study provides a first set of estimated coefficients from Engel curves for Germany. These show how income as well as sociodemographic and health variables affect per-capita expenditures for FAH and FAFH consumption.","[Burzig, Johanna; Herrmann, Roland] Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Herrmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Giessen, Germany.",Roland.Herrmann@agrar.uni-giessen.de,,,"European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001-00360, RII-CT-2006-062193, CIT5-CT-2005-028857]; US National Institute on Ageing [U01 AG09740-13S2, P01 AG005842, P01 AG08291, P30 AG12815, Y1-AG-4553-01, OGHA 04-064, R21 AG025169]",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); US National Institute on Ageing(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"The authors are grateful to the SHARE Research Data Center, University of Mannheim, for providing the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) data for the empirical analysis.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the dual response choice experiment (DRCE) design which allows for analyzing forced and unforced options in choice experiments using the same sample. The heteroscedastic extreme-value (HEV) model is used due to its relaxation of the restrictive assumption made in the multinomial logit model regarding the identically distributed error term across alternatives. The empirical analysis uses consumer-level questionnaires to elicit information regarding consumer attitudes toward rabbit meat in Catalonia (Spain). Findings - The results demonstrate a higher preference for rabbit meat from Catalan origin followed by higher quality certification information. Convenience and ready-to-eat products made from rabbit meat may help bolster increased consumption. An effective communication campaign is needed to educate individuals regarding the health characteristics of rabbit compared to other types of meat. Furthermore, results demonstrate that the ordering of attributes is not significantly different from forced and non-forced choices obtained from the DRCE design. However, significant differences on the magnitude of the preferences for some attributes' levels are found. Research limitations/implications - From a methodological point-of-view, the study follows a similar design to the dual response choice experiments. However, the study is differentiated by asking consumers whether they are willing to buy the product. More emphasis is made on the purchasing context of the task leading consumers to focus more on their budget constraints by considering the price. The study uses the DRCE design as an alternative of the traditional single stage choice experiments. Owing to budgets constraint, the study could be improved by comparing results from both designs. At the empirical level, it would be interesting to extend the study to other geographical parts in Spain. Social implications - The study can help policy makers in stimulating demand for rabbit meat. Rabbit meat farmers in Catalonia were forced to abandon their farms due to the lack of demand. Consumption has decreased dramatically. As recommended in the paper, high quality labelling of the meat, improving the carcass format and its presentation and the healthiest characteristic of the meat could be a good way to promote and stimulate demand. Originality/value - From the empirical point-of-view, this study, to the authors' knowledge, is the first application of CE and CV to analyze consumers' preferences towards rabbit meat. Furthermore, it is the first paper that applies the HEV model in agro-food economics and specifically towards rabbit meat.","[Kallas, Zein; Maria Gil, Jose] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Ctr Agrofood Econ & Dev, CREDA UPC IRTA, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; IRTA,"Kallas, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cataluna, Ctr Agrofood Econ & Dev, CREDA UPC IRTA, Barcelona, Spain.",zein.kallas@upc.edu,"GIL, Jose M./B-2699-2012; kallas, zein/G-5620-2010","GIL, Jose M./0000-0003-3313-9052; kallas, zein/0000-0003-2870-3691",,,,,53,32,32,0,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This research questions how effective RSPO is in attaining its claimed conservation goals especially regarding orangutans, as this is central to justifying its existence. The study found five shortcomings explaining poor outcomes regarding the protection of the forest area, and especially the orangutan habitat: financial compensation too small, too much room for interpretation in the guidance document, postponement on contentious issues, non-integration of RSPO within the socio-politico-legal Indonesian context and finally the lack of effective external control system. As these shortcomings complement each other, the effectiveness of the scheme is dramatically reduced for biodiversity conservation, and is almost zero for species such as Sumatran orangutan that needs large forested areas. Conservation of biodiversity, and especially orangutans, will require oil palm sector reform. This would include reincorporating the state into the scheme and changing the approach supporting local development in a sound socio-ecological regional planning. Covering a period of seven years, the study analyses the RSPO's work in the context of the acute conflict resulting from Sumatran orangutan habitat conversion to oil palm plantations.

Small rural communities may require a coordinated approach to overcome the limitations of economies of scale. Low-carbon development strategies present potential for large payoffs at a household and community scale. Southeast Alaskan forests previously harvested for timber are currently re-growing and require thinning to maintain ecosystem service benefits such as wildlife habitat and hunting. Thinned material presents a potential biofuel source. However, without verification among decision alternatives, communities may not have the momentum, vision, or conviction to stimulate a shift to a new energy source. We present a network approach to evaluating multiple energy delivery pathways, and a calculation of carbon, energy, and dollar savings presented by each pathway. We quantify chain of production impacts; from the point of energy extraction and transport (upstream), through consumption and emission accounting (downstream). Our findings suggest substantial greenhouse gas emission savings of over 70% as well as heating cost savings for all bioenergy scenarios compared to fossil fuel scenarios.

A concern in entrusting decisions to local governments is that the effectiveness of the conservation instrument can be threatened by interactions among these local governments. We examine this concern with respect to an ecological fiscal transfer mechanism, the ICMS-Ecologico, implemented in Brazil in the early 1990's in order to reduce biodiversity loss. The mechanism enables states to reward municipalities for the creation and management of protected areas. We describe this mechanism, present a conceptual framework aimed at understanding the potential sources and consequences of interactions among local governments on the effectiveness of a decentralized mechanism aimed at promoting the creation of protected areas, and propose an empirical application using a Bayesian spatial Tobit model. Our empirical investigation on the creation of protected areas in the state of Parana between 2000 and 2010 reveals strategic substitutability in municipalities' conservation decisions.

Exposure is estimated at the census block-group level using geographic microdata from the Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We find that racial and ethnic disparities in pollution exposure are strongest among neighborhoods with median incomes below $25,000, while income-based disparities are stronger among neighborhoods with median incomes above that level. We also find considerable differences in the patterns of disparity across the ten EPA regions. In the two regions with the highest median exposure (the Midwest and South Central regions), for example, African-Americans and Hispanics face significantly higher exposures than whites, whereas in the region with the next highest exposure (the Mid-Atlantic), the reverse is true. We show that the latter result is attributable to intercity variations - minorities tend to live in the less polluted cities in the region - rather than to within-city variations.

The aim is to look at common as well as different effects among regions and to draw policy implications relating to fuel price, as well as to fuel tax, towards developing a low-carbon transport system, which are applicable to other countries including emerging countries where a demographic disparity between megalopolis areas and rural areas might be increasing. The methodology includes the multiple regression models complemented by the 1st order auto-regressive models of error terms, where the elasticities of gasoline price and those of income regarding usage of personal automobiles, of public transport and of passenger railways with or without periodic tickets, and fuel consumption on cars, as well as ownership of various types of cars, are estimated for individual gross-regions. In both gross-regions, higher gasoline prices are commonly shown to be related to lower ownership of larger private passenger cars, higher ownership of light cars, lower ownership of the total private passenger cars, lower passenger-km per capita in cars, lower fuel consumption on cars and higher transit ridership. The result suggests general automobile-fuel-price policy implications, the extent of which is differentiated by spatial characteristics, and estimates the adverse effect of the possible abolition of the provisional gasoline tax rate on the emissions in both gross-regions. The application of result is also tried in exploring effect of other policy measures such as expressway tolls. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we look at how functional specialisation within a city region can, via trade between sub-regions, create emissions interdependencies; and how this complicates environmental policy implementation in an analogous manner to international trade at the national level. For this purpose we use a 3-region emissions extended input-output model of the Glasgow City region (2 regions: city and wider city-region) and the rest of Scotland. The model utilises data on household consumption to account for consumption flows across sub-regions and plant-level data on emissions from electricity generation to augment the top-down disaggregation of emissions. This enables a carbon attribution at the sub-regional level, which is used to analyse emissions interdependencies within the city-region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examined whether the policy improved the income-related equality in health care utilization. This study analyzed the extent to which the policy improved income-related equality in outpatient visits, inpatient days, and inpatient and outpatient care expenditure based on triple difference estimator. Using nationwide claims data of the NHI from 2002 to 2004 and from 2006 to 2010, we compared cancer patients as a treatment group with liver disease as a control group and low-income group with the highest-income group. The results showed that the extension of NHI benefits coverage led to an increase in the utilization of outpatient services across all income groups, but with a greater increase for the low-income groups, among cancer patients. Moreover, the policy led to a less decrease in the utilization of inpatient services for the low-income group while it decreased across all income groups. Our finding suggests that the extension of NHI benefits coverage improved the income-related equality in health care utilization.","[Kim, Sujin; Kwon, Soonman] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Kim, Sujin; Kwon, Soonman] Natl Evidence Based Healthcare Collaborating Agcy, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency (NECA),"Kwon, S (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 1 Kwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",kwons@snu.ac.kr,,"Kim, Sujin/0000-0002-4251-6318",,,,,32,26,26,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Agri-environmental policies contribute to these efforts by encouraging farmers to adopt environmentally friendly practices within the vicinity of these ecosystems. A spatially targeted agri-environmental policy promotes natural amenities and may thereby affect household location decisions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent of these impacts on the spatial urban structure. We extend a monocentric city model to include farmers' responses to an agri-environmental policy. Our main findings are that the implementation of a spatially targeted agri-environmental policy may lead to some additional urban development, which could conflict with the aim of the policy.

More specifically, would the change in a rate regulated firm's input quantity due to a change in its input price be less price elastic than the unregulated firm's change in the input quantity due to a change in its input price. We follow Fare and Logan (1986), Nelson and Wohar (1983) in estimating a rate regulated cost function and capital input share system of equations. Using a 1992-2000 panel of 34 US major investor-owned electric utilities, empirical results indicate that the regulated own-input price elasticities of demand for labor and fuel are less price elastic than their corresponding unregulated own-input price elasticities of demand (a Le Chatelier principle type effect). Having a fuel clause (1) reduces the firm's willingness to substitute from fuel to either non-fuel (capital, labor) input when the price of fuel rises, and (2) enhances the firm's willingness to substitute from non-fuel inputs to fuel when the price of non-fuel inputs rises.","[Granderson, Gerald] Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Forsund, Finn] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway",University System of Ohio; Miami University; University of Oslo,"Granderson, G (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",grandegd@muohio.edu; finn.forsund@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We analyze the evolution of inequality in global CO2 per-capita emissions using both historical data on energy-related CO2 emissions and future emission scenarios generated with the integrated assessment model REMIND. Within our sample of 90 countries the results indicate that the Gini index declined from about 0.6 in 1971 to slightly above 0.4 in 2008. A decomposition of the Gini index of total emissions into primary energy carriers indicates that this reduction is mainly attributed to declining shares of emissions from coal/peat and oil in total emissions, and decreasing emission inequality within all fossil primary energy sources. From the perspective of economic sectors, the decline in overall inequality is almost entirely due to a decline of the contribution of emissions from manufacturing & construction. Our analysis also suggests that an equally spread emission reduction from any one source would not have a major impact on overall emission inequality. The analysis of future scenario data indicates that climate policy reduces absolute emission inequality, while inducing drastic progressive emission reductions in all regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we investigate the proposition that international environmental law, as a network of treaties and institutions, exhibits some key characteristics of a complex adaptive system. This proposition is premised on the scientific understanding that the Earth system displays properties of a complex adaptive system. If so, international environmental law, as a control system, may benefit from the insights gained and from being modelled in ways more appropriately aligned with the functioning of the Earth system itself. In this exploratory review, we found evidence suggesting that international environmental law is a complex system where treaties and institutions self-organize and exhibit emergent properties. Furthermore, we contend that international environmental law as a whole is adapting to exogenous changes through an institutional process akin to natural selection in biological evolution. However, the adequacy of the direction and rate of adaptation for the purpose of safeguarding the integrity of Earth's life-support system is questioned. This paper concludes with an emphasis on the need for system-level interventions to steer the direction of self-organization while maintaining institutional diversity. This recommendation stands in contrast to the reductionist approach to institutional fragmentation and aims at embracing the existing complexity in international environmental law.","[Kim, Rakhyun E.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kim, Rakhyun E.] UN Univ Inst Adv Studies UNU IAS, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Australian National University; United Nations University; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Kim, RE (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",rakhyunkim@gmail.com; b.mackey@griffith.edu.au,"Mackey, Brendan/ABE-3805-2020; Kim, Rakhyun E/C-3814-2017","Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064",,,,,155,64,73,4,83,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

To address this, we develop a protocol for linking ecological processes and outcomes to human preferences, which combines environmental modeling, expert elicitation, and nonmarket valuation methods. Our application values reductions in nutrient loads to lakes in the southeastern US. The innovation centers on how biochemical measures of water quality (e.g., chlorophyll a) are translated into terms that are meaningful to individuals who derive ecosystem services from them. Using expert elicitation data, we estimate a model linking changes in biochemical measures to an index of eutrophication in lakes. We then develop a stated preference survey including (a) detailed descriptions of the perceptible outcomes - e.g., water color, clarity - associated each eutrophication index level; and (b) policy scenarios involving state-level changes in lake eutrophication conditions. We estimate a function that predicts households' willingness to pay for changes in lake water quality. We demonstrate the protocol through a case study examining the benefits of lake quality improvement in Virginia as a result of recent policies to reduce nutrient loads in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

However, after the Black Death, much of England's arable was converted to pasture, mainly for sheep, and this process accelerated after 1470. These two observations are contradictory. This article provides new numbers of adult sheep based on estimates of domestic cloth consumption, cloth exports, the changing weight of cloth, and fleece yields. The conclusion is that the adult sheep population only declined by around 13 per cent from 1310 to 1440, and had risen dramatically by the mid-sixteenth century.","Bishops Univ, Lennoxville, PQ J1M 1Z7, Canada",Bishops University,"Oldland, J (通讯作者)，Bishops Univ, Lennoxville, PQ J1M 1Z7, Canada.",,,,,,,,121,14,17,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Secondly, this indicator is integrated into two simultaneous equation models to capture the marginal impacts of changes in biodiversity on the value of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) due to climate change. Our estimation results confirm the role of biodiversity as a nature-based policy solution for climate change mitigation, shedding light on the policy actions that generate co-benefits by enhancing ecosystems' capacity to mitigate climate change impacts, while conserving biodiversity and sustaining the flows of EGS for human livelihoods. Especially, nature-based mitigation policies are more cost-effective and better at coping with the ethic and inequality issues associated with distributional impacts of the policy actions, compared to the pure technical solutions to improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. However, the strength of biodiversity as a nature-based policy option for climate change mitigation depends on both the nature of the EGS and the geographical area under consideration.

Positioned at the interface between producers and consumers, retailers have the potential to reduce this problem through informing their customers on the consequences of their actions. The purpose of this paper is to understand the variety of ways European retailers go about informing their customers on the linkage between food choice and climate change as well as which actions they advocate in-store to reduce the problem. Design/methodology/approach - In-store walkthroughs lasting between 40 minutes and 1.5 hours were carried out at 30 grocery stores in five European countries to identify climate mitigating communications. The observations targeted any message produced and transmitted by the retailer where links between food and climate change were drawn. Findings - The diversity in climate mitigating food communication we expected to find across Europe did not materialize. Only four out of the 30 retailers visited transmitted to their customers any information showing a direct link between food consumption and climate change. Indirectly, the authors found some retailers communicating food choices believed to lead to GHG reduction without linking them to climate change. Finally the authors found several retailers communicating what the authors argue are ambiguous messages to their customers where sustainability issues were confounded with climate ones. The dearth of climate mitigating food communications reveals the complexity in informing customers on such issues but also a possible lack of interest on the part of both parties. Originality/value - This research contributes empirically to knowledge of how retailers communicate climate mitigating food consumption to consumers.","[Ekelund, Lena; Hunter, Erik; Spendrup, Sara; Tjarnemo, Helene] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, Alnarp, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Spendrup, S (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, Alnarp, Sweden.",sara.spendrup@slu.se,,"Hunter, Erik/0000-0002-4906-2515",Swedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Retail and Wholesale Development Council,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Retail and Wholesale Development Council,"Thanks are due to the Swedish Research Council Formas and the Swedish Retail and Wholesale Development Council, for financing the project Climate Labelling in Food Retail.",,81,10,10,1,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The compensation can take the form of either or both monetary and environmental units to meet three goals: i) minimisation of the cost associated with the compensation, ii) no aggregate welfare loss, and iii) minimal environmental compensation requirement. The findings suggest that - in some cases - providing both monetary and environmental compensation can be the cost-minimising option. Minimal compensation constraints can increase total compensation costs but reduce individual gains and losses relative to the initial situation that arise from heterogeneous tradeoffs between income and environmental quality.

In that sense, particularly interesting studies are those which attempted to determine the individuals' risk propensity and tried to answer what influences that propensity. In order to assess a propensity and behaviour under conditions of risk and uncertainty for the first and second year students of business economics, an analysis based on questionnaires with standardized questions known as Risk in basket and Choice dilemma has been conducted.

Using inferential statistics, significant differences (two-tailed Z-tests) in the number of claims are explored and compared to differences in legislation standards and consumer preferences. Findings - The initial analysis revealed that there were six significant differences between the presence of the seven health and nutrition claims across 16 product categories in the US and the EU. Further analysis of the 16 product categories revealed a range of significant differences between the frequency of US and EU claims.

This is true in the national parks of the Northern Safari Circuit of Tanzania, which attract hundreds of thousands of tourists annually. To better understand what tourists to Tanzania were willing to pay for various attributes of their tour package, we used a linear mixed effects model to analyze what attributes of 72 tour packages from 32 tour operators contributed to the price of tour packages. We found that the number of days spent on tour, the number of days spent in the Serengeti, the type of accommodation (basic camping versus lodges or luxury tents), the mode of transport into the park (flying versus driving), and the inclusion of cultural tourism helped predict the price of a tour package. Our findings suggest that tour operators charge 92% more for a day in the Serengeti than other Northern Circuit attractions, but we do not examine what happens to the additional rent generated by the Serengeti. Additionally, the utility of cultural tourism in attracting foreign tourists presents both tremendous opportunities and potential challenges to efforts to realize culturally sensitive ecotourism.

Based on the analysis, one comes to the conclusion that nominal exchange rates have appreciated since 2002 until the introduction of the single currency in Slovakia. This positive trend was supported by the growth in productivity as well as by the inflow of foreign direct investment.

To solve this problem, scholars emphasize the importance of leveraging private capital. If states create institutional mechanisms that promote private investment, they can reduce the fiscal cost of carbon abatement. We examine the ability of different international institutional designs to leverage private capital in the context of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Empirically, we analyze private capital investment in 3749 climate mitigation projects under the CDM, 2003-2011. Since the CDM allows both bilateral and unilateral implementation, we can compare the two modes of contracting within one context. Our model analyzes equilibrium private investment in climate mitigation. When the cost of mitigation is high, unilateral project implementation in one host country, without foreign collaboration, draws more investment than bilateral contracting, whereby foreign investors participate in the project.

Initiatives such as Agenda 21, promoted by the UN, highlight the need to evaluate the relationships among factors of production and consumption, innovation and demographics, and the environment, in the attainment of sustainable development. In this context, our work studies in depth those factors underlying the economic activity of households, in a representative group of European Union countries and the US. Within the framework of an input-output model, a Structural Decomposition Analysis is considered in order to identify the weight that growth in demand, changes in patterns of consumption, changes in the distribution of income, the substitution of inputs, and changes in energy intensity have all had on the evolution of CO2 emissions. The work specifically seeks to identify common patterns and differential behaviors among productive sectors in the European social environment The results show that growth in demand, and therefore in production, largely absorbs the limited effect of technological and efficiency improvements and the incipient changes observed in consumption patterns.

In the presence of a fragile environmental regulatory framework, inducement can indeed be endogenous and environmental innovations may be spurred by firms' reactions to their direct or related environmental performance. Cross-sector analysis focuses on a panel of Italian regions, over the time span 2003-2007, and is conducted by implementing zero-inflated regression models for count data variables. The empirical results suggest that in a context characterized by a weak regulatory framework, such as the Italian one, environmental performance has significant and complementary within- and between-sector effects on the generation of green technologies.

A potentially important conflict is that hospitals prefer comparatively short length of stay (LOS) at hospital, while social care services prefer longer LOS all else equal. Furthermore, inappropriately delayed discharges from hospital, i.e. bed blocking, is costly for society. Our aim is to discuss which factors that may influence bed blocking and to quantify bed blocking costs using individual Norwegian patient data, merged with social care and hospital data. The data allow us to divide hospital LOS into length of appropriate stay (LAS) and length of delay (LOD), the bed blocking period. We find that additional resources allocated to social care services contribute to shorten LOD indicating that social care services may exploit hospital resources as a buffer for insufficient capacity. LAS increases as medical complexity increases indicating hospitals incentives to reduce LOS are softened by considerations related to patients' medical needs. Bed blocking costs constitute a relatively large share of the total costs of inpatient care.","[Holmas, Tor Helge; Islam, Mohammad Kamrul; Kjerstad, Egil] UNI Rokkansenteret, N-5015 Bergen, Norway",,"Kjerstad, E (通讯作者)，UNI Rokkansenteret, Nygardsgaten 5, N-5015 Bergen, Norway.",egil.kjerstad@uni.no,,"Islam, M.

However, when primary studies provide more than one estimate, the presence of dependence in the metadata has implications for the statistical efficiency of estimated moderator variables. Previous meta-analyses have adjusted for within study dependence through ad hoc procedures (e.g., selecting one estimate per study and study average) or regression-based methods (e.g., weighted and panel data models). This paper defines dependency based on the underlying primary data (i.e., from the same sample) and examines the effect of different models and treatments on meta-regression estimation and implications for benefit transfer performance. The models are applied to the sportfishing literature that contains 140 papers providing 833 estimates of access values for fishing in the United States and Canada. The different methods of adjusting for dependency within the sportfishing metadata result in differences in the estimated model coefficients; hence, different transferred values and transfer errors.

We suggest that the dynamics of the local environment strongly influences the method that individuals choose to acquire useful knowledge and is one of the principal determinants of the way they compete and cooperate. We focus on the way different environments lead to different costs, especially the relative opportunity costs, of search and communication and, consequently, to the emergence of different patterns of persistent cooperation and competition. In predictably regular and in predictably random environments, the cost of autonomous search is low and little social structure emerges. In complex environments, the relative costs of communication are high, leading to persistent social structure. Our presumption is that the characteristics of the emergent, or informal, social structure are a major determinant of successful collective action. We investigate the hypothesis through a comparison of three fisheries in which the costs of acquiring useful knowledge are different. Because of these differences, fishers' acquisition of useful knowledge leads to different social structure and different preconditions for successful collective action in each fishery. The lobster fishery is characterized by strong collective action and appears sustainable; the urchin and groundfisheries, worked by the same communities, are not even though almost all their participants are familiar with and often participate in the lobster fishery.

This is problematic given the long-standing controversy concerning the status of deposits, but also because bank efficiency estimates are known to be affected by the inclusion of additional outputs such as non-traditional (fee-based) activities or risk measures. This paper proposes a data-driven identification of bank outputs and inputs using the directional technology distance function. While previous applications of this tool used symmetric expansion or contraction directions, we focus on a set of orthogonal directions, each corresponding to an assumption on the input/output status of an individual variable. These directions correspond to a set of different specifications, whose estimated coefficients can be used to determine the input or output status of all variables except the regressand. Our empirical analysis revealed a very consistent pattern across the alternative specifications estimated. There is strong evidence that customer deposits are an input, and that non-performing loans are an important undesirable output. Finally, the orthogonal expansions/contractions we consider avoid the simultaneity problem raised by the convenient normalization commonly used to impose linear homogeneity in stochastic frontier estimation.","[Guarda, Paolo; Rouabah, Abdelaziz] Banque Cent Luxembourg, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Vardanyan, Michael] IESEG Sch Management Lille Econ & Management, CNRS, UMR 8179, Socle Grande Arche, F-92044 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IESEG School of Management,"Vardanyan, M (通讯作者)，IESEG Sch Management Lille Econ & Management, CNRS, UMR 8179, Socle Grande Arche, 1 Parvis Def, F-92044 Paris, France.",paolo.guarda@bcl.lu; abdelaziz.rouabah@bcl.lu; m.vardanyan@ieseg.fr,,"Vardanyan, Michael/0000-0002-6895-9045",,,,,47,15,15,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Rationalists argue that countries' material self-interest and political and economic conditions affect the likelihood of countries ratifying treaties. Constructivists argue that countries are influenced by exposure to world society. Structural embeddedness theory argues that countries are influenced by neighboring countries, religion, language, and economic peers, and those whom they have network ties to via diplomatic relations and IGO memberships. The article is a study of how these factors affected the ratification of two environmental treaties: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The results show that political and economic factors, peer behavior, and network ties were more important in explaining the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol than the UNFCCC. Similar to von Stein (J Conflict Resolut 52:243-268, 2008), it found that exposure to world society was important in the UNFCCC. The authors suggested that the differences were due to the demands which the Kyoto Protocol placed on countries in contrast to the softness of the UNFCCC. They also discussed how social influence-based on a variety of inter-governmental relations and affiliations-may signal a change in the structure of the global environmental regime and how it conducts its business.","[Yamagata, Yoshiki; Yang, Jue] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Galaskiewicz, Joseph] Univ Arizona, Dept Sociol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Arizona,"Galaskiewicz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Dept Sociol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",galaskie@email.arizona.edu,"Yamagata, Yoshiki/H-7224-2018; Yamagata, Yoshiki/T-6489-2019",,,,,,34,11,16,2,71,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

But valuation and BCA have also attracted criticisms. 'Internal' criticisms point to the absence of alternative scenarios in valuation, overlooking of ecological trade-offs and dis-services, and inattention to context. Others criticize aggregation across diverse stakeholders and the problem of non-monetizable benefits, and dismiss BCA as fatally flawed. They suggest approaches such as deliberative decision-making and multi-criteria analysis. We propose a middle path that uses the strengths of economic analysis for decision support while avoiding the pitfalls. We disaggregate economic impacts by stakeholder groups, link ecosystem changes to benefits as well as dis-benefits, and examine how socio-technological context shapes the magnitude of economic impact. We illustrate this approach by studying the impact of creating the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple wildlife sanctuary in the Western Ghats forests of southern India. Our analysis shows that while some stakeholders are net beneficiaries, others are net losers. Changes in forest rights, irrigation technologies, and ecosystem dynamics influence the magnitude of benefits and sometimes convert gainers into losers. Such disaggregated analysis can provide useful information for deliberative decision-making and important academic insights on how economic value is generated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This analysis links fertility life histories to wealth at death data for four rural villages in France, 1750-1850. For the first time, the wealth-fertility relationship during the onset of the French fertility decline can be analysed. Where fertility is declining, wealth is a powerful predictor of smaller family size. This article argues that fertility decline in France was a result of changing levels of economic inequality, associated with the 1789 Revolution. In cross-section, the data support this hypothesis: where fertility is declining, economic inequality is lower than where fertility is high.","CUNY Queens Coll, New York, NY USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Cummins, N (通讯作者)，CUNY Queens Coll, New York, NY USA.",,,,,,,,51,31,37,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

These, though, vary in their coverage and do not record the inland trade. This article uses the Statute Merchant certificates of debt from 1285 to analyse changing levels of commercial investment by alien and denizen merchants throughout all areas of the kingdom. It shows that Italian investment was declining from the 1280s in line with falling imports of foreign silver. It discusses the causes of this decline, and the effect on alien and denizen credit of imports of counterfeit sterling coins produced by European mints. It relates these financial developments in England, France, and Flanders to the sequence of events which led to English merchants increasing their numbers and mercantile capital at the beginning of the fourteenth century when they were first able to establish their domination of the country's export trade in wool.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Nightingale, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,,,,,35,5,6,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

While there had been earlier famines, that of 1315-17 produced the earliest surviving evidence of official attempts at remedial actions. Those included the enforcement of traditional regulatory measures such as the assizes of ale and weights and measures, and efforts to regulate brewing by preventing the use of wheat and limiting the amount of barley used. In addition, the government acted to encourage the import of grain and imposed prohibitions on export that were explicitly justified by scarcity and high prices. English bishops were urged to encourage those who were hoarding grain to hold only enough for themselves and their families and sell the rest. While it is unclear whether government actions had much effect, it is difficult to imagine under fourteenth-century conditions that any government had the means or measures to respond effectively to famine. Nonetheless, some of the measures taken by Edward II's government, especially export prohibition and attempts to persuade or compel those with supplies of grain to sell it, had a long future ahead of them.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Sharp, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",,,,,,,,59,10,11,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

An agent-based simulation model for investment decision-making is coupled with GIS data. The spatial-temporal diffusion model accounts for the limited availability of substrate resources, alternative plant sizes and different heat use combinations. For illustration, we apply the model to the German federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria, for which we estimate an additional economical capacity potential of 409 MWel. Overall, we conclude that current feed-in payments per unit of electric power provided are probably not too far off the optimum level, if one considers the maximum diffusion of CHP units possible. However, the current feed-in system may overtly favor small generating units, thereby failing to incentivize coordination among farmers for joint resource utilization in larger and more efficient plants. In addition, optimization of the biogas conversion process and feedstock use would also be highly beneficial. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents new empirical evidence from the first international study of the scope and character of community currencies. It identifies the diversity, scale, geography and development trajectory of these initiatives, discusses the implications of these findings for efforts to achieve sustainable development, and identifies future research needs, to help harness the sustainability potential of these initiatives.

Libya, a country with a young population base, has limited information on breakfast skipping prevalence among its young citizens as well as its compounding factors unique to the country. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the breakfast skipping pattern among Benghazi primary school children. Design/methodology/approach - The paper's approach is to use a cross sectional study among 386 primary school children (196 males and 190 females) using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. The enrolment exclusion criteria were a pre-existing chronic disease or a food allergy or food intolerance or any acute illness. Findings - Breakfast skipping during weekdays (38.6 per cent, n = 149), reduced drastically on weekends (1.0 per cent, n = 4); 10.7 per cent subjects skipped breakfast daily (mean 2.5 + 1.3 days). Absence of hunger and lack of time to eat or prepare breakfast were cited as main barriers in its regular consumption. Bread and milk were the most commonly consumed breakfast foods. Certain groups of regular breakfast eating subjects consumed higher (p < 0.05) dietary thiamine and iron than their breakfast skipping counterparts and also better fulfilled their daily requirements for these nutrients. Parental breakfast eating habits influenced their children's breakfast eating pattern. Practical implications - Efforts, including better time management, are required to inculcate a positive breakfast eating attitude among Benghazi primary school children. Their parents need to act as better role models by adopting healthy breakfast eating practices themselves. Originality/value - The paper shows that breakfast skipping among Benghazi primary school children is a nutritional problem of grave concern, warranting a public health intervention.","[Pandey, Diwa; Buzgeia, Mohammed H.; Suneetha, Epuru; Ahmed, Hana; Al Gani, Honida Abd El Rahaman; Al Kadam, Hajir Abd El Rahman; Elariby, Nawal Juma] Garyounis Univ, Dept Nutr, Benghazi, Libya",University of Benghazi,"Pandey, D (通讯作者)，Garyounis Univ, Dept Nutr, Benghazi, Libya.",diwa.pandey@rediffmail.com,"Epuru, Suneetha/C-2307-2013","Epuru, Suneetha/0000-0002-5153-1114",,,,,37,3,3,1,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Biodiversity conservation will benefit from this land restitution only if the Khomani San, who interact with nature more than do other groups, are good environmental stewards. To assess their attitude toward biodiversity conservation, this study used the contingent valuation method to investigate the economic values the communities assign to biodiversity conservation under three land tenure arrangements in the Kgalagadi area. For each community and land tenure arrangement, there are winners and losers, but the winners benefit by more than the cost that losers suffer. The net worth for biodiversity conservation under the various land tenure regimes ranged from R928 to R3456 to R4160 for municipal land, parkland, and communal land respectively for the Khomani San, compared to R25 600 to R57 600 to R64 000 for municipal land, parkland, and communal land respectively for the Mier.

A main challenge of analyzing spatial data is that researchers must a priori choose the size and make-up of the areal units, hence the resolution of the analysis. Analyzing the data at a resolution that is too high may mask macro patterns, while analyzing the data at a resolution that is too low may result in aggregation bias. Thus, ideally marketing researchers would want a data-driven method to determine the optimal resolution of analysis, and at the same time automatically explore the same dataset under different resolutions, to obtain a full set of empirical insights to help with managerial decision making. In this paper, we propose a new approach for multi-resolution spatial analysis that is based on Bayesian model selection. We demonstrate our method using two recent marketing datasets from published studies: (i) the Netgrocer spatial sales data in Bell and Song (Quantitative Marketing and Economics 5:361-400, 2007), and (ii) the Pathtracker(A (R)) data in Hui et al. (Marketing Science 28:566-572, 2009b; Journal of Consumer Research 36:478-493, 2009c) that track shoppers' in-store movements. In both cases, our method allows researchers to not only automatically select the resolution of the analysis, but also analyze the data under different resolutions to understand the variation in insights and robustness to the level of aggregation.","[Hui, Sam K.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Bradlow, Eric T.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",New York University; University of Pennsylvania,"Hui, SK (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",khui@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,56,13,16,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

An application to the Spanish economy,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,CO2 emissions; International trade; Shared responsibility between producer and consumer,POLLUTION; CONSUMER; PRODUCER; EMISSIONS,"The aim of this paper is to define a shared responsibility criterion for analysing the impact of international trade on CO2 emissions applied to sectors. With the approach proposed it is possible for sectors in a country to account for only a part of the emissions associated with exported and imported goods. The agents considered as responsible for pollution are sectors two-fold: as producers and suppliers of intermediate inputs and final demand (accounting for direct emissions linked to production), and as consumers of intermediate inputs required for production (accounting for direct and indirect emissions linked to consumption of inputs), and the countries and foreign sectors that trade with these industries. The responsibility of emissions is shared by all the participants along the global product chain depending on the value added of each step. The criterion is applied to the Spanish economy for the period 2000 to 2005, and proves useful for determining what economic policies may be suitable for mitigating anthropogenic impact on the environment and for including all the agents of the supply chain in the development of sustainable supply chain management.

The environmental strategies and impacts are shaped by the businesses' on-going interpretation of external pressures and opportunities, transnational outsourcing of production to newly industrialised countries, changes towards 'fast fashion' and lower retail prices. Differences are identified with respect to whether and when companies take and embed environmental initiatives. The companies make environmental demands to suppliers in newly industrialised countries to different degrees. Some companies cancelled eco-labelling, because it was too demanding to manage, while some fashion companies recently launched eco-labelling, because they see a need to show environmental commitment publicly. The fast changing fashions and low price strategies encourage increased clothing consumption among young women, unused clothing in their wardrobes and frequent changes of clothing during the week Concerns about environmental impacts are limited. The dominating business strategy of only few eco-labelled products seems to have had limited impact on these women's practices, and thereby on the environmental impacts from Danish consumer choices in general.

Yet, in many cases, this change did not ensue. This article argues that several riparians are trapped in stalemate due to a too strong sovereign approach to their water relations. Adopting a critical perspective on hydro-hegemony, this article argues that this framework of analysis is too limited since it is embedded in a Westphalian concept of sovereignty. To support this argument, the article draws on the Iberian Peninsula water politics. These riparians are still embedded in notions of territorial sovereignty, not being able to take on a holistic water basin governance regime embedded on considerations of equity, human rights and social justice. The article concludes that it is vital to move beyond a static sovereignty-based analysis of riparian relations and engage in a dynamic discussion of different water governance models and their consequences concerning peace and development.","[Lopes, Paula Duarte] Univ Coimbra, FEUC, Sch Econ, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Lopes, Paula Duarte] Univ Coimbra, FEUC, Ctr Social Studies, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Lopes, PD (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, FEUC, Sch Econ, Av Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal.",pdl@fe.uc.pt,"Lopes, Paula Duarte/AAP-5150-2021","Lopes, Paula Duarte/0000-0003-1723-077X",,,,,53,9,12,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Yet despite these and other important features, sharecropping was surprisingly absent in most regions. Using case studies associated with French wine production, this article argues that a number of factors have often been overlooked in the literature, the first of which is the need for landowners to be able to offer farms that were sufficiently large both to employ the sharecropper's family on a full-time basis, and to allow them to produce a variety of products to minimize risk. Second, measurement problems exist with the division of the harvest, especially when quality was an important factor in determining price. Finally, the nature of vertical cooperation and integration associated with the production and marketing arrangements of individual crops suggests that landowners were not indifferent to receiving payment in cash or kind, and this affected contract choice. This article incorporates these ideas to explain not just the presence and absence of sharecropping in different geographical localities, but also the wide variety of different forms of the contract that existed in France.","[Carmona, Juan; Simpson, James] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Carmona, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,"carmona, juan/AAA-6428-2019","carmona, juan/0000-0002-1447-2178",,,,,92,12,13,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This paper examines an encompassing semiparametric frontier model that combines the DEA-type nonparametric frontier, which satisfies monotonicity and concavity, with the SFA-style stochastic homoskedastic composite error term. To estimate this model, a new two-stage method is proposed, referred to as Stochastic Non-smooth Envelopment of Data (StoNED). The first stage of the StoNED method applies convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS) to estimate the shape of the frontier without any assumptions about its functional form or smoothness. In the second stage, the conditional expectations of inefficiency are estimated based on the CNLS residuals, using the method of moments or pseudolikelihood techniques. Although in a cross-sectional setting distinguishing inefficiency from noise in general requires distributional assumptions, we also show how these can be relaxed in our approach if panel data are available. Performance of the StoNED method is examined using Monte Carlo simulations.","[Kuosmanen, Timo] Aalto Univ, Sch Econ, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Kuosmanen, Timo] MTT Agrifood Res Finland, Helsinki 00410, Finland; [Kortelainen, Mika] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Aalto University; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Manchester,"Kuosmanen, T (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Econ, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",Timo.Kuosmanen@aalto.fi; Mika.Kortelainen@manchester.ac.uk,"Kuosmanen, Timo/B-5532-2008","Kuosmanen, Timo/0000-0001-9232-5387",,,,,60,177,189,2,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

On the one hand, the country has been linked to the argument that there exists a relationship between the gold standard and lowered borrowing costs; on the other hand, it has been discussed as motivated by a desire to expand its trade with gold standard countries. This article argues against both strands in the literature, and argues for a third interpretation. It demonstrates that the specificities of Japan's gold standard reveal a concern with 'original sin', or the impossibility of raising foreign loans in Japan's own currency, and explains that there were grave costs to gold standard adoption.","Univ Leuven Japanese Studies, Louvain, Belgium",,"Schiltz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven Japanese Studies, Louvain, Belgium.",,"Schiltz, Michael/GWC-1432-2022",,,,,,50,12,15,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Enterprise mix diversification is the most common, and is widely regarded as the most effective, strategy for mitigating multiple sources of short-term economic risk to agricultural enterprises. However, assessments of enterprise mix diversification as a strategy for mitigating climate risks to ensure long term viability of agricultural enterprises are sparse. Using the Lower Murray region in southern Australia as a case study, we combined APSIM modelling with Monte Carlo simulation, probability theory, and finance techniques, to assess the extent to which enterprise mix diversification can mitigate climate-induced variability in long term net returns from rain-fed agriculture. We found that diversification can reduce the standard deviation by up to A$200 ha(-1), or 52% of mean net returns; increase the probability of breaking even by up to 20%, and increase the mean of 10% of worst probable annual net returns (Conditional Value at Risk) by up to A$100 ha(-1). We conclude that enterprise mix diversification can also be an effective strategy for hedging against climate-induced economic risk for agriculturalists in marginal areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

One finding is that free lending and extensive liquidity support against good collateral developed gradually after 1847, and was already a fact of life before Bagehot published Lombard Street. Another is that the extension of the Bank of England's lender-of-last-resort function went along with a reduction of its exposure to default risks, in contrast with accounts that have associated lending of last resort with moral hazard. Finally, we provide a new interpretation of the 'high rates' advocated by Bagehot. We suggest they were meant to prevent banks from free-riding on the safety offered by the central bank, and were aimed at forcing them to keep lending during crises so as to maintain a critical degree of liquidity in the money market.","[Bignon, Vincent; Flandreau, Marc] Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Ugolini, Stefano] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Pisa, Italy",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,"Bignon, V (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.",,"Bignon, Vincent/JYP-2587-2024; Ugolini, Stefano/E-3727-2015","Ugolini, Stefano/0000-0002-0172-9237",,,,,68,40,41,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The goal of the article is to present the results of recent research on early modern Mediterranean trade and finance, drawing attention to some promising areas of investigation that have been overlooked by scholarship and that constitute part of the author's own work in progress. The central question is: how did traditional Mediterranean networks and trade fare in the age of global expansion? In other words, did Mediterranean trade networks experience an evolution in their structures similar to the rest of the world? An attempt is made to answer this question through an analysis of the activities of Greek, Venetian, and English mercantile and financial networks in the eastern Mediterranean, showing the peculiarities of the interplay between trade and finance that underpinned the economy of the Venetian Stato da Mar. This attempt highlights two phenomena at play within the 'Venetian Mediterranean': firstly, that foreign operators began directly financing Venetian imperial administrative structures, and secondly, that the number of Venetian merchants involved in these operations increased as new players entered the financial game.","Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Fusaro, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England.",,,,,,,,74,23,26,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Specifically, I argue that to the extent that WTO-compliance requires strict adherence to the principle of nondiscrimination, as embodied in the national treatment and most-favored nation provisions in the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, there is the potential for conflict with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), both as a free-standing principle of customary international law and as set out in various multilateral environmental agreements and, in particular in the climate change context, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. This is insofar as the unilateral imposition of BCAs by developed countries shifts costs of compliance with environmental legislation in developed economies onto the developing world. Such allocation may conflict with the principle of CBDR, which recognizes the unequal contribution to environmental degradation of developed countries as well as their enhanced ability to address the challenges presented by such degradation and, as a consequence, requires that they undertake more onerous obligations with respect to climate change mitigation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the extent to which this conflict is illustrative of a deeper tension between efficiency and equity considerations inherent in the intersection of international economic law and international environmental law.","Org Amer States, Gen Secretariat, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"Ladly, SD (通讯作者)，Org Amer States, Gen Secretariat, 19th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",s.davidsonladly@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,34,19,20,2,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Using novel and unique behavioral data from a panel of casino gamblers, this paper investigates three aspects of consumer behavior in this domain. The first is that consumers are addicted to gambling, the second that they act on irrational beliefs, and the third that they are influenced by marketing activity that attempts to influence their gambling behavior. We use the interrelated consumer decisions to play (gamble) and the amount bet in a casino setting to focus on addiction using the standard economic definition of addiction. We test for two irrational behaviors, the gambler's fallacy and the hot hand mythaEuroour research represents the first test for these behaviors using disaggregate data in a real (as opposed to a laboratory) setting. Finally, we look at the effect of marketing instruments on the both the decision to play and the amount bet. Using hierarchical Bayesian methods to pin down individual-level parameters, we find that about 8% of the consumers in our sample can be classified as addicted. We find support in our data for the gambler's fallacy, but not for the hot hand myth. We find that marketing instruments positively affect gambling behavior, and that consumers who are more addicted are also affected by marketing to a greater extent. Specifically, the long-run marketing response is about twice as high for the more addicted consumers.","[Narayanan, Sridhar] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Manchanda, Puneet] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Stanford University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Narayanan, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sridhar.narayanan@stanford.edu; pmanchan@umich.edu,,,,,,,29,21,28,2,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

In this study we consider whether theory and methods developed to test for and explain environmental inequality in the U.S. can be extended to a major developing country such as China. We argue that, due in part to the state's hukou registry system, urban workers in China with an official rural residence may be subject to disproportionate exposure to environmental pollution. We also argue that environmental inequalities in China may be shaped in part by social processes analogous to those which have been held to explain racial differences in pollution exposure in the U.S. In an analysis of the locations and emissions of pollution-producing facilities in China's Jiangsu province, we find that townships with a higher percentage of rural migrants are more likely to be exposed to high levels of air and water pollution.

Specifically, the eligibility criterion considered is compliance with minimal requirements of long-term economic and agroenvironmental sustainability. To this end, 69 range farms were surveyed in Extremadura (SW Spain). In these farms, sustainability was studied using the MESMIS framework MESMIS is based on the evaluation of basic attributes of sustainability (adaptability, self-reliance, equity, stability, and productivity) formed from different indicators. The original indicators are then synthesized by means of qualitative, quantitative, or mixed techniques into a single value measuring the sustainability of the system (sustainability index). Alternative scenarios were then defined in which the perception of CAP subsidies was to a greater or lesser extent linked to levels of sustainability. For each of these scenarios, the economic indicators of the farms were compared with those of the baseline (present) situation. The analysis was completed using a logistic model classification to study the relationship between the maximum levels attainable by the economic indicators in terms of the sustainability indices. The results showed that including sustainability as a condition for receiving aid under the CAP can contribute to improving the economic results of traditional extensive farms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The preferred FLR, ANN and CR models are selected via mean absolute percentage of error (MAPE). The intelligent approach of this study is then applied to estimate natural gas price in industrial sector. Domestic sector is also used to further show the flexibility and applicability of the hybrid approach. The economic indicators used in this paper are consumer price index (CPI), population, gross domestic (GDP), and annual natural gas consumption. The stated indicators could be contaminated with noise and vagueness. Moreover, there is a need to develop a hybrid approach to deal with both noise and vagueness. The input data were divided into train and test data sets. A complete sensitivity analysis has been performed by changing train and test data to show the superiority of the proposed approach. The superiority of ANN for the domestic sector and FLR for the industrial sector was proved by error analysis.

Considering those circumstances, the decisions are affected by risks in an expanding capacity. Since the management decisions are typically taken on the basis of incomplete information, based on some partial data and in conditions of uncertainty, these are associated with errors. Because the risk is regarded as a probability, therefore it is worth to investigate the nature of what is called the statistical risk. It plays an important role in the framework of statistical inference. The statistical feature of the decisional area determines that the error's probabilistic measurement to be made by the risks. In this paper there are depicted and adjusted the risks, such as Type I, Type II and Type III. The variance resulting from measurement error becomes noise and thus it could decrease the power level. To be more specific, since a high degree of measurement error hinders the condition of the variable from being correctly indicated, it drags down the possibility of correctly detecting the effect under study. Those risk types are affecting the alternative hypotheses of the decision making processes and also the Taguchi risk and the potential index of a process.","[Dragan, Irina-Maria] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest 010552, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,irina.dragan@csie.ase.ro,"Dragan, Irina Maria/B-9540-2009; Dragan, Irina Maria/AAA-6838-2021; Dragan, Irina Maria/M-1083-2017","Dragan, Irina Maria/0000-0001-9349-1846; Dragan, Irina Maria/0000-0001-9349-1846;",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,339,349,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500032,0

This study aims to explore different groups of conventional German pig farmers with respect to their understanding of animal welfare. Based on the results, a target group is determined that is willing to take part in an animal welfare programme in accordance with the current state of research, i.e. considering the four Welfare Quality principles: good housing, good feeding, good health and especially appropriate behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 160 German pig farmers between March and May 2010 using an online questionnaire. Data analysis combines two quantitative methods. To reduce complexity and to identify the animal welfare perceptions of the farmers first an explorative factor analysis was conducted. Subsequently, based on the determined factors, the sample was divided into different groups by means of a cluster analysis. Findings - Three groups of pig farmers were defined with regard to the establishment of an animal welfare programme according to the current state of research. While a broad acceptance of the principles good housing, good feeding and good health exists among the farmers, the appropriate animal behaviour is only important for a small group of pig farmers. Therefore, the three groups should be addressed by the developers of an animal welfare programme, using different strategies to gain the support of all farmers. Originality/value - To successfully introduce new animal welfare requirements, farmers are important actors to take into account. This paper is the first analysis of the animal welfare perceptions of conventionally producing German pig farmers and determines different groups for a comprehensive animal welfare husbandry system as currently discussed by scientists and politics.","[Franz, Annabell; Spiller, Achim] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev Mkt Food & Agr Prod, Gottingen, Germany; [Deimel, Ingke] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Kiel,"Franz, A (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev Mkt Food & Agr Prod, Gottingen, Germany.",afranz@uni-goettingen.de,"Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,,,,,48,33,33,0,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through the distribution of a survey instrument to craft beer and home brewers, designed to assess the demographic profile, purchasing/restaurant selection, and decision behavior of this group and assess the likelihood of their future behavioral intentions toward continued participation in the craft beer segment. Findings - The paper reveals that craft beer and micro brew pub success has been driven by the home brew movement and continues to gain market share at the expense of broad line food service and macro beer producers. The demographic profile of this group shows age range, income, and educational levels sufficient to drive continued growth. The high satisfaction and likelihood to recommend scores support this assessment. Research limitations/implications - The sample is limited to members of the Brewers Association, the American Home Brewers Association, and craft beer enthusiasts known to members of the organization. Additionally, the survey was administered electronically limiting participation to people comfortable with this medium. Practical implications - F&B operators who demonstrate commitment to craft beer through server education, beverage list commitment, and supporting events can achieve market differentiation and dominance within the niche; leading ultimately to competitive advantage. Originality/value - This research sheds light on underexplored areas of craft beer and the opportunity for independent F&B operators to identify and penetrate an increasingly important niche market, which to date has been viewed primarily from the perspective of microbrew pubs.","[Murray, Douglas W.; O'Neill, Martin A.] Auburn Univ, Coll Human Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Murray, DW (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Coll Human Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",dwm0004@auburn.edu,,,,,,,18,84,103,5,106,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The paper starts with brief introduction of the concept of outsourcing, both in relation to private and public sector practices. The core parts are devoted to the analysis of the experience with outsourcing of internal services in private and public organizations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. On the base of our preliminary data from the Czech Republic and Slovakia we may conclude that outsourcing decisions in the public sector in both countries are really chaotic, ad hoc made, without any real ex-ante analysis. In such conditions there is the high risk that outsourcing will not deliver efficiency improvements. We also already have preliminary data about outsourcing in the private sector in Czechia and they indicate that outsourcing is relatively frequently used by private firms in the country. Second, we may argue that the quality of implementation of outsourcing in the private sector in the Czech Republic is bit limited.","[Sumpikova, Marketa] Univ Econ Prague, CZ-13067 Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,sumpik@vse.cz; juraj.nemec@umb.sk; mpmppp@seznam.cz; merickova@umb.sk,"Sumpikova, Marketa/AAA-8595-2020; Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/AAN-7235-2021; Nemec, Juraj/M-5467-2013","Sumpikova, Marketa/0009-0008-6632-918X; Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/0000-0002-3187-9201; Nemec, Juraj/0000-0002-5881-7422",,,,,21,0,0,0,5,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,1073,1089,,,,,,17,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500101,0

Design/methodology/approach - A telephone survey consisting of 913 households was made to reach an estimated 3.3 percent sampling error with 95 percent confidence level. Findings - It was found that those who were female, who had higher occupation prestige, who had college education levels, who were aged in their 40s, and who possessed an optimistic opinion toward the necessity of organic farming tend to pay a premium for and buy organic food. The majority of Taiwanese respondents showed a high level of concern about pesticides but a low trust in organic food, which revealed an attitudinal inconsistency toward organic agriculture/food. A multiple discriminant analysis with a moderating variable shows that consumers' trust in organic food and their pesticide concern jointly explain the respondents' willingness to pay a premium and purchasing behavior. The influence of consumers' pesticide concern on their willingness to pay a premium and purchase actually depends on their levels of trust. Originality/value - As a whole, lack of trust and confusing organic product certification levels is the main barrier to Taiwan's organic agriculture development. Further communication and policy modification is needed to reinforce consumers' confidence in organic agriculture/food.","[Tung, Shih-Jui] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; [Shih, Ching-Chun] Chien Kuo Technol Univ, Dept Beauty Sci, Changhua, Taiwan; [Wei, Sherrie] Chien Kuo Technol Univ, Dept Int Business Adm, Changhua, Taiwan; [Chen, Yu-Hua] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioind Commun & Dev, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University; Chienkuo Technology University; Chienkuo Technology University; National Taiwan University,"Tung, SJ (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.",sjtung@nchu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Yu-Hua/0000-0001-6925-148X",,,,,56,68,73,2,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Systematic data were reported on the MEC of various dusts and the influences of ignition energy, dust calorific value, moisture content and particle size were taken into account. It is found that the overly low or high ignition energy will result in unrealistic MEC results. To reliably measure MEC, the experimental tests should be preformed under the condition that the test result is independent of ignition energy. For the Siwek 20 L vessel, the 4-6 kJ is the most appropriate energy ranges to determine the MEC of various dusts. The more incombustible component contained in lower calorific value dust acts as a thermal sink in the ignition and heating process of dust cloud, and therefore, the higher MEC can be found in the MEC measurement of lower calorific value dust. Moreover, due to the notable dust agglomeration, to validly measure MEC, the moisture content of test dust should not exceed 10 wt %. When the moisture content is lower than 10wt %, the MEC smoothly increases with the rise of moisture content. With the decrease of particle size, the measured MEC becomes lower, and the MEC has an approximate linear relation with particle size. The results reported in this work provide the experimental basis and data guidance for the prevention and evaluation of dust explosion risk. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Systematic substance flow analysis can indicate critical emissions and potential strategies of risk reduction by mapping the flows of toxic substances throughout the economic system. This research developed an integrated modeling framework for examining the connections between driving forces and environmental risk. Three methodologies, including substance flow modeling, input-output model, and environmental risk assessment, were integrated into the framework. We built a model of lead flow system integrating four risk chain modules, which are corresponding to the Driver, Presser, State, and Impact component of DPSIR environmental management framework. Thus, risk can be backtraced to its exposure pathways, emission sources, and driving forces. In the results, Sankey diagrams are presented to highlight the sources and driving forces of the lead flow system. Among the driving forces, unit change in the demand on computer products is associated with the most significant change in risk of lead. Backtracing the contributions of the causes along the risk chain, the sectors of electronic product and computer product had driven the electronic supply chain which contributes the greatest to risk of lead by discharging into water body.

This article contributes new time series data for the Gold Coast and Ghana between 1890 and 2010 and in particular a new GDP time series for Ghana for the years 1891-1957.

Theoretically one would expect a reduction in educational inequality should, given the positive correlation between education level and income, initially increase and then, at a later stage, reduce income inequality. Testing for such a Kuznets-type relationship between educational and income inequalities yields an unexpected result: we find the expected inverse U-curve before the 1950s, but the relationship changes into a normal U-curve afterward. We explain this observation by a change in the trend of skill premium during the second half of the twentieth century due to an increased relative demand for skills, which contradicts the usual assumption of decreasing returns to education. Due to lack of appropriate wage data, we cannot directly capture this effect. Yet, once we use an instrumental variable estimation method to filter out the effect of the omitted skill premium, the expected inverse U-curve also appears for the latter decades of the twentieth century.","[Foldvari, Peter; van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Földvári, P (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",peter.foldvari@econ.unideb.hu,"Foldvari, Peter/AAW-9861-2021","Foldvari, Peter/0000-0003-4557-8810; van Leeuwen, Bas/0000-0001-7817-5298",,,,,88,10,11,0,29,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2014,8.0,3,,,,,271,300,,10.1007/s11698-013-0105-3,0.0,,,30,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,AN4XS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340593700001,0

I review the history of government involvement in health care financing over this period. Then I use panel regression methods to examine whether a variety of mortality based outcome measures are correlated with the extent of government involvement.

After a substantial rise brought about by the arrival of the Court in 1561, real wages experienced a remarkable fall from 1621-30 onwards. Our thesis is that the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by the Crown to fund its ambitious imperial policy exerted a clear influence on this decline. The currency manipulations of the low-value petty coin (maraved) drove serious losses in the real wages of building labourers and craftsmen between 1621 and 1680. In the years around 1665 the real wages of both groups had fallen below the levels of 1561-1600, and the indirect taxes levied by the Crown and the town council contributed to keeping real wages stagnant at around the low levels of 1665-80 between 1681 and 1700. Although this issue merits further research, it seems unlikely that building labourers and craftsmen could have offset the decline in their real wages through an increase in the number of hours worked or a rise in the number of work days.","[Andres Ucendo, J.

However, there are currently few methods available through which we can understand and communicate humanity's dependence on these cycles. This paper presents a novel method, based on input-output analysis, for deriving a suite of indicators describing the level at which the global economy, through its transformation of useful resources (i.e. raw materials) into residuals (i.e. wastes, pollutants, emissions), is appropriating biogeochemical processes. Furthermore, significant insight into the scale of the global economic system is gained by comparing the rate of human appropriation of biogeochemical cycling with that of the biosphere's regenerative capacity. In order to calculate these indicators, we create a new concept of 'ecotime', defined as the average biogeochemical cycling time available for matter held within differing types of environmental commodities (e.g. carbon dioxide, plants, fossil fuels) to reach biogeochemical processes under consideration. Resources used by the global economy generally have long ecotimes, while the residuals produced by economic activities generally have short ecotimes. Applying our method to an extensive database encompassing the key biogeochemical cycles, it is found that humans are placing significant pressure on these cycles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By quantifying the effect of trade on crop production on grid-cell level and combining it with cell- and crop-specific virtual water contents, we are able to determine green and blue water consumption and savings. Connecting the information on trade-related blue water usage to water shadow prices gives us the possibility to value the impact of international food crop trade on local blue water resources. To determine the trade-related value of the blue water usage, we employ two models: first, an economic land- and water-use model, simulating agricultural trade, production and water-shadow prices and second, a global vegetation and agricultural model, modeling the blue and green virtual water content of the traded crops. Our study found that globally, the international trade of food crops saves blue water worth 2.4 billion US$. This net saving occurs despite the fact that Europe exports virtual blue water in food crops worth 3.1 billion US$. Countries in the Middle East and South Asia profit from trade by importing water intensive crops, countries in Southern Europe on the other hand export water intensive agricultural goods from water scarce sites, deteriorating local water scarcity.

We present the results of a study in which OC were estimated in dry tropical forest, in western Mexico. We focus on OC of activities which result in forest degradation such as shifting cultivation, grazing of cows, gathering of firewood, and poles for construction. Our approach inventoried the net returns for each activity as OC, stratified by size of forest holding and ownership condition. Cattle provided the largest share of returns, together with the subsidy paid for cultivation. The main implications for the design of REDD+ payments are (I) at minimum, payments for carbon would have to be higher than the government subsidy currently paid for clearance for maize/grazing; (2) the compensation payments, would be between US$160-800 per hectare/year. The social implications of making carbon conservation more profitable than the current uses should be considered as some of the most vulnerable groups may lose their livelihoods. Overall, the opportunity costs per ton of carbon appear to be high compared with the current price of carbon on the international market. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - After putting together a theoretical basis from business studies and institutional economics, the paper explores factual evidence of strategic moves by dairy firms in Brazil. Findings - Danone, despite being a second mover, has been able to effectively make use of new values and collective concerns regarding food functionality to create a favourable institutional set in which to operate. Other firms have not been able to challenge its position in the market, simply abiding by the concepts and values created by Danone. Practical implications - On the one hand, case studies based on traditional economic theories usually approach markets with supply and demand adjustment tools or taking technology as exogenous and the sole determinant of the existence of a market. On the other hand, traditional business theories highlight an individual entrepreneur as the only relevant object of analysis. This study offers an alternative guideline to study markets with creative players that craft not only new physical products or directly delivered services, but also concepts and ideas Studies of other markets or similar markets in different countries can benefit from its insights. Originality/value - The functional yogurt market in Brazil has not previously been object of academic research, and the combined framework of analysis in this study may offer guidance for other market studies.","[Almeida, Felipe] Univ Fed Pampa, Santana Do Livramento, Brazil; [de Paula, Nilson; Pessali, Huascar] Univ Fed Parana, BR-80060000 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Pampa; Universidade Federal do Parana,"Pessali, H (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Parana, BR-80060000 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",pessali@ufpr.br,"Almeida, Felipe/H-6457-2016; Pessali, Huascar F/C-9907-2014; de Paula, Nilson/I-5336-2018","Pessali, Huascar F/0000-0002-5770-4653; de Paula, Nilson/0000-0002-2143-5172",Brazilian Research Council (CNPq),Brazilian Research Council (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),The authors thank Luiz Alberto Esteves and Wilfred Dolfsma for helpful comments on previous versions of the paper.

This is the case for PFM in the two Ethiopian pioneer sites, Dodola and Chilimo that represent two distinct PFM approaches in Ethiopia. This paper analyses how PFM, after controlling pre-PFM differences, affects members of forest user groups (FUGs) and non-members' total annual incomes, forest incomes, expenditures and livestock asset holdings. Income and asset data were collected from 635 randomly selected households. Data were analysed using propensity score matching models. Results show that in Dodola, where commercial timber harvest is allowed, the introduction of PFM means that FUGs have higher livestock assets and forest income than non-members. The average total income and the expenditure for members and nonmembers, however, were not significantly different. In Chilimo site, the result is the opposite the introduction of PFM means that FUG members have lower total incomes and assets than non-members. Based on our findings we recommend that the PHA scaling up approaches in Ethiopia, which currently allow FUGs only subsistence use from forest resources, need to be revised. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

All presented models are a tools for building forecasts. The differences between the models arise from econometric assumptions. In addition to the adaptive models is not possible the interpretation of the strength of the influence of independing variables. With regard to the quality of the forecasts generated models presented in the article may be comparable. In practice, in certain situation it is important to use the forecasts, which are built on the basis of short past. This may be due to the lack of relevant data. From the point of view of practical importance is the level of accuracy of predictions in relation to expectations. Comparative analysis of forecasting properties will be carried out on the example of the price of gold.","Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Finance & Insurance, Dept Appl Math, PL-40276 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Barczak, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Finance & Insurance, Dept Appl Math, Ul Gen K Pulaskiego 25, PL-40276 Katowice, Poland.",stanislaw.barczak@ue.katowice.pl,,"Barczak, Stanislaw/0000-0003-2074-9580",,,,,10,3,3,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,63,73,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700007,0

Design/methodology/approach - A case study format was selected for this investigation. The focal company selected offers a large number of products derived from beef for different commercialisation channels in the domestic and foreign market. A non-probability sample of 30 suppliers (cattle farmers) of the focal company provided data on finished steers sold in 2010, according to the three types of governance used in the transactions (spot market, forward contracts and long-term contracts). Findings - The simultaneous use of more than one type of governance structure to coordinate similar transactions has been termed plural forms of governance in the literature. In Brazil, new forms of governance, such as formal and informal contracts, have been adopted for transactions between beef processing companies and cattle farmers, in addition to the use of spot market and vertical integration. It has been shown that the adoption of plural forms reduces the risk of complex transactions; and is a strategy to deal with unpredictable institutional environments and high heterogeneity of both suppliers and distribution channels. Research limitations/implications - The research provides empirical evidence of plural forms of governance, as well as the reasons for the adoption of this strategy by firms, which contributes to the ongoing theoretical discussion on this subject. Practical implications - The paper has implications for company supply chain management. Originality/value - This paper presents theoretical review on plural forms of governance, new empirical evidence and determinant factors for their adoption.","[Carrer, Marcelo Jose; de Souza Filho, Hildo Meirelles] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Prod Engn, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Brandao Vinholis, Marcela de Melo] Brazilian Agr Res Corp EMBRAPA, Dept Res, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"de Souza, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Prod Engn, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",hildo@dep.ufscar.br,"Vinholis, Marcela/C-7525-2013; Souza Filho, Hildo/C-9164-2013","Carrer, Marcelo Jose/0000-0001-8511-2543; Vinholis, Marcela/0000-0003-3033-0230; Souza Filho, Hildo/0000-0002-7580-157X",FAPESP - Sao Paulo Research Foundation,FAPESP - Sao Paulo Research Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),The authors would like to thank FAPESP - Sao Paulo Research Foundation for financial support.,,31,14,15,1,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

There is international evidence to suggest socio-economic influence on food outlet availability and healthfulness within these environments; however the situation in the UK is unclear. The purpose of this paper is to describe food outlet provision (frequency and type) within primary school fringes across the spectrum of deprivation. Design/methodology/approach - Ten primary schools in Newcastle upon Tyne were purposefully selected from a comprehensive list of all schools within the region. Two schools were chosen at random from each quintile of deprivation. A total of 400-metre buffer zones around schools were audited. School fringe food environments were classified using a Food Outlet Classification System. Access (i.e. frequency), and type of food outlets were compared to area level deprivation, obesity prevalence rates and area type. Findings - Food outlet frequency was highest in the most deprived school fringe area. Convenience stores and takeaways represented the greatest proportion of total food outlets across all school fringe environments. More total food outlets were observed in fringes with above national average obesity prevalence rates for children. Research limitations/implications - UK case study approach limits widespread and international applicability. Practical implications - Informs school, health and urban planning disciplines regarding current picture of UK school fringes. Originality/value - Provides evidence in UK context that area deprivation and Census 2001 Supergroup class show significant correlations with school fringe food environment.","[Gallo, Rachel G.] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Barrett, Lisa] Northumbria Univ, Sch Life Sci, Sch Biol Food & Nutr, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Lake, Amelia A.] Univ Durham, Ctr Publ Policy & Hlth, Sch Med Pharm & Hlth, Stockton On Tees, England",Newcastle University - UK; Northumbria University; Durham University,"Gallo, RG (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",rachel.gallo@ncl.ac.uk,,"Lake, Amelia/0000-0002-4657-8938",ESRC; NEPHO; Medical Research Council [MR/K02325X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NEPHO; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Many thanks to Tom Burgoine for his assistance in the initial stages of GIS mapping, and for RG's funders ESRC and NEPHO (funders had no input in research at any stage) and supervisors Tim Townshend and Louisa Ells.",,72,6,6,2,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Regional policy goals aim to balance economic performance with the sustainable use of natural resources. From a practical perspective, challenges arise when measuring sustainability levels that mix multiple dimensions, scales, and benchmarks. This study addresses these challenges by comparing the sustainability of agricultural systems across varied crops, land types, and cropping techniques in China's Loess Plateau. Sustainability levels for each system are compared to benchmarks using data envelopment analysis, which is then used to calculate a sustainable value (SV). The SV approach provides a monetary measure of sustainability that includes economic, environmental and social dimensions. Results demonstrate that the most sustainable agricultural systems in the Loess Plateau involve machine intensive cropping systems, a corn-soybean-corn rotation, mulching, furrows ridging, and bench terracing.

It supplies society with valuable ecosystem services, including the provision of food, the regeneration of nutrients and the sequestration of carbon. Technological advancements in the second half of the 20th century made large-scale exploitation of mineral, hydrocarbon and fish resources possible. These economic activities, combined with climate change impacts, constitute a considerable threat to deep-sea biodiversity. Many governments, including that of the UK, have therefore decided to implement additional protected areas in their waters of national jurisdiction. To support the decision process and to improve our understanding for the acceptance of marine conservation plans across the general public, a choice experiment survey asked Scottish households for their willingness-to-pay for additional marine protected areas in the Scottish deep-sea. This study is one of the first to use valuation methodologies to investigate public preferences for the protection of deep-sea ecosystems. The experiment focused on the elicitation of economic values for two aspects of marine biodiversity: (i) the existence value for deep-sea species and (ii) the option value of deep-sea organisms as a source for future medicinal products.

Youth entrepreneurship and self-employment is one of possible ways to decrease unemployment rates. Therefore, it is of a significant interest to explore how entrepreneurial attitudes of the youth have developed in the past decade and how these attitudes relate to actual entrepreneurial activity. Our analysis is based on the data from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor project that were collected in the Czech Republic in years 2006, 2011 and 2013. A representative sample of adult population between 18 and 64 years of age answered questions mapping their entrepreneurial attitudes and entrepreneurial activity. Results show some improvements in the area of entrepreneurial attitudes. Compared with 2006, young people were more entrepreneurially active in 2013. However, the practical absence of nascent entrepreneurship among the young and unemployed in 2013 is disturbing. We suggest a change in primary and early secondary education, which should be more focused on the development entrepreneurial attitudes and skills.","[Lukes, Martin; Zouhar, Jan] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Lukes, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",lukesm@vse.cz; jan.zouhar@vse.cz,"Lukes, Martin/G-2677-2019; Zouhar, Jan/E-9659-2013","Lukes, Martin/0000-0001-9063-9251; Zouhar, Jan/0000-0002-1164-7948",,,,,15,1,1,0,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,879,887,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700086,0

It then seeks to hypothesise how this information can be used to determine whether and how additional value can be created in the chain. Design/methodology/approach - The chain used was that from sourcing to retail sale of walnuts in the UK. The data used were: UK import price/quantity/origin and total consumption data, global comparisons for import price/quantity/origin and total consumption data. Findings - This paper validates predictions for walnut quality, market size and pricing from a simple model for the UK walnut market. The UK walnut market is small (0.26 g/capita/day) but expanding per capita (8 per cent pa). Import prices are low (15-25 per cent below several other major EU importers) but rising in real terms (7 per cent pa). The UK generally sources walnuts opportunistically from low cost low international standard quality suppliers. These findings are consistent with model predictions of market behaviour and previous findings on walnut quality. Practical implications - There may be an opportunity to improve quality specifications for the UK walnut market Wor to expand the UK market into higher quality uses. Both options require educating the UK consumer market in the additional consumer value created. Originality/value - The study indicates the extent of price seeking purchasing behaviour within global markets for an agricultural product (walnuts). It shows this is not a globally consistent market response and thus offers opportunities for all participants in the UK walnut retail value chain to provide enhanced consumer value.","[McNeil, D.

In order to determine the health potential of the NND, a six-month, controlled dietary intervention trial was conducted, in which participants procured NND foods at a specially designed intervention supermarket and prepared and consumed NND meals in their homes. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative sociological study was conducted among intervention participants in order to explore whether and how they appropriated this diet into their everyday food practices. Findings - Participants appropriated the NND by becoming co-producers of this diet, tailoring it to accord with individual preferences and the demands of everyday life. Findings indicate that while the taste of the NND is likely to appeal to wider groups of consumers, the tasks of food procurement and preparation are likely to constitute barriers to its adoption. The strictly controlled intervention setting enabled participants to learn how to comply with dietary composition despite their deviations from given menu-plans and recipes. The extent to which such compliance would be achieved outside this context by other consumers is questioned. Further studies are needed to determine whether more widespread consumption of the NND would in practice comply with Nordic dietary recommendations. Originality/value - The study provides insights relevant to health agencies, public health researchers and food companies regarding consumer appropriation of a dietary system, the health benefits of which are dependent upon dietary compliance.","[Micheelsen, Arun; Holm, Lotte; Jensen, Katherine O'Doherty] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Micheelsen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",armi@foi.ku.dk,"Holm, Lotte/L-7954-2014","Holm, Lotte/0000-0003-0667-7779",Nordea Foundation,Nordea Foundation,The OPUS research project is funded by the Nordea Foundation.

It adds to the existing literature by explicitly modeling squatting on government-owned land and presents a unified framework for analysis of issues related to squatting, urban planning and policy. In the model, a squatter-organizer optimally controls squatting so as to forestall eviction. The model highlights how the existence of an eviction cost leads to formal residents tolerating squatting, trading-off open space to avoid paying taxes toward evicting squatters. The paper derives comparative-static results under some functional form assumptions. The analysis is extended to examine the comparative-static effects for the case where squatters freely migrate into the city. The framework for exploring a combined model of squatting on government and private land is also laid out. Finally, some policy analysis of squatter formalization is carried out.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Shah, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",nilopa.shah@uci.edu,,,,,,,18,5,9,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Design/methodology/approach - The research uses the news database Nexis and focuses on the period since the global financial crisis in 2007 in nine national UK print media titles. The search criteria included mention of the term food bank at least three times in the newspaper article and a UK focus. This resulted in 190 usable articles from the newspapers. Findings - There were no UK-focused newspaper articles before 2008 and few until 2012 when the number increased dramatically. A key theme in reporting was increasing numbers of food banks and users of them. The data most often cited were from the Christian charity The Trussell Trust which runs a franchise system of food banks. There were clusters of newspaper articles indicating a common source. Few of the articles used direct quotes from current food bank users. A frame contest appeared in 2013/early 2014 with newspaper articles reporting both changes in welfare provision and the proliferation of food banks as the reason for the increase in food banks and food bank use. Tensions emerged between three key sets of players: government ministers, church leaders and The Trussell Trust as the key provider of food banks in England. Research limitations/implications - The authors only examined newspapers, the reporting in other media may be different. Practical implications - The media reporting of food poverty and the use of food banks has the potential to influence public perceptions and policy.

Traditionally, QFD rates the design requirements (DRs) with respect to customer needs, and aggregates the ratings to get relative importance scores of DRs. An increasing number of studies stress on the need to incorporate additional factors, such as cost and environmental impact, while calculating the relative importance of DRs. However, there is a paucity of methodologies for deriving the relative importance of DRs when several additional factors are considered. Ramanathan and Yunfeng [43] proved that the relative importance values computed by data envelopment analysis (DEA) coincide with traditional QFD calculations when only the ratings of DRs with respect to customer needs are considered, and only one additional factor, namely cost, is considered. Also, Kamvysi et al. [27] discussed the combination of QFD with analytic hierarchy process-analytic network process (AHP-ANP) and DEAHP-DEANP methodologies to prioritize selection criteria in a service context.

We consider three cases of attendance, namely that people may always, sometimes, or never pay attention to a given attribute in making their choices. This allows a series of models to be estimated which addresses the following questions: To what extent do respondents ignore attributes in choice experiments? What is the impact of alternative strategies for dealing with attribute non-attendance? Can respondents reliably self-report non-attendance? Do respondents partially attend to attributes, and what are the implications of this? Our results show that allowing for the instance of 'sometimes attending' to attributes in making choices offers advantages over methods employed thus far in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Given that nations are sovereign enforcing compliance with IEAs cannot rely on the presence of a strong sanctioning body. Nonetheless, enforcement provisions must be effective in the sense that they will deter non-compliance and credible in the sense that they will actually be imposed. In this paper, we address the problem of enforcing compliance with IEAs by examining one promising mechanism-a deposit-refund system-that exhibits the necessary features for effective enforcement. We analyze a simple model to demonstrate the desirable properties of the mechanism and then consider the effects of imperfect monitoring, uncertainty, partial participation and reputation on the effectiveness of a deposit-refund system.","Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"McEvoy, DM (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, 3108 Raley Hall,416 Howard St, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",mcevoydm@appstate.edu,,,,,,,31,6,7,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Synthesizing political ecology with ecological economics, we argue that this way of framing the question is limited. We propose a reformulation of the question into when and how to value with money? and under what conditions? We recommend four criteria for a sound choice: environmental improvement; distributive justice and equality; maintenance of plural value-articulating institutions; and, confronting commodification under neo-liberalism. We call for due attention to the socio-political context within which a valuation is placed and the political goals it serves. The relevance of this framework is demonstrated by applying it to three practical cases: pollution damages, water pricing and payments for ecosystem services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, different analytical techniques are needed that take into consideration more than monetary income to fully capture these additional benefits to better understand the production decisions of smallholder farmers. We build on previous work on the household model and shadow wage estimation to develop a shadow wage for Ecuadorian cacao producers that includes these nonmarket benefits. We found that the shadow wage correctly indicated that, on average, these households would prefer to use an agroforestry production system instead of the more profitable modern system because of the nonmarket benefits received from the former system.

The survey covers theoretical modelling approaches and empirical studies including experimental work. Central to our survey is the question how the political process impacts different stages of agreement formation and stability. We distinguish the rules defined during pre-negotiations that govern negotiations, ratification and implementation. Strategic delegation and lobbying are directly relevant during the negotiation and ratification phases. Implementation, the choice of policy instruments at the national level, will also be impacted by lobbying and indirectly influence negotiations. We find that the basic theoretical framework for the analysis of international environmental agreements is largely unrelated to empirical approaches. Furthermore, we observe that models of the political process of agreement formation, like for example sequential game models, are yet to be developed.","[Wangler, Leo] Inst Innovat & Tech, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Altamirano-Cabrera, Juan-Carlos] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Dept Econ, Growth & Environm Grp, Mexico City 13, DF, Mexico; [Weikard, Hans-Peter] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; Wageningen University & Research,"Weikard, HP (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",wangler@iit-berlin.de; jcarlos.altamirano@gmail.com; hans-peter.weikard@wur.nl,"Weikard, Hans-Peter/O-1120-2013","Weikard, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-5209-9845",,,,,102,25,30,0,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Our approach allows us to estimate individual-specific preferences for recreational use of different forest types. These estimates are used in a second stage of the analysis where we test whether preferences depend on access to recreation sites. We find that there is significant preference heterogeneity with respect to most forest attributes. The spatial analysis shows that preferences for forests with parking and picnic facilities are correlated with having access to such forests while for the other attributes considered (dominant tree species, trekking paths and presence of lake and rivers) we find no correlation between stated preferences and accessibility. This implies that the problem of endogenous distances in the travel cost method (Parsons, 1991) may be present in the estimation of welfare economic values for parking and picnic facilities in the analyzed model. The results underline the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity of preferences carrying out economic valuation of spatial-delineated environmental goods and that the spatial variation in willingness to pay for such goods is not only explained by the users' transport costs of accessing the sites.

In order to improve the prediction accuracy of aggregated land use share models, we propose in this paper a methodological contribution by controlling for both unobserved individual heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. Our model is a land use shares model applied to aggregated data in France. Our data-set is a panel which covers both time series observations from 1992 to 2003 and cross-sectional observations by Departement (equivalent to NUTS3 regions). We consider four land use classes: (1) agriculture, (2) forest, (3) urban and (4) other use. We investigate the relation between the areas in land in different alternative uses and economic and demographic factors influencing land use decisions. Based on the comparison of prediction accuracy of different model specifications, our findings are threefold: First, controlling for both unobserved individual heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation outperforms any other specification in which spatial autocorrelation and/or individual heterogeneity are ignored. Second, accounting for cross-equation correlations does not seem to improve the prediction performances and finally, ignoring individual heterogeneity introduces substantial loss in prediction accuracy.

The main contribution of this work is to compare estimates of energy thresholds in the form of minimum energy requirements to reach high levels of development with output projections of per capita final energy supply from a group of integrated assessment models (IAMs). Scenarios project that reductions of carbon emissions in-developing countries will be achieved not only by means of decreasing the carbon intensity, but also by making a significant break with the historically observed relationship between energy use and economic growth. We discuss the feasibility of achieving, on time scales acceptable for developing countries, both decarbonization and the needed structural changes or efficiency improvements, concluding that the decreases in energy consumption implied in numerous mitigation scenarios are unlikely to be achieved without endangering sustainable development objectives. To underscore the importance of basic energy needs also in the future, the role of infrastructure is highlighted, using steel and cement as examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The quest for a higher status is assimilated to a preference for capital wealth. The government uses income tax to finance infrastructure and environmental protection. We find that accounting for preferences for social status and environmental quality may lead to an allocation of tax revenue in favor of a cleanup effort to the detriment of infrastructure. Economic growth is not necessarily and negatively affected by this allocation as it is partly explained by an excessive accumulation of capital wealth due to the quest of status. Status seeking can however harm economic growth and environmental quality when its motive is important enough. Finally, we show that economic growth may be consistent with environmental preservation but is not necessarily welfare-improving as in the case of absence of status-seeking behavior.

Carbon emissions generally depend on technology and scale. Given the technology options, abatement is possible without a substantial reduction in scale. Otherwise the change must come purely through a reduction in demand. Our analysis shows that the cost of environmental policy is considerably overestimated by top-down models if a bottom-up abatement cost curve is not included. Using the data for the Swiss economy, we demonstrate two techniques of representing an abatement function explicitly in a computable general equilibrium model: a traditional and a hybrid (discrete technology modeling) approach. The results suggest that the current climate policy in Switzerland will not be able to move the economy towards the required 10% CO2 reduction. Both approaches provide virtually the same results when the calibration process is precisely executed, which contradicts the results of previous studies. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have theoretically argued that such minimum distance requirements may lead to a so-called 'domino effect' where farmers who want to grow transgenic maize are forced to grow the non-transgenic variety and in turn impose the same constraints on their neighbors. This article applies a spatially explicit farm model to a dairy region in the Southern Netherlands to assess how farmers growing non-transgenic maize limit other farmers' potential to grow transgenic herbicide-resistant maize. The results indicate that the minimum distance requirements can severely limit the benefits from herbicide resistant maize. Having different land use options in one farm, however, enables dairy farmers to grow transgenic maize despite having one or more neighbors growing non-transgenic maize. We also find that the share of the domino effect in the overall impact of minimum distance requirements decreases with the density of farmers not growing transgenic maize. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The balanced scorecard (BSC) which links financial and non-financial, tangible and intangible, inward and outward factors can provide an integrated viewpoint for decision makers in selecting optimal NPD projects. Considering the interrelated perspectives and criteria of BSC, ANP is used to obtain the weights of the criteria. TOPSIS is used for simplifying ANP to rank the alternatives. After reviewing the literature on BSC, the study collected criteria for selecting optimal NPD projects. Likert nine-point scale questionnaires based on the BSC criteria were received from 34 senior executives to obtain the importance of criteria. Findings - Based on the geometric mean values, the top 12 criteria are: Capabilities, Well-being, Satisfaction, Lead-time, Risk, Facility, Reputation, Loyalty, New customer, Market, Profitability and New market to structure the hierarchy for century-old Taiwanese food business NPD project selection. Practical implications - Using the hierarchy based on four perspectives and 12 important criteria, century-old Taiwanese food businesses may select the optimal NPD projects more effectively. Moreover, the practical application of the proposed approach illustrated is generic and also suitable for century-old Taiwanese food businesses. Originality/value - In 2008, Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) established an association to help century-old businesses to maintain growth and competitive advantage. To maintain continuous competitive advantage, developing new products is necessary. However, NPD is a risky process. The vital issue in NPD is how to select the optimal projects for new products. The majority of century-old Taiwanese businesses are in the food industry. This paper contributes to a more effective selection of optimal NPD projects for century-old Taiwanese food firms.","Hsuan Chuang Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Hsinchu, Taiwan",Hsuan Chuang University,"Chang, KL (通讯作者)，Hsuan Chuang Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",cs821@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,43,19,19,1,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Consumer survey was conducted by using a face to face interview method for a sample of 298 students. The hypotheses of this study are risk benefit perceptions and concerns about the current labeling policy likely to determine students' support for mandatory labeling of GMF. The questionnaire employed for the survey mainly focuses on the questions such as students' perceptions about GMF and opinions about current labeling policy in India. Probit model was used to analyze the determinants of young consumers' support for this policy. Findings - The authors found that 58 per cent of the students support mandatory labeling of GMF and 39 per cent of the students are willing to pay 10-15 per cent more price for foods under this policy. Young consumers who have knowledge about GM technology are more likely to support this policy. Young consumers' dissatisfaction with the current labeling, and demand for information about food production have a positive influence on support for this policy. Those young consumers who use food labels regularly are likely to support this policy and young consumers' trust in university for truthful information about GMF has a positive influence. Whereas, students' risk benefits perception and moral concerns about GMF have an insignificant influence. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of the study are that it focused only on university students and used small sample size. Hence, further studies are recommended for overall consumer representative sample. Practical implications - The findings of this study will be helpful for further research on consumers and mandatory labeling of GMF in India, and also provide some useful information for marketing of GMF in India. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge this is the first study that analyzes the determinants of young consumers' support for mandatory labeling policy for GMF in India.","[Kajale, Dilip Babasaheb; Becker, Tilman C.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Policy & Agr Markets 420, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Kajale, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Policy & Agr Markets 420, Stuttgart, Germany.",kajaledilip27@gmail.com,,"Becker, Tilman/0000-0002-2454-1712; Kajale, Dilip/0009-0007-8518-4943",,,,,43,8,8,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In addition, this study investigates whether being an active practitioner of angling or whether belonging to a household with angling activity has an effect on consumers' choices. Design/methodology/approach - Consumers' habits, profiles, and perceptions were obtained from randomized personal interviews (n = 395) at traditional markets (the main source of fresh fish for Spaniards) and from interviews with restaurant managers (n = 11) carried out on Mallorca Island, in the West Mediterranean, in 2009. Findings - A wide range of middle-aged and middle-class residents consumed fresh fish. The residents in the sample preferred to buy fish in traditional retail markets and consumed fish at least once a week, including a wide range of species. Consumers were satisfied with the quality of the fish but were moderately unsatisfied with the information that they received about the fish and fisheries. Although fish price was a factor in decisions to purchase, consumers were willing to pay more for local products of good quality. A significant proportion of individuals in the sample were themselves recreational fishers or belonged to households with recreational fishing members. These individuals shared a different consumer profile, tending to prefer local species that come at higher prices. A parallel survey of fish restaurants showed differences in preferred species depending on customers' place of residency and nationality. Practical implications - The consumer trends that were identified and the perception of fresh fish captured by local fleets might have implications for commercialization and fishery management. Originality/value - This is the first study of consumer choice related to leisure activity in a country with a very high rate of fish consumption.","[Morales-Nin, Beatriz; Cardona-Pons, Federico; Garcia, Eugenio; Alvarez, Itziar; Perez-Mayol, Silvia] Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats IMEDEA UIB CSIC, Esporles, Spain; [Maria Grau, Antonio] Direccio Gen Pesca, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC),"Morales-Nin, B (通讯作者)，Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats IMEDEA UIB CSIC, Esporles, Spain.",beatriz@imedea.uib-csic.es,"Alvarez, Itziar/AAY-5180-2021; Cardona, Federico/M-4439-2014","Alvarez, Itziar/0000-0003-4128-9149; Morales-Nin, Beatriz/0000-0002-7264-0918; Perez-Mayol, Silvia/0000-0003-3974-7657",,,,,16,14,15,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Surfinias (high needs) and Begonias (low needs) were fertilized with three organic based fertilizers (Daniels (R), Biofert (TM) and Solo-Tek Grow (TM)) and compared to a control (conventional fertilization program). Surfinia as well as Begonia plants fertilized with the three organic based fertilizers showed the same quality than those grown under conventional fertilization. Differences between treatments were detected for substrate pH and electrical conductivity. Leaf tissue analyses revealed nutrient deficiencies for some treatments with however no visible deficiency symptoms. Because of their low cost, lower impact on the environment and ease of use with conventional greenhouse equipment, organic based fertilizers have a good potential for inclusion in a bedding plant production fertilization program.","[Rochefort, S.; O'Donoughue, L.; Authier, N.; Delorme, M.] IQDHO, St Hyacinthe, PQ, Canada",,"Rochefort, S (通讯作者)，IQDHO, St Hyacinthe, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,9,2,3,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66052-57-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2013,982.0,,,,,,53,60,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture; Soil Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGP15,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323698200004,0

While retailers seek new sources of competitive advantage, the perspective to customer experiences should be extended from the in-store activities to post-purchase where the value-in-use of the groceries eventually actualises. In this quest for an enhanced customer experience, the possibilities provided by Internet-based service applications have been an underexplored area of research. Towards that end, the purpose of this paper is to explore and analyse how such service applications can facilitate customers' post-purchase experiences in the context of food retailing. Design/methodology/approach - A case study research setting was applied focusing on an internet-based service application that provides customers with detailed information about the healthfulness of their groceries. Altogether 456 submissions of customer feedback data and 16 customer interviews were generated and analysed. Subsequently, a typology of facilitating customers' post-purchase food retail experiences was constructed to uncover and illustrate how the service succeeds in extending the customer food retail experience towards the customer's context. Findings - The authors identified four types of the typology, including Playing, Check-pointing, Learning, and Goal-orientation. These four types can be conceptualised through the utilitarian versus hedonic dimensions and the degree of customer transformation. Originality/value - The paper introduces internet-based service applications as a suitable experiential marketing strategy. It offers a fresh perspective and new insight into leveraging on the capabilities of the Internet in facilitating customers' post-purchase food retail experiences.","[Saarijarvi, Hannu; Kuusela, Hannu] Univ Tampere, Sch Management, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland; [Rintamaki, Timo] Univ Tampere, Sch Management, Res & Educ Ctr Synergos, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland",Tampere University; Tampere University,"Saarijärvi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Sch Management, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland.",hannu.saarijarvi@uta.fi,,"Saarijarvi, Hannu/0000-0001-5803-9037",Tekes - the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation,Tekes - the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation(Finnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),This study is part of a wider research project (Serve - Pioneers of Service Business) funded by Tekes - the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation.,,32,10,11,4,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Despite problems within it, it is ecological economics which is now emerging as the most potent opponent to neo-classical economics. It is ecological economics which addresses the most profound failure of neoclassical economics, the failure to deal adequately with resource depletion and environmental destruction both locally and globally (Costanca, 1991). The complex challenges are anchored in a deep conflict between mainstream economics and the natural and social conditions, to harmonize this connection it would seem necessary to develop a valid understanding of the interconnectedness between economy, nature and society. The idea behind this article is four-fold. Firstly, we describe and discuss the ontological worldview in ecological economics. Secondly, the epistemological consequences of the ontological preconditions are discussed. Thirdly, some of the main concepts and principles in ecological economics are focused on.

It suggests that reorienting the current unsustainable and inequitable path and implementing the degrowth transition in an ecologically sustainable and socially equitable manner requires a shift in the hierarchy of social norms, from the property-based economic rationale, where social and ecological considerations are subordinated to the specific requirements of capitalist expansion, towards an eco-social economic rationale, where economic activities are subordinated to social and ecological considerations and imperatives. Such an eco-social rationale could subordinate property capitalist expansion through the following, interrelated ways: limiting the scope of the property domain, regulating capitalisation practices, orienting investments, distributing returns and limiting the capitalist expansion of property. Nonetheless, getting out of the involutionary path of western development might require more radical alternatives, such as non-property, possession-based institutional arrangements and partnerships.

Determining the benefits of improving the state of marine areas has drawn increasing attention, especially with the establishment of the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive. However, existing knowledge of the benefits provided by marine ecosystem services in Europe is limited and context-specific. This study applies meta-analysis to summarize available information on the value of reducing eutrophication in European sea areas, and to provide welfare predictions for different scenarios. The challenges related to the small number of available studies are addressed by employing a Bayesian meta-regression. Several models are compared with prior and posterior predictive checks, and value predictions are estimated using Bayesian model averaging. The results indicate that the perceived benefits of reducing eutrophication in European marine areas can be considerable, with the predicted annual willingness to pay per person ranging from $6 for small local changes to $235 for substantial changes covering large sea areas. The findings suggest that values differ between marine regions, highlighting the importance of investigating previously unstudied geographical areas. As marine policy requires international cooperation, future studies would also benefit from collaboration between countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Scott, P",,,,"Scott, Peter",,,The determinants of competitive success in the interwar British radio industry,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MARKET,"This article discusses the sources of competitive advantage in the interwar British radio industry. Specifically, it examines why sections of the industry that reaped substantial monopoly rents from the downstream value chain failed to dominate the industry. During the 1920s Marconi (which controlled the fundamental UK patents) had a key cost advantage, as had other members of the 'Big Six' electrical engineering firms which formed the BBC and were granted preferential royalties. Meanwhile the valve manufacturers' cartel was also able to extract high rents from set manufacturers. The vertical integration literature suggests that input monopolists have incentives to control downstream production. Yet-in contrast to the gramophone industry, which became concentrated into two huge companies following market saturation in the 1930s-radio retained a much more competitive structure. The Big Six failed to capitalize fully on their initial cost advantages owing to logistical weaknesses in supplying markets subject to rapid technical and design obsolescence. Subsequently, during the 1930s, marketing innovations are shown to have played a key role in allowing several independents to establish successful brands. This gave them sufficient scale to provide strong bargaining positions with input suppliers, negating most of their initial cost disadvantage.","Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Scott, P (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",,,"Scott, Peter/0000-0003-1230-9040",,,,,37,6,6,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Our model captures the idea that status (which depends on relative performance) in a community influences a person's well-being. In our main specification, relative performance depends on the absolute difference in after-tax profits. We show that overharvesting resulting from the tragedy of the commons problem is exacerbated by the desire for higher relative performance, leading to a smaller steady-state fish stock and smaller steady-state profit for all the fishermen. We also consider alternative specifications where status depends on the absolute difference in harvests or relative difference in profits, or where there is heterogeneity in the degree to which status matters, or allowing for the possibility of extinction. In all these specifications, status further reduces the steady-state fish stock. We examine taxes and an individual quota as policy alternatives and find support for using the direct quantity method to implement the socially efficient stock level. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Doing this avoids several well-known empirical problems associated with construction and use of aggregated inputs and outputs, the assumption of separability among inputs and outputs, and the estimation of reduced forms. Using time-demeaned data for a balanced panel of families from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child Sample for 1994-2000, we estimate an output-oriented directional distance function that simultaneously relates good and bad inputs from home, school, and environment, to good and bad outcomes, measured as children's math and reading test scores as well as parent-reported behavior problems. We are able for the first time to compute partial effects among endogenous outputs. Recovering consistent estimates of time-invariant coefficients using a second-stage estimator, we find that some time-invariant variables are significant. We also measure productivity growth, technical change, efficiency change, and technical efficiency. Children's productivity growth is highest at age 5 years and diminishes thereafter.

The eco-label has been recognized as a means of promoting products with lower environmental impact. A considerable body of literature has focused on consumer demand for eco-label use: however, little attention has been paid to producers. Because the adoption decision is voluntary, a better understanding of producers' adoption behaviors towards eco-labels could significantly determine the effectiveness of the program. This paper contributes to this policy issue by assessing the impacts of the Taiwan Good Agricultural Products program, a combined eco-label and food traceability system, on the distribution of aquaculture producers' income in Taiwan. Using a unique aquaculture producer survey in Taiwan, we examine the extent to which label use may affect the level of income, income variability and income inequality of the producers. Our findings suggest that eco-label use increases income and that the effect is more pronounced for producers at the higher percentile range of income distribution. Label use also increases income variability, but no significant effect on income inequality is evident. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we report the results of a choice experiment survey that investigated the preferences of UK residents for the conservation of threatened wildlife in the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania, part of the Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot. We examine the sensitivity of values to species types, the number of species, the number of conservation sites and, more unusually, to potential substitutes/complements. Critically we find some evidence of coherency in preferences. Respondents are willing to pay significant, positive amounts to conserve charismatic and/or endemic species and are scope sensitive to the number of endemic species. In contrast, species which are neither endemic nor charismatic, and the number of conservation sites, do not contribute significantly to utility. Further, changing the overall scope of the 'good' is found to have a significant and differential impact on respondent's choices depending on the species type: as the availability of wildlife increases, we observe substitution effects for non-endemic charismatic species, and complementarity for endemic (non-charismatic) species.

We develop a model of Nash behavior by identical risk neutral harvesters to explain individual equilibrium preferences for enforcement of an efficient harvest quota. If the quota is not enforced well, we demonstrate that individual harvesters will always prefer increased enforcement-either increased monitoring or increased penalties-of the quota. We conduct a test of this theoretical result with data from framed common pool resource experiments conducted in artisanal fishing communities in three regions of Colombia. Subjects were given the opportunity to express their preferences for enforcement by voting on two levels of enforcement of a harvest quota, with and without communication. The two enforcement strategies involved the same probability that the government would audit individual harvesters, but differed in the level of the penalty for noncompliance. Contrary to theory, individuals voted for the lower inefficient penalty about 80% of the time and groups implemented this weaker enforcement strategy over 90% of the time. Giving subjects the opportunity to vote on the enforcement strategy did not lead to more efficient harvests, nor did allowing subjects to communicate before voting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The main objective of this study is to investigate whether or not individuals' preferences for the environmental benefits associated with ES vary depending on types of landscapes within which these benefits are delivered. A latent class model is applied to data obtained from a choice experiment survey of over 1000 respondents sampled across England. The results suggest that individuals have heterogenous preferences for the benefits of ES, though different segments of the population with more homogenous preferences can be identified. In particular, higher levels of benefit are often associated with the operation of ES in landscapes close to where respondents live. This leads to the suggestion that, in order to maximise the benefits of ES, its implementation could take this result into account by encouraging greater uptake from farmers whose land is closer to large populations.

Regarding the technology cost structure, we propose a modified dynamic cost function model that consists of the above equation, the translog variable cost equation containing technical progress as one of the factors, and Euler equations with respect to physical and research and development capital stocks. Using data on eight firms in the Japanese electric-furnace steel industry for the period 1970-1998, the model was empirically validated using the generalized method of moments. An elasticity of production cost with respect to technical progress showed a cost-reducing effect. This fact was influenced by the type of product and the extent of each firm's R&D. Also derived from this model is one reasonable phenomenon of business-cyclically changing the use of endogenous capacity. This economic information supports the appropriateness of the above model, including the assumption of transforming technical progress into an endogenous variable, and the methods of analysis.","[Ueda, Shuzo] Japanese Econ Assoc, Nishikyou Ku, Kyoto 6160027, Japan; [Ueda, Shuzo] Iron & Steel Inst Japan, Nishikyou Ku, Kyoto 6160027, Japan; [Ogawa, Kazuo] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan",Osaka University,"Ueda, S (通讯作者)，Japanese Econ Assoc, Nishikyou Ku, 36-8 Arashiyamauchida Cho, Kyoto 6160027, Japan.",sueda@tulip.sannet.ne.jp; ogawa@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

However, the way to operationalize this approach remains challenging. The present paper illustrates how the concepts of stochastic co-viability, which accounts for dynamic complexities, uncertainties, risk and sustainability constraints, can be useful for the implementation of EBFM. In the present case, this concept is used to identify fishing strategies that satisfy both ecological conservation and economic sustainability in a multi-species, multi-fleet context. Economic Viability Analysis (EVA) and the broader Co-Viability Analysis (CVA), are proposed to expand the usual Population Viability Analysis (PVA) and precautionary approach. An illustration is proposed, using data on the fisheries of Bay of Biscay (France) exploiting the stocks of nephrops and hake. Stochastic simulations show how CVA can guarantee both ecological (stock) and economic (profit) sustainability.

We present other examples of this analytical error, including several by Nobel Prize winners in Economics. We show that Proposition 1 by Chilarescu and Viasu is too obvious to be necessary to prove.

However, when environmental-service (ES) buyers are heterogeneous in their income and water-consumption levels, this scheme may not be optimal, as total payments might become too low and services under-supplied. This paper estimates willingness to pay (WTP) higher fees from hydrological-service buyers in an ongoing PES initiative in an Andean watershed in Colombia, where small, flat user payments have been introduced. ES users fall into two highly heterogeneous categories: smallholder peasants and recreational-house owners. We perform a contingent valuation analysis in a representative sample of 218 households. For improved water services, ES buyers on average are willing to pay monthly about US$1 premium over current flat PES rate. Users' heterogeneity, however, affects significantly this outcome: while recreational-house owners are willing to pay monthly on average US$1.61 more than the current fee, smallholders only US$0.41. Spatial variables, such as distance to the water distribution point and to the town center, importantly influence WTP. Results may help designing user-driven PES schemes in line with efficiency and equity objectives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Land-use planning can be improved if the value of the spatial relationships between land uses can be computed sufficiently easily. In this paper, we developed an economically sound way to incorporate the spatial dimensions (size and connectedness) of ecological networks within cost-benefit analysis. The methodology computes the value of ecological networks by accounting for the essential spatial characteristics (size and configuration) of areas of natural land. This methodology can be generalised to other land uses, which we illustrate using a hypothetical case study that contains all the relevant elements. The optimal configuration of different land uses, which accounts for the value of the ecosystem network, will generate a land-use plan with the highest net benefit. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A decomposed environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) demonstrates that places (such as countries, counties, or cities) following the grow first, clean up later approach (or the first half of the EKC) may obtain economic gains accompanied by extreme environmental sacrifice, excessive social injustice, and income and environmental inequalities. The same place may include communities whose curves differ in shape. Some communities may prosper at the expense of other communities, which may fall into environmental poverty and eventually irreversible environmental degradation and economic failure. Places following alternatives or flat EKCs may be slow in getting out of economic poverty, but enjoy a healthier environment, equality in income and environmental quality, and social justice.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from shopping mall intercepts in Perth, Western Australia, using a structured questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the principal constructs which most influence the consumer's decision to purchase. On the basis of the ways in which honey was consumed within the household, cluster analysis was utilised to group the respondents into meaningful segments. Findings - In Perth, Western Australia, honey is primarily consumed as a spread or a sweetener on breakfast cereals and porridge. However, honey is also used as a marinade, in cakes and cookies and as a beverage. According to the way in which honey is consumed in the household, five clusters were identified. In purchasing honey from a retail store, exploratory factor analysis revealed three principal constructs which were most influential in the consumer's decision to purchase: brand reputation, origin and value for money. Ethnicity was found to have a significant influence on the way in which honey was consumed in the household and the importance of the three constructs extracted.

Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional survey was carried out in Portugal as part of the Pro Children study. In total 1,673 women, mothers of 11-13 year old children, took part in the study. The vegetable intake and sociodemographic characteristics were collected with a self-administered questionnaire in which a precoded 24-hour recall was applied. The analysed sociodemographic characteristics were the number of people and composition of household, educational level, social class and region of residence The associations between preferential or exclusive consumer mothers of vegetable soup (i.e. >= 50 per cent. of total vegetable intake) and sociodemographic characteristics were analysed by a logistic regression model. Findings - The mean intake of vegetable soup was 76.1 g/d and its contribution to total vegetable intake was approximately 45 per cent. The percentage of mothers that were preferential or exclusive consumers of vegetable soup was 41 per cent. Preferential or exclusive vegetable soup intake was less likely among mothers when the number of people in the household was less than four (vs 4; OR: 0.734, 95 per cent CI: 0.577-0.934) and that did not live with their spouse/partner (OR: 0.617, 95 per cent CI: 0.424-0.878).

Design/methodology/approach - A literature review was used to develop the behavioural framework. Exploratory factor analysis was then used to initiate development of a measurement scale, based on a sample of 108 Swedish livestock farmers. Findings - Based on the framework developed, the authors' data suggest unidimensionality of farmers' attitudes to animal welfare and health; and that farmers perceive animal welfare as being about animal health and comfort in particular. Research limitations/implications - Further research should be devoted to this area to develop a more final measurement scale. This could be done by re-evaluating the scale obtained in this paper in both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis settings. The behavioural framework proposed here provides a basis for such scale development and a more rigid framework for evaluating and comparing farmers' attitudes to animal welfare. Practical implications - The behavioural framework and scale development initiated in this paper can be used by policymakers and organizations responsible for quality assurance schemes to develop policy measures and education programmes to re-train farmers' behaviour into a system that supports higher animal welfare and health standards. Originality/value - The originality of this paper is that it develops and uses a behavioural framework based on psychological and psychometric theory to initiate development of a scale to measure farmers' attitudes to animal welfare and health.","[Hansson, Helena; Lagerkvist, Carl Johan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Hansson, H (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",Helena.Hansson@ekon.slu.se,"Hansson, Helena/AAR-2089-2021","Lagerkvist, Carl Johan/0000-0003-1191-9445; Hansson, Helena/0000-0001-9609-4387",,,,,41,18,19,0,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The storage behaviour of the product must be studied before commercialisation of the product. This paper aims to foals on this process. Design/methodology/approach - Extrudates (25 g) prepared under optimised conditions of proportion (rice flour, pulse powder and carrot pomace), moisture content, screw speed and die temperature, were sealed using a polythene sealing machine in LDPE bags and aluminium laminated LDPE bags. The bags were then stored for six months in an incubator at temperature of 38 +/- 2 degrees C to evaluate the stability of the product. The extrudates were analysed for change in colour, hardness, moisture content and sensory characteristics. Findings - Zero- and first-order models were fitted for prediction purposes. The minimum overall change in color Delta E value, minimum increase in moisture content and minimum increase in hardness was observed in aluminium laminated LDPE bags. The zero order model better predicted the variation of L*, b*, Delta E, moisture content and hardness during storage, whereas first order model was better fitted for the a* value. Originality/value - The carrot pomace has the potential to be used as a food ingredient that enhances the nutritional attributes of products along with a reduction in cost. Extruded products were successfully developed in the laboratory using carrot pomace as one of the ingredients.

Therefore this paper aimed to examine the balance between health benefits and risks associated to the birdbeak dogfish consumption, with a special emphasis on the assessment of the risks of toxic metal intake. Design/methodology/approach - Between September 2008 and May 2009, 82 individuals were analysed. The chemical composition (moisture, ash, protein and lipid content), essential elements (zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and sodium (Na)), toxic elements (mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb)) and fatty acid composition were determined using standard procedures. Findings - The species is a lean fish (fat content <2.0 per cent) and for both females and males the mineral concentration in descending order was K > Na > Mg > Fe > Zn > Cu. The edible part of birdbeak dogfish is a good source of several minerals, namely K and Na, reaching respectively ca 18 and 36 per cent of the recommended daily intakes for a 150 g muscle portion. Polyunsaturated fatty acids prevail in the fatty acid composition of both sexes and significant differences between females and males were only found in palmitic acid, arachidonic acid and omega 6. Females attained larger length and higher Hg values. The risk assessment was established for three different consumption scenarios (one and two portions of 150 g per month and one portion of 150 g per week) and showed that only a regular consumption of one portion of a female dogfish per week posed a higher health risk (15 per cent). Practical implications - This study presents the information about the quantity of shark muscle (in g) to be ingested in terms of the PTWI allowing each consumer to have access to the risks and benefits in eating this fish. Originality/value - No data existed for fatty acid profile and risk assessment yet and this is the first information on the essential and toxic elements for the European waters.","[Paiva, Rafaela Barros; Neves, Ana; Sequeira, Vera; Gordo, Leonel Serrano] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Oceanog, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Cardoso, Carlos; Bandarra, Narcisa; Nunes, Maria Leonor] Natl Inst Biol Resources, Lab Res Sea & Fisheries, IP L IPIMAR, Lisbon, Portugal; [Paiva, Rafaela Barros; Sequeira, Vera; Gordo, Leonel Serrano] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Portuguese Institute of Sea & Fisheries Research (IPIMAR); Universidade de Lisboa,"Paiva, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Ctr Oceanog, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal.",rcpaiva@fc.ul.pt,"Oliveira, Maria/ISB-2741-2023; Sequeira, Vera/B-1673-2012; Nunes, Maria Leonor/AAG-7195-2021; Paiva, Rafaela Barros/B-2828-2012; Nunes, Maria Leonor/L-4283-2014; Bandarra, Narcisa/C-4780-2013; Gordo, Leonel/B-3604-2012; Neves, Ana/B-3611-2012","Sequeira, Vera/0000-0001-7173-4982; Paiva, Rafaela Barros/0000-0002-7205-9373; Cardoso, Carlos/0000-0001-7273-0676; Nunes, Maria Leonor/0000-0003-4393-2150; Bandarra, Narcisa/0000-0002-7563-9226; Gordo, Leonel/0000-0002-9144-6061; Neves, Ana/0000-0003-3885-2738",,,,,44,5,6,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Psychological theory suggests behaviour modification is driven by ten experiential and behavioural processes of change. However, their role in food choice remains unclear. Some of these mechanisms may be nothing more than a proxy for self-efficacy, a dominant factor in behaviour change. Thus, the aim of this study is to delineate the importance of processes of change (POCs) in fruit and vegetable intake, over and beyond self-efficacy. Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on a questionnaire survey assessing POCs and self-efficacy in relation to change in fruit and vegetable intake. Participants were 150 university undergraduates. Findings - MANOVA revealed significant differences in both experiential and behavioural processes across stages of behaviour change. These resources were more copious at advanced stages. Controlling for self-efficacy via MANCOVA negated stage differences in consciousness raising. Overall, though, the contribution of experiential and behavioural processes in fruit and vegetable uptake transcended differentials in self-efficacy. The unique or direct contribution of consciousness raising requires further investigation. Research limitations/implications - The findings may not generalise to an older more ethnically diverse population. Practical implications - Fruits and vegetables interventions may require a mixture of cognitive, self-evaluative, and behavioural treatments, over and beyond self-efficacy enhancements.

Also,. it seeks to elaborate the sensorial background of consumer preferences of different green table olives. Design/methodology/approach - Four green table olive samples (Celebi, Domat, Kaba, and Ayvalik) commonly consumed in Turkey were chosen and collected from a local producer. Dimensional measures, salt content, pH value, oil content, titrable acidity, L value, a* value, b* value and texture of samples were assessed by the AOAC methods. A panel described and measured the appearance (greenness, yellowness, globeness), aroma (fresh olive, vinegary, soapy, musty), flavour (sour, salty, bitter, hay, oily) and texture properties (firmness, flesh/stone adherence, fibrousness, watery). In addition, 50 consumers evaluated hedonic values. Findings - The salt content, pH value, oil content, titrable acidity, L value, a value, b* value and texture of samples were found to following values 2.91-5.46 percent, 2.80-3.97, 4.67-18.71 percent, 0.59-1.40 percent, 49.96-69.56, 1.35-17.91, 19.57-45.47 and 434.1-895.7 g. Although prepared with the same technique, many properties of the olives were found different. This difference affected consumer preference and buying intentions as well. Research limitations/implications - The paper provides scientific data for researchers to design similar sensory descriptive analyses for different table olive samples. Originality/value - The paper is helpful both to consumers and traders to determine the proximate and sensory attributes of commercial green olive samples.","[Yilmaz, Emin; Aydeniz, Buket] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Food Engn, Canakkale, Turkey",Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University,"Yilmaz, E (通讯作者)，Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Food Engn, Canakkale, Turkey.",eyilmaz@comu.edu.tr,,"YILMAZ, Emin/0000-0003-1527-5042",,,,,17,15,15,4,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

India's National Policy on Biofuels claims that wastelands are well suited for biofuel production because they are empty and unused. However, in rural Tamil Nadu, a Prosopis juliflora fuelwood energy economy already exists on these lands and services a mix of rural and urban consumers at household and industrial levels. This Prosopis economy currently provides 2.5-103 times more useful energy than would the government's proposed Jatropha curcas biodiesel economy, depending on Jatropha by-product usage. Contrary to the government's claims, growing biofuels on wastelands can weaken, rather than improve, the county's energy security. Further, replacing Prosopis with Jatropha could engender changes in economic and property relations that could further weaken energy security. These findings are not specific to rural Tamil Nadu as Prosopis is widely used as a fuelwood throughout Asia and Africa. Calls to 'develop' degraded lands through biofuel promotion similarly exist in these regions. This study underscores the importance of analyzing wasteland-centered biofuel policies at local levels in order to better understand the changes in human-environment relationships resulting from this policy push.

Choice experiments are used in order to determine how fisher participation rates change under different marine PES programme designs. Various designs, with differing restriction rates, show different rates of adoption. However, fishers show a high utility loss associated with any move away from the current management situation, irrespective of restriction levels. This indicates that PES scheme costs may be high and creating an enabling environment could be important to reducing perceived losses, as could investment into conditional in-kind compensation mechanisms.

The adoption of flexible functional forms to model firm-level technology lets us directly derive different measures of elasticity from the coefficients of the estimated production and cost functions. The use of foreign labour is shown to affect the industry composition in favour of low skill intensive sectors and the estimated cross demand elasticities confirm the complementarity between migrant and native workers found in previous studies. However, the two labour inputs prove to be substitutes in terms of the Morishima elasticity of substitution: in general, firms tend to increase the foreign labour intensity of production in response to a decline in migrants' wage, while the migrant to domestic labour ratio responds to changes in the domestic workers' wage only for firms in low skill intensive sectors.","[Bettin, Giulia; Lo Turco, Alessia; Maggioni, Daniela] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Bettin, Giulia] Univ Politecn Marche, MoFiR, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Marche Polytechnic University,"Bettin, G (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Ple Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",g.bettin@univpm.it; a.loturco@univpm.it; d.maggioni@univpm.it,"BETTIN, GIULIA/AAF-4345-2021","BETTIN, GIULIA/0000-0001-6711-0253; /0000-0002-4942-5486",,,,,37,8,8,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This paper studies the evolution of domestic water consumption as a consequence of increasing agricultural production, as well as the impact that the growing need for water had on the construction of infrastructure for irrigation. To that end, we examine the water consumed in the production of vegetable and animal goods for five different years: 1860, 1900, 1930, 1962 and 2010. From these results, a detailed analysis of the trends in water consumption and changes in compositional patterns is carried out. We determine to what extent the development of the agricultural sector conditioned the construction of new irrigation infrastructure. Finally, a Decomposition Analysis (DA) is applied to analytically identify and quantify the main explanatory factors behind that evolution, and to understand the increase in agricultural water consumption over the long term. Our findings show the large pressures on water resources exerted as a result of the expansion of the Spanish agricultural sector during the last 150 years. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is the first to analyze how neighborhood characteristics influence renters' decisions to move within the neighborhood as well as how these decisions are interrelated with their housing tenure transitions and race. Results demonstrate that homeownership rates have a significant, positive association with the probability that renters stay and/or purchase homes in the current neighborhood. Both the tenure composition of the housing stock and higher neighborhood satisfaction appear to be central in understanding this association. Results also suggest that nonblack renters are more likely to leave neighborhoods that experience growth in the percentage of the black population, while blacks are more likely to stay and purchase homes within such neighborhoods.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Lee, KO (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr,SDE1-03-03, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",rstleeko@nus.edu.sg,"Lee, Kwan Ok/E-2731-2012","Lee, Kwan Ok/0000-0003-2545-2591",,,,,70,19,23,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Enhanced forest inventories and merchandizing yards can help in maximizing value recovery in the forest products supply chain. This study develops an optimization model to analyze the economic impact of enhanced forest inventory information and merchandizing yard operations in the forest products supply chain. The application of the model is demonstrated by using a case study of a hypothetical forest industry in northwestern Ontario, which obtains four log assortment grades from the surrounding eight forest management units. The model analyzes five different scenarios with 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% certainty of tree quality in forest inventory information. The results of the study show that with full certainty of tree quality information, it is possible to gain 49% in gross profit in comparison with a scenario with no certainty. The usefulness of enhanced forest inventory and merchandizing yard in the entire supply chain of forest products industry is recognized by maximizing total value of wood fiber (by allocating right log to the right product), reducing fluctuations in raw wood fiber supply, and minimizing inventory carrying costs and lost sales.

Coupling smart meters and complementary currencies to reinforce the motivation of households for energy savings,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy saving; Motivation; Complementary currencies; Smart metering; Innovative policy instruments; Households; Energy consumption,SELF-DETERMINED MOTIVATION; BEHAVIOR; INFORMATION; COMMUNITY; FEEDBACK; RISKS,"A crucial argument in the debate around smart meter deployment in the EU is the potential for households to save energy. One strand of research in this field has investigated the effects on household energy consumption of the feed-back provided by smart meters. However, another aspect that deserves attention is the motivation for households to use the feed-back to save energy. This paper explores how the emerging trend of using complementary currencies for sustainability policies could translate into new interventions adapted to the smart meter deployment and capable of promoting more autonomous forms of motivation compared to interventions using official currencies. Three systems designs (rewarding, regulatory and hybrid) are presented and discussed within the framework of self-determination theory. Because the rewarding system S1 can contribute positively people's basic needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, it could lead to more autonomous forms of motivation. The conclusions regarding the regulatory system S2 are less clear, although the hybrid variant S3 that integrates mechanisms from the rewarding system into the regulatory system could be perceived as more consonant with people's basic need for autonomy.

International organizations, in which international treaties are being negotiated and created, will have to support this type of cross-disciplinary approach. International institutions, however, were not originally designed to cope with such a cross-disciplinary effort. Rather, most international institutions have emerged in line with the premise of 'functionalism', according to which their role is limited to supplying specialized services, usually as a solution for emerging needs and as a result of historical events. These specialized institutions have thus emerged with little coordination or common planning and have resulted in a global structure that has been referred to as an 'accident of history'. The role that international organizations should and do fulfil with respect to the implementation of the principle of integration is reviewed in this paper. This paper concentrates on trade and investment organizations (the World Trade Organization and the Energy Charter Treaty); it reviews the channels through which non-trade/investment considerations may, or may not, penetrate the decision-making processes of these organizations; the ways these International organizations engage with interdisciplinary issues and how the objectives of other institutions are reflected in their work.","Univ Cambridge Wolfson Coll, Cambridge CB3 9BB, England",University of Cambridge,"Kent, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge Wolfson Coll, Barton Rd, Cambridge CB3 9BB, England.",ak663@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,72,12,12,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

To examine determinants of fisher behaviors, this study develops a coupled behavior-economic model examining how physical, market, and regulatory forces affect commercial fishers' choice of fishing grounds in a small-scale fishery (SSF) in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The model estimates that fishing operations land $396 +/- 110 per trip (mean +/- SD; n = 427 trips), with the highest value in landings arriving from Lang Bank. The model explains 62% of the variation in fishers' choice to fish at Lang Bank, the most productive, yet farthest fishing grounds. The coupled behavioral-economic model is focused on the small temporal and spatial scales of fishing effort and FEK in an SSF. Therefore the model can be used to predict how a range of physical and regulatory conditions and changes in demand will drive overall (fleet) fishing effort allocation in space and time. By illustrating and quantifying these social-ecological causes and effects, the model can assist managers to efficiently allocate limited monitoring and enforcement resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Collapses have occurred frequently in history, often followed by centuries of economic, intellectual, and population decline. Many different natural and social phenomena have been invoked to explain specific collapses, but a general explanation remains elusive. In this paper, we build a human population dynamics model by adding accumulated wealth and economic inequality to a predator-prey model of humans and nature. The model structure, and simulated scenarios that offer significant implications, are explained. Four equations describe the evolution of Elites, Commoners, Nature, and Wealth. The model shows Economic Stratification or Ecological Strain can independently lead to collapse, in agreement with the historical record. The measure Carrying Capacity is developed and its estimation is shown to be a practical means for early detection of a collapse. Mechanisms leading to two types of collapses are discussed. The new dynamics of this model can also reproduce the irreversible collapses found in history. Collapse can be avoided, and population can reach a steady state at maximum carrying capacity if the rate of depletion of nature is reduced to a sustainable level and if resources are distributed equitably.

We conduct an empirical analysis of the agricultural impacts associated with major dams in Idaho, focusing on their crop mixes, crop productivities, and overall agricultural land values using an integrated county-level repeated cross section dataset Our results suggest that the presence of a dam resulted in significant increases in total crop acreage, particularly in those counties in which farmers have predominantly junior water rights. Dams led to an increase in the acreage of the higher-valued, more waterintensive crops and positively impacted some crop productivities, particularly during periods of severe droughts. In contrast to the traditional literature, we find that the presence of a dam had a small, positive, but nonsignificant effect on farmland values. Finally, we evaluate long-term patterns in stream flow change and examine the impacts of dams on the natural environment. We find that the presence of dams enabled the spatiotemporal transfer of water resources from cold (non-agricultural) to warm (agriculturally-intensive) seasons, reduced the potential availability of water resources for ecosystem use, and increased the seasonal volatility in water supplies.

This study examines one of the most extreme examples of such reform using data from New Zealand public high schools. In the 1990s school zoning was abolished in New Zealand and public schools competed for students, not just with private schools, but also with each other. A categorical Data Envelopment Analysis model using data on school resources and student academic performance, stratified using student socio-economic characteristics, is used to calculate efficiency scores for schools. A regression model is then used to analyse differences in these efficiency scores and their relationship to different levels of competition. The study finds average school performance tends to be higher when schools are located in areas of high competition. However, this result appears to vary depending on school size, suggesting that competition can lead to a widening in the gap between the best and worst performing schools. Longterm this is likely to result in the inefficient use of fixed public resources, as public school survival is only indirectly related to performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Subjective well-being has been demonstrated to have a causal influence on positive health outcomes. The aim of this paper is to examine whether subjective well-being could add to the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) in predicting fruit and vegetable consumption. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 72 undergraduates completed online measures of the TPB variables, subjective well-being components (happiness and life satisfaction) and fruit and vegetable consumption at a single time point. Findings - Subjective well-being made a significant contribution to the variance explained for both intention to consume fruit and vegetables and actual fruit and vegetable consumption (1.7% and 4.3%, respectively). Perceived behavioural control and happiness were found to be significant unique predictors of fruit and vegetable consumption. Originality/value - The TPB appears a useful model for predicting fruit and vegetable consumption, which is enhanced by the addition of subjective well-being variables. The current study provides direction to future interventions, suggesting that targeting perceived behavioural control and the subjective well-being component of happiness may be useful for improving fruit and vegetable consumption in young adults.","[Ding, Ting; Mullan, Barbara; Xavier, Kristina] Univ Sydney, Dept Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Mullan, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",barbara.mullan@curtin.edu.au,"Mullan, Barbara/E-2474-2019","Mullan, Barbara/0000-0002-0177-8899",,,,,56,17,21,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The physical, textural and chemical properties as well as volatile profile and free radical scavenging capacity of eight cultivars (cvs Acco, Arakta, Bhagwa, Ganesh, Herskawitz, Molla de Elche, Ruby, and Wonderful) were quantified to demonstrate the diversity among the characters of the commercially grown cultivars. Findings - Statistically significant differences were found between cultivars for most of the evaluated characters, primarily highlighting the genetic diversity among the cultivars. The classification of fruit cultivars based on quality traits (such as size, texture, colour, soluble solids, acidity, juiciness and phenolics) showed the great potential of the cultivars for processing and fresh market. The relationship among these quality traits was analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) resulting in the separation of the investigated cultivars into two groups (cluster 1 = Ruby, Arakta and Ganesh; Class 2 = Bhagwa, Acco and Herskawitz) and two ungrouped cultivars (Molla de Elche and Wonderful). Specific understanding about quality traits of each cultivar was established using the correlation coefficients obtained.

This decision seriously impacts other aspects of the enterprise that include sales, marketing policy, and the utilization of assets. However, various methods are used to resolve this problem. Among optimization methodologies, the linear programming approach and Theory of Constraints represent the more common. The Theory of Constraints is based on the assumption that every system, such as a firm, contains at least one constraint. Without the latter, the firm could possibly accumulate unlimited profits. The goal of the theory is to maximize throughput of the firm as a whole. Therefore, it is both a holistic and systems approach to the firm. Linear programming is used in many papers to validate the optimality of the solution, therefore, it is often considered to be the most suitable. The Theory of Constraints is a heuristic and therefore, more often used by managers who lack the applied mathematical skills for linear programming. The solution can be transferred to linear programming as well as the Activity Based Costing approach for product mix optimization. This conclusion leads to the basics of this branch of product mix optimization methods as to what costs are relevant in product mix optimization. This paper focuses on various methods of product mix optimization that enhance the original heuristic solution and provides recommendations for the relevant costs. The linear programming approach is also introduced, a comparison of the methods is performed and assumptions for usage are described.","Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Hájek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jiri.hajek@vse.cz,"Hajek, Jiri/K-5666-2016",,,,,,14,0,1,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,434,444,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700043,0

As a consequence, model innovation of land circulation is vital and governments at all levels have a big role to play.","[Hong, Bi-Gang] Shaoyang Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Shaoyang, Peoples R China",Shaoyang University,,hong6210@126.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,13,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",1951-6851,,978-94-6252-008-0,ADV INTEL SYS RES,,,2014,107.0,,,,,,358,363,,,,,,6,Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BB0ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340893200060,0

A country needs around 25% of its land to be covered by forest to maintain its ecological balance, but here the percentage is much less. Urban dwellers have hardly seen any greenery around them and every inch of land is occupied by various types of infrastructure. The solution lies in planting as many trees as possible, and the only place to do that seems to be on the rooftop or balcony and in slum areas. Vegetable production by the sack gardening method is an effective and innovative technology in Bangladesh. It has received positive attention from urban household communities. It is an alternative vegetable garden for utilizing small land areas or space. Individual families are growing many varieties of vegetables with minimum expenditure. After receiving the exciting research findings, the technology has increasingly been adopted among the urban people of some city areas such as Dhaka (capital and central), Sylhet (north-eastern) and Brahmanbaria districts (east-central) of Bangladesh in 2010-2011. It has been observed that urban people including slum dwellers have been showing keen interest in this method. Urban households are now able to grow and cook their own vegetables and have more diversity in their daily diet by growing highly nutritional products. The technology is possible for adoption and replication in other city areas both at home and abroad.","Friends Village Dev Bangladesh FIVDB, Dhaka, Bangladesh",,"Hossain, ST (通讯作者)，Friends Village Dev Bangladesh FIVDB, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",,,,,,,,12,1,1,1,12,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-45-3,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1054.0,,,,,,95,100,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1054.10,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357663400010,0

A conceptual model for analysing supply chains according to EPCIS standard is also presented. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review was conducted to establish a theoretical framework. A case study of a Swedish fresh fish supply chain was then carried out. Findings - Implementation of the EPCIS standard and RFID technology to enable food traceability potentially affects the following logistic operations activities: identification, monitoring, labelling, goods handling, reporting of production, identification costs and revenue changes due to sales of goods. The conceptual model was used to analyse the effects. Research limitations/implications - The paper contributes to logistic research by studying the implementation of RFID technology and information standards to comply with food traceability requirements. The research is limited to fish supply chains; other sectors and supply chains need to be investigated for further generalisation of the results. Practical implications - Regulatory requirements on food traceability stipulate the implementation of food traceability systems, placing the responsibility on companies by authorities. The research presented can support managers in understanding the potential effects of implementing such systems. Originality/value - The discussion about logistics and food traceability has in part revolved around implementation of RFID technology and standardised approaches for handling information to preserve food quality and safety.

Unexpectedly little is known about how these economic food choices affect diet quality and/or health. The purpose of this paper is to examine differences in nutrient content and cost of daily food intake data modeled to contain food exclusively from either LB, generic brands (GB) or discount brands (DB). Design/methodology/approach - This study analyzed nutrition information of 430 food products that were selected based on dietary intake data from a sub-sample of the Amsterdam Growth and Health Longitudinal Study. Data were collected in Dutch supermarkets, where information was copied from back-of-pack nutrition tables. Findings - Results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the LB, GB or DB daily intake models in energy (kJ), protein, carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fatty acids, fiber or added sugar contents. However, there were significant differences in sodium content where LB had significant less sodium compared to GB and DB. Also, there were significant price differences: LB vs GB + (sic)2.75/day; LB vs DB + (sic)7.17/day; GB vs DB + (sic)4.42/day. Originality/value - To the knowledge, this is the first study analyzing differences in nutrient content and price of leading, generic and discount food brand formats on a diet level. The analysis revealed that there is little reason to suggest that dietary nutrient quality is negatively affected by an increased consumption of DB products. Indeed, the substantial price difference between leading and DB suggests that discount products provide a reasonable alternative to LB.","[Waterlander, Wilma E.; van Kouwen, Marita; Steenhuis, Ingrid H.

Conversely to advantages of correspondence analysis, impact of any changes in the data cannot be determined by this analysis. At this point, bootstrapping correspondence analysis gives additional information by exhibiting ellipses of row and column profiles of the contingency table. This study applies bootstrap ellipses for graphical visualization of correspondence analysis on market research data of a baby food brand. The results show that with the bootstrapped ellipses, it is convenient to merge categories of the contingency table, resulting in dimension reduction.

This paper describes the impact of weather change on rice drying system design and management in Bangladesh. A general simulation model (WEGDM) translated in to FORTRAN 77 language that can simulate different weather patterns was used to study the effect of weather change on rice drying system design and management. There are three major components of the model-simulator for weather variables, simulator for drying process and simulator for economic analysis. Net present value (NPV) of cash flow was used as an overall criterion to study the effect of weather on the capacity of the drying and storing system. Eight different weather patterns have been simulated to study the effect of weather using previous weather data of 24 years. All pertinent cost parameters including fixed cost and variable costs were considered. Energy cost of drying was calculated using available grain drying theories and equations. Results indicated that there was a significant effect of weather change on rice drying and storing system capacities. The model revealed that the optimum drying capacity, storage size and the benefit cost ratio for a locality in Bangladesh were 4.37 m(3)/h, 547.0 m(3) and 1.58 respectively. The model could also be used to determine the optimum capacities of drying and storing facilities of other cereals under adverse weather change.","[Ziauddin, A.

In particular, we assume that producers maximize return to the outlay (RO). For simplicity and tractability we start with a Cobb-Douglas transformation function with multiple inputs and outputs and show how the first-order conditions of RO maximization can be used to derive an estimating equation which is nothing but a partial input productivity equation. This equation does not suffer from the econometric endogeneity problem although the output and input variables are endogenous. First, we consider the case where producers are fully efficient allocatively but technically inefficient. The model is estimated using a single equation stochastic frontier approach. The model is then extended to allow allocative inefficiency and it is estimated as a system using generalized method of moment. Algebraic expressions are derived to decompose the effect of technical and allocative inefficiencies on RO. We also consider translog specifications that are estimated as (1) a single equation frontier model as well as (2) a system. We use a panel of Norwegian fishing trawlers data to estimate the model. Outputs are different species caught while inputs are labor and vessel size. We also control for number of days of operation, age of the vessel and year effects. Empirical results show that the average rate of RO is reduced by about 20 to 30 % due to technical inefficiency. On the other hand, average allocative efficiency is found to be about 78 %. The average overall efficiency is found to be around 60 %.","[Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.; Tveteras, Ragnar] Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Universitetet i Stavanger; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Kumbhakar, SC (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",kkar@binghamton.edu,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728; Tveteras, Ragnar/0000-0002-8553-556X",,,,,39,23,24,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In fact, there is a long history, starting in the late fifties but largely ignored, of sustained attempts to assign monetary values to nature's services. These early efforts encountered many conceptual and methodological roadblocks, which could not be resolved and led a number of researchers to argue that monetary valuation was not a fruitful approach. It is in that context that MES was hailed by some in 1997 as a promising way to integrate environmental goods and services into the logic of economic markets. Knowledge of the full timeline casts a very different light, in particular on the difficulties currently encountered in the practice of MES; far from being the expected growing pains of a young discipline, these difficulties turn out to be long-standing problems that have eluded solution over the last half-century and appear intrinsically unresolvable. This perspective suggests that, at this point, it is advisable to look at alternatives to MES for the integration of nature into economic decisions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Although the modern technology is characterized by higher fixed costs and a higher speed of transport, it is chosen for intermediate distances, rather than to long distances. The reason is that, when the shipper switches to the modern technology, the industrial firm changes production from the home to the foreign city. Thus, the demand for transport decreases proportionally to the distance between the home and foreign city. For long distances, revenue from transportation becomes so low that the modern technology does not break even.","[Pires, Armando J.

We find that in most of the pre-democratic era, there was a strong procyclical bias to fiscal policy. Eradication began in the last years of the autocratic regime under the influence of fiscal institutional reform and perhaps learning.

In contrast to the previous literature, this study argues that it is the fractionalization and/or polarisation of ethnic groups that is the relevant consideration, rather than the population share of ethnic minorities, since such ethnic divisions may significantly increase the difficulty of coordinating community action. Using toxic release data for the periods 1990 to 1995 and 2000 to 2005 we find that measures of ethnic divisions have a positive relationship with toxic releases.

The ecology is represented by an eleven species food web in which individual optimizing plants and animals engage in competitive and predator/prey relationships. The ecological model defines a steady-state set of sustainable grazing and hunting options, and for each option, biodiversity is measured using an index defined over the eleven species. In linking the ecology to the economics, social welfare depends on grazing profits and hunter net benefits. The problem can be stated as maximizing economic welfare over two ecosystem services, subject to their sustainable use and subject to a target level of biodiversity. A numerical application with economic and biological data from the Western United States is used to determine sustainable grazing and hunting options for alternative biodiversity levels, and to select the option that maximizes welfare.

Tentative initial results using simple two-variable cointegrated VAR models suggest considerable heterogeneity in the experiences of the countries we look at. For most, however, there was a negative relationship between tariffs and levels of income for both the pre- and post-Second World War periods. However, in the second half of the twentieth century, the causality ran from income to tariffs: that is, countries simply liberalized as they got richer.

Specifically, we consider a predator prey system under two potential management policies: an unrestricted regime where agents can compete to harvest from both species, and a second one where they are allowed to harvest only predators. The performance of both policies is compared from an ecological and an economic point of view. For a sufficiently large number of agents (or for strong biological interaction parameters) the assumed restricted fishing policy yields both higher long run stock levels and profits. Thus, this contribution suggests that such a policy, while requiring weaker monitoring/governance than instruments based on outputs (such as quotas or taxes), would meet environmental and economic objectives. Finally, several features of the analysis are discussed, including targeting prey instead of predator and the issue of compliance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This is particularly the case in countries such as Denmark where many properties are privately owned. However, little attention has previously been given to the relationship between farmers' willingness to provide a good or service and the spatial heterogeneity associated with their demand. In this study farmers' willingness to participate in afforestation contracts are investigated using a choice experiment of various contracts with the purpose to provide: groundwater protection, biodiversity conservation or recreation. We employ a random parameter logit model to analyse the relationship between farmers' preferences for afforestation purposes and the spatial variables; groundwater interests, species richness, human population density, forest cover and hunting. The results show that increasing human population density significantly increases farmers' required compensation with respect to recreational activities. Furthermore, there is a significant effect of hunting which decreases compensation required by the farmers to enter an afforestation project. The share of groundwater and forest cover does not significantly influence preferences. We conclude that spatial variations should be considered when designing conservation policies (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We developed a discrete-event simulation model to determine the impact of changing the number of NICU beds in BC on the probability of transfer to the US and on overall system costs. The model includes births in 25 different zones at five different levels of care; transitions between levels of care over time; and transfers of patients between zones and to the US when there is insufficient capacity. We parameterized the model using data from the BC Health System, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, published reports, internal hospital data and expert opinion. Our analysis suggests that the province should consider a modest increase in NICU capacity. In particular, the use of a bottleneck approach to identify the type and location of 4 new beds at select hospitals throughout the system resulted in a reduction in the probability of transfer to the US and an increase in annual system costs. A model like the one described in this paper may be useful to evaluate the tradeoffs associated with capacity expansion for a number of different services where Canadians seek care in the US.

We present empirical evidence for a newly released NAMEA available for the 20 Italian regions in order to demonstrate the role played by sector innovation, regional spillovers and environmental policies. The Italian North-south divide regarding industrial development and productive specialization patterns seems to affect regional EP. Nonetheless, such a pattern presents some interesting differences, revealing a more heterogeneous distribution of emissions which may reflect the role of other driving forces. In particular, agglomerative effects seem to play a major role and the EP of neighboring regions influences the regional internal EP. This means that together with the spatial concentration of specific sectors into restricted areas, there is also some convergence in the adoption of cleaner or dirtier production process techniques. Finally, interregional technological spillovers are more important than sector internal innovation for improving EP, revealing that accounting for spatial features and linking ecological economics to regional economics are crucial in understanding the key drivers of EP.

A particular version of 'entropic net psychic income' has been implanted as the main conceptual basis for these aggregated measures of sustainable economic welfare. However, a well-known limitation of SWBIs is that they do not prudently factor-in measures of investment and depreciation of 'human-health capital'-yet this is a critical aspect of sustainable well-being. It is argued that under Fisher's psychic income framework, the heart of the indicator is a theory that specifies accounting for some sort of change in the human psyche, i.e. the stock (or fund) of human-health capital. Advocates of SWBIs cannot adequately account for the degree of human health or knowledge, because this is not their reference point-'personal consumption expenditures' is their reference point. Political economy seeks to avoid abstracting from the whole reality, recognising that endogenous processes of human-health capital formation are overdetermined. This paper thus argues that there is a significant conceptual shortcoming in ISEW and GPI, which, if left unattended will undermine the measure of theoretical legitimacy and empirical efficacy.

Most macro-economic models start from a neoclassical economic perspective and focus on equilibrium outcomes, either in a static or dynamic way, and describe economic processes at a high level of aggregation. As a consequence, they typically fail to account for the complexity of social interactions and other behavioural responses of consumers and producers to disasters, which may affect the macroeconomic impacts of floods. Employing evolutionary principles and methods, such as agent-based modelling, may help to address some of the shortcomings of current macro-economic models. We explore and discuss the implications of applying consumer and producer heterogeneity, bounded rationality, network effects, social and technological learning, co-evolution and adaptive policy-making concepts into existing economic frameworks for the assessment of macro-economic impacts of floods.

Initially industry was largely artisanal, and located in the former political capitals; but even then the waterfalls of the subalpine north-west attracted what factory industry there was. Contrary to widespread opinion, in the aftermath of Unification the industrial and overall growth leaders were actually in the south, where selected provinces reaped the gains from the freer foreign trade, and infrastructure investment, that accompanied the loss of independence. Over the later nineteenth century industry concentrated into the 'industrial triangle'; but even there industrialization remained sharply local, and excluded the right bank of the upper Po. The early twentieth century, in turn, brought a measure of industrial diffusion-to the centre/north-east, where it was tied to the production of perishables on recently improved land-and concentration within the north-western triangle itself, into its major cities, as progress in energy transmission effectively moved the waterfalls into the plains.","[Ciccarelli, Carlo; Fenoaltea, Stefano] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Ciccarelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,68,39,39,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

J,"Sandvik, PT; Storli, E",,,,"Sandvik, Pal Thonstad; Storli, Espen",,,Big business and small states: Unilever and Norway in the interwar years,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In 1930, Unilever tried to take control of Lilleborg, Norway's most important producer of soap and vegetable oil, with the aim of wiping out most of Norway's independent margarine and soap industry. However, as the purchase was dependent on government concession, Unilever became embroiled in a power struggle with the Norwegian political authorities. The company was strongly criticized by Norwegian nationalists. The question of whether or not to let Unilever go forward became one of the most contested questions in Norwegian politics in the period. In the end, Unilever was allowed to go ahead with the purchase, but in return the company was forced to make substantial concessions. Expanding on Jones's framework for understanding the balance of power between multinationals and host governments, in this article it is argued that we must look beyond firm specific assets and a cost-benefit oriented analysis of the relationship between multinationals and host countries to understand the end result. In this case, nationalism had a decisive impact. Unilever's acquisition of Lilleborg and the Norwegian response thus contributes to our understanding of the nature of multinational enterprise in the interwar period and of the political economy of foreign direct investment in general.","[Sandvik, Pal Thonstad] NTNU, Dept Hist & Class Studies, Trondheim, Norway; [Storli, Espen] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Harvard University,"Sandvik, PT (通讯作者)，NTNU, Dept Hist & Class Studies, Trondheim, Norway.",,,,,,,,56,8,8,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

By properly assessing the outcomes involved - especially those concerning human life - economic theory of choice under uncertainty is expected to help people take the best decision. However, the widely used expected utility theory values life in terms of the low probability of death someone would be willing to accept in order to receive extra payment. Common sense and experimental evidence refute this way of valuing life, and here we provide experimental evidence of people's unwillingness to accept a low probability of death, contrary to expected utility predictions. This work uses new axioms of choice defined by Chichilnisky (2000), especially an axiom that allows extreme responses to extreme events, and the choice criterion that they imply. The implied decision criteria are a combination of expected utility with extreme responses, and seem more consistent with observations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Farming is characterized by the availability of vast areas of land, a reasonable climate and low cost. These conditions have led South America to be an important supplier of agricultural goods on the world market. Traditionally farmers owned some hundreds of acres and invested their money in all kinds of assets, i.e. land, buildings and equipment. A new phenomenon has emerged in this area i.e. farming companies. These companies have capital but do not own assets. They rent what they need, i.e. land, work force, machinery, transportation, storage and manage from 15,000 ha to 330,000 ha. The purpose of this paper is to determine the perspective of network companies. Design/methodology/approach - Representatives of 11 network companies in Uruguay and Argentina were interviewed, which provided the opinions of 81 interviewees. Findings - The most important conclusion of this research is that, though sometimes these companies are called in a pejorative way pools de siembra, network companies might bring prosperity to the members of their supply chain and to a larger extent to the rural population of South America. The possibilities to reduce risk with regards to bad weather, to optimize the combination of soil and crop, and to realize economies of scale are the main factors for this success. Originality/value - The size and number of network companies is steadily growing and this study contributes to a large debate taking place in Argentina and Uruguay, in order to assess the real impacts of these companies on the economy, environment and population.","[Clasadonte, Laure; Tourrand, Jean-Francois] CIRAD, Environm & Soc Dept, Montpellier, France; [de Vries, Elizard; Trienekens, Jacques] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Management Studies Grp Bedrijfskunde, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Arbeletche, Pedro] Univ Republ, Fac Agron, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Paysandu, Uruguay","CIRAD; Wageningen University & Research; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Clasadonte, L (通讯作者)，CIRAD, Environm & Soc Dept, Montpellier, France.",laureclasadonte@hotmail.com,"trienekens, jacques/JFA-0126-2023; Arbeletche, Pedro/GPP-1174-2022",,,,,,16,3,4,1,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - One-on-one interviews with general questions and laddering/means-end chain (MEC) elicitation were used to reveal both physical and psychological impacts of GI disturbances and alleviation of the disturbances in women aged between 45 and 70 years old. Findings - In terms of the laddering procedure and cognitive mapping, the number of linkages apparent between concrete and abstract levels demonstrated a complex map of cognitions regarding GI disturbances that involved both physical and psychological impacts. Positive or negative framing of context altered the cognitions revealed in the laddering, with the role of food highlighting these differences. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, MEC theory has not been applied to explore the impact of acute GI disturbances in healthy participants on their quality of life. The exploratory research demonstrates that mild and/or acute experiences of GI dysfunction have negative impacts on psychological well-being, similar in type to those suffering from chronic conditions and deepens our understanding of the complexity of inter-relationships between components of well-being in the context of gut health.","[Gamble, Jo; Skinner, Margot; Jaeger, Sara] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res, Auckland, New Zealand; [Skinner, Margot] Univ Auckland, Food Sci Programme, Auckland 1, New Zealand",New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd; University of Auckland,"Skinner, M (通讯作者)，New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res, Auckland, New Zealand.",margot.skinner@plantandfood.co.nz,"Jaeger, Sara R/R-2648-2016; Jaeger, Sara R/IAO-6411-2023","Jaeger, Sara R/0000-0002-4960-5233","Foundation of Research, Science and Technology Wellness Foods programme [C06X0405]","Foundation of Research, Science and Technology Wellness Foods programme","The research was funded by the Foundation of Research, Science and Technology Wellness Foods programme (C06X0405).

Although differentiating products (services) is considered important in firms' strategies and productivity growth, it has not been sufficiently investigated in previous studies. In this paper, we study this issue in two retail trade industries, department stores and supermarkets, applying the model of Melitz (2000). Our results indicate that the standard production function is not relevant to estimate productivity in imperfectly competitive markets. It also suggests that the market structure should be carefully considered in productivity analysis. In addition, product differentiation has a positive effect on firms' revenue for the supermarkets. Furthermore, the retail trade industries possibly follow increasing returns to scale. Thus, policy measures that promote economies of scale and product differentiation should contribute to further growth in these industries. In addition, the results indicate that the regulatory reform of the retail trade industry in 2000 increased the gap between winners and losers in terms of productivity.","Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1006008, Japan; Res Inst Econ, Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008901, Japan; [Kato, Atsuyuki] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1006008, Japan; [Kato, Atsuyuki] Minist Econ Trade & Ind METI, Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008901, Japan",,"Kato, A (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Kasumigaseki Bldg 8F,3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan.",akato@adbi.org,,,,,,,23,6,6,1,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

By using the analytical approach related to recognition as employed by Axel Honneth, I argue on the basis of empirical findings that unpaid work can play a significant role in one's personal well-being at the individual level. With regard to the transition process towards a society of degrowth, however, a key seems to be a change in the normative paradigm concerning work at the individual level. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This framework allows an investigation into the connection between physical environmental variables (waste flows, virgin material flows) and economic decisions of agents in the product chain i.e. firms innovation strategies, consumers choices and development of recycling activities. The paper highlights the value of using agent-based modeling as an operational tool to investigate the effect of waste prevention policy on economic and technological decisions of agents. We focus on three types of extended producer responsibility (EPR) instruments, which are recycling fees, tax-subsidy and norms. The simulation results show that the impact of each instrument depends on the policy design, in particular on the level of stringency and on the reward system which is implemented. We show that only tax-subsidy systems and stringent norms can lead to radical innovations and to significant changes in product designs. In the case of tax-subsidy, the impact relies more on an innovation effect, while in the case of norm it mainly relies on a selection effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper draws upon established literature from public administration to show that such fragmentation is unavoidable, because it occurs even in governance at the national level. Moreover, while such fragmentation undoubtedly carries with it problems, it also brings advantages, such as redundancy which makes it less likely that blame avoidance will result in issues being overlooked. The existence of multiple arenas also makes possible the phenomenon of 'forum shopping', which allows entrepreneurial actors to advance (or block) the development of international agreements. Using primarily examples from environmental governance, but with some comparative examples from other issue areas, this paper reflects upon both the threats and opportunities this reality presents, suggesting that the prevailing fragmentation of governance at once presents not just an obstacle to global governance, but opportunities for improving global governance-opportunities that would not occur if a single regime enjoyed a monopoly on governing capacity.","Univ Tasmania, Sch Govt, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Kellow, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Sch Govt, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",akellow@utas.edu.au,,,,,,,59,23,25,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

In practice, however, researchers are often forced to make untested assumptions regarding the public's perceptions of the environmental commodity being studied. Stated preference methods offer an opportunity to examine how home values are affected when researchers know exactly what is being valued. A stated preference study is conducted to investigate how people value environmental quality, by measuring impacts on home values from a leaking underground storage tank (LUST). The study incorporates two experimental treatments, expressing environmental risks in terms of(i) the presence of an exposure pathway, and (ii) pollution concentrations. This mimics information provided to Maryland households whose groundwater is actually impacted by a LUST. The questionnaire is administered to a convenience sample of Maryland residents. Within sample comparisons of the experimental treatments reveal that even when the groundwater at a home is not contaminated, respondents believe home prices decrease 18% to 24%. Prices decrease further once pollution levels exceed the regulatory standard, and an exposure pathway is present. Respondents seem capable of interpreting pollution information, and believe prices are impacted in ways consistent with economic theory. Future research to further bridge the gap between methodologies is discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The answer lies with a simple tournament model of military competition that allows for learning by doing. Political incentives and military conditions then explain why the rest of Eurasia fell behind Europeans in developing the gunpowder technology.

It traces the long-term evolution of this European institution, and offers a first pass at analysing its impact on long-term economic development. Starting in Spain in the twelfth century, parliaments gradually spread over the Latin west between 1200 and 1500. In the early modern period, parliaments declined in influence in southern and central Europe and further gained in importance in the Netherlands and Britain, resulting in an institutional 'Little Divergence' between 1500 and 1800. We discuss the background of this phenomenon in detail. Moreover, by analysing the effects of parliamentary activity on city growth we find that these differences in institutional development help to explain the economic divergence between north-western and southern and central Europe.","[Van Zanden, Jan Luiten; Buringh, Eltjo; Bosker, Maarten] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Van Zanden, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,,"buringh, eltjo/0000-0002-6847-3328",,,,,40,117,127,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

It is shown that the net energy balance and greenhouse gases (GHGs) balance are positive. The investment value in biofuel from J. curcas is also studied, and both its intrinsic and option values are calculated. A reference case is evaluated, namely, the cultivation of J. curcas as a substitute for conventional fuel in a specific less-developed country, Kenya, that lies in the tropical region where J. curcas grows. The investment is modeled as a perpetual investment call option. It is shown that the Net Present Value is positive for a vast range of discount factors and investment costs, while the option value depends crucially on the parameters of the model. A positive option value points out those cases in which it is optimal to defer the investment even if it entails a positive and possibly high Net Present Value. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Examples are the health, education and general government sectors. The System of National Accounts 1993 recommends valuing these nonmarket outputs at their costs of production but it does not give much guidance on exactly how to do this. In this paper, an explicit methodology is developed that enables one to construct these marginal cost prices. However, in the main text, an activity analysis approach is taken in order to simplify the analysis, so in particular, constant returns to scale, no substitution production functions for the specific activities in the nonmarket sector are assumed. It is shown that it is possible to obtain meaningful measures of Total Factor Productivity growth in this framework.

This paper compares the performance of the standard BCC model as a base case with two single-stage models: the Banker and Morey (1986a) model, which incorporates continuous environmental variables and the Banker and Morey (1986b) model, which incorporates categorical environmental variables. Simulation analyses are conducted using a shifted Cobb-Douglas function, with one output, one non-discretionary input, and two discretionary inputs. The production function is constructed to separate environmental impact from managerial inefficiency, while providing measures of both for comparative purposes. Tests are performed to evaluate the accuracy of each model. The distribution of the inputs, the sample size and the number of categories for the categorical model are varied in the simulations to determine their impact on the performance of each model. The results show that the Banker and Morey models should be used in preference to the standard BCC model when the environmental impact is moderate to high. Both the continuous and categorical models perform equally well but the latter may be better suited to some applications with larger sample sizes. Even when the environmental impact is slight, the use of a simple two-way split of the sample data can produce significantly better results under the Categorical model in comparison to the BCC model.","[Harrison, Julie; Rouse, Paul; Armstrong, Jamie] Univ Auckland, Sch Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Harrison, J (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Sch Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",j.harrison@auckland.ac.nz,"Rouse, Paul/H-8967-2019; Harrison, Julie/P-2626-2019","Rouse, Paul/0000-0002-5223-3143; Harrison, Julie/0000-0002-2905-6134",,,,,48,13,15,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Our results indicate a significant level of profit inefficiency for the EU region, which is predominantly attributed to allocative inefficiency. Our findings also suggest that banks operating in the old EU region are, on average, more profit efficient than credit institutions in the new EU member states. Overall, we observe considerable variation of efficiency scores across countries and different patterns in efficiency change over time, as well as a negative relationship between bank size and efficiency.","[Koutsomanoli-Filippaki, Anastasia] Hellen Minist Finance, Council Econ Advisors, Athens 10180, Greece; [Margaritis, Dimitris] Univ Auckland, Sch Business, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Staikouras, Christos] Athens Univ Business & Econ, Athens, Greece",University of Auckland; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Koutsomanoli-Filippaki, A (通讯作者)，Hellen Minist Finance, Council Econ Advisors, 5-7 Nikis St, Athens 10180, Greece.",a.koutsomanoli@mnec.gr; d.margaritis@auckland.ac.nz; cstaik@aueb.gr,"Margaritis, Dimitris/E-6114-2013","Margaritis, Dimitris/0000-0001-5056-1170",,,,,46,27,28,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

A computable general equilibrium analysis,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; General equilibrium modeling; Forestry; Afforestation,CARBON SEQUESTRATION; COST; SINKS; LAND,"This paper analyzes the role of forest-based carbon sequestration in a unilateral EU27 emissions reduction policy under a Global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) framework. Forestry mitigation is introduced into the model relying on carbon sequestration curves provided by a global forestry model. The structure of the original CGE is extended to consider land use change and timber supply effects, resulting from the use of forest sinks to reduce carbon emissions. Results show that afforestation and timber management could lead to substantially lower policy costs. By using forest-carbon sinks it is possible to achieve the 30% emissions reduction target with an additional European effort of only 0.2% of GDP compared with the cost of a 20% emissions reduction without forestry. Carbon price is also reduced, by approximately 30% in 2020. European forest-carbon sequestration may have, however, the perverse effect of increasing timber production in areas of the world which already have high deforestation rates. A sensitivity analysis on main parameters confirms the robustness of our results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper addresses the multi-level governance problem of coherently addressing key interactions between four Earth sub-systems - climate change, freshwater use, land use and biodiversity - taking into account concerns over problem shifting. After discussing possibilities for regional downscaling of the boundaries, we explore challenges for the EU region to coherently address this particular set of interacting Earth sub-systems and reduce the risk of problem shifting. This analysis demonstrates that Earth system interactions can be governed, but that they likely require comprehensive packages of governance responses across both sub-systems and levels. Three overarching governance functions are tentatively identified that directly or indirectly address Earth system interactions: reduction of system stress, risks and vulnerabilities; triggering and navigation of transformation of economic activity; and development of a diversity of options. Finally, the paper briefly discusses political and institutional challenges for developing, enabling and stabilising these governance functions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To permit empirical study of the effects of institutions that can facilitate or restrict allocations, we conducted field experiments to explore trust's potential when resource contracts are limited, using a novel asymmetric-productivity ultimatum game with a final surplus-sharing step added. As a form of informal institution, trust could in principle make rights and contracts unnecessary. We observe whether trust in compensation is in fact expected and expressed. We also explore whether trust is exploited, and the effect of communication, within our two bargaining structures: (1) no communication; and (2) with a non-binding message concerning the surplus to be shared. We see that our participants both expect and express trust that some of the surplus will be shared. Trust raises total output and some surplus is indeed shared; those who trust gain a bit on average; and the more trust was shown, the more was shared. However, often the trust was barely repaid. Further, the messages-found to help in other research-had little impact and were often untrue. In sum, trust does matter but both efficiency and equity could well rise with complete contracts.

In contrast, research from behavioral economics shows that introducing monetary incentives can undermine collective action that is motivated by social norms. In such a case payment could have perverse impacts. In view of this dichotomy, we conducted choice and field experiments in rural Mexico and Tanzania to test the response of prosocial behavior to incentives. The field experiments involved voluntary participation in real communal tasks under different incentive structures. Findings suggest that payments help raise participation where people are otherwise uninterested, but that participation in communal tasks can be high irrespective of the incentive if social norms favoring participation are present. In Tanzania, high individual payments do not undermine participation although they appear to reduce people's satisfaction from the task relative to when there is no payment. In Mexico, group payments made through village authorities yield lower participation where people distrust leaders. Challenges to conducting field experiments in our research settings limit what we can conclude from our work, but the findings raise important points and suggest areas for further research.

Almost no information, however, is available from an academic perspective on consumers' association with this food, including their knowledge, actual consumption of muscadines or by-products they associate with muscadine grapes. This study seeks to add to the limited existing knowledge on muscadine grapes and their by-products exploring these areas. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of consumers from a Southern US town, where muscadine grapes are native, was chosen. A total of 189 participated completing a questionnaire. Findings - Overall, respondents indicated familiarity with muscadine grapes and by-products (e.g. wine, jams, juice), but predominantly the more mature respondents related much more to those by-products than the younger consumer groups. Concerning muscadine wines, while 56.6 per cent of respondents were familiar with this product, and 45.5 per cent considered their consumption experience satisfying to very satisfying, 67.7 per cent either never buy them or seldom do so, suggesting very limited attachment with muscadine grapes. Research limitations/implications - Choosing one single geographic location (a Southern US town) and the number of participants are two limitations of this study. Practical implications - Given the importance of muscadine grapes and their by-products for the Southern region, particularly culturally, traditionally and for consumers in general in terms of beneficial health-related properties, an argument is made concerning the need to promote this ancient food. The role of the hospitality and tourism sector, government, agricultural and consumer groups is therefore suggested in promoting, marketing and other forms conducive to raising the profile of muscadine by-products.

Design/methodology/approach - The literature review is of the chemical composition of sunflower seeds, their health benefits and their utilization in different products. Findings - We are what we eat. All living creatures need to take in nutrients to live. Nutrients provide energy for processes in the body and can promote growth, maintenance and repair. The classes of nutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Sunflower seeds are a good source of all these nutrients. Plant foods such as fruits, vegetables, oil crops and whole grains contain many components that are beneficial to human health. Research supports that some of these foods, as part of an overall healthful diet, have the potential to delay the onset of many age-related diseases. Research limitations/implications - Currently available information on sunflower seeds is insufficient. These observations have led to continuing research aimed at identifying specific bioactive components in foods, such as antioxidants, which may be responsible for improving and maintaining health. Antioxidants are present in foods as vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and polyphenols. Originality/value - This review is unique in its comprehensive nature.

We distinguish the following scale of the highest educational attainment: primary and incomplete education, secondary education without GCSE, secondary education with GCSE, higher vocational and bachelor education and tertiary education. Forecasts of wage distribution have been developed for the next two years for all of these categories. Three-parametric lognormal curve formed the basis of the theoretical probability distribution. Parameter values of relevant three-parametric lognormal curves were then estimated using the method of L-moments of parameter estimation. Forecasts of sample values of L-moments were calculated using trend analysis of their past development and the parameters of three-parametric lognormal curves for forecasts of wage distribution were calculated using the predicted values of the first three sample L-moments.

A growing body of evidence suggests that strengthening buyer-seller relationships fosters more efficient supply chains. Much of the long-term relationship literature tends to treat suppliers as a homogeneous group when identifying motivations, strategies and incentives to enhance the quality of buyer-seller relationships. This article aims to explore the role of long-term relationships between buyers and sellers in Malaysia's dairy industry, taking into consideration the heterogeneous nature of producers. Design/methodology/approach - The study examines variation in relationship quality (trust, satisfaction, and commitment), loyalty and price satisfaction dimensions, using data from a survey of 133 dairy producers. Findings - Cluster analysis suggests two well-defined groups differing in terms cif demographic characteristics and relationship perceptions about their buyers. Practical implications - The study results highlight ways milk buyers can develop and promote more appropriate and efficient marketing strategies with milk producers.

Moreover, China's FDI inflows and outflows remained stable and robust, despite the global financial and economic downturns. Therefore, the purposes of the paper are to analyse the evolution of China's inward and outward FDI between 2000 and present, underlying their main features, to identify the factors that have influenced these flows, to determine the impact of the present crisis on the investments and to see how the FDI contributed, during time, to the economic growth of the country. The method used to achieve these objectives consisted in an exploratory research.

Design/methodology/approach - In this qualitative study, 22 families participated in in-depth interviews that explored their perspectives on food in the family and the significance of being able to cook. The sample was socio-economically diverse and drew from one urban and one rural community in British Columbia, Canada. Findings - The main themes from participants' descriptions of the significance of home cooking were that home cooking gave families control over their food supply, helped them to connect to others, enabled them to explore their own and others' food cultures and, in the case of teens, become more independent. Research limitations/implications - The paper shows that the familial motivations for home cooking go beyond concerns for health or home economy and would benefit from further exploration. Practical implications - For food producers and retailers, cooking instructors, dieticians, food scholars and writers, understanding familial motivations for home cooking provides the opportunity to better target family cooks with food products or services, and to encourage increased home cooking as a means to promote healthier, more sustainable diets and socially rich.family food practices. Originality/value - A perceived broad-based decline in home cooking has received a great deal of attention in the UK and elsewhere.

The paper is devoted to developing of a preliminary statistical count model appropriate to the modelling of insured accident probability for given motor-hull insurance portfolio in the Czech Republic. Firstly, the Poisson model is considered and because of the fact that the data violates the variance assumption, we turn to the negative-binomial model.

The combination model is feasible for the forecast of the construction industry production safety situation.

Data on the various household income types, including environmental income, were collected through a structured survey of 200 households. Environmental income constituted 20% of the total income. The poorest income quintile showed the highest relative dependence on environmental income (31%), though absolute environmental income increased with total income. Poverty analyses showed that poverty incidence and poverty gap would increase by 13 and 7 percentage points respectively without environmental income. Gini-coefficient analyses revealed that income inequality would increase by 6 percentage points for all households if environmental income was excluded. The results generally suggest that environmental income is important for both the poor and the well-off, and wealth accumulation might be tied to resource use. There is a case for promoting sound environmental management and sustainable and fair resource use in the Kalahari drylands in order to help pull more households out of poverty. Our findings also point to issues of heterogeneity in resource access even among indigenous communities previously thought to be homogenous. These should be key considerations for conservation interventions. (C) 2014 The Authors.

One of the most striking characteristics of protected areas is how much they vary in size. We examine the consequences of this size variation for the cost of acquiring protected areas. We use recent land acquisitions (2000-2009) in central and southern Appalachian forest ecosystems of the United States. Acquisition costs for these protected areas show pronounced economies of scale; specifically ten times the area can be purchased for seven times the cost of a smaller site. We examine how these economies of scale differ by contract type and motivations. For example, we find that easements do not show economies of scale despite costing less than fee simple acquisitions overall. Also, we find that economies of scale are stronger for protected areas that were specifically created to protect occurrences of rare or imperiled species but where development pressure was not identified as an explicit threat to the site. Conservation organizations may better account for acquisition costs in protected area creation by recognizing such economies of scale and their context dependency with respect to land acquisition contract type and conservation motivations.

This was made possible due to lesson drawing and learning among states. Recent evidence from the UNFCCC negotiations suggests that countries began to reflect on the Copenhagen experience. They are setting up domestic climate legislation in the form of low carbon development plans and share their knowledge and experiences in the international climate change negotiations. Country representatives engage in workshops and roundtables to showcase their mitigation plans and low carbon development initiatives, thereby raising ambitions and creating group pressure on other countries. This article examines how the diffusion of policies across countries is motivated and facilitated by knowledge transfer and learning within multilevel-reinforcing governance dynamics between the domestic level and international negotiations. It analyzes how changes in the negotiation setting from confrontational formal negotiations to a more open forum and bottom-up pledge-and-review process, in combination with a positively framed win-win low carbon economic development narrative resulted in the diffusion of climate policies across developed and developing countries. Communicating these climate initiatives on the national level has shifted the debate. Countries emphasize less the win-lose perspective of economic costs and sacrifice. Thus, they focus less on the question of who should reduce emissions', but identify co-benefits instead. The institutionalized knowledge sharing within the UNFCCC is also creating positive competitive dynamics among countries to increase their ambition and to take on a leadership role. This shift in the negotiations carries potential for a more ambitious aggregate negotiation outcome and opens up a window of opportunity.","[Rietig, Katharina] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Rietig, Katharina] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rietig, K (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.m.rietig@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,61,24,26,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Good farming practices are integrated together with flood protection programs within a common management policy. The inclusion of risk exposure and socio-demographic variables in a random parameter logit model allows accounting for both latent and observed heterogeneity in preferences. Results show substantial benefits for each of the management alternatives valued. Results also identify that preferences significantly vary across respondents which suggests that policy makers should consider heterogeneity in preferences when designing policies for various area profiles in order to closely monitor welfare improvements.

We use data of a representative sample of the Spanish manufacturing sector for the period 1991 and 2005. These data allow us to estimate firm level productivity for a relatively long period of time and provide us with firm level perception of the business cycle. We find that productivity tends to converge in recessions because, in these periods, the productivity growth of followers is higher than the productivity growth of leaders. This fact is consistent with theoretical models of managerial incentives and competition. A recession can be seen as an exogenous increase in competition that reduces demand and poses a threat of liquidation. This threat is higher for followers and is high enough to create asymmetric incentives to become more productive. We test the robustness of our results to sample selection and different productivity measure.","[Escribano, Alvaro] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid 28903, Spain; [Stucchi, Rodolfo] Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Stucchi, R (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, Av Pedro de Valdivia 0193, Santiago, Chile.",alvaroe@eco.uc3m.es; rstucchi@iadb.org,"Escribano, Alvaro/H-7997-2015","Escribano, Alvaro/0000-0003-4401-0887; Stucchi, Rodolfo/0000-0002-6317-9461",,,,,34,12,12,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We estimate a translog stochastic variable cost frontier using two different techniques on an unbalanced panel of 141 water distribution utilities over the years 2002-2009, for a total of 745 observations. Results show that exogenous factors have an impact on variable cost. More precisely, we find that the share of pumped over total extracted water, population density, altitude and meteorological factors (maximum 30 days temperature and extreme precipitation events) have a significant impact on variable cost. Likelihood ratio tests emphasize the importance to include observed heterogeneity in the estimations. Efficiency rankings provided by models accounting for exogenous factors and their counterparts without them are however relatively similar. On the contrary, the efficiency ranks differ strongly between alternative estimation techniques. In assessing the economic performance of utilities, the most important choice thus seems to be about the way unobserved heterogeneity is treated.","[Faust, Anne-Kathrin] EPFL ENAC INTER REME, Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Res Grp Econ & Management Environm REME, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Baranzini, Andrea] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland HES SO, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, Geneva Sch Business Adm HEG Ge, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland,"Faust, AK (通讯作者)，EPFL ENAC INTER REME, Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Res Grp Econ & Management Environm REME, Bat BP,Stn 16, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",annekathrin.faust@gmail.com,"Baranzini, Andrea/R-6506-2019","Baranzini, Andrea/0000-0002-9438-7730",,,,,56,12,12,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

There are new perspectives on greening (focusing on ecological objectives) and sustainability (combining both ecological and social goals). Academic papers mainly study the ecological efficiency of agricultural public policies, while real public policies, such as the European Common Agricultural Policy, examine both ecological and social considerations. The objective of this paper is to consider economic, social and ecological objectives within the design of agricultural public policies. Using a bio-economic model applied to France, we compare different optimal public strategies. We show that, when the biodiversity objectives are either very limited or very demanding, grassland subsidies are the best instruments from both green and sustainable points of view. However for medium objectives, reducing crops subsidies is the cheapest way to green the CAP, while subsidies on grasslands are the only strategy from a sustainability perspective. Our work highlights new trade-offs related to policy implementation, such as social acceptance or technical difficulties, and the spatial equity of performance among regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Disagreement reduces the impact of economic models and signals a need for improved methodology. The problem is related to the choice of intergenerational welfare functions. A first questionnaire finds that the standard welfare function (SWF) fails to capture people's dislike of overshooting and fluctuating consumption paths. A second questionnaire reveals that when very-long-term sustainability of well-being is threatened, people's implicit discount rates resemble the low estimates used by the Stern Review. An alternative welfare function (AWF) reflecting consumption growth can potentially capture the preference structure revealed in both questionnaires. This makes the AWF an interesting candidate when searching for policies for sustainable development under uncertainty. Importantly, the questionnaires demonstrate that people are able to choose among policies by inspecting time graphs of policy consequences. Thus, it is possible to circumvent the complexities and disagreements introduced by welfare functions and discounting. (C) 2014 The Author.

This article studies the relationship between this technological change and the spatial distribution of manufacturing industries in the German Empire during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The adoption of steam powered machinery created incentives for manufacturers to form industry clusters near coal mining regions. Specifically, this article shows that a one standard deviation increase in the average size of steam power operations was associated with a rise in geographic concentration of one-quarter of a standard deviation. In contrast, a one standard deviation increase in the size of water power operations was associated with a drop in geographic concentration of one-sixth of a standard deviation. This is consistent with the constraint that water powered plants had to be located on a stream with a sufficient gradient and away from other water powered plants to avoid disruption from neighbouring gates and dams. Together the findings indicate that the transition from water to steam powered machinery contributed to the geographic concentration of manufacturing in the nineteenth century.","Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12181 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Gutberlet, T (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12181 USA.",,,,,,,,37,11,13,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Collectors were appointed by parishes and incorporated boroughs in accordance with the poor laws of 1552 and 1563, but few of their fragile records survive. The accounts examined here document early use of compulsory rates to provide income, but several features of the distribution of relief differ from patterns common in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Adult male recipients outnumbered women in many of the parishes; children were frequently helped directly; and cities and towns assisted a smaller fraction of their total populations than did villages but awarded larger per capita payments. Accounts from the 10 villages and small towns analysed most fully show that Elizabethan Collectors were moving away from the late medieval practice of providing only occasional aid; increasingly they awarded regular payments to a selected subset of the local poor. Comparison with the early seventeenth century suggests that the poor laws of 1598 and 1601 contributed to a transition that was already underway but did not create a new system of relief.","Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"McIntosh, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,,36,7,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Based on the review of the equity and cost-effectiveness literature and relevant policy documents, we identify three potential indicators for equity (vulnerability level, poverty, equal funding per capita), and three indicators for cost-effectiveness (economic savings in absolute and relative terms, human lives saved). Applying these simple indicators to information provided in all 39 project documents considered by the Adaptation Fund Board (AFB) in 2011, we find that projects approved or endorsed by the AFB rank high according to one cost-effectiveness indicator (absolute economic savings), while they rather rank low according to all equity and further cost-effectiveness indicators. Furthermore, we analyze whether equity and cost-effectiveness are two contradicting goals, or whether ways can be found to reconcile both goals in multilateral adaptation finance. We conclude from both the theory and the 39 analyzed project documents that a pure economic definition of cost-effectiveness tends to be in contradiction with equity but that trade-offs between equity and cost-effectiveness can be limited if relative economic savings or human live savings are used as indicator for cost-effectiveness.","[Stadelmann, Martin; Michaelowa, Axel] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stadelmann, Martin; Michaelowa, Axel] Univ Zurich, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Persson, Asa] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Persson, Asa] Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ratajczak-Juszko, Izabela] RMIT Univ, Global Cities Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",University of Zurich; University of Zurich; Stockholm University; Stockholm Environment Institute; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Stadelmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.stadelmann@pw.uzh.ch,"Persson, Åsa/ABD-8096-2021","Persson, Asa/0000-0002-8886-5046; Michaelowa, Axel/0000-0001-5053-3700",,,,,69,35,38,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Building on a simple Cobb-Douglas production function, our model shows that the implementation of skill-biased technologies requires a sufficient proportion of highly educated individuals. Moreover, when technical progress disproportionately replaces middle-skill jobs, the local distribution of skills will exhibit fat-tails, where the proportion of both highly skilled and low-skilled workers increases. These and several other predictions of the model are consistent with recent existing evidence, and avoid some major criticism against the canonical CES framework.","[Accetturo, Antonio; de Blasio, Guido] Bank Italy, Reg Anal Div, Struct Econ Anal Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Dalmazzo, Alberto] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; University of Siena,"Accetturo, A (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Reg Anal Div, Struct Econ Anal Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",antonio.accetturo@bancaditalia.it; alberto.dalmazzo@unisi.it; guido.deblasio@bancaditalia.it,"Accetturo, Antonio/ISA-2834-2023","Dalmazzo, Alberto/0000-0002-9968-4419",,,,,45,13,13,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

We first argue that the conventional engineering motivation of DEA can be problematic since it often builds on unverifiable production axioms. We then provide a dual viewpoint and highlight the 'behavioral' interpretation of DEA models. We start from a specification of the production objectives while imposing minimal structure on the production possibilities, and construct tools to meaningfully quantify deviations of observed producer behavior from optimizing behavior. This brings to light the economic meaning of DEA, provides guidelines for selecting the appropriate model in practical research settings, and prepares the ground for instituting new DEA models. We also provide an empirical application that demonstrates the practical relevance of our arguments. We hope that our insights will contribute to the further dissemination of DEA, and stimulate public sector applications of DEA that build on its behavioral interpretation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a dynamic three-sector computable general equilibrium model of the period to analyze the effects of the policies of import-substituting industrialization (ISI), and changing factor endowments, on the structure of the economy. We find that the declining land-labor ratio was more important than ISI in explaining relative stagnation in agriculture.

To date, there has been a limited amount of research investigating farmers' values through the ecosystem services concept, particularly in Australia. In this paper we address this research gap through focusing on farmers' perceptions of four different attributes towards 12 ecosystem services. Results from our survey indicate that farmers place a high value on the importance of all ecosystem services, whilst perceiving most of them to be moderately manageable. The farmers identified a variety of threats towards ecosystem services that were mostly agricultural in origin, whilst perceiving themselves to be moderately vulnerable to the loss of services. To overcome any potential loss of services, market-based instruments such as schemes paying for ecosystem services can be applied. These economic tools do appear to be needed, as the farmers in this study directly identified the economic cost of maintaining native habitat as a threat. Through more explicit understanding of the social dimension of the two-way relationship between ecosystem services and agricultural production, natural resource policies to overcome this potential negative cycle can be implemented more effectively.

Also, the study aimed to determine what relationship exists between consumers' lifestyle and their behavioral intention to eat healthily when dining out. In addition, the study investigated the relationships between restaurant attributes and consumers' intention to eat healthily when dining out. Design/methodology/approach - This study posits that restaurant attributes have an impact on consumers' intention to order healthy meals at a restaurant Questionnaires were distributed and collected over a two-month period in south Florida. Respondents were asked to indicate on a five-point scale their considerations when selecting a restaurant and particular ingredients in the food when dining out. The study analyzed the data using one-way ANOVA and Games-Howell test in order to find that considerations about nutritional components when choosing a meal at a restaurant. Also, multiple regression was run to determine the relationship between lifestyle and restaurant attributes and intention to order healthy food at a restaurant. Findings - Most of the respondents (76.5 percent) were concerned about their weight; however, only 26.7 percent of the respondents were actually on a diet Of the respondents 33 percent knew about MyPyramid (USDA), which is an updated version of the Food Pyramid (USDA). Based on the results of one-way ANOVA and Games-Howell test, the study found that considerations about nutritional components when choosing a meal at a restaurant differed according to consumers' knowledge of health issues, weight concerns, gender, age, and marital status. Also, the results of multiple regression suggested that lifestyle, offering variety of healthy food, and services were significant predictors of consumers' intention to order healthy food at a restaurant, whereas other attributes of restaurants were not significant predictors for the ordering of healthy food. Originality/value - This study has contributed unique and extended conclusions from previous studies and has given consumers a better understanding about particular nutritional components in order for them to take advantage of the recent trend in more healthy foods being available at restaurants. The results of this study revealed that restaurants' marketing strategies for healthy food need to target consumers whose lifestyle promotes a healthy life in terms of regular exercise, dietary plans, or eating food considering the FoodPyramid, rather than target consumers whose lifestyle is less healthy. However, the results of this study also suggest that the offering of healthy food and good services do have effect on consumers' consideration to order healthy food.","[Choi, Jinkyung] Woosong Univ, Dept Foodserv Management, Taejon, South Korea; [Zhao, Jinlin] Florida Int Univ, Chaplin Sch Hospitality & Tourism Management, Miami, FL 33199 USA",Woosong University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Choi, J (通讯作者)，Woosong Univ, Dept Foodserv Management, Taejon, South Korea.",choi3728@wsu.ac.kr,,,,,,,55,20,21,2,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Only a very limited number of studies have focused on the implementation of lean manufacturing practices within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the food sector. The majority of these studies used the case study method and concentrated on individual lean manufacturing techniques geared towards resolving efficiency issues. This paper aims to analyze the status of the lean manufacturing practices and their benefits and barriers among European food processing SMEs. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire was developed to collect data. A total of 35 SMEs' representatives, mostly CEOs and operations managers, participated in the survey. The study investigated the role of two control variables in lean implementation: size of the company and country of origin. Findings - The findings show that lean manufacturing practice deployment in food processing SMEs is generally low and still evolving. However, some lean manufacturing practices are more prevalent than others; e.g. flow, pull and statistical process control are not widely used by the food processing SMEs, whereas total productive maintenance, employee involvement, and customer association are more widespread. The key barriers encountered by food SMEs in the implementation of lean manufacturing practices result from the special characteristics of the food sector, such as highly perishable products, complicated processing, extremely variable raw materials, recipes and unpredictable demand. In addition, lack of knowledge and resources makes it difficult for food processing SMEs to embark on the lean journey. Originality/value - The gap in the literature regarding the application of lean manufacturing in the food sector is identified and addressed in this study. The originality of this paper lies in analyzing the current status of the use of lean manufacturing practices among food SMEs in Europe and identifying potential barriers.","[Dora, Manoj; Van Goubergen, Dirk; Molnar, Adrienn; Gellynck, Xavier] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van Goubergen, Dirk] Univ Ghent, Dept Ind Management, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Kumar, Maneesh] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Molnar, Adrienn; Gellynck, Xavier] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Bioengn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; Cardiff University; Ghent University,"Dora, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",manojkumar.dora@ugent.be,"Kumar, Maneesh/HSF-0452-2023; Molnar, Adrienn/AAK-2861-2020","Kumar, Maneesh/0000-0002-2469-1382; Molnar, Adrienn/0000-0002-3828-4198; Dora, Manoj/0000-0003-4730-8144","IWT, Belgium","IWT, Belgium(Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT))","This study is a part of CORNET project Innovative management system for food industry and was financed by IWT, Belgium.",,59,106,118,10,170,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The study related grape consumption with consumers based on Means-end chain analysis. The data were gathered with both laddering interviews (n = 37) and questionnaire survey returned by 843 individuals in 31 provinces of China. The data were firstly processed by SPSS software and descriptive statistics was adopted to evaluate consumers' awareness. Furthermore, MECanalyst software was opted for, to construct the hierarchical relations of table grape consumption. Findings - The findings are that consumers consume grapes based on their functional cognition and sensory perception. The quality-orientated characters are deemed to be the most important grape attributes, healthy and practical function are the main expected benefits and desired values in table grape consumption. Practical implications - The findings can provide some implications to producers, administers and operators in the grape industry and inspire them to design products that will better satisfy consumers. Stakeholders in grape industries should take measures to inform consumers of grape benefits so as to increase grape consumption and expand the market. Originality/value - The paper fulfils the combinations of laddering interview and structured questionnaire to conduct the large-scale samples survey about consumers' perception based on MEC analysis.

Recent development in the area of application of IFRS and growing number of countries, that adopt IFRS standards in their national environment as a vital alternative to national GAAPs reveals that the whole process of harmonisation of accounting and reporting faces a number of issues worth further investigation. The issue of cultural differences and their impact on implementation of international reporting standards has been analysed in scientific literature by both accounting scholars and practitioners. After the compulsory adoption of IFRS by publically listed firms in the EU in 2005, there have emerged many research studies on centripetal and centrifugal forces in financial reporting in various national environments. In our contribution we use a qualitative holistic approach to characterize the influence of cultural factors on adoption of international reporting standards. We attempt to create a coherent roadmap of different layers influencing the dynamics of accepting the common financial rules.","[Kubickova, Dana; Kocmanova, Sarka] Univ Finance & Adm, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic; [Jindrichovska, Irena] Univ Econ & Management, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Kubícková, D (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic.",dana.kubickova@centrum.cz; sarka.kocmanova@centrum.cz; irena.jindrichovska@seznam.cz,"Kubickova, Dana/F-5098-2013; Jindrichovska, Irena/N-5867-2019; Jindrichovska, Irena/N-7626-2015",,,,,,13,3,3,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,785,794,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700077,0

In the food industry, the quality of products is affected by manufacturing/processing and logistics activities, such as transportation and packaging. Specifically, transportation is likely the most critical step throughout the food journey from farm to fork because of the potential stresses that affect the products during shipment and storage activities. The purpose of this paper is to present and apply an original assessment of quality, safety and environmental effects due to the international distribution of food products via different container solutions. A case study that examines the shipment of edible oils from Italy to Canada demonstrates that the quality of a product at the place of consumption can be significantly affected by the use of different containers. Design/methodology/approach - A simulation-based quality assessment, combined with a life cycle and environmental analysis, supports the logistic manager in the decision-making process in order to guarantee the highest level of product quality at the place of consumption. Findings - The proposed approach and the illustrated case study demonstrate the importance of conducting safety and quality assessment combined with environmental analyses of sustainable food supply chains. Originality/value - This paper highlights the interdependency of implications and decisions on food quality and environmental sustainability of supply chain processes and activities.","[Manzini, Riccardo; Accorsi, Riccardo; Bortolini, Marco] Alma Mater Studiorum Bologna Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Bologna, Italy; [Ayyad, Ziad; Bendini, Alessandra; Toschi, Tullia Gallina] Alma Mater Studiorum Bologna Univ, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Bendini, Alessandra; Toschi, Tullia Gallina] Alma Mater Studiorum Bologna Univ, Interdept Ctr Ind Res Agri Food, Bologna, Italy; [Gamberi, Mauro] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Padua, Italy; [Valli, Enrico] Alma Mater Studiorum Bologna Univ, Interdept Ctr Ind Res Agri Food, Cesena, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna; University of Bologna; University of Padua; University of Bologna,"Manzini, R (通讯作者)，Alma Mater Studiorum Bologna Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Bologna, Italy.",riccardo.manzini@unibo.it,"Valli, Enrico/AFK-4776-2022; Toschi, Tullia Gallina/A-4816-2010; Accorsi, Riccardo/AAV-9129-2020; Manzini, Riccardo/I-9450-2012","Valli, Enrico/0000-0001-6716-1173; Accorsi, Riccardo/0000-0002-2958-923X; Bortolini, Marco/0000-0002-1779-6362; MANZINI, RICCARDO/0000-0003-1142-9139; Gallina Toschi, Tullia/0000-0001-7241-2280; GAMBERI, MAURO/0000-0002-0633-0559",,,,,51,46,46,0,47,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The reason for writing this paper is that food preservation is often overlooked when developing sustainability strategies. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses established carbon footprint data for specific food types and consumer survey data to determine how consumers use fresh and frozen products in the home. Consumption and waste data for 83 households was obtained using a combination of narrative and graphical association questions. Findings - The results show greenhouse gas emissions associated with a diets containing frozen food are reduced because 47 per cent less frozen foods is wasted as compared to fresh foods with a typical household wasting 10.4 per cent of fresh food and 5.9 per cent frozen food. Research limitations/implications - This research has highlighted the importance of understanding the waste impacts of catering and food service consumption outside the home. Practical implications - This research will guide future product development for frozen foods with regard to dietary planning and portion control. Social implications - The cost and sustainability benefits of meal planning are identified and these will inform policy making and education to improve dietary choices. Originality/value - This work extends the scope of current consumer surveys that assess quality, value and taste attributes to sustainability criteria and it will enable collaboration between fresh and frozen product categories to deliver sustainable dietary options.","Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sheffield Business Sch, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England",Sheffield Hallam University,"Martindale, W (通讯作者)，Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sheffield Business Sch, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England.",w.martindale@shu.ac.uk,"MARTINDALE, WAYNE/R-8135-2017","MARTINDALE, WAYNE/0000-0003-0117-1875",Iglo Foods Ltd.,Iglo Foods Ltd.,The initial questionnaire design in the research presented here and the APC was funded by Iglo Foods Ltd.,,11,32,34,3,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The theoretical question then arises of whether it is possible to predict when a natural resource governance system will follow such an incremental path of institutional change. Our investigation of the prior appropriation water rights system as administered in the state of Wyoming reveals that mental models, based on factors such as strong personal connections with administrators, plus strong confidence in the system, tend to favor incremental change. We note that choosing incremental change is not without risk. While systems that undertake wholesale and rapid change risk a good deal - exposing themselves to a potential shower of unanticipated consequences - systems that follow the path of incremental change also take risks. Incremental change may mean successful accommodation of new needs that demand attention, or it may be too little too late, ultimately allowing the pent-up pressure of unmet needs to push the system over a threshold into collapse.

Numerous articles have appeared in health services operations management literature in which models of health operations are used. In this paper we review this wide body of literature with the aim of synthesizing evidence on application of generic operational models in health services. A generic operational model is defined as a formal description of operations performed to deliver a health service that is applicable in a wide range of health service delivery settings. The systematic review of the literature which forms the basis of our research synthesis includes peer reviewed publications from business management databases (SCOPUS) as well as medical databases (Pubmed). Our search resulted in more than 4000 recent papers of which 116 papers met the inclusion criteria. This paper reports our synthesis from the included papers on four main questions: 1) why are models used? 2) what is modeled? 3) what models are used and how are they developed? 4) what are the achievements? Our systematic review reveals that few papers report achievements which qualify as empirical evidence to guide the application of operational models for health services. Nevertheless, the synthesis leads to an initial framework for operational modeling in health services to guide further research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a large database of prices by state of agricultural commodities, we find that dispersion fell for many commodities until the First World War. We demonstrate that this reflected changes in transport costs which in turn in the long run depended on productivity growth in railroads. The year 1920 marked a change in this relationship, however, and between the First and Second World Wars we find considerable disintegration of agricultural markets, ultimately as a consequence of the 1920 Transportation Act. We argue that this benefited railroad companies in the 1920s and workers in the 1930s, and we put forward an estimate of the welfare losses for the consumers of railroad services (that is, agricultural producers and final consumers).","[Federico, Giovanni] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Federico, Giovanni] Univ Pisa, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Sharp, Paul] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark",European University Institute; University of Pisa; University of Southern Denmark,"Federico, G (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.",,"Sharp, Paul/C-1027-2019; Federico, Giovanni/J-5310-2014","Sharp, Paul/0000-0003-0679-0106; Federico, Giovanni/0000-0002-2683-683X",,,,,56,7,8,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

However, the theoretical spatial statistics literature shows that biased estimates might emerge if spatial interactions extend beyond the boundaries of the available data (i.e., the boundary value problem). This paper empirically assesses the practical relevance of this concern by studying German local politicians' assessments of their jurisdictions' main competitors in the struggle to attract firms. We find that location near a border significantly undermines politicians' perception that the fiercest competitive pressure derives from jurisdictions within their own state. This effect sets in about 20 km (10.2 km) from a national (international) border. These results indicate that nearest municipalities perceive each other as competitors regardless of the state or country where they are located, which has important implications for estimating spatial dependence models.","[Geys, Benny] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Oslo, Norway; [Geys, Benny] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Appl Econ, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Osterloh, Steffen] Stat Bundesamt, German Council Econ Experts Sachverstandigenrat B, D-65180 Wiesbaden, Germany",BI Norwegian Business School; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Geys, B (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Business Sch, Oslo, Norway.",Benny.Geys@bi.no; steffen.osterloh@destatis.de,,"Geys, Benny/0000-0003-4524-1820",,,,,61,17,17,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

This investigation compiles extant statistics on the population of Brazil by race and state for the pre-census period from 1545 to 1850, complementing them with headcount estimates based on sugar, gold, and coffee production; pre-contact indigenous populations; and trans-Atlantic slave voyages. The resulting panel of demographic data illustrates national and regional racial transitions encompassing the colonial era.

As ESS refer to human needs and interests, values are to be considered when dealing with the concept in practice. As a result we argue that in using the concept there is a need to be clear about what different dimensions of value are involved, and be aware of ethical issues that might be associated with the concept. A systematic analysis of the ethical implications associated to the ESS concept is still lacking. We address this deficiency by scrutinising value dimensions associated with the concept, and use this to explore the associated ethical implications. We then highlight how improved transparency in the use of the ESS concept can contribute to using its strengths without succumbing to possible drawbacks arising from ethical problems. These problems concern the dangers that some uses of the concept have in obscuring certain types of value, and in masking unevenness in the distribution of costs and benefits that can arise in the management of ESS.

These reductions are maximized when electricity-sector carbon emissions are constrained through policy measures. We use a linear optimization, generation expansion/dispatch model to evaluate the impact of increased electricity demand for plug-in electric vehicle charging on the generating portfolio, overall generating fuel mix, and the costs of electricity generation. We apply this model to the PJM Interconnect and ISO-New England Regional Transmission Organization service areas assuming a CO2 pricing scheme that is applied to the electricity sector but does not directly regulate emissions from other sectors. We find that a shift from coal toward natural gas and wind generation is sufficient to achieve a 50% reduction in electricity-sector CO2 emissions while supporting vehicle charging for 25% of the vehicle fleet. The price impacts of these shifts are sensitive to demand side price responsiveness and the capital costs of new wind construction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This period is of major interest because it covers Portugal's euro area accession and its impact on the banking system. Hence, critical factors impacting the banking system are identified against the background of increasing financial integration prior to the financial crisis that started in 2007 and later translated into strains in some European sovereign debt markets. Banks are modelled as firms which produce loans and other earning assets, choosing the cost minimizing combination of labour, capital and interest bearing debt, subject to holding a predetermined level of equity. According to the results of this study, technological progress has shifted the cost frontier downwards throughout the period under consideration, whereas the distance at which banks have operated from the frontier seems to have remained constant. Further, increases in production under scale economies have also contributed to the recorded increase in productivity.","[Boucinha, Miguel; Ribeiro, Nuno] Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Lisbon, Portugal; [Boucinha, Miguel] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Weyman-Jones, Thomas] Univ Loughborough, Dept Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",Banco de Portugal; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Loughborough University,"Boucinha, M (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Lisbon, Portugal.",mmboucinha@bportugal.pt,,,,,,,20,14,15,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Reducing such disparities is a major goal in European countries. However, healthcare utilization among Italian immigrants is under-studied. The objective of this study is to explore differences in healthcare use between immigrant and native Italians. Cross-sectional study using the latest available (2004/2005) Italian Health Conditions Survey. We estimated separate hurdle binomial negative regression models for GP, specialist, and telephone consultations and a logit model for emergency room (ER) use. We used logistic regression and zero-truncated negative binomial regression to model the zero (contact decision) and count processes (frequency decisions) respectively. Adjusting for risk factors, immigrants are significantly less likely to use healthcare services with 2.4 and 2.7 % lower utilization probability for specialist and telephone consultations, respectively. First- and second-generation immigrants' probability for specialist and telephone contact is significantly lower than natives'. Immigrants, ceteris paribus, have a much higher probability of using ERs than natives (0.7 %). First-generation immigrants show a higher probability of visiting ERs (1 %). GP visits show no significant difference. In conclusion Italian immigrants are much less likely to use specialist healthcare and medical telephone consultations than natives but more likely to use ERs. Hence, we report an over-use of ERs and under-utilization of preventive care among immigrants. We recommend improved health policies for immigrants: promotion of better information dissemination among them, simplification of organizational procedures, better communications between providers and immigrants, and an increased supply of health services for the most disadvantaged populations.","[De Luca, Giuliana] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Ponzo, Michela] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Rodriguez Andres, Antonio] Al Akhawayn Univ, Sch Business Adm, Ifrane 53000, Morocco",University of Calabria; University of Naples Federico II; Al Akhawayn University,"Ponzo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",gideluca@unical.it; michela.ponzo@unina.it; A.Rodriguez@aui.ma,"Andres, A.R/C-8464-2018; Andres, Antonio Rodriguez/H-5951-2019","Andres, A.R/0000-0001-6578-5118; Andres, Antonio Rodriguez/0000-0001-6578-5118; PONZO, Michela/0000-0002-5970-9415",,,,,66,48,53,1,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Results confirm previous work: all subgroups, except Cubans, are less likely to be homeowners than white, non-Hispanics and only Cuban neighborhoods had foreclosure rates significantly lower than rates in white, non-Hispanic neighborhoods.

Because there is a large sales surge over the winter-holiday, it is important to account for seasonal variation. Using a novel approach to constructing a seasonally-adjusted cost-of-living price index that explicitly accounts for consumer heterogeneity, I find that from 1997 to 2003 constant-quality software prices declined at an average 15.9% at an annual rate.

One common approach to changing human behavior is rewarding desired behavior. Because financial incentives often have side effects that diminish efficacy, we predict that social rewards are more effective, because they invoke adherence to descriptive and injunctive social norms. We investigated this by measuring electricity use for 13 weeks at a Dutch firm. Each week, employees were rewarded for conserving energy. They either received monetary rewards ((sic)0-(sic)5) or social rewards (grade points with a descriptive comment). Rewards were either private or public. In both the short and long term, public rewards outperformed private rewards, and social rewards outperformed monetary rewards. This suggests that private monetary rewards, although popular, may be ineffective. Instead, public social rewards may be a more promising approach to stimulating energy conservation. We argue that this approach should be considered more frequently by policy-makers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Handgraaf, Michel J.

The housing slump did not simply follow the downward shifts in income: rather residential investment collapse helped to precipitate the Great Depression. By utilizing an augmented Tobin's q model of residential investment, we show that heightened uncertainty surrounding builders' anticipated profits largely explains the housing slump in the key year of 1930. A combination of forces, including house prices, building costs, credit and demand constraints, and financing costs, is shown to explain the longer decline of residential investment in 1928-1933.

Whilst previous hedonic studies have generally examined the impact on property prices of distance to the nearest active landfill site this paper presents a study for Birmingham in England in which properties are simultaneously located close to numerous active and historical landfill sites. Accounting for the proximity of historical landfill sites alters the perceived disamenity impact of active sites and furthermore, reveals evidence of significant disamenity impacts, decades after site closure, albeit over shorter geographical distances. Estimated disamenity impacts are however somewhat sensitive to assumptions regarding the geographical range of the externalities generated by landfill. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse how a pre-requisite programme (PRP) and key performance indicators (KPI) for food safety can be developed for the production of fresh produce, in both low input and high input supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - The first stage of the research involved an examination of literature, which was conducted using desk research. The second stage includes a review of food safety management systems (FSMS) in fresh produce supply and the development of a PRP/KPI framework. Findings - Farm assurance is well developed in the high input food supply chain for multiple retail customers. However, low input systems such as organic production, or conventional sources are often non-assured, and supply wholesale retail and food service markets. Recent food safety incidents such as the E. coli outbreak in Germany have demonstrated that universally an effective FSMS is critical to ensure that produce is safe and wholesome and is not the cause of a food safety outbreak.

Defining reversibility as the ability to maintain and to restore the functional performance of a system is consistent with thermodynamics; specification of its crucial terms is case dependent. Reversibility is coming in degrees from flexibility, over rigidity to preclusion, with irreversibility as an absolute end. Further substantiating reversibility considers three variables: duration of impacts, revoking cots, and substitutability. Substitutability depends on weights assigned to the strict identity or to the functional performance of something valued. For given degrees of substitutability, revocability of an action is measurable in time-dependent revoking costs. Together with future time and doubt, reversibility sets a three-dimensional context for societal decision-making, revealing domes of expanding complexity. Cost-benefit analysis is a useful decision tool at lower complexity but falters at high complexity because there prevail non-monetary trade-offs. A revival and proper use of the concept reversibility are recommended for improved dialog on major societal issues, with climate change outstanding as the case where reversibility could turn into absolute irreversibility. Also shown is the correspondence between reversibility and ecological concepts like resilience, lock-in, tipping points, and others. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Physicians have explicit financial incentives attached to each potential drug treatment, with profit margins ranging more than a hundred fold. SEER-Medicare claims and Medispan pricing data were formed into a panel of 4,503 patients who were diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer and treated with anti-cancer drugs from 1992 to 2002. We analyzed the effects of product attributes, including profit margin, randomized controlled trial citations, FDA label, generic status, and other covariates on therapy choice. Instruments and drug fixed effects were used to control for omitted variables and possible measurement error associated with margin. We find that increasing physician margin by 10% yields between an 11 and 177% increase in the likelihood of drug choice on average across drugs. Physicians were more likely to use drugs with which they had experience, had more citations, and were FDA-approved to treat breast cancer. Oncologists are susceptible to financial incentives when choosing drugs, though other factors play a large role in their choice of drug.","[Johnson, Scott J.] Precis Hlth Econ, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Epstein, Andrew J.] Philadelphia Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Ctr Hlth Equ Res & Promot, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Epstein, Andrew J.] Univ Penn, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Epstein, Andrew J.] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Johnson, SJ (通讯作者)，Precis Hlth Econ, 711 Atlantic Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",scott.johnson@precisionhealtheconomics.com,,"Epstein, Andrew/0000-0001-5078-6564",,,,,44,17,17,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

This is followed by the presentation of several macroeconomic scenarios using Low Grow, a simulation model of the Canadian economy. The scenarios considered are 'business as usual' which is a projection into the future of past trends, 'selective growth' in which differential growth rates are applied to parts of the economy according to their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and 'degrowth' where the average GDP/capita of Canadians is reduced towards a level more consistent with a world economy the size of which respects global environmental limits. The paper ends with a comparison of the scenarios.

Drawing upon a database of public authorities located in three Italian regions, this paper assesses the determinants and drawbacks of green procurement adoption. In particular, using an econometrical approach we tested the following propositions: (i) the existing awareness on GPP practices, tools and regulations does support public authorities to develop GPP strategies; (ii) the support of external experts in purchasing function does support public authorities to develop GPP practices; (iii) the small dimension of public authority is an obstacle to adopting GPP practices; (iv) ISO 14001 certified public authorities are more likely to develop GPP practices. The econometric analysis shows that the dimension of public authorities and the level of awareness of the existing tools for supporting GPP have a positive and significant effect on the probability that they adopt GPP practices.

Meanwhile we argue that ESS can be understood in a richer and more nuanced way if we revisit the human well-being dimension of the ESS concept, going beyond the widely cited notion of benefits as put forward by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA, 2005) and transcending the currently prevalent utilitarian framing. Hence, we examine ESS through the lens of the capability approach, which offers a multidimensional framework for human wellbeing as an alternative to mainstream utilitarian and opulence perspectives. Within this framework, ESS can be effectively viewed as contributing - in a diversity of ways - to people's capabilities, i.e., their freedoms to lead lives they have reason to value. Such a view opens up a richer debate on the human dimension of ESS and points to new potential areas and ways of application of the ESS concept. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This article shines light on the need to better understand how regime complexes manage overlaps. In developing this understanding, the article explores overlaps and coordination in the forest regime complex. By examining the work of an informal high level agency, the Collaborative Partnership on Forests, the article investigates how coordination in a dense regime complex could be achieved. In pursuing this analysis, the article draws lessons for how to manage increasingly complex problems that interacting planetary boundaries could give rise to. The article draws on the literatures of institutional interplay and institutional design in order to understand the more subtle forms of institutional decision-making. The article shows that there are many overlaps among international institutions with forest related mandate, and identifies the innovative mechanism as important in managing these linkages, although it does not take part in actual decision-making. In sum, the article's findings suggest that carefully designed mechanisms might be one way to, if not to overcome, at least to facilitate the institutional response of governance challenges in the complex setting of planetary boundaries.

However the causes of deforestation are rooted in current economic and development paradigms. The causes of deforestation also vary across different geographical regions and have implications for the forest transition. Attempts to reach an international agreement on curbing deforestation have achieved little success despite over 30 years of UN negotiations. New initiatives from REDO (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) could provide financial incentives to curb deforestation. Hence, alternative development paths for forest cover changes and forest transition are analyzed for the REDD policy within the framework of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for deforestation. The EKC models are estimated for geographical regions of Latin America, Africa and Asia. The results based on the panel data analysis of 43 countries, covering the period 1970-1994, provides evidence that an inverted U-shaped EKC fits for Latin America and Africa, while a U-shaped EKC applies to Asia. The results also indicate that strengthening agricultural and forestry sector policies are important for curbing deforestation. The EKC models' estimates could provide guidance for decisions on financing the REDD policy as specific to each region. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using large farm-level data and a matching estimator, this study explores the relationship between organic certification and farm household income with its various components. Contrary to expectations, certified organic farmers do not earn significantly higher household income than conventional farmers. Though certified organic crop producers earn higher revenue, they incur higher production expenses as well. In particular, certified organic producers spend significantly more on labor, insurance, and marketing charges than conventional farmers. The results suggest that the lack of economic incentives can be an important barrier to conversion to organic farming. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this context the crucial question arises whether EU theory is able to deal with catastrophic risks, i.e. risks of high, but very unlikely losses, in an ethically appealing way. In this paper we show that this is not the case. Rather, if in the framework of EU theory a plausible level of risk aversion is assumed, a tyranny of catastrophic risk (TCR) emerges, i.e. project evaluation is dominated by the catastrophic event. Or, contrary to that, with low degrees of risk aversion, the catastrophic risk eventually has no impact at all (negligence of catastrophic risk (NCR)) which is ethically not acceptable as well.

Several researchers have shown an interest in analyzing the dynamic adjustment processes of unemployment and the average degree of dependence of the current unemployment rates or gross domestic product from the ones observed in the past. In this paper, we present a new econometric approach to the study of regional unemployment persistence, in order to account for spatial heterogeneity and/or spatial autocorrelation in both the levels and the dynamics of unemployment. First, we propose an econometric procedure suggesting the use of spatial filtering techniques as a substitute for fixed effects in a panel estimation framework. The spatial filter computed here is a proxy for spatially distributed region-specific information (e.g., the endowment of natural resources, or the size of the home market) that is usually incorporated in the fixed effects coefficients. The advantages of our proposed procedure are that the spatial filter, by incorporating region-specific information that generates spatial autocorrelation, frees up degrees of freedom, simultaneously corrects for time-stable spatial autocorrelation in the residuals, and provides insights about the spatial patterns in regional adjustment processes. We present several experiments in order to investigate the spatial pattern of the heterogeneous autoregressive coefficients estimated for unemployment data for German NUTS-3 regions. We find widely heterogeneous but generally high persistence in regional unemployment rates.","[Patuelli, Roberto] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Fac Econ Rimini, Bologna, Italy; [Patuelli, Roberto; Nijkamp, Peter] RCEA, Rimini, Italy; [Schanne, Norbert] Inst Employment Res IAB, Nurnberg, Germany; [Griffith, Daniel A.] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Dallas, TX 75230 USA; [Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Bologna; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Patuelli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Fac Econ Rimini, Bologna, Italy.",roberto.patuelli@unibo.it; norbert.schanne@iab.de; dagriffith@utdallas.edu; p.nijkamp@vu.nl,"Patuelli, Roberto/C-6271-2008","Patuelli, Roberto/0000-0003-1908-4307; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; Schanne, Norbert/0000-0003-4799-3233; Griffith, Daniel/0000-0001-5125-6450",,,,,57,34,35,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The regulatory framework is changed from an input regulation based on farm-specific feed quotas, to an individual transferable quota system on nitrogen pollution. The regulatory change is analyzed using Data Envelopment Analysis to model the underlying production structure. The effect of allowing trading of nitrogen quotas on production and profitability is analyzed in a joint production model with good and bad output under different behavioral and technical assumptions, whilst keeping the overall pollution level of nitrogen constant. Furthermore, the effect of a catchment area restriction on nitrogen is analyzed to comply with the EU Water Framework Directive. The paper quantifies the gains of a policy change from a command and control system to an incentive based system. The estimated results suggest that the changed regulation could increase Danish aquaculture production by 16 to 55%, whilst actual profitability could be increased 5 to 10 times.

Therefore, this study was carried out with the intention of assessing the consumption and preferences for ethnic specialty produce by the Hispanics in the east coast of the USA with an aim of formulating production and marketing guidelines to meet the increasing demands of the rising Hispanic population in the USA. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through telephone interviews from 542 randomly selected Mexicans and Puerto Ricans living in 16 east coast regions of the USA. Questions related to socio-demographic details and consumption and preference for 20 pre-determined ethnic specialty produce were asked. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Findings - Chain grocery stores were the most common outlets for ethnic produce. Freshness and quality were the most important criteria for both Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. Expenditure patterns revealed that they allocate 71 percent and 62 percent respectively on ethnic produce compared with other produce. Age and education had a negative influence while income had a positive influence on the willingness-to-pay for ethnic specialty produce. Research limitations/implications - In this study, only ten crops each were selected as ethnic specialty crops that are consumed by Mexicans and Puerto Ricans and the average willingness-to-pay for these crops were elicited. Practical implications - Based on the expenditure patterns of 20 ethnic specialty produce commonly consumed and having a potential to be grown in the USA, this study recommends crops to be prioritized for production trials and grower recommendations. Originality/value - The approach outlined in this paper uses a market-driven assessment for crop prioritization research.","[Ariyawardana, Anoma] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Australia; [Govindasamy, Ramu; Puduri, Venkata] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA",University of Queensland; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Ariyawardana, A (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Australia.",a.ariyawardana@uq.edu.au,"Ariyawardana, Anoma/D-3585-2013","Ariyawardana, Anoma/0000-0003-0947-9559","National Research Initiative (NRI) of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, United States Department of Agriculture [2005-35618-15735]","National Research Initiative (NRI) of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, United States Department of Agriculture","This project was supported by the National Research Initiative (NRI) of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Award No. 2005-35618-15735.

Design/methodology/approach - As part of a larger questionnaire-based survey on innovation in food sector SMEs, respondents were asked to provide examples of their recent innovations and to categorise them as product, process, position, or paradigm innovations. Findings - Food sector SMEs offered a wide range of examples of innovation. They were able to classify their innovations into product, process, position or paradigm innovations. Further, there is evidence that food sector SMEs are engaged in a range of innovation types, although a greater number of examples were offered for product innovation than for other types of innovation. Additionally, there is evidence of overlap and complementariness between different types of innovation. Originality/value - Although the food sector plays an important role within the UK economy, innovation in food and drink sector SMEs has received relatively limited attention.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 260 US consumers participated in a web-based survey that took place in April 2010. The best-worst scaling method was applied measuring the level of importance given by participants to a list of most common attributes used in choice of wine. Independent sample t-tests were applied to compare the best-worst scores between Generation Y and older cohorts. Findings - Differences were found in the level of importance that Generation Y gives to wine attributes in comparison to older cohorts. Generation Y was found to attach more importance to attributes such as Someone recommended it, Attractive front label and Promotional display in-store, whereas older cohorts gave more importance to attributes such as I read about it and Grape variety. This suggests that Generation Y preferences for wine are driven by marketing added-value activities such as promotions and labelling, whereas limited importance is given to information about wine, reflecting lack of subjective knowledge, experience and involvement about wine. Research limitations/implications - This research adds to generation-based research in wine marketing and contributes towards a better understanding of the differences between generation cohorts in relation to their preferences towards wines.

The central hypotheses for this study are that purchase intentions of Chinese DS consumers are a result of attitudes toward using DS, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Health value and perceived susceptibility to illness, as well as product knowledge and marketer distrust, are integrated into the model. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 251 consumers in Shanghai, China. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings - The TPB model is effective in predicting Chinese consumers' imported soy-based DS purchase intentions. Attitudes toward using soy-based DS, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control have significant influences on purchase intention. Perceived behavioral control also plays an important role in the formation of attitudes. Subjective norm significantly influences perceived behavioral control. Chinese consumers' marketer distrust plays a significant role in forming their attitudes and purchase intentions. On the other hand, product knowledge has no moderating influences on the relationships between health value and attitudes and perceived susceptibility to illness and attitudes. Neither health value nor susceptibility to illness has any influence on attitudes. Practical implications - The findings of this study regarding the impact of marketer distrust on attitude and purchase behavior have important implications for western marketers exporting to China and the Chinese government. The western marketers of soy-based DS should consider taking specific actions to decrease consumer distrust of marketers promoting soy-based DS products. In regards to production of goods for the domestic market in China, relevant Chinese state agencies, such as the State Food and Drug Administration, would be well-advised to continue to step up their efforts in product inspections and regulation of pharmaceutical ingredients and also to strengthen legislation such as the Consumer Rights Protection Law. Originality/value - Considering the growing popularity of DS in China, the current research is the first academic attempt to identify factors that affect purchase of imported soy-based DS among Chinese consumers.","[Chung, Jae-Eun; Stoel, Leslie; Ren, Jing] Ohio State Univ, Dept Consumer Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Xu, Yingjiao] Ohio Univ, Sch Human & Consumer Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Chung, JE (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Consumer Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",chung.362@osu.edu,"Stoel, Leslie D/K-2862-2012","xu, yingjiao/0000-0001-9008-9851",,,,,47,37,40,0,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper aims to analyse the multiplicity of behavioural factors influencing producers' motivation to break the food safety norms intentionally. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews existing disciplinary approaches for the analysis of behavioural risks. Based on this review, an analytical framework is developed which provides a base for an interdisciplinary institutional analysis of behavioural risks in food chains. Findings - The reviewed approaches on behavioural risk share the view that deviance is the result of multi-goal and (potentially) opportunistic decision making of bounded rational individuals. The analytical framework presented in this paper integrates these approaches. Research limitations/implications - The analytical framework provides a rough categorisation of behavioural drivers. It neither details the context-dependent subcomponents that determine the utility outcome within each category nor the methods that should be used to analyse them. Originality/value - A behavioural economic analysis based on the framework means opening up the black box of the regulatees' action situation by incorporating the subjectively perceived material incentives in addition to immaterial. motivations such as reputation effects, social norms and community pressure into the analysis. Based on an understanding of producers' motivation, proper institutional solutions can be implemented to enhance producers' compliance with fonnod safety norms.","[Hirschauer, Norbert; Bavorova, Miroslava] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Ernahrungswissensch, Halle, Germany; [Martino, Gaetano] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Econ Estimat & Alimenti, I-06100 Perugia, Italy",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; University of Perugia,"Bavorová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Ernahrungswissensch, Halle, Germany.",miroslava.bavorova@landw.uni-halle.de,"Martino, Gaetano/AAA-3664-2021","Martino, Gaetano/0000-0001-6827-3185; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889",,,,,74,19,21,1,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This information is highly relevant to human well-being, which is the motivation of ecosystem services assessments. We present results from an analysis of stakeholders' perceptions of ecosystem services, well-being and drivers of change in two semi-arid watersheds in south-eastern Spain. Based on the information compiled through a literature review, participant observation and semi-structured interviews, we designed a questionnaire and conducted 381 interviews. Our results show that semiarid watersheds deliver a large variety of ecosystem services; however, these services are perceived in different ways. We identified five stakeholder groups, including: locals dependent on provisioning ecosystem services, locals not directly dependent on provisioning ecosystem services, environmental and local development professionals and rural and nature tourists. Overall, provisioning services related to traditional practices were perceived as highly important and highly vulnerable by every stakeholder group. However, we found contrasting perceptions of some ecosystem services among stakeholders and of the relevant drivers of change and wellbeing. We suggest that socio-cultural valuation is a useful tool to prioritize ecosystem services but more attention should be directed to emerging trade-offs. Linking values to other stakeholder perceptions might be a useful way to move forward in ecosystem services valuation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By employing data from 1800 Bangladeshi farm-households in eight drought-prone and groundwater-depleted districts of three climatic zones and logit models, this study breaks new ground in investigating farm-level adaptation to climate change. Results showed that farmers' perceptions of climatic variability supported macro-level evidence. Science-driven (e.g., drought tolerant rice), environmental resource-depleting (e.g., groundwater), and crop-switching (e.g., non-rice crops) typified preferred farm-level adaptation strategies to alleviate adverse effects of climate change. Drought severity, extent of groundwater depletion, education level, farm-size, access to climate information, and electricity for irrigation, and agricultural subsidies were significant factors underpinning farmers' decision to adapt. Inadequate access to climate information and scientific research outcomes, limited irrigation facility and resource-base represented major adaptation barriers. Strengthening agricultural research and support services including information accessibility, community-focussed farming education and training for improved crop culture practices, and expanded and efficient surface-water irrigation infrastructure are critically important for creating an effective adaptation process to climate change. Scientific research-driven adaptation measures with stronger support systems appear more sustainable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, because of difficulties implementing projections based on standard measures, the closest projections identified by means of least-distance measures may be preferable. Taking into account the practical significance of closest projection points, Aparicio et al. (J Prod Anal 28:209-218, 2007) proposed a least-distance approach based not only on the 1-norm (Manhattan), 2-norm (Euclidean), and a-norm (Chebyshev), but also on the procedure presented by Cherchye and Van Puyenbroeck (Eur J Oper Res 132(2):287-295, 2001). Recently, Tone (Eur J Oper Res 200(2):901-907, 2010) presented a least-distance version of SBM (or equivalently, the enhanced Russell graph measure). However, these authors examined neither the occurrence of multiple optimal projections nor the strong/weak monotonicity of the ratio-form least-distance efficiency measures over the efficient frontier of the production technology. Furthermore, it is not well known that the standard measures of CCR and SBM suffer from the occurrence of multiple optimal solutions or efficient targets. Therefore, the present paper also investigates the possibility of multiple optimal targets and axiomatic properties of ratio-form efficiency measures within a unified p-norm efficiency measurement framework.","[Fukuyama, Hirofumi] Fukuoka Univ, Fac Commerce, Jonan Ku, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan; [Masaki, Hiroya] ASMO Co Ltd, Kosai City, Shizuoka 4310493, Japan; [Sekitani, Kazuyuki] Shizuoka Univ, Dept Math & Syst Engn, Naka Ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan; [Shi, Jianming] Tokyo Univ Sci, Sch Management, Kuki, Saitama 3468512, Japan",Fukuoka University; Shizuoka University; Tokyo University of Science,"Fukuyama, H (通讯作者)，Fukuoka Univ, Fac Commerce, Jonan Ku, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan.",fukuyama@fukuoka-u.ac.jp; hiroya.videgam-78917@ezweb.ne.jp; sekitani@sys.eng.shizuoka.ac.jp; shi@rs.tus.ac.jp,"Fukuyama, Hirofumi/J-3294-2012; Shi, Jianming/J-2545-2014","Fukuyama, Hirofumi/0000-0002-8133-6299; Shi, Jianming/0000-0003-0695-5660","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23510165, 25282090] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,36,29,29,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

It then measures productivity growth. Fares of London coaches in 1835-6 were about 27 per cent of what they would have been but for improvements in horses, vehicles, and roads from 1750, and the two main periods of productivity growth correspond to those of rising speeds. Speeds and productivity of regional coaches increased more smoothly. The rising productivity firmly identifies road transport as one of the modernizing sectors of the economy. New figures are put forward for the growing number of London and regional coaches, indicating rapid growth in passenger miles. While turnpike trusts had little impact before the 1750s, their increasing effectiveness, together with the use of steel springs and improved horses, was crucial to the rising productivity of the 1760s-80s, and even more so to that of the 1810s-20s. The cross roads were apparently poorer than London roads in the late eighteenth century, but thereafter the gap narrowed.",,,,,,,,,,,204,18,19,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

With research control given to the teacher and her classroom as part of their in-class honors biology curriculum, the result was a student designed/written, and professionally structured, research manuscript. The aim of this collaboration was to: (1) integrate quantitative social science into the K-12 science curriculum to foster learning about the nature of social science investigation in a real world context; (2) create a community-based science partnership; and (3) generate social science data useful for decision-making that could withstand scientific peer review. In this commentary, we present the written product of the classrooms' work to illustrate the type of information that can be generated by a participatory science education program, along with a reflection from the students and project researchers about opportunities and barriers to conducting authentic social science research in K-12 classrooms.

A widely discussed policy option to reduce leakage and protect competitiveness of heavy industries is to impose border carbon adjustments (BCAs). The estimation of carbon leakage as well as the assessment of different policy options led to a substantial body of literature in energy-economic modeling. In order to give a quantitative overview on the most recent research of the topic, we conduct a meta-analysis on 25 studies, altogether providing 310 estimates of carbon leakage ratio according to different assumptions and models. The typical range of carbon leakage estimates are from 5% to 25% (mean 14%) without policy and from -5% to 15% (mean 6%) with BCAs. A meta-regression analysis is performed to further investigate the impact of different assumptions on the leakage estimates. The decrease of the leakage ratio with the size of the coalition is confirmed and quantified. Among the BCA options, the extension of BCAs to all sectors and the inclusion of export rebates are the most efficient features in the meta-regression model to reduce the leakage ratio. All other parameters being constant, BCAs reduce leakage ratio by 6 percentage points. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze patterns of drug utilization prior to the coverage gap, where the effective price is higher than the actual copayment for drugs because consumers anticipate that more spending will make them more likely to reach the gap. We find that enrollees' total pre-gap drug spending is sensitive to their effective prices: the estimated price elasticity of drug spending ranges between 0.14 and 0.36. This finding suggests that filling in the coverage gap, as mandated by the health care reform legislation passed in 2010, will influence drug utilization prior to the gap. A simulation analysis indicates that closing the gap could increase Part D spending by a larger amount than projected, with additional pre-gap costs among those who do not hit the gap.","[Jung, Kyoungrae] Penn State Univ, Coll Hlth & Human Dev, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Feldman, Roger; McBean, A.

We used structural decomposition analysis to identify the drivers of change for CO2e emissions in these countries between 1995 and 2009, a period that includes the collapse of the Soviet Union, restructuring and economic growth and the great recession. The results show that final demand has been the main driving force for increasing emissions in the Baltic States and would have caused an 80%, 64% and 143% emission increase in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, respectively, all other factors kept constant. This increase has been partly offset by a declining emission intensity of the economy, especially in Latvia and Lithuania; whereas in Estonia, which has one of the highest emission intensities in Europe, a shift in consumption patterns towards low carbon consumption items and a decarbonizing economic structure were the main balancing factors. It is likely that the Baltic States will experience a continuation of economic growth given their relatively low per capita GDP, which is less than half of the European Union average thus adequate carbon policies are paramount.

New series of transatlantic steerage fares drawn from the unique Cope Line records at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania (HSP) show westward fares fell rapidly from 1830. Adjusted for British and US manual wages, westward travel costs, including provisions, almost halved between 1847 and 1851-3, when Irish migration peaked. Hence although the Irish had to leave Ireland, they might not otherwise have gone so extensively to North America. Eastward travel costs also fell after 1830, encouraging an unexpectedly large return migration to Britain in the late1850s, and maybe earlier.","[Killick, John] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,,,,,,,,,31,6,10,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We describe a general methodology to impose (observation-specific) constraints for the class of linear regression estimators using a method known as constraint weighted bootstrapping. While this method has received attention in the nonparametric regression literature, we show how it can be applied for both parametric and nonparametric estimators. A benefit of this method is that imposing numerous constraints simultaneously can be performed seamlessly. We apply this method to Norwegian dairy farm data to estimate both unconstrained and constrained parametric and nonparametric models.","[Parmeter, Christopher F.] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Sun, Kai] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Henderson, Daniel J.] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, Stavanger, Norway",University of Miami; Aston University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Kumbhakar, SC (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",c.parmeter@miami.edu; k.sun@aston.ac.uk; djhender@cba.ua.edu; kkar@binghamton.edu,"Sun, Kai/AAX-1669-2020; Henderson, Daniel J/D-1822-2014","Sun, Kai/0000-0002-5245-0439; Henderson, Daniel J/0000-0002-4940-9689",,,,,34,23,24,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

However, not all of these new reserves may be as large or as productive as North Dakota's Bakken shale oil. In addition reserves of shale oil look to be a lot less in relative terms than the reserves of shale gas as evidenced by the price of natural gas in the U.S. compared to the price of oil. This suggests that the U.S. and world supplies of shale oil may be limited. In this article, we will look to attempt a different type of forecast for oil using a modified Hubbert curve oil production forecast. We look at possible world oil production trends rather than just U.S. oil production trends. Two interesting comparisons of the world oil production trend to other regional trends are the former Soviet Union's oil production trend and the U.S. oil production trend. If we compare the current world oil production trend to those previous trends using indexation, then we can get an idea of what may happen to world oil production in the future.

The results show that moisture content has a significant effect on the physical properties of cotton seed such as width, geometric mean diameter, volume, thousand seed mass, angle of repose, true density and bulk density (p < 0.01), and also has a significant effect on the length, thickness, projected area and porosity (p < 0.05). As moisture content increased from 7.17 to 13% (dry basis) length, width, thickness, geometric mean diameter, projected area, volume, thousand seed mass and angle of repose increased, while true density, bulk density and porosity decreased. Also, moisture content has no effect on the sphericity of the seeds.

This index deals with experienced well-being, life expectancy and ecological foot print. The comparison of the development of economic indicators, such for example GDP per capita with the development of Happy Planet Index is very interesting and useful for further analyze. Many wealthy countries have very low HPI and very poor countries have high HPI. For example Costa Rica has HPI 64,0 but GNI per capita in 2012 only 8820 current US dollar.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected via an online survey from a sample size of 598 regular UK wine drinkers. To operationalise the study, five research questions were formulated. A highly structured quantitatively directed questionnaire was designed to find the answers to the research questions. Findings - Barriers to a larger uptake of the product category included non-availability of the products, lower quality perceptions, taste issues, lack of awareness, lack of alcohol's feel effect and absence of a lower alcohol drinking occasion. Many UK consumers are not yet convinced how/if lower alcohol wine fits into their wine drinking occasions. The lower ABV wine buyer's main profile characteristics are weighted towards females, Millennial and Baby Boomer age generations, mostly mid to low income, who drink mainly white and rose wines. Lower alcohol on its own is not seen as a big benefit, thus lower ABV wines should be more creatively communicated to sell the benefits. Originality/value - This study contributes to the knowledge base in that it is the first to investigate consumer behaviour metrics as regards lower ABV wine in one of the world's leading markets, in the process providing some important baseline research information on this category. As such it is of value to academic researchers and practitioners alike.","[Bruwer, Johan] Univ S Australia, Sch Mkt, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Jiranek, Vladimir] Univ S Australia, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Halstead, Lulie] Wine Intelligence Ltd, London, England; [Saliba, Anthony] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Psychol, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia",University of South Australia; University of South Australia; Charles Sturt University,"Bruwer, J (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Sch Mkt, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",johan.bruwer@unisa.edu.au,"Bruwer, Johan/L-1280-2013","Bruwer, Johan/0000-0001-7568-605X",,,,,63,14,14,6,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The problem of over-education, asymmetrical impact and inability of human capital to reflect market needs and broken link from R&D to innovations, are the most discussed problems today. In this article we focus on the impact of R&D and science and technology human capital ( HRSTC) on economic growth on EU regional level.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors used the structural equation mode to analyze the variables' causal relationships. Findings - The research results show that Chinese aquatic farmers' relationship networks can positively impact their participation in modern channels through the mediators of trust, specific assets investments and joining in cooperatives. Research limitations/implications - Two constructs are measured by a single item. Further study to incorporate multi-item constructs would be valuable. Practical implications - The policy implication is that the government should pay attention to farmers' relationship networks and can provide them with more public goods, especially channel and price information, to assist their evaluations and decision-making, which can help them to access modern marketing channels. Originality/value - The authors gave the answers that whether farmers' relationship networks affect their marketing channel selection decision and the function mechanism.","Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Geng, XH (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",gengxh@njau.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71003050]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China [KYZ201162]; Fundamental Research Funds for Chinese Academy of Fish Science [2012C018],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China; Fundamental Research Funds for Chinese Academy of Fish Science,"This article is the result of a coordinated research program with the participation of the following projects and donors, who we thank for funding: Input-output analysis of Chinese agribusiness: from the view of international comparativeness (No. 71003050), funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); Direct Farm Project and its impact on the small farmers' behaviour and income (No. KYZ201162), Funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China; The Development and Management Plans for Jiangsu Aquatic Industry (No. 2012C018), Funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for Chinese Academy of Fish Science.",,40,6,6,0,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The situation and condition of road infrastructure in Czech Republic is not at perfect, even though density of road infrastructure is very high compering average of EU. According to theories, improvements in transport infrastructure definitely reach long-term economic impacts by influencing firms on the one side and inhabitants on the other side. The impacts go mainly through decisions that are made by employers. The effect on employment and obviously unemployment rate takes place at many points in time period and space, and can differ considerably across diverse sectors of the economy. Providing of transport infrastructure is endogenous and at the same time exogenous. From this reason, the contributory relationship between transport investment and employment is probably indefinite.","[Halova, Pavlina] Ceska Zemedelska Univ Praze, Provozne Ekon Fak, Prague 16501, Czech Republic; [Alina, Jiri] Jihoceska Univ Ceskych Budejovicich, Ekon Fak, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Hálová, P (通讯作者)，Ceska Zemedelska Univ Praze, Provozne Ekon Fak, Kamycka 933, Prague 16501, Czech Republic.",halova@pef.czu.cz; jalina@ef.jcu.cz,"Alina, Jiri/U-1917-2019; Halova, Pavlina/H-6831-2018","Halova, Pavlina/0000-0003-2236-3227",,,,,10,9,9,0,9,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-02-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,445,455,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC1KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350226700044,0

The most important competitive factor became price, which was determined mainly based on the prices of competitors. Hotel companies therefore segment in some detail even the prices of services. Pricing structure is usually based on prices offered by the competition. One of the fundamental problems of pricing is the method of obtaining information about the market situation, especially on competitive prices.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative longitudinal study involving 37 low socioeconomic Australian parents with at least one overweight or obese child aged five to nine years. Data were obtained with the use of interviews, focus groups, and self-introspections. Findings - Identified issues relating to the practice of hiding vegetables included: how parents manage hiding vegetables, children's presence in the kitchen during vegetable preparation, the employment of deception when hiding vegetables, the use of cookbooks and blogs, and the alternative views of parents not strongly in favour of hiding vegetables. Research limitations/implications - Hiding vegetables is a practice used by some parents to increase their children's vegetable intake. Children who are unaware of hidden vegetables in their meals are potentially missing the opportunity to develop an appreciation for vegetables and learn about vegetable preparation and cooking. Practical implications - The findings are relevant to dietitians, general practitioners, and other health professionals providing advice to parents on appropriate child-feeding strategies. Originality/value - This appears to be the first study to provide an in-depth account of low socioeconomic parents' use of hiding vegetables to facilitate higher levels of vegetable consumption.","[Pescud, Melanie] Univ Western Australia, Sch Sport Sci Exercise & Hlth, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Pettigrew, Simone] Univ Western Australia, Hlth Promot Evaluat Unit, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Pescud, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Sport Sci Exercise & Hlth, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",melanie.pescud@uwa.edu.au,"Pescud, Melanie/H-5623-2014","Pettigrew, Simone/0000-0003-3921-1174; Pescud, Melanie/0000-0002-9073-3093",Healthway [18919]; Healthway [18919] Funding Source: researchfish,Healthway; Healthway,This work was supported by Healthway (18919).

Furthermore, heightened recent attention to private labels in the food retailing industry creates the need to assess whether the factors vary, depending on customers' brand proneness and their impact on key marketing performance variables (satisfaction, attitudinal loyalty, behavioural loyalty). Design/methodology/approach - The proposed analysis features 211 questionnaires out of a sample of 391 consumers surveys gathered in four different store formats; 137 of which were completed by consumers who admitting being private label prone, and 74 pertaining to consumers who considered themselves national brand prone. The underlying food store factors were identified using factorial analysis of principal components, and their influence on consumers' satisfaction and loyalty was evaluated with linear parametric regression models. Findings - Store attributes related to providing sufficiently convenient purchasing experiences and a special atmosphere are most important for private label brand-prone consumers and enhance their satisfaction, attitudinal loyalty and behavioural loyalty. For national brand-prone consumers, attributes related to quality are more important for enhancing marketing performance variables. Research limitations/implications - The results enable a clear identification of food store factors that vary with the consumer segment being considered (private label prone consumers vs. national brand prone), as well as their differential impacts on key marketing performance variables. Practical implications - To appeal to private label-prone consumers, food retailers should put particular emphasis on the attributes of the store itself, especially those that enhance convenience and the pleasantness of the store atmosphere. To attract national brand-prone consumers, they primarily need to highlight aspects related to quality. Originality/value - This research emphasises the importance of building competitive strategies in food retailing based on: an increased knowledge about the attributes and factors that food consumers value more highly; and brand type preferences.","[Pilar Martinez-Ruiz, Maria; Ruiz-Palomino, Pablo; Martinez-Canas, Ricardo; Jose Blazquez-Resino, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Business Adm, Fac Social Sci, Cuenca, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Martinez-Canas, R (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Business Adm, Fac Social Sci, Cuenca, Spain.",ricardo.martinez@uclm.es,"Blazquez-Resino, Juan Jose/D-3861-2009; Martinez-Canas, Ricardo/G-3040-2010; Ruiz-Palomino, Pablo/D-4981-2012; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/B-7200-2012; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/IUM-9361-2023","Blazquez-Resino, Juan Jose/0000-0001-8586-6337; Martinez-Canas, Ricardo/0000-0003-4629-5513; Ruiz-Palomino, Pablo/0000-0002-0413-8512; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/0000-0002-5890-5174; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/0000-0002-5890-5174",,,,,69,16,16,3,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The research is developed in two stages: a qualitative investigation based on in-depth interviews with quality managers (QMs); a quantitative investigation with a structured questionnaire: with response from 192 food processors in Italy, selected through a probabilistic random sampling method. Data were elaborated with descriptive statistical techniques and subsequently with multivariate analysis (factor and cluster analysis). Findings - QMs agree with most of the assumptions with regard to the impact elements of the BRC food standard. Some characteristics, such as geographic location, size, and type of processing and adoption of ISO 9001, seem to elicit different perceptions between the companies. Through factor analysis, eight factors were extracted; and subsequently, through cluster analysis applied to the factors, five different groups of companies are identified. Practical implications - The adoption of private food standards is both useful and comprehensible for food operators. However, BRC is a minimum standard and a base level for food suppliers; it cannot wholly substitute a specific retailer's dedicated second-party audit. Findings could be used by the subjects of the certification process to determine ideal marketing strategies. Originality/value - this paper provides a statistically significant description of the impact of private food standards (via the important BRC standard) in one of the most important European markets.","[Spadoni, Roberta; Lombardi, Pamela; Canavari, Maurizio] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Hingley, Martin] Lincoln Univ, Sch Business, Lincoln, England",University of Bologna; University of Lincoln,"Hingley, M (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Sch Business, Lincoln, England.",mhingley@lincoln.ac.uk,"Canavari, Maurizio/A-7247-2008","Canavari, Maurizio/0000-0003-0573-7880; Hingley, Martin/0000-0003-0281-959X",,,,,51,12,14,4,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This study examines underlying reasons and offers recommendations for improvement.","[Xin, Hai-Chang] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Hlth Care Org & Policy, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Amsbary, Jonathan; Powell, Larry] UAB, Commun Studies, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Amsbary, J (通讯作者)，UAB, Commun Studies, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",hxin@uab.edu; amsbary@uab.edu; lpowell@uab.edu,"Amsbary, Jonathan/AAU-4281-2021",,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",1951-6851,,978-94-6252-008-0,ADV INTEL SYS RES,,,2014,107.0,,,,,,407,416,,,,,,10,Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BB0ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000340893200068,0

In the analysis there are compared two Time Input-Output tables, which should express the same on the level of sections of commodity classification. The difference lies in the way of compilation. One approach uses the input data aggregated on the level of sections before the compilation starts. The second approach uses the input data for the compilation at more detailed level, namely at the level of product groups. The resulted Time Input-Output tables are aggregated after the compilation on the level of sections of commodity classification, in this case.

There are few systematic studies of the determinants of environmental preferences in emerging economies, and Brazil is a particularly interesting case because of its democratic political system, rapid economic growth, and importance for the global environment. In general, we find that the Brazilian public is highly supportive of environmental protection. To explain variation in environmental preferences, we focus on the effects of income and education. Many previous studies suggest that both should have positive effects, but the empirical evidence is mixed. Indeed, we find that income has no effect on environmental preferences. However, education is a strong predictor of environmental preferences. While college education is not necessary for environmental awareness, there is a large difference between Brazilians with primary and secondary education. For policy, the findings imply that investment in secondary education can raise environmental awareness, regardless of income levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, current understanding of livelihood vulnerability to climate change is based on a fractured and disparate set of theories and methods. This review therefore combines theoretical insights from sustainable livelihoods analysis with other analytical frameworks (including the ecosystem services framework, diffusion theory, social learning, adaptive management and transitions management) to assess the vulnerability of rural livelihoods to climate change. This integrated analytical framework helps diagnose vulnerability to climate change, whilst identifying and comparing adaptation options that could reduce vulnerability, following four broad steps: i) determine likely level of exposure to climate change, and how climate change might interact with existing stresses and other future drivers of change; ii) determine the sensitivity of stocks of capital assets and flows of ecosystem services to climate change; iii) identify factors influencing decisions to develop and/or adopt different adaptation strategies, based on innovation or the use/substitution of existing assets; and iv) identify and evaluate potential trade-offs between adaptation options. The paper concludes by identifying interdisciplinary research needs for assessing the vulnerability of livelihoods to climate change. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The way in which incentives are structured affects trade-offs between local livelihoods, carbon emission reduction, and the cost-effectiveness of a REDD + programme. Looking at first-hand empirical data from 208 farming households in the Bolivian Amazon from a household economy perspective, our study explores two policy options: 1) compensated reduction of emissions from old-growth forest clearing for agriculture, and 2) direct payments for labour input into sustainable forest management combined with a commitment not to clear old-growth forest. Our results indicate that direct payments for sustainable forest management - an approach that focuses on valuing farmers' labour input can be more cost-effective than compensated reduction and in some cases is the most appropriate choice for achieving improved household incomes, permanence of changes, avoidance of leakages, and community-based institutional enforcement for sustainable forest management.

In evaluating improved stoves' relative benefits, little attention has been given to who received which stove intervention due to choices that are made by agencies and households. Using Chinese household data, we find that the owners of more efficient stoves (i.e., clean-fuel and improved-biomass stoves, as compared with traditional-biomass and coal stoves) live in less healthy counties and differ, across and within counties, in terms of household characteristics such as various assets. On net, that caused efficient stoves to look worse for health than they actually are. We control for counties and household characteristics in testing stove impacts. Unlike tests that lack controls, our preferred tests with controls suggest health benefits from clean-fuel versus traditional-biomass stoves. Also, they eliminate surprising estimates of health benefits from coal, found without using controls. Our results show the value, for learning, of tracking who gets which intervention.

We formalize this mechanism in a theoretical model that portrays a small community having joint access to a common pool resource. The diffusion of norms of cooperation takes place via interpersonal relations, while individual agents face the temptation of higher profits by overexploiting the resource. Agents remain conditionally cooperative, unless other individuals are misbehaving already. We can observe a bubble of conditional cooperators slowly building up followed by a sudden burst, which means that a transition from a cooperative social norm to non-cooperation occurs. Interestingly, in some parameter regions alternative stable states and limit cycles arise. The latter implies that the same community goes through such a transition repeatedly over long time spans - history thus repeats itself in the form of the creation and erosion of social capital.

According to the hypothesis, stringent environmental regulations have dynamic effects on firm performance, and these effects eventually generate profits that offset the adaptation costs. We extend previous analyses by using unique data on environmental protection investments in the Swedish manufacturing industry as a proxy for environmental stringency. These data enable us to separate environmental protection investments into pollution prevention and pollution control. This distinction is crucial since the hypothesis claims that it is investments in prevention that have positive dynamic effects on firm performance. To test the hypothesis, a stochastic production frontier model is estimated where firm inefficiency is a function of investments in environmental protection. In general, we find no support for the Porter hypothesis within the time frame of our study, indicating that environmental regulations lead to efficiency losses. This result is even stronger in the harshly regulated pulp and paper industry.","[Broberg, Thomas; Samakovlis, Eva; Hammar, Henrik] Natl Inst Econ Res, S-10362 Stockholm, Sweden; [Marklund, Per-Olov] Umea Univ, Ctr Reg Sci CERUM, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Hammar, Henrik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Umea University; University of Gothenburg,"Samakovlis, E (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, S-10362 Stockholm, Sweden.",eva.samakovlis@konj.se,,,,,,,24,44,48,1,84,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We adopt consistent bootstrap estimation procedures to obtain confidence intervals for Malmquist indices of HEI productivity and their components. Consequently, we are able to assess the statistical significance of changes in HEI productivity, efficiency and technology. Our results suggest that, assessed vis-A -vis a common 'European' frontier, HEI productivity rose on average by 4 % annually. Statistically significant changes in productivity were registered in 90 % of observations on the institutions in our sample, but statistically significant annual improvements in overall productivity took place in only 56 % of cases. There are considerable national differences, with German, Italian and Swiss HEIs performing better in terms of productivity change than HEIs from the other countries examined.","[Parteka, Aleksandra; Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Parteka, A (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",aparteka@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Parteka, Aleksandra/AAN-5881-2020; Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna/O-4433-2018","Parteka, Aleksandra/0000-0003-1149-6614; Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna/0000-0002-3392-5267",,,,,39,46,50,2,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

An empirical example of a 6-dimensional EEPPF is provided using a watershed in Illinois where three provisioning ecosystem services (corn, soybeans, hay) and three regulating services (flood control, water quality, and carbon retention) are the objectives. When aggregated, provisioning and regulatory services form a linear-to-convex EEPPF, but regulatory services can be increased from 10 to over 90% of optimal with a reduction in provisioning services (crops) from 100 to 78% of optimal. While corn and soybeans are shown to form a trade-off with all other ecosystem services, hay is complementary with flood control, water quality and carbon retention. These three regulating services are complementary with one another, with water quality and carbon correlated at 0.80. These results demonstrate the use of GIS, distributed watershed models such as SWAT, and genetic algorithms as a valuable method to estimate empirical EEPPFs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Existing parametric econometric techniques (stochastic frontier methods) assume that output is a continuous random variable but, if output is discretely distributed, then one faces a scenario of model misspecification. Therefore a new class of econometric models has been developed to overcome this problem. The Delaporte subclass of models is studied in detail, and tests of hypotheses are proposed to discriminate among parametric models. In particular, Pearson's chi-squared test is adapted to construct a new kernel-based consistent Pearson test. A Monte Carlo experiment evaluates the merits of the new model and methods, and these are used to estimate the frontier and efficiency scores of the production of infant deaths in England. Extensions to the model are discussed.","Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Fé, E (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Room 4-305,Jean McFarlane Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",e.fe-rodriguez@manchester.ac.uk,,"Fe, Eduardo/0000-0001-7693-9143",,,,,56,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Firstly, it argues that the costeffectiveness of REDD+ may have been exaggerated as current estimates ignore some cost categories as well as the evolution of drivers. Whilst REDD+ remains a low-hanging fruit' for climate mitigation, if all costs were included estimates would be at the high end of the currently accepted range. Secondly, the article highlights that REDD+ will be affected by a large funding gap at least until the entry into force of a new climate protocol in 2020. This gap is due as much to the poor status of public finances in donor countries as to the languishing state of carbon markets, and it calls for a revision of the assumptions regarding the design of the programme. Finally, it is advocated that, in order to contribute to the development of the programme, economic research on REDD+ should consider different policy options, assessing their efficiency and identifying measures that increase their cost-effectiveness.

This paper analyzes primary data on time allocation to livelihood activities by forest communities in the Indian Himalayas to investigate this question. Estimation results are consistent with the hypothesis that forest access regimes affect both forest extraction behavior and other livelihood strategies. Residents of sanctuary forests, experiencing higher restrictions on forest use, decrease the proportion of time allocated to forest extraction and livestock activities, but compensate by increasing their time allocation to agriculture in comparison to residents of state-controlled protected forests. However, wealthy residents of the wildlife sanctuary expend a higher proportion of their time in managing livestock and extracting forest resources in comparison to its less affluent residents. Thus wealth enables circumvention of access restrictions despite legalization of exclusion.

However, the effects of invasive species on non-market services such as biodiversity and landscapes can be considerable. A proactive approach of assessing the expected economic impact of invasive species prior to their occurrence may contribute to greater efficiency of policy makers. Here we used a stated preference method for a priori evaluating the willingness of the population to pay for different control programs of a new invasive bee species in Israel, the dwarf honey bee, Apis florea. We evaluated possible economic impacts of A. florea using two model plant species expected to be adversely affected by its invasion due to decreased pollination. The plants have no market value but they add aesthetic value to the open landscape. Using a mixed logit model we found that the mean willingness to pay (WTP) differed between the model plants, and increased with the extent of plant loss. Respondents differentiated between levels of damage to the plants and between control methods in their preferences for a specific program. Our results provide means for informed proactive decision making in preventing the continued invasion of the bee. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Of the 144 distinct 2 x 2 games in which the players have strict ordinally ranked utilities, 25 are potentially relevant to climate problem. The negotiations may be characterized as a No-Conflict Game, Prisoner's Dilemma, Coordination Game, Chicken, Type Game, or Cycle, depending on the payoff matrix. Which game corresponds to the actual state of the world depends both on the severity of risks associated with climate change and the perceptions of the governments engaged in the negotiations. Nash equilibrium or Maxi-min equilibrium (or neither) may be the outcome. Achieving universal abatement of greenhouse gas emissions may require side payments or enforcement mechanisms outside the game framework, but we show how the negotiations themselves may offer opportunities to select between Nash equilibria or alter the payoff rankings and strategic choices of the players. In particular, scientific information pointing to the severity of the risks of climate change suggests characterization of the negotiations as a Coordination Game rather than a Prisoner's Dilemma.

CSR is considered as a way for an enterprise to increase its reputation and safeguard against risks, e.g. food safety, environmental or social incidence. Thus, it is not surprising that CSR has gained importance for meat companies. However, the question arises whether consumers are indeed aware and appreciative of this involvement. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A convenient sample of 123 consumers was interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive as well as uni- and multivariate methods. Findings - The results show that CSR is hardly known by German consumers and only plays a moderate role in their present purchase behavior. However, consumers are interested in CSR and the survey results reveal a potential for CSR to become an important determinant in consumers' purchase decision of meat. Research limitations/implications - Concerning the interpretation of the results, there exist potential limitations that arise from the small sample size, the method of data collection and a social desirability bias in responses. Future research may analyze the role of CSR in consumers' purchase decisions using non-hypothetical choice experiments. Practical implications - There is scope for companies to gain competitive advantage by responsible conduct and by spreading information about that in a thoughtful and authentic manner. This holds especially for the area of animal welfare. Originality/value - There exists little research that analyzes consumers' attitudes towards and perception of CSR for the food sector and no study so far has concentrated on the meat industry. This study provides information for decision makers in food companies and researchers interested in the impact of CSR on consumers' attitudes and behavior.","[Hartmann, Monika; Heinen, Sarah; Melis, Sabrina; Simons, Johannes] Univ Bonn, Dept Agr & Food Market Res, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Hartmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Agr & Food Market Res, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany.",monika.hartmann@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Hartmann, Monika/J-8224-2017","Hartmann, Monika/0000-0002-3631-164X",state government of North Rhine-Westphalia; European Union,state government of North Rhine-Westphalia; European Union(European Union (EU)),The authors thank the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia and the European Union for funding this study which was accomplished within the scope of the project Forschungsnetzwerk Innovation durch Qualitatskommunikation (FIN-Q.NRW).,,50,33,37,1,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory research involved baseline and follow-up interviews with 74 kitchen staff (51 primary and 23 secondary English schools) enrolled onto the FFLP programme. Empirical data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire between 2007-2010 with an average of 20 months between baseline and follow-up. Data were collected on the perceived programme impact on school cook professional experience and employment and their role in health promotion. Findings - Numbers of kitchen staff and mean job satisfaction grew. Kitchen staff reported significant investment in their kitchen environment. They felt a greater degree of involvement and broader integration with the rest of the school's educational mission. However, towards the end of their involvement, kitchen staff became increasingly cognizant of the growing challenges posed by broader economic conditions emerging at the time of follow-up. Practical implications - Kitchen staff can play an important role in the promotion of healthy eating and school cohesion. However, there are significant organisational and employment-based barriers to fulfilling this potential. Originality/value - This paper outlines the role of kitchen staff in whole school food programmes and illustrates the key dimensions and barriers that need to be overcome to enhance their role through the delivery of improvements in school food uptake and the promotion of healthier and more sustainable food consumption.","[Kimberlee, Richard; Jones, Mathew] Univ W England, Dept Hlth & Appl Social Studies, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Morley, Adrian] Cardiff Univ, ESRC Ctr Business Relationships Accountabil Susta, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Orme, Judy] Univ W England, Fac Hlth & Life Sci, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Salmon, Debra] Univ W England, Dept Nursing & Midwifery, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England; Cardiff University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of West England; University of West England,"Kimberlee, R (通讯作者)，Univ W England, Dept Hlth & Appl Social Studies, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",Richard.kimberlee@uwe.ac.uk,,"Jones, Mat/0000-0003-3692-8065; Morley, Adrian/0000-0002-4331-8735",Economic and Social Research Council [not_applicable] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [not_applicable] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,20,5,6,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Yet, key topics debated in the field of ecological economics such as sustainable consumption, reduction in working time, the degrowth debate, the energy-exergy link, and the rebound effect require a holistic and macro perspective. While this deficiency has been identified before and Keynesian economics has been generally suggested as a potent vehicle to establish economic systemic thinking, very little concrete theorizing and practical suggestions have been put forward. We give further credence to this suggestion and demonstrate the value of tackling key concerns of ecological economics within a Keynesian growth framework. Contextualized by an application to climate change we suggest that policy relevant recommendations need to be based on a consistent view of the macroeconomy.

We investigated whether ecosystem services influence household wealth in semi-arid rural Mali, where climate variability and soil degradation were expected to regulate subsistence production. Mean rainfall, mean rain use efficiency, and rain use efficiency trends (a land degradation proxy) over the last 25 years were used to quantify ecosystem services. Asset wealth was measured in 2527 households from 65 villages spanning the range in ecosystem services. We evaluated effects on wealth, controlling for household size and demographics, ethnicity, village size, crop selection, and distance to open water and markets. While wealth variation was dominated by demographics, significant associations with ecosystem services were observed. Predicted household wealth increased significantly (20%) with rainfall. Effects of rain use efficiency mean and trends were also significant. but only when conditioned on rainfall. With lower rainfall, wealth increased with mean rain use efficiency (+ 33%) but decreased with rain use efficiency trend (- 22%). With higher rainfall, however, wealth decreased with rain use efficiency (- 57%) and increased markedly with rain use efficiency trend (+ 185%). While ecosystem services are clearly important, their effect on rural poverty is complex and potentially obscured by coping strategies that mitigate environmental limitations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis of such institutions is challenged due to addressing a multitude of complex interactions between these two systems occurring at different natural scales and levels of human organization. Due to this complexity, empirical analysis of biodiversity management often leads to context-specific explanations, providing little scope for comparative work or the development of more generalised, theory-based accounts. We aim at reducing complexity in understanding human-biodiversity relations, making cases comparable across sites, and propose that, in order to address complexity, we need a method of abstraction that leads to the development of a more structured analysis, based on selection of explanatory factors according to cconceptual models as well as empirical significance. We suggest that the stylisation of typical resource useperspectives - the combination of typical transactions that are inextricably linked by the interest of the actor - can be a useful method for realizing appropriate model selection. In this paper, we provide an account of how use-perspectives can be developed and to what kind of analysis they can contribute, using the example of agrobiodiversity in grain as seed, food, or genetic material.

This study assesses the loss of shade coffee during a 9 year period in a biological corridor in Costa Rica, and investigates the mediating factors of land use change. Following a conceptual framework that presents how household and farm characteristics mediate the interplay between underlying and proximate causes of land use change, the effect of the mediating factors is determined by applying an ordered probit model to household and land use data for 2000 and 2009 from 217 former and present coffee farmers. Additional 224 telephone interviews supplement the data on land use change. Results show a 50% reduction in the coffee area and a corresponding loss of trees. Family labor, age of household head, coffee prices, and use of shade tree products significantly reduce the probability of converting the coffee field, while the number of family members engaged in other agriculture and non-farm work increases the probability.

Medicare reimburses hospices on a fixed per diem basis, regardless of patient diagnosis. Because under this system patients with lower expected costs are more profitable, hospices can selectively enroll patients with longer lengths of stay. While it is illegal for hospices to reject potential patients explicitly, they can influence their patient mix through referral networks. A fixed per diem rate also creates an incentive shirk on quality and to substitute lower skilled for higher skilled labor, which has implications for quality of care. By using within-market variation in hospice characteristics, the empirical evidence suggests that for-profit hospices differentially take advantage of these incentives. The results show that for-profit hospices engage in patient selection through significantly different referral networks than non-profits. They receive more patients from long-term care facilities and fewer patients through more traditional paths, such as physician referrals. This mechanism of patient selection is supported by the result that for-profits have fewer cancer patients and more patients with longer lengths of stay. While non-profit and for-profit hospices report similar numbers of staff visits per patient, for-profit firms make significantly less use of skilled nursing providers. We also find some weak evidence of lower levels of quality in for-profit hospices.","Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Healthcare Policy & Res, Richmond, VA 23298 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University,"Gandhi, SO (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Healthcare Policy & Res, POB 980430, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.",sgandhi@vcu.edu,,"Gandhi, Sabina/0000-0003-2900-549X",,,,,39,19,31,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Developing, scaling-out, and targeting rainwater management innovations as adaptive strategies to upgrade rainfed agriculture are therefore preferably best approached through integrated innovations and recommendation domains as a paradigm. At the level of scenario development, the integrated innovations paradigm helps to understand and address integrity between technical, economic, and ecological issues that affect technology adoption, impact, and sustained use. At the level of scaling-out and targeting, recommendation domains provide the spatial dimension that embraces the economic, institutional, biophysical, and agro-ecological conditions in which integrated rainwater management innovations can be accommodated to address heterogeneity. This paper reviews Ethiopia's experience in rainwater management (adoption, performance, and impact) to get insights about the proposed paradigm and the factors entering the paradigm. The findings suggest that integrated innovations and the conditions of success embraced in a recommendation domain provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a successful rainwater management intervention at a landscape level.

The main objective of this paper is to test spatial hypotheses regarding respondents' local water quality and quantity, and their willingness-to-pay for improvements in water quality attributes. This paper combines choice experiment and spatially related water quality data via a Geographical Information System (GIS) to develop a method that evaluates the influence of respondents' local water quality on willingness-to-pay for river and stream conservation programmes in Canterbury, New Zealand. Results showed that those respondents who live in the vicinity of low quality waterways are willing to pay more for improvements relative to those who live near to high quality waterways. The study also found that disregarding the influence of respondents' local water quality data has a significant impact on the magnitude of welfare estimates and causes substantial underestimation of aggregated benefits.

This article examines comparative productivity for one major segment of large-scale retailing in both countriesthe department store sector. Drawing on exceptionally detailed contemporary survey data, we show that British department stores in fact achieved superior performance in terms of operating costs, margins, profits, and stock-turn. While smaller British stores had lower labour productivity than US stores of equivalent size, TFP was generally higher for British stores, which also enjoyed stronger scale economies. We also examine the reasons behind Britain's surprisingly strong relative performance, using surviving original returns from the British surveys. Contrary to arguments that British retailers faced major barriers to the development of large-scale enterprises, that could reap economies of scale and scope and invest in machinery and marketing to support the growth of their primary sales functions, we find that British department stores enthusiastically embraced the retail managerial revolutionand reaped substantial benefits from this investment.","[Walker, James] Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,,,,"Walker, James/0000-0002-3477-0236; Scott, Peter/0000-0003-1230-9040",,,,,53,14,15,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

These display fundamental concepts among the English poor, who were often poorly literate, and who comprised the majority of the population. Discussion focuses upon their understandings of home, belonging, friends, and community. These key concepts are related here to modern discussions, to set important concerns into historical perspective. Friends, valuably studied by sociologists such as Pahl, had a wide meaning in the past. Home meant (alongside abode) one's parish of legal settlement, where one was entitled to poor relief under the settlement/poor laws. This was where one belonged. Ideas of community were held and displayed even at a distance, among frequently migrant poor, who wrote to their parishes showing strong ties of attachment, right, and local obligation. This discussion explores these issues in connection with belonging and identity. It elucidates the meaning and working of poor law settlement, and is also an exploration of popular mentalities and the semi-literate ways in which these were expressed.","Univ Leicester, Ctr English Local Hist, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Snell, KDM (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Ctr English Local Hist, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",,,,,,,,80,21,25,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The model allows for both agricultural product wages and relative prices to affect fertility. The model is estimated using new data for the pre-industrial period in England, and the analysis reveals a strong, positive effect of agricultural wages as well as a nonnegative effect of real agricultural prices on fertility. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that there is strongly decreasing returns to scale with respect to labour in the agricultural sector and approximately constant returns to scale in the manufacturing sector. The analysis provides evidence in favour of the usual Malthusian model, as invoked by unified growth theories such as e.g. Galor and Weil (Am Econ Rev 90:806-828, 2000).","[Klemp, Marc P.

The purpose is to understand and define the interorganisational trust in business relationships by viewing these inductive findings in light of the relevant literature. Design/methodology/approach - Discourse analysis of interviews with individuals in the food processing industry is used to determine different representations of trust. Findings - Three representations of trust emerged from the interviews. They indicate that trust is a complex and dynamic phenomenon. The representations found were: a key operational element; recognition of context; and relationship resource stemming from individual bonds and personal characters. Trust is associated with control and context in the food industry as well as with a business's size and its customer reputation. Research limitations/implications - The implications for food chain participants and other stakeholder groups are discussed to emphasise further the research on trust. However, because the discursive representations are context-specific, changes in economic, market or relationship power situations can prompt new and different representations. Practical implications - This paper provides complementary insights into the challenges that business relationships face in their daily processes. The results can be used to recognise and analyse the dynamic and asymmetrical contexts of business relationships and build the competitive advantages of businesses. Trust can actively be used as a tool to distinguish a business from its competitors. Originality/value - This research increases understanding of the representations of trust in an asymmetrical food business context and offers some new analytical tools for the current trust research.","Univ Helsinki, Ruralia Inst, Seinajoki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Suvanto, H (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Ruralia Inst, Seinajoki, Finland.",hannele.suvanto@helsinki.fi,,"Suvanto, Hannele/0000-0001-6064-8579",,,,,59,4,4,1,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper shows that small switching costs may reduce firm profits and provide short-term incentives to lower rather than raise prices. We provide a simple expression which characterizes the impact of the introduction of switching costs on prices and profits for a general model. We then explore the impact of switching costs in a variety of specific examples which are special cases of our model. We emphasize the importance of a short term compensating effect on switching costs. When consumers switch in equilibrium, firms offset the costs of consumers that are switching into the firm. If switching costs are low, this compensating effect of switching costs causes even myopic firms to decrease prices. The incentive to decrease prices is even stronger for forward looking firms.","[Arie, Guy] Univ Rochester, Simon Grad Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Grieco, Paul L.

In these forests, the main preventive action consists of forest compartmentalization by fuel break networks, which entail high costs and sometimes significant negative impacts. While many studies look at public preferences for fire suppression, this study analyses the heterogeneity of social preferences for fire prevention. The visual characteristics of fire prevention structures are very familiar to respondents, but their management is unfamiliar, which raises specific attention in terms of analysing preference heterogeneity. A random parameter logit model revealed large heterogeneity and preference for traditional heavy machinery, maintaining linear unshaded fuel breaks at a high density. A latent class model showed that this may be reflected by a third of the population preferring lighter machinery and shaded irregular fuel breaks; a quarter of the population not treating the budget constraint as limiting, another quarter only being worried about the area burnt and the remaining group being against everything. Finally, a discrete mixture model revealed extreme preference patterns for the density of fuel breaks. These results are important for designing fire prevention policies that are efficient and acceptable by the population. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Their influence and use have increased slowly but consistently since the end of the Cold War. This article investigates their political dimension, by way of studying United Nations' partnerships for sustainable development, registered with the commission on sustainable development (CSD). Around 350 sustainability partnerships that promise to solve environmental problems and achieve the MDGs are registered with the CSD. Since their endorsement at the 2002 Johannesburg Summit, various studies assessed their value for environmental governance often finding them ineffective or counter-productive. This article exposes a new set of influences that partnerships have on the practice and discourses of global environmental governance, by following the politics of their emergence, that of partnership building and registration, and their actualization: During their negotiation, various contestations emerged and influenced the resulting partnerships regime; this is studied through in-depth interviews. Secondly, this regime leaves many geographical and participatory lacunas with political effects, which are studied through a large-N database. Finally, the unintended consequences of partnership projects on their issue areas and the discursive changes they cause in environmental governance reveal an otherwise concealed political dimension: The introduction of controversial technologies into the UN platforms.","Amsterdam Global Change Inst, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Mert, A (通讯作者)，Amsterdam Global Change Inst, B-644,De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",aysem.mert@vu.nl,,,,,,,35,7,8,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

By contrast, an optimization approach to management identifies the most efficient exploitation strategy by postulating an absolute understanding of the resource dynamics and its inherent uncertainties. Here, we study the potential and limitations of LBD in achieving optimal management by undertaking an analysis using a simple growth model as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of an agent equipped with a 'state-of-the-art' learning algorithm. The agent possesses no a priori knowledge about the resource dynamics, and learns management solely by resource interaction. We show that for a logistic growth function the agent can achieve 90% efficiency compared to the optimal control solution, whereas when a threshold (tipping point) is introduced, efficiency drops to 65%. Thus, our study supports the effectiveness of the LED approach. However, when a threshold is introduced efficiency decreases as experimentation may cause resource collapse. Further, the study proposes that: an appropriate amount of experimentation, high valuation of future stocks (discounting) and, a modest rate of adapting to new knowledge, will likely enhance the effectiveness of LBD as a management strategy.

The multifaceted concept of ecosystem services includes a normative component, which has strong implicit links to the notion of sustainability. Yet, how ecosystem services research relates to sustainability has received little attention. We reviewed the current state of research on ecosystem services, and examined whether the concept's original motivation has allowed it to act as an effective boundaty object for the integration of the diverse knowledge related to sustainability. A full-text, multivariate statistical analysis of 1388 peer-reviewed publications on ecosystem services from 1997 to 2011 revealed a rapidly growing but fragmented body of research, which has emphasized the development of descriptive understandings of human-nature interactions. Future challenges for the ecosystem services concept include greater integration of currently fragmented knowledge domains and stronger engagement with the concept's normative foundations.

Tying occurs when a console hardware manufacturer produces software that is incompatible with rival hardware. There are two important trade-offs an integrated firm faces when implementing a technological tie. The first is an effect that increases console market power and forces hardware prices higher. The second, an effect due to the integration of the firm, drives prices lower. A counterfactual exercise determines technological tying of hardware and software increases console price competition; console makers subsidize consumer hardware purchases in order to increase video games sales, in particular their tied games, where the greatest proportion of industry profits are made. I also determine technological tying to be a dominant strategy for hardware manufacturers when software development costs are low.","Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Derdenger, T (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",derdenge@andrew.cmu.edu,,"Derdenger, Timothy/0000-0002-4274-5479",,,,,24,20,30,4,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

In this article, we compare three methods for calculating national EF: a) the process analysis represented by Global Footprint Network (GFN) accounts; b) a standard environmentally extended multi-regional input-output model (EE-MRIOM); and c) a hybrid EE-MRIOM. The process analysis accounts for total domestic production and international trade of selected products. A standard EE-MRIOM further accounts for the upstream footprint of all traded products, but has a low resolution of relevant products in available datasets. The hybrid EE-MRIO method assessed here traces the primary biomass products in physical units through environmental extensions. Our results show that the standard MRIO model might introduce a significant error due to low resolution and poor data quality. The hybrid MRIO approach provides more accurate results than the standard MRIO method since it applies data from additional sources on a more detailed level. The process analysis underestimates the footprint of imports and exports as it ignores trade in services and other products as well as the upstream flows of products included in the analysis.

However, such entities continue to experience difficulty in operationalizing sustainable practices in management decisions. For firms that own natural ecosystems, part of the difficulty stems from their inability to balance the environmental value of conserving these ecosystems against potential profits that could be captured through their development. To overcome this, we present a new comparative framework for natural and engineered systems, which allows for a rigorous valuation of ecosystem services based on functional equivalence with engineered systems. This framework allows for the opportunity of such value to be represented within international accounting standards, thus aligning biological ecosystem service valuation with current, rigorous, accepted accounting norms. Looking specifically at the removal of phosphorus via wetland, we characterize an ecosystem service using a massbalance mechanistic biogeochemical model. We then simulate the ecosystem performance under various loading conditions to determine the limit state for which the wetland can perform the service of phosphorus removal in the long-term. Finally, using functional substitutability, we apply an appropriately scaled price of the engineered equivalent system to determine a market-based value of the ecosystem service. As a demonstration, we apply this methodology to an estuary located in Southern California. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We reconsider the directional symmetry of oil-price shocks by addressing the question Where is an oil shock? the answer to which reveals a great deal of spatial/directional asymmetry across states.

Haze originates from peat and forest fires mostly in Indonesia, with Malaysia and Singapore suffering the worst of its effects. Most of these fires are man-made and linked to land-clearing activities of local and foreign commercial oil palm plantations. The regional nature of the haze has resulted in a concentration of haze mitigation activities at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) level. However, these initiatives continually fail to effectively mitigate haze. This article argues that this failure is due to the influence of patronage politics in the sector, which is linked to the ASEAN style of regional engagement that prioritises the maintenance of national sovereignty. States are compelled to act in their national interests, as opposed to the collective regional interests. The economic importance of the oil palm sector to the states involved, coupled with the political importance of the clients populating this sector to elite patrons in the governments, meant that the maintenance of the status quo, where clients could continue to clear land using fire, was of crucial national interest. Therefore, the ASEAN style of regional engagement has enabled political elites to shape ASEAN initiatives to preserve the interests of their clients, while the public continue to suffer the haze. This article demonstrates this through a close analysis of the negotiations, outcomes and the implementation of the ASEAN Agreement on transboundary haze pollution, with a special focus on Indonesia's decision to withhold ratification of the treaty.","Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Varkkey, H (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",varkkey@gmail.com,"Varkkey, Helena/IZP-8781-2023; Varkkey, Helena/K-7934-2012","Varkkey, Helena/0000-0002-4622-0450",,,,,81,26,27,1,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Although large-scale agribusinesses are generally implicated, farmers themselves are often seen as culpable. We investigate whether farmer identity is an important factor affecting their attitudes toward the environment and farm management and conservation practices. Identity refers to a general outlook or perspective, whereas attitudes refer to beliefs or preferences about specific things. We investigate which identities matter most for affecting how farmers view the appropriateness of specific ethical situations relating to environmental management practices. We use a social-psychological model of ethical decision-making, and data from a survey of Missouri farmers, to examine the relationship between the identity of farmers and their attitudes toward ethical issues affecting the environment. We find that a conservation identity, in contrast to a productivist one, is most closely correlated with attitudes toward ethical environmental issues, although there is also an important interaction effect with one's view about the future.

Fars is the most important province from the agricultural products point of view in Iran. The total cultivated area of this province is about 1.1 million ha. There are 22,518 active tractors and 2,090 active combines in this province. In this research, the mechanization level and capacity were used as indices to evaluate the mechanization status of Fars province in Iran. Data were obtained from the existing statistics in the different departments of Agricultural Organization of the province. Mechanization level was calculated by dividing the total power consumed in the province to the cultivated area. Power of tractors and combines was used to calculate the total draft power. Conversion coefficient of 0.75 was considered for the tractors and combines with the working age of less than 13 years while, coefficient of 0.5 was considered for the tractors and combines with the working age of higher than 13 years. Total area of irrigated crops plus 50% of rain fed crops and orchards area was considered as the total cultivated area of the province. Mechanization capacity (energy consumed per unit area) was also determined by dividing the total energy consumed in the province by total cultivated area. Results showed that the mechanization level of the province was 1.38 kW/ha which was higher than the average mechanization level of the country (0.75 kW/ha) but, the level had no acceptable uniformity in different townships of the province. Mechanization capacity (energy consumed per unit area) was 972 kWh/ha in this province. Results also showed that about 53.7% of tractors and 40.9% of combines existing in the province had the working age of higher than 13 years which should be replaced with new tractors and combines to improve mechanization productivity in this province.","Fars Res Ctr Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Agr Engn Res, Shiraz, Iran",,"Afzalinia, S (通讯作者)，Fars Res Ctr Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Agr Engn Res, POB 71555-617, Shiraz, Iran.",afzalinia@farsagres.ir,"Moafpourian, Gholamreza/F-5941-2017; Afzalinia, Sadegh/A-7976-2017",,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-45-3,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1054.0,,,,,,291,298,,,,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357663400035,0

Design/methodology/approach - Principal component analysis was applied for the multivariate statistical analysis of the cooking shows, the components being: personal hygiene, cross-contamination, cooking and storing practices and risk communication. Data were collected via a questionnaire special designed for the purpose of the study. The positive attributes were converted into numbers using a nine-point Likert scale. This conversion enabled ranking of the cooking shows as a function of the total results obtained and considering the best show as the one with the maximum score attained. Findings - Evaluation of cooking practices by food safety professionals highlighted the most frequent safety errors and poor practices that are disseminated by the TV shows. Practical implications - While the repetition of good food handling and cooking practices risks antagonizing viewers, an increase in occasional emphasis of good hygiene would be of benefit to domestic viewers and potentially improve food safety practices among the public. Originality/value - This is the first study that gives an European perspective on presentation of safety practices during food handling and preparation in a range of TV cooking shows as it examines 19 such shows broadcasted in six European countries over three months.

The aims of this paper are twofold. First, the paper explores the notion of ranking nations based on food safety performances, beyond benchmarking. The paper appraises how a global comparative analysis could contribute to best practices and continuance improvement in food safety. Second, this paper presents an experiment in which a group of regulators took part in a workshop held in Helsinki, Finland in the Fall 2011. Design/methodology/approach - A session was held in October 2011 in Helsinki, and many countries were invited. A total of 17 countries were represented. The following countries were represented: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the UK and the USA. The session was designed to be informative, interactive and flexibly tailored to the delegates' needs and experience. It was also designed to raise awareness and understanding of benchmarking and supra-national ranking systems, what it is and how it can be applied using practical examples from healthcare and across other sectors. Findings - The session also introduced the principles of process thinking and illustrated how process benchmarking can be a useful tool for continuance improvement. The session then built upon the theory presented in the introductory portion by focusing specifically on the essence of ranking indicators. In this session, delegates spent time familiarizing themselves with indicators provided by the University of Guelph, discussing how they might implement it within their individual nations and across the trust as a whole. Practical implications - The collection of primary data was also debated at the session. Public trust, for example, could easily be an indicator which could be included. Measurement of public trust in food safety might be important for governments. It could provide them with information on the performance of the food safety systems from a consumers' perspective. To be an effective indicator of performance the measurement of public trust in food safety should be liable to change. Therefore, changes in performance of the food safety systems have to be reflected through the measurement of public trust in food safety. Originality/value - The Helsinki session is believed to be the first international meeting in which benchmarking metrics were discussed in order to rank countries based on food safety risk practices. Ranking programs in food safety remain controversial. Most particularly, risk assessors and the public service remain skeptical about their effectiveness. The Helsinki meeting was not met to alleviate the skepticism around ranking systems, but it did allow many to better appreciate several perspectives from around the world.","[Charlebois, Sylvain] Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Hielm, Sebastian] Govt Finland, Helsinki, Finland",University of Guelph,"Charlebois, S (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",sylvain.charlebois@uoguelph.ca,,"Charlebois, Sylvain/0000-0002-9400-0153",,,,,33,20,21,0,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The research carried out sought to make an understanding of the experiential environments in which eating-out is performed, as well as the experiences that it seeks to produce, and was conducted from a market-orientated ethnography in selected markets from the UK and Brazil. Findings - Six ideal models of service providers, according to the main characteristics of the stimulus provided by the service encounter, were identified: authentic, relaxed, all you can eat, as home, efficient and distinction environment. The diversity of food service environments is somehow an answer to the diversity of customers and expectations regarding eating-out. The access of different social classes to eating-out opens the space for more variety, and the creativity that food service managers have on building an appropriate set of stimulus, is a distinctive skill. Research limitations/implications - The restaurant side of experience encounters was the focus of analysis, but for a deeper understanding of experiential consumption on eating out these results must be confronted to consumer research based on psychophysical methods to assess consumer responses to eating out. Originality/value - Theoretical implications of this paper rely on the understanding that there are distinct forms of service encounters, providing an alternative view of servicescapes that allows a better understanding of business strategies and host-guest relationships on food service.","[de Rezende, Daniel Carvalho] Univ Fed Lavras, Lavras, Brazil; [Rodrigues Silva, Matheus Alberto] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"de Rezende, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Lavras, Lavras, Brazil.",rezendedc@gmail.com,"Silva, Matheus Alberto Rodrigues/E-2606-2012","Silva, Matheus Alberto Rodrigues/0000-0002-5026-1079; Carvalho de Rezende, Daniel/0000-0003-1277-724X",Lancaster University; Federal University of Lavras (UFLA),Lancaster University; Federal University of Lavras (UFLA),The authors would like to thank Lancaster University and Federal University of Lavras (UFLA) for the support.,,30,22,26,3,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This measure of course does not take into account the differences in the number of children among individual people but also the differences in the average number of children among people by the year of birth. Nevertheless the average number of children of women of younger generations (born in the seventies and later) will be probably lower than the average number of children of women born in the sixties or before.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether functional and organic food consumers have the same understanding of health, and which health and well-being improving lifestyles are characteristic for them. Based on this, the authors identify dimensions for a wellness-orientated lifestyle model. Design/methodology/approach - In order to measure the different well-being and health lifestyles, MO dimensions were adapted to theoretical wellness concepts. The results of the conducted factor and multiple OLS regression analyses are based on the data of an online survey of 500 German consumers. Findings - Consumers of functional food have a similar concept of health and well-being to organic consumers, but differ in certain aspects in their way of achieving this. The purchase of organic and functional food is driven by different lifestyles. Overall, the results confirm the link between organic food and an active lifestyle, as well as functional food and a passive lifestyle. Practical implications - The paper contributes to the discussion of health in marketing and especially in the food industry. The results reveal which kinds of lifestyle food marketing should be considered in a target group specific product communication and positioning.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper opted an exploratory approach using a quantitative survey across food manufacturing companies in New Zealand. The primary foci of this empirical investigation were: orientation towards the NPD, innovation processes, collaborative NPD links and routes to commercialisation. Findings - The results (based on a 22 per cent response rate) show a significant difference ( p < 0.05) in the aims and mode of NPD between Groups 1 and 2. Further it was observed that food companies in Group 1 have significantly (p < 0.05) more diverse external collaborations with broader aims to collaborate, in comparison with food companies in Group 2. Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted in New Zealand and thus generalisability of the findings may have to be interpreted carefully. Practical implications - The traditional NPD approach (independent and closed NPD), with loose intellectual property protection practices, dominates the food manufacturing industry in New Zealand. Research-oriented collaborations need to be strengthened in their scope and content to develop the innovative capabilities and capacities of small and medium enterprises (SME's) within future value- added food productions. Originality/value - This research provides the comparative narration of innovation process of food manufacturing companies with reference to FFs development.","[Khan, Rao Sanaullah; Win, Alan G.] Massey Univ, Inst Food Nutr & Human Hlth, Auckland, New Zealand; [Grigor, John Vincent; Boland, Mike] Massey Univ, Riddet Inst, Auckland, New Zealand",Massey University; Massey University,"Khan, RS (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Inst Food Nutr & Human Hlth, Auckland, New Zealand.",sanaullah666@hotmail.com,"Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012; Boland, Mike/H-7170-2016","Boland, Mike/0000-0001-8134-2181",,,,,86,15,16,0,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

These observations make it difficult to build right models for time series and can misrepresent any predictions. In the article we describe the different types of outliers and their integration into the stochastic time series. We work with transfer function models, which are mainly based on ARIMA models and on linear dynamic models. In our paper we show that each outlier must necessarily leave specific track in residuals.

The Decagon (R) 5TE is a recently available sensor that simultaneously measures soil water content, bulk soil electrical conductivity, and temperature, and so could be useful under saline conditions. Initial laboratory and field studies were conducted at the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. A sample of four sensors was evaluated in the laboratory under different soil water contents and salinities. In the field, sensors were installed at depths of 10, 30 and 50 cm in the soil in various plots as part of ongoing water productivity experiments that used relatively low (2 dS m(-1)) and high (8+ dS m(-1)) salinity irrigation water. The bulk soil electrical conductivity was used to estimate soil pore water conductivity. Results show that the sensors responded well, in a relative sense, to changes in soil water content, electrical conductivity and temperature, and so could be used to assess irrigation events, infiltration, and drainage. Water with conductivity in excess of 10 dS m(-1) resulted in increased soil water content measurements due to the effect of electrical conductivity on measured dielectric permittivity. Estimates of soil water salinity followed expected patterns, with lower values directly following irrigation and higher values as soil water content decreased due to plant water uptake.","[McCann, I.

Against this background, the aim of this paper is twofold; first, to ascertain if the stimulus organic food, placed by storytelling, influences the perception of wine. Based on this, the study tries to discover wherein a positive perception of organic wine might be reflected (e.g. willingness to pay premium prices, better taste perception). Design/methodology/approach - Focusing on the consumer perception and evaluation of conventional versus organic wine, it was decided to use an experimental design with a blind taste test procedure. The prediction was that subjects would rank a wine described as organic higher than a conventional wine even if there is no objective difference. Consumer perceptions and attitudes toward the wines were assessed using a questionnaire including wine preference, buying and recommendation intention, and willingness to pay. Besides, consumer wine knowledge and consumer personal environmental orientation were measured as individual constructs. Findings - In accordance with existing research insights, consumers tend to prefer organic products over conventional ones. In this context, the experiment shows that adding information on the product's process during a blind test leads consumers to increase their ratings in favour of the organic wine. Interesting is that consumers even give a better rating for conventional wine just described as being organic, indicating that the appearance and taste are perceived to be better, and the price intention is higher - thus, a pure signalling effect is achieved. Originality/value - The key finding of the study was that even if they tasted the identical product, the respondents ascribe a significantly better taste to the organic-labelled wine compared to the conventional alternative. Besides, the willingness to recommend the organic wine and the willingness to pay differed significantly from the evaluation of the red wine presented as conventional. Moreover, regardless of their knowledge and attitude towards organic products in general, all respondents rated the so-called organic wine higher in all given attributes.","[Wiedmann, Klaus-Peter; Hennigs, Nadine; Behrens, Stefan Henrik; Klarmann, Christiane] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Mkt & Management, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Hennigs, N (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Mkt & Management, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",hennigs@m2.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,47,95,101,1,87,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

One definition of efficiency is the proportional scaling needed for observations of inefficient units to be projected onto an efficient production function and another definition is a ratio index of weighted outputs on weighted inputs. When linear programming is used to estimate efficiency the two definitions give identical results due to the fundamental duality of linear programming. Empirical applications of DEA using linear programming showed a prevalence of zero weights leading to questioning the consequence for the efficiency score estimate based on the ratio definition. Early literature on weight restrictions is exclusively based on the ratio efficiency. It was stated that variables with zero weights had no influence on the efficiency score, in spite of the alleged importance of the variables. This has been one motivation for introducing restrictions on weights. Another empirical result was that often there were too many efficient units. This problem could also be overcome by introducing weight restrictions. Weight restrictions were said to introduce values for inputs and outputs. The paper makes a critical examinations of these claims based on defining efficiency relative to a frontier production function.","Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Forsund, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway.",finn.forsund@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,41,26,26,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

J,"Järvensivu, P",,,,"Jarvensivu, Paavo",,,Transforming market-nature relations through an investigative practice,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Market-nature relations; Market practices; Degrowth; Practice theory,CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; POLITICS; STRATEGY,"Degrowth theorists and practitioners have challenged the economic growth paradigm and sought for economic, cultural and political alternatives that would respect the planetary boundaries. Their strategy has generally been to either reject the formal market system as a whole and experiment with alternative practices outside markets or suggest changes in the policies that regulate markets. They have paid less attention to potential changes in market cultures. This paper seeks to foster the cultural transformation of current market-nature relations while retaining the radical core of degrowth. The paper presents an investigative practice that was found in an ethnographic study of an evolving forest-based market in Finland. The practice seems to have the potential to disrupt habitual ways of approaching nature and of turning it into exchangeable and consumable objects. According to practice theory, this kind of disruption creates space for emerging alternatives to the dominant practices. In this sense, the investigative practice works similarly to an environmental shock, without the harmful material effects. In addition, the investigative practice involves a critical approach that supports a transition toward sustainable market-nature relations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In particular we investigate how rule effectiveness and rule compliance depend on the prevailing local norms and ecological values held by resource users. For this purpose, we employ a framed field experiment that is based on a rangeland model for semi-arid regions and carried out with communal farmers in Namibia and South Africa. Participants could vote for three 'best practice' management rules found in many places around the world that are discussed for implementation in the study area: (temporary) private property rights, rotational grazing or limitation of livestock numbers. All rules were designed in a way that facilitated cooperation or coordination of actions. The focus of this study lies on the interactions between these rules and prevalent ecological norms exhibited in the rounds prior to rule implementation. In contrast to previous lab experimental studies, we find that democratic voting of rules is not sufficient for high rule compliance and an overall enhancement in cooperation. Rules turned out to be inefficient if they were in conflict with the prevalent ecological norm. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Three questions are addressed: (I) To what extent do households behave sustainably regarding firewood extraction from agroforestty? (2) Which factors determine the likelihood of households practicing sustainable agroforestty? (3) Are sustainably behaving households better off in terms of income compared to households practicing unsustainable agroforestry? The analysis is based on cross-sectional data of 314 households. A sustainability indicator shows that the share of sustainable households varies between 14 and 41% depending on the underlying wood growth rate. The results of the logistic regression indicate that property rights regarding the ownership of agricultural land and environmental awareness increase the likelihood of sustainable firewood extraction. Empirical evidence from the quantile regression reveals that poorest households generate higher income if they extract firewood unsustainably. The opposite is true for households of upper income percentiles. Thus, the poor are likely to increase environmental degradation to generate more income causing a 'downward spiral' of the poverty-environment trap resulting in income losses in the long run. Households with a per capita income of 524 TZS or more manage their tree stocks sustainably. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A regulatory context calls for a consequential LCA (CLCA) of a policy as opposed to an attributional LCA (ALCA) of a product. In performing CLCA, issues of scale, price effects, technology and policy in the counterfactual state of the world, strategic behavior, policy horizon etc. need consideration. This appears to increase both uncertainty in estimates and the cost of performing LCA. We suggest heuristics for determining vulnerability to harmful indirect effects at an early stage in the policy process and discuss alternative policies to limit harmful indirect effects without engaging in the full effort of computation and selection of a central estimate for uncertain outcomes.

Surprisingly, rigorous on the field evidence on the causal impact of these devices is very limited. This paper estimates the impact of an improved stove design distributed in the Northern Peruvian Andes on firewood consumption. To identify the causal effect of improved stoves, it exploits a quasi-experiment related to the improved stove intervention. The evidence indicates that a proportion of households that adopted the new device experienced iron frame failures. These failures were not systematically caused by inadequate usage, installation or maintenance, but by faulty iron frame construction. Moreover, faulty iron frames were randomly distributed, and whether an iron frame was faulty or not, was not ex-ante observable to the beneficiaries. Therefore, an iron frame failure indicator is used as an instrumental variable to identify the causal effect of improved stoves. Improved stove usage appears to reduce firewood consumption by approximately 46% in the study area. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I have interpreted this rise in terms of the appearance of a new equilibrium in the early industrial economy with more and younger children at work. The new equilibrium, in turn, was related to a number of co-incidental developments including: an increase in the relative productivity of children as a result of mechanization, new divisions of labour, and changes in the organization of work; the dynamics of competitive dependence linking labour market and families; high dependency ratios within families; stumbling male wages and pockets of poverty; family instability; and breadwinner frailty.

The model is based on the premise that global warming is such a complex problem that present political realities do not allow an immediate solution to it. I propose that current mitigation activities should focus on building technological and political transformation potential to enable more ambitious climate cooperation in the future. Successful international climate cooperation could comprise a series of politically feasible small wins guided by a big dream of a comprehensive future climate regime. The analysis contributes to the emerging literature on the dynamics of climate governance by showing how coherence between multiple independent climate policies can be achieved, both across policymakers and over time.

It has been estimated that 20% of the water consumption and pollution in the world relates to the production of export goods. This study analyzes how French water resources are allocated over various purposes, and examines impacts of French production in local water resources. In addition, it analyzes the water dependency of French consumption and the sustainability of imports. The basins of the Loire, Seine, Garonne, and Escaut have been identified as priority basins where maize and industrial production are the dominant factors for the blue water scarcity. About 47% of the water footprint of French consumption is related to imported agricultural products. Cotton, sugar cane and rice are the three major crops that are identified as critical products in a number of severely water-scarce river basins: The basins of the Aral Sea and the Indus, Ganges, Guadalquivir, Guadiana, Tigris & Euphrates, Ebro, Mississippi and Murray rivers.

Cluster analysis and principal component analysis are utilised to account for sample heterogeneity and to identify heterogeneities in farmer beliefs regarding adoption of organic methods. The results indicate that the impact of economic incentives and technical barriers varies, while social acceptance of organic farming constrains adoption. These findings suggest that policy incentives mainly based on subsidy payments may be insufficient to increase the organic sector in the presence of social and technical barriers.

To a lesser extent, Brennan is also critical of the fact that the ISEW and GPI are unable to reflect both economic welfare and sustainability. Whilst I'm happy to concede that the two indicators fail to fully account for changes in human-health capital, it is my contention that this failure represents, at most, a methodological shortcoming. It does not amount to a theoretical weakness. Despite Brennan's best efforts, the ISEW and GPI remain soundly based on Irving Fisher's distinction between income and capital. Indeed, Brennan's suggested modifications to the ISEW and GPI do nothing but conflate income and capital, which, if taken on board, would lead to misleading indicators of total economic welfare. As for not reflecting both economic welfare and sustainability, I have long argued that the ISEW and GPI merely reflect the former and need to be supplemented by biophysical indicators to determine whether the economic welfare being enjoyed by a nation is sustainable. The fact that the ISEW and GPI only reflect economic welfare is not a weakness, since no indicator can or should attempt to reflect both conditions. The use of strong sustainability approaches to calculate the environment costs incorporated in the ISEW and GPI is not an exercise designed to measure sustainability. It is an exercise in good economic accounting. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of their responses, we then estimate their degree of uncertainty. New within this study is that the respondent's degree of uncertainty is revealed, while it is stated in those using existing measurement methods. Three statistical models are used to explore the sources of respondent uncertainty. We also present a simple way of calculating the uncertainty adjusted mean WTP, and compare this to the one obtained from an interval regression. Our findings in terms of determinants of preference uncertainty are broadly consistent with a priori expectations. In addition, the uncertainty adjusted mean WTP is quite similar to the one derived from an interval regression. We conclude that our method is promising in accounting for preference uncertainty in WTP answers at little cost to interviewees in terms of time and cognitive effort, on the one hand, and without researcher assumptions regarding the interpretation of degrees of uncertainty reported by respondents, on the other.

This issue involves a large number of processes, ranging from field to global scales, which have not been fully integrated yet. In this study, we intend to help bridging this gap by quantifying the effect of farm-scale autonomous adaptations in response to changes in climate. To do so, we use a modelling framework coupling the STICS generic crop model to the AROPAj microeconomic model of European agricultural supply. This study provides a first estimate of the role of such adaptations, consistent at the European scale while detailed across European regions. Farm-scale autonomous adaptations significantly alter the impact of climate change over Europe, by widely alleviating negative impacts on crop yields and gross margins. They significantly increase European production levels. However, they also have an important and heterogeneous impact on irrigation water withdrawals, which exacerbate the differences in ambient atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations among climate change scenarios.

The article draws findings and propositions from recent literature to identify the mechanisms at work and the conditions under which they foster mutually beneficial solutions.

First, we construct a global database of primary valuation studies that focus on recreational benefits of coastal ecosystems. Second, the profile of each of the 253 individual observations is enriched with characteristics of the built coastal environment (accessibility, anthropogenic pressure, human development level), natural coastal environment (presence of protected area, ecosystem type, marine biodiversity), geo-climatic factors (temperature, precipitation), and sociopolitical context. We then propose a meta-analytical framework that is built upon a Geographic Information System (GIS) and allow for the exploration of the spatial dimension of the valued ecosystems, including the role of spatial heterogeneity of the selected meta-regression variables well as the spatial profile of the transferred values. The empirical outcome results in the first global map of the values of coastal recreation, which may play a crucial role in identifying and ranking coastal area conservation priorities from a socio-economic perspective.

The value (general purchasing power) of a convertible currency must be the relative cost of producing gold and other goods, which did not change significantly between 1914 and the 1930s. Monetary and fiscal policies might have affected the timing but not the ends of the price paths that were determined by the decisions to resume. [T]he value of money ... does not depend permanently on the quantity of it possessed by a given community, or on the rapidity of its circulation, or on the prevalence of exchanges, or on the use of barter or credit, or, in short, on any cause whatever, excepting the cost of its production. Other causes may operate for a time, but their influence wears away as the existing stock of the precious metals within the country accommodates itself to the wants of the inhabitants. As long as precisely 17 grains of gold can be obtained by a day's labour, every thing else produced by equal labour will, in the absence of any natural or artificial monopoly, sell for 17 grains of gold; whether all the money of the country change hands every day, or once in four days, or once in four years; whether each individual consume principally what he has himself produced, or supply all his wants by exchange; whether such exchanges are effected by barter or credit, or by the actual intervention of money; whether there be 1,700,000 or 170,000 grains in the country.(2)","[Mazumder, Sandeep; Wood, John H.] Wake Forest Univ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",Wake Forest University,"Mazumder, S (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",,"Wood, John/ISS-3666-2023",,,,,,75,11,11,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The second part applies the model developed in part one to simulate the direct and indirect rebound for the average U.S. household in terms of primary energy, CO(2)e, NOx, and SO2 emissions and for energy efficiency investments in electricity, natural gas, or gasoline services. Part one provides a critical review of the largely independent economic and industrial ecology literatures on the indirect rebound. By studying the two-goods case and the n-goods case, we demonstrate that the indirect rebound is bounded by the consumer budget constraint, and inversely related to the direct rebound. We also compare the common proportional spending and income elasticity spending assumptions with our model of cross-price elasticities including both substitution and income effects for the indirect rebound. By assuming zero incremental capital costs and the same embodied energy as conventional technologies for efficient appliances, we model an upper bound of the indirect rebound. Future work should also consider the increase in consumer welfare possible through the rebound effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Relationships of various flour parameters, gluten composition and cookie characteristics were determined. Findings - Gluten subfractions, damaged starch, protein, AWRC values were significantly correlated to the cookie spread and texture. Damaged starch (r = -0.638), protein (r = -0.508) and AWRC (r = -0.844) had a negative relationship with the cookie spread. The flours with higher SDS sedimentation value also produced cookies with lower spread ratio and harder texture. The study clearly demonstrated a positive correlation between Gli:Glu ratio (r = 0.765) and spread ratio and a negative correlation (r = -0.528) with hardness of the cookies measured in terms of breaking force. Flours with lower dough development time and dough stability performed better as cookie flours. Originality/value - The gliadins and Gli/Glu ratio had a significant effect on the cookie spread and texture and the prediction equation developed during the study could accurately predict the cookie spread from the Gli/Glu ratio and AWRC values.","[Barak, Sheweta; Mudgil, Deepak; Khatkar, Bhupendar Singh] Guru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Food Technol, Hisar, Haryana, India",Guru Jambheshwar University of Science & Technology,"Khatkar, BS (通讯作者)，Guru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Food Technol, Hisar, Haryana, India.",bhup2009@hotmail.com,"Mudgil, Deepak/IXN-6289-2023","Mudgil, Deepak/0000-0001-8965-8930",,,,,26,30,34,5,67,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, ten orchards of Chemlali olive oil variety were chosen, in Sfax region, characterized by the same applied cultural techniques. Pomological characters of olives, fatty acids composition and organoleptic analysis of olive oil were conducted. Findings - Results showed that the pomological characters were specific of the Chemlali variety: the olive weight ranged from 0.9 to 1.10 g in all studied orchards and the water content (WC) ranged from 41.45 to 57.68 per cent. All analysed oils showed good fatty acids balance. Chemlali olive oil contains high amounts of oleic acid and a smaller amount of linoleic acid. The oleic acid content ranged from 57.96 to 63.52 per cent according to the orchards. All oils having oleic acid higher than 55 per cent are categorized as extra virgin olive oil based on International Olive Oil Council (IOOC) Norma. Based on the organoleptic analysis, all the analysed oils were classified as an extra virgin olive oil. The principal component analysis applied separately on olive characters and fatty acids contents do not indicate any group's structure. Originality/value - An objective approach based on pomologic, sensory and acidic composition analyses would be used to delimitate Protected Designation of Origin (PDOs) in olive oil from the Bi'r al Malluli area and better protect their markets.","[Feki, Mouna; Hammami, Mohamed] Fac Med Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia; [Feki, Mouna] Inst Olivier Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia; [Feki, Mouna; Hannachi, Hedia; Ali, Moez Bou; Hamrouni, Haytem; Karray, Boubaker] Inst Olivier Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Feki, Mouna; Romano, Elvira] Ctr Ric Olivicoltura & Ind Olearia CRA OLI, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",Universite de Monastir; Institut de l'Olivier; Institut de l'Olivier; Universite de Sfax,"Feki, M (通讯作者)，Fac Med Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia.",abr.mouna@yahoo.fr,,", Hedia Hannachi/0000-0002-7550-2182; Romano, Elvira/0000-0002-5531-5005",,,,,51,2,2,0,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The new regulations require primary producers such as arable farmers, fruit growers and vegetable growers to follow good hygiene practice and manage their operations in such a way as to control food safety hazards. Various food safety incidents in recent years have increased the public's concern with food safety and contributed to the establishment of various farm assurance schemes in order to reassure the public, often via labelling displaying high profile symbols such as the Red Tractor logo, that the food they eat is safe and has been produced in accordance with strict guidelines and standards. The requirement for documented HACCP plans is central to the majority of farm assurance schemes in the UK. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent and nature of barriers to HACCP implementation amongst a group of arable farmers and fresh produce growers. The research forms part of the first phase of a larger project being undertaken as part of a PhD. Design/methodology /approach - For this research study an in-depth qualitative methodology was used, and a non-prescriptive narrative interview technique utilised in order to investigate the barriers to HACCP implementation amongst four arable farmers and fresh produce growers in England. The farmers and growers all had HACCP plans produced for their business in order to comply with the requirements of farm assurance schemes. Findings - Non-prescriptive analysis of the narrative interviews identified shortcomings associated with farm assurance audits and several common themes associated with experiences and perceptions of HACCP as difficult, a burden in terms of cost, time and paperwork and unnecessary, all of which acted as barriers to implementation. Originality/value - This paper combines in-depth, academically sound research with the involvement of primary producers. It brings together the views of four arable fanners and fresh produce growers. This study both supports and develops previous research studies, contributing to the existing body of research by uncovering additional findings associated with farm assurance schemes and identifying the extent and nature of barriers to HACCP implementation in primary production.","[Lowe, Juliette Patricia; Taylor, Joanne Zaida] Univ Salford, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England",University of Salford,"Lowe, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Salford, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,49,14,14,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The research involved analysis of both qualitative and quantitative methods of risk assessment. Findings - Risk assessment is a key element of the HACCP approach to food safety. It requires food business operators and those on HACCP teams to determine both the acceptable level of contamination and the risk for the food business, and ultimately the consumer. The choice of food safety risk assessment model is crucial to an organisation. The mechanisms to determine what is acceptable can be a combination of scientific based and value based criteria and utilise qualitative or semi-quantitative approaches. Whilst fuzzy logic has a place in making risk assessment more quantitative; specific software tools are required to enable quantitative risk assessment especially where what is acceptable at one point could, subject to other factors later in the supply chain, change to an unacceptable level of risk to the consumer. Quantitative mechanisms are required to make these decisions at organisational, or indeed at policy level, fully transparent. Originality/value - This research is of academic value and of value to policy makers and practitioners in the food supply chain.","[Manning, L.; Soon, J.

The conversion of tropical peatland into oil palm plantation has been assumed to enhance the decomposition process due to drainage, causing further emission of soil CO2. It is postulated that this process will increase with time of oil palm cultivation. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the influence of environmental variables and root biomass on soil CO2 fluxes from different ages of oil palm. The soil CO2 fluxes were measured for 24 months from three palm ages (1, 5 and 7 years of planting; S1, S2, S3) in tropical peatland of Sarawak, Malaysia using a closed-chamber technique. The highest mean soil CO2 flux was recorded in S3 (221.26 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) followed by S2 (195.43 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and S1 (177.63 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) palms. The cumulative soil CO2 fluxes for S1, S2 and S3 were 14.72, 16.38 and 18.53 t C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Water-filled pores space (WFPS) correlated negatively with soil CO2 fluxes in all of the three different ages of oil palm probably due to reduced root respiration. The increase in soil CO2 flux with palm age was consistent with higher root biomass of growing palms suggesting that root respiration was a major component of soil respiration in tropical peatland under oil palm.","[Melling, L.; Chaddy, A.] Chief Ministers Dept, Trop Peat Res Lab Unit, Sarawak, Malaysia",,"Melling, L (通讯作者)，Chief Ministers Dept, Trop Peat Res Lab Unit, Sarawak, Malaysia.",,"Hatano, Ryusuke/A-5113-2012","Hatano, Ryusuke/0000-0002-2261-1799",,,,,33,14,14,1,23,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66052-57-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2013,982.0,,,,,,25,35,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2013.982.2,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture; Soil Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGP15,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323698200002,0

We first consider Robert Costanza's treatment of Nicholas Stern's Global Deal and then survey climate change-related articles published in this journal over the past five years. This survey reveals how mainstream (neoclassical) methodologies dominate discourse, and do so by marginalizing more critical (political economy) analyses. This situation imperils the field's founding vision of a no-growth 'steady state'; it also fails to address the (related) growth dynamics of capitalism. Without such a critical treatment, the field's formal embrace of 'methodological pluralism' actually entails an ideological empiricism that renders ecological economics theoretically incoherent. This situation undermines the field's historical promise as an alternative economic paradigm. Ecological economics now faces a problematic future. Its survival in a form faithful to its founding vision will require an explicit choice to address its internal contradictions, and reinvent itself in ways relevant to our contemporary context. Without such a choice, ecological economics will likely succumb to an implicit acceptance of the hegemony of mainstream economic methodologies and their pro-growth imperatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In other words, the uncertainty of model selection is ignored once the best model has been chosen. However, the true data-generating process is in general unknown and may not be consistent with the chosen model. In the analysis of productivity and technical efficiencies in the stochastic frontier settings, if the estimated parameters or the predicted efficiencies differ across competing models, then it is risky to base the prediction on the selected model. Buckland et al. (Biometrics 53:603-618, 1997) have shown that if model selection uncertainty is ignored, the precision of the estimate is likely to be overestimated, the estimated confidence intervals of the parameters are often below the nominal level, and consequently, the prediction may be less accurate than expected. In this paper, we suggest using the model-averaged estimator based on the multimodel inference to estimate stochastic frontier models. The potential advantages of the proposed approach are twofold: incorporating the model selection uncertainty into statistical inference; reducing the model selection bias and variance of the frontier and technical efficiency estimators. The approach is demonstrated empirically via the estimation of an Indian farm data set.","[Lai, Hung-pin] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Huang, Cliff J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN USA",National Chung Cheng University; Vanderbilt University,"Lai, HP (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan.",ecdhpl@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,28,10,10,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The literature argues that the official monopoly was sidelined by a free, innovative market known as the Coulisse, but it fails to explain how the Coulisse emerged despite the monopoly and how the two markets persisted alongside each other during the entire century. We provide a detailed history of how these two markets emerged and interacted. The Parquet increasingly developed as a high-end market, providing security, transparency, and effective settlement-delivery to unsophisticated investors trading on the spot market. The Coulisse provided liquidity, immediacy, and opacity to professional investors trading mostly forward. In line with recent theoretical developments, we argue that the juxtaposition of heterogeneous organizations had important virtues for market participants, since it allowed the exchanges to specialize in different investors and services and made the exchanges complementary to each other. We demonstrate our claim by looking at both the formal rules and the actual functioning of the Parquet, drawing on its archives which we have recently classified.","[Hautcoeur, Pierre-Cyrille] Paris Sch Econ EHESS, Paris, France; [Riva, Angelo] European Business Sch, London, England",Paris School of Economics,"Hautcoeur, PC (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ EHESS, Paris, France.",,"Villen Retamero, Andrea Maria/IAR-1667-2023",,,,,,64,25,25,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We propose that resilience thinking offers a framework that could be helpful in the governance of rural changes. This framework is based on the complexity of the social-ecological system and takes into account the unpredictable future, as it emphasizes adaptive approaches to management. As such, it helps evaluate to what extent rural development policies contribute to the resilience of rural areas. Nine criteria were developed including thirteen specifications. In order to evaluate the usability and usefulness of the proposed framework, a case study has been performed that specifically investigated the degree of resilience of a European rural development policy (i.e. the spending of extra funds generated through compulsory modulation under the 2009 Health Check in the Netherlands).

The paper reviews some studies quantifying the contribution of human numbers to environmental impact. It warns against playing this factor off against that of high consumption in rich countries. It asks whether from the environmental point of view complacency about either present or predicted population size is warranted. The answer depends both on fertility and mortality assumptions and on constraints such as resource and food availability. The concept of cultural carrying capacity would aid societies in determining their optimal population when account is taken not only of subsistence, but of quality of life. A population-control toolkit for both rich and poor societies is sketched, and some controversial, 'coercive' policy possibilities analysed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For a watershed in Zagros, a quantitative analysis based on the sustainable livelihood framework approach is used to identify household livelihood strategies, analyze livelihood choices, and investigate which strategies are most sustainable. The study revealed that most households (64%) follow a mixed strategy with a combination of forestry, animal husbandry, and subsistence agriculture. Households following a livelihood strategy that is highly dependent on forest extraction and livestock grazing (27%) are the poorest, whereas those that combine cultivation of commercial crops with non-farm work (9%) are able to earn higher incomes. The results also give some evidence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve: households that both adopt a mixed strategy and fall into the middle-income category are responsible for the highest overuse of forest resources and pasture. Since the end of 1980s, a number of households have shifted from a strategy based on forest and livestock to a strategy of mixed practices. An increasing share of households is adopting a strategy of non-farm and/or commercial practices, as well as outmigration to urban areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This is understandable due to the ease and convenience offered by the simplicity of such conceptualization. Although this line of thinking may help facilitate decision making processes, it is only as defensible as the degree at which the system under consideration behaves linearly. Recent work shows that diverse properties of cities exhibit power-law relationships with population size. Such relationships may invalidate the reliance on linear thinking. Furthermore, in the era of globalization, resources and people move virtually freely through bounds of any confines used to define a system. We incorporate into a simple resource-population model the power-law scaling behavior and the influence of import and immigration, and investigate their effects on sustainable growth of communities. We explore through bifurcation analysis the different scenarios of how an unsustainable system could be sustained. Import can be effective if: the import exceeds a critical level and a critical mass of people populates the system. In contrast, increasing immigration alone can rescue the intrinsically unsustainable system, both directly through people entering the system and indirectly by increasing its harvesting ability, although critical values exist that cause the population to sharply rise or shrink.

This paper focuses on measurement errors in capital inputs, associated with unobserved variations in capital utilization rates, as an explanation for the existence of pro-cyclical patterns in measures of productivity. Recently constructed national and state-specific indexes of inputs, outputs, and productivity in U.S. agriculture for 1949-2002 are used to estimate production functions that include proxy variables for changes in the utilization of durable inputs. The proxy variables include an index of farmers' terms of trade and an index of local seasonal growing conditions. We find that utilization responses by farmers are significant and bias measures of productivity growth in a pro-cyclical pattern. We quantify the bias, adjust the measures of productivity for the estimated utilization responses, and compare the adjusted and conventional measures.","[Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Andersen, Matthew A.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Wyoming; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Alston, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",julian@primal.ucdavis.edu,,"Pardey, Philip/0000-0002-8012-1341",,,,,35,9,10,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Many natural resources are Common Pool Resources (CPRs), managed under different non-cooperative, cooperative, and externally imposed management frameworks. While early studies of non-cooperative CPR management suggest inevitable tragedy of the commons, here we discuss how users can avoid tragic outcomes by changing their decision making rationales and exploitation strategies even in a noncooperative environment. This paper introduces and compares various types of non-cooperative institutions that are available to manage CPRs. These management institutions are then applied, using a numerical groundwater exploitation example, to determine how different planning variables are affected by the choice of management institution. Results indicate that CPR users can improve their gains by considering the externalities and developing long-term exploitation plans, as opposed to short-term plans with no consideration of externalities that result in rapid exhaustion of the resource and lead to the so-called tragedy of the commons.

Power within the interorganisational relationships in the food supply chain may hinder the integration necessary for that traceability to be effective. The purpose of the present study is to define the configuration of power in food industry-distribution relationships from the food industry perspective. Design/methodology/approach - The variables of power configuration considered in this study have been classified as mediated and non-mediated power sources, in accordance with the criteria used by French and Raven. The Rasch model employed in the treatment of the values given by the food industries to the construct perceived power (mediated and non-mediated power sources) permit a unidimensional measurement of that construct. Thus, the model estimated using this methodology explains power-shaping in the food industry-distribution relationships in the Canary Islands. Findings - The results obtained are mostly based on the distributors' use of mediated power sources; they describe a situation that does not contribute to a high level of commitment in such relationships, since the negative effects of this type of power do not favour the climate required for the implementation of active traceability. Research limitations/implications - The data applied in this study were gathered prior to the implementation of traceability as a legal requirement, and consequently it would be advisable and useful to conduct a post-implementation. Originality/value - The paper adopts a business management approach, aimed at improving relations in the food supply chain. The methodology employed allows food firms to establish suitable chain integration strategies, facilitating the effective implementation of traceability. The paper presents a conceptual framework and analytical methodology which sustain the present study and subsequent work.","[Angeles Sanfiel-Fumero, Maria; Martin Ramos-Dominguez, Angel; Ramon Oreja-Rodriguez, Juan] Univ La Laguna, Inst Univ Empresa IUDE, San Cristobal De La Lagu, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"Sanfiel-Fumero, MA (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Inst Univ Empresa IUDE, San Cristobal De La Lagu, Spain.",msanfiel@ull.es,,"Ramos Dominguez, Angel Martin/0000-0002-1564-5974",,,,,72,20,20,0,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Although originally there was no difference between the term cluster (Anglo-Saxon branch) and the competitiveness clusters (les poles de competitivite-French Connection), however, in Romania they tend to be used differently, and a conceptual distinction would be welcome. Thus, the term cluster refers mainly on industrial agglomerations concentration of firms in the same field or related economic fields. Competitiveness clusters is an association of businesses, organizations and training of research and, acting in partnership to implement a common development strategy. This strategy is built around innovative projects aimed at addressing one or more end markets.

Therefore we can state that HDI affects the migration flows within the EU27 and that people tend to migrate from countries with lower index of income into the countries with higher index of income and that there is a correlation also between GMI and other indicators of HDI.,"[Bednarikova, Jana; Stehlikova, Beata] Paneuropean Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia",Pan-European University,,janka.bednarikova@gmail.com; stehlikovab@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,3,3,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,93,103,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500010,0

The study finds that the influence of altruism on guanxi is stronger for women than men and the influence of both interpersonal harmony and protecting company resources on guanxi is stronger for men than women. The effects of personal initiation and identification with company on guanxi are indifferent between genders. The results imply that an appropriate balance of women and men in a team is important as a mixed-gender team can fuel social capital through the synergy of altruism and protecting company resources and managers should adopt different performance indicators to assess employees' contributions to social capital.","[Gao, Simon S.] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Accounting Financial Serv & Law, Edinburgh EH14 1DJ, Midlothian, Scotland",Edinburgh Napier University,,s.gao@napier.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,8,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-86-7,,,,2012,,,,,,,404,415,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BFO19,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320722500038,0

Design/methodology/approach - A 3 x 2 x 2 between-subject design with three levels of product harm, two levels of product knowledge, and two treatments of negative information was used in this study. The experimental product is diet food. Findings - The findings reveal that the level of product harm affects consumers' ethical evaluation. Furthermore, the individual's ethical evaluation will influence his or her purchase intention. The main effect of subjective knowledge is significant while its moderating effect is not significant. It is also found that the negative information disclosure will lower consumer's ethical evaluation of a firm, and the effect of product harm on ethical evaluation will be stronger for harmful products than for harmless products when the negative information is disclosed. Practical implications - Marketers might need to be especially responsive if their practices result in a diminished reputation for their firms and lost sales. Exploiting the vulnerability of consumers or worsening their situation by marketing harmful products might be evaluated as unethical under principles of justice. It is suggested that marketers include increased disclosures of actual product harm levels relative to industry norms.

This study uses a stays-hospitals-years database comprising acute myocardial infarction inpatients to examine whether the reimbursement policy mitigates the medical benefits claimed to a third-payer party during 2000-2008. The estimated results of a nested random-effects model showed that hospitals attempted to increase their medical benefit claims under the influence of initial implementation of global budgeting. The magnitudes of hospitals' responses to global budgeting were significantly attributed to hospital ownership, accreditation status, and market competitiveness of a region. The results imply that the regional budget cap superimposed on FFS payments provides only blunt incentive to the hospitals to cooperate to contain medical resource utilization, unless a monitoring mechanism attached with the payment system.","I Shou Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 840, Taiwan",I Shou University,"Hsu, PF (通讯作者)，I Shou Univ, Dept Finance, 1,Sec 1,Syuecheng Rd, Kaohsiung 840, Taiwan.",hsupf@isu.edu.tw,,,,,,,17,14,15,3,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

We investigated the extent to which the concepts and categories of ecosystem services are able to accommodate peoples' perceptions about their individual-surroundings relationships. We used a qualitative approach to identify local people's perceptions in Tarituba, a coastal village on the southeastern Brazil. We found that the categories of ecosystem services accommodated only partially the range of perceptions of individuals about their relationships with the environment Individuals perceive that they actively search and pursue their provisioning and other services, and are not passive recipients of benefits or products from nature. As well, we documented how the relations with the environment change over time. Some cultural values can be identified using ecosystem services frameworks, but they do not fit the monetary valuation models from economics.

This article focuses on one aspect of the topic: the political uncertainty and transaction costs of establishing environmental rights. Our contribution is to model the political process around the rights establishment, and to monetize the associated welfare costs. The model includes both policy-related and political-institutional parameters, including the extent to which environmental rights are shared with polluters; the environmental benefits of the policy; the policy's abatement costs, and the relative political power of polluters and environmentalists. The model is solved to give unique Nash equilibria for the transaction costs of lobbying, and for the probability of the policy's political success. These results are then used to show the degree to which political actions can dissipate the expected economic surplus from environmental policymaking. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the economic theory of this policy, and shows that such a policy could actually hurt fish stocks, even if rigorously enforced. It is then shown that in the absence of enforcement, the policy would definitely lead to an increase in the number of fishers and a decline in fish stocks. In short, the current policy is worse than no policy. This hypothesis is tested using data from the state of Amazonas (both statewide data and data from the county (municipio) of Coari) and we arrive at the following conclusions. First, the defeso is completely unenforced. Second, the number of fishers has increased dramatically. Finally, catch per unit effort (CPUE) has declined over the period from 2005 to 2010 and additional evidence (presented later in the paper) suggests that stocks have decreased as well. The paper concludes with the recommendation of spatially oriented fishery regulations (zoning and rotating closures) combined with a co-management regime with fishing communities.

However, these countries usually are marginalized in the international political arena, due to their lack of structural power. This paper explores the strategic influence of SIDS and its representative organization, the Alliance of Small Island States, in the negotiations leading to the Copenhagen summit of December 2009. Using the concepts of leadership and discourses, the position, strategies, and impact of SIDS are analyzed on negotiation processes and their final outcome, focusing on three core demands of small island countries at Copenhagen: a temperature rise limit of 1.5 A degrees C above preindustrial levels, funding for adaptation, and a legally binding outcome. Results reveal that SIDS practiced entrepreneurial, intellectual, and environmental leadership strategies and especially made use of moral claims in the debate. Given their near absence of structural power, they managed to secure a surprisingly large part of their agenda and interests in the final Copenhagen Accord, especially through (discourse) coalitions with various other state and non-state stakeholders.","[Corneloup, Ines de Agueda; Mol, Arthur P.

To tackle this integration challenge, we empirically explore how Finnish non-industrial private forest owners' perceptions about voluntary biodiversity conservation contracting correspond with the institutional theories about PES. Further, we test whether the perceptions are related to PES contracting in the past or in the future. The results of the explorative factor analyses corresponded with the theoretical considerations of both economics and institutional analysis. The logistic regression analyses showed that the factors that related to past contracting differed notably from those that explained future intentions to contract. Most consistently, perceptions about positive ecological impacts were positively related to past contracting, while social and moral normative perceptions had a negative effect. In other words, those who would conserve nature for altruistic reasons tended not to have entered a contract but rather stayed out. Local and social welfare expectations increased the willingness to contract in the future. Our analysis highlights the importance of normative conservation justifications as well as the expectations regarding non-economic benefits and welfare impacts for PES design and analysis.

Far from implying a necessary reduction in wellbeing, some research suggests this could actually improve it: as reduced expenditure means a reduced need for income, and hence paid work, then there is the possibility for average working hours to fall, providing increased leisure time in which to pursue happiness through less consumption-intensive, but more time consuming, ways. To date, however, there has been little critical discussion of the details of what policy might need to cover to allow and encourage substantial working time reduction in a way that successfully reconciles these environmental and wellbeing goals. This article addresses this gap in the literature. It begins by reviewing the conditions under which working time reduction could bring environmental and wellbeing benefits. It then presents examples of innovative voluntary working time policies from the Netherlands and Belgium. Drawing these elements together, the article presents a new green life course approach for working time policy design. It argues that, as a complement to more conventional working time policies, this could be a valuable tool to combine environmental and wellbeing goals. (C) 2014 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Taking the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) as a case in point, it asks: in what ways may IPES schemes impinge upon the political and economic autonomy of local and indigenous peoples in tropical countries? It is argued that PES schemes like REDD should be assessed not only with respect to questions of distributional equity (does everyone have enough pie?) but also with respect to franchise equity (does everyone want pie?) and that failure to take questions of franchise equity into account in IPES schemes reflects a form or intellectual mercantilism, where wealth transfers from new economies to old ones are achieved by redefining existing locally available resources as internationally tradable speculative commodities. This proposition is considered through exploration of two illustrative cases - the REDD+ Social and Environmental Standards (REDD+ SES) and the Yasuni-ITT initiative - and through normative political theory recommendations building on Dryzek and Stevenson's discussion of deliberative systems, regarding how it might be possible to ensure franchise equity within REDD+ in particular and within global environmental governance, more generally.

In real-time forecasting, however, a simple version of forecast combinations seems to perform better than the remaining models, predicting that welfare caseloads in Japan will surpass 1.7 million by the beginning of 2016, an approximately 20% increase in five years from the beginning of 2011.

Wages, unemployment, prices of housing and land are endogenously determined. We characterize the steady-state equilibrium and then discuss the issue of efficiency. To explore interactions among markets, we implement comparative static analysis. We also consider three policies: an entry-cost policy that reduces firms' entry, a transportation policy that reduces commuting costs, and a housing policy that decreases rental prices. We find that the transportation and housing policies are more efficient if the unemployment rate is low, while the entry-cost policy is more efficient if the unemployment rate is high.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Xiao, W (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",wei.xiao@ne.su.se,,,,,,,41,6,6,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

First, visibility reflects air pollutants (e.g. fine particulates) that are typically omitted by publicly reported indicators of air pollution, typically SO2 and TSP. Second, data on visibility cover almost the entire world, whereas the typical pollution indicators cover a smaller and non-representative sample. We show that both features matter, in a significant way, by employing visibility as a proxy of air quality to re-estimate its relationship with income. Using the findings of Grossman and Krueger (1995) and Harbaugh et al. (2002) as benchmarks, we find that the test of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis is highly sensitive to the coverage of countries. More importantly, we find that this visibility-income linkage is only partially driven by publicly monitored pollutants, but is dominated by the unobserved ones. Addressing both issues, we find the inverse-U shape relationship supported for most of the economies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
