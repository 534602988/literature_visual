Also, a yes-no voting rule is often used as a tool for aggregating individual preferences over any given finite set of alternatives into a collective preference. In this second context, Diffo Lambo and Moulen (DM) have introduced a power relation which ranks the voters with respect to how ably they influence the collective preference. However, DM relies on the metric d that measures closeness between preference relations. Our concern in this work is: do I, SS, BC and DM agree when the same yes-no voting rule is the basis for collective decision making? We provide a concrete and intuitive class of metrics called locally generated (LG). We give a characterization of the LG metrics d for which I, SS, BC and DM agree on ranking the voters.","[Lambo, L.

This situation arises in a number of applications of bounds analysis and moment inequality models, and in recent work on estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes. Drawing on earlier work relating differentiability to the existence of unbiased and regular estimators, we show that if the target object is not differentiable in the parameters of the data distribution, there exist no estimator sequences that are locally asymptotically unbiased or a-quantile unbiased. This places strong limits on estimators, bias correction methods, and inference procedures, and provides motivation for considering other criteria for evaluating estimators and inference procedures, such as local asymptotic minimaxity and one-sided quantile unbiasedness.","[Hirano, Keisuke] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Porter, Jack R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Arizona; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hirano, K (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",hirano@u.arizona.edu; jrporter@ssc.wisc.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0962488, SES-0962422, SES-0438123]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0962488] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0962422] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","1Early versions of this paper were titled Impossibility Results for Bounds Estimation.

In this paper, we build on search and bargaining theory to clarify a key general equilibrium channel through which changes in industrial composition could have substantial effects on wages in all sectors. In this class of models, wage determination takes the form of a social interaction problem and we illustrate how the implied sectoral linkages can be empirically explored using U.S. Census data. We find that sector-level wages interact as implied by the model and that the predicted general equilibrium effects are present and substantial. We interpret our results as highlighting the relevance of search and bargaining theory for understanding the determination of wages, and we argue that the results provide support for the view that industrial composition is important for understanding wage outcomes.","[Beaudry, Paul; Green, David A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Beaudry, Paul] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Green, David A.] IFS, London, England; [Sand, Benjamin] York Univ, Dept Econ, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",University of British Columbia; National Bureau of Economic Research; York University - Canada,"Beaudry, P (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, 997-1873 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",paulbe@interchange.ubc.ca; green@econ.ubc.ca; bmsand@econ.yorku.ca,,,,,,,26,48,66,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2012,80.0,3,,,,,1063,1104,,10.3982/ECTA8659,0.0,,,42,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,947WX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304466200004,0

Also we introduce the new reserving function RDC, using all these dates and payments for reserve predictions. We study three reserving functions: chain ladder, the Schnieper (1991) method and RDC. Checks with simulated cases obeying the assumptions of Mack (1999) for chain ladder and Liu and Verrall (2009) for Schnieper's method, respectively, confirm the validity of our method.

We study the tests by Anderson and Rubin (1949, The Annals' of Mathematical Statistics 20, 46-63), Moreira (2003, Econometrica 71, 1027-1048), and Kleibergen (2005, Econometrica 73, 1103-1123) and their generalized empirical likelihood versions. These tests have asymptotic size equal to nominal size when the instruments are exogenous but are size distorted otherwise. While in just-identified models all the tests that we consider are equally size-distorted asymptotically, the Anderson-Rubin type tests are less size-distorted than the tests of Moreira (2003) and Kleibergen in over-identified situations. On the other hand, we also show that there are parameter sequences under which the former test asymptotically over-rejects more frequently. Given that strict exogeneity of instruments is often a questionable assumption, our findings should be important to applied researchers who are concerned about the degree of size distortion of their inference procedure. We suggest robustness of asymptotic size under local model violations as a new alternative measure to choose among competing testing procedures. We also investigate the subsampling and hybrid tests introduced in Andrews and Guggenberger (2010a, Journal of Econometrics 158, 285-305) and show that they do not offer any improvement in terms of size-distortion reduction over the Anderson-Rubin type tests.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Guggenberger, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, Room 315,9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",pguggenberger@ucsd.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0748922, SES-1021101]; Sloan Fellowship; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1021101, 1346827] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Sloan Fellowship(Alfred P.

UK values are lower than US values for most of the 243 possible EQ-5D health states. Although similar protocols were used for data collection, analytic choices regarding how to model values from the collected data may also influence national value sets. Participants in the UK and US studies assessed the same subset of 42 EQ-5D health states using the time trade-off (TTO) method. However, different methods were used to transform negative values to a range bounded by 0 and -1, and values for all 243 health states were estimated using two different regression models. The transformation of negative values is inconsistent with expected utility theory, and the choice of which transformation method to use lacks a theoretical foundation. Objectives: Our objectives were to assess how much of the observed difference between the UK and US EQ-5D value sets may be explained by the choice of transformation method for negative values relative to the choice of regression model and the differences between elicited TTO values in the respective national studies (datasets). Methods: We applied both transformation methods and both regression models to each of the two datasets, resulting in eight comparable value sets. We arranged these value sets in pairs in which one source of difference (transformation method, regression model or dataset) was varied. For each of these paired value sets, we calculated the mean difference between the two matching values for each of the 243 health states. Finally, we calculated the mean utility gain for all possible transitions between pairs of EQ-5D health states within each value set and used the difference in transition scores as a measure of impact from changing transformation method, regression model or dataset. Results: The mean absolute difference in values was 1.5 times larger when changing the transformation method than when using different datasets. The choice of transformation method had a 3.2 times larger effect on the mean health gain (transition score) than the choice of dataset. The mean health gain in the UK value set was 0.09 higher than in the US value set. Using the UK transformation method on the US dataset reduced this absolute difference to 0.02. The choice of regression model had little overall impact on the differences between the value sets. Conclusions: Most of the observed differences between the UK and US value sets were caused by the use of different transformation methods for negative values, rather than differences between the two study populations as reflected in the datasets. Changing the regression model had little impact on the differences between the value sets.","[Augestad, Liv Ariane; Kristiansen, Ivar Sonbo] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Augestad, Liv Ariane; Rand-Hendriksen, Kim; Stavem, Knut] Akershus Univ Hosp, Hlth Serv Res Ctr, Lorenskog, Norway; [Stavem, Knut] Akershus Univ Hosp, Dept Pulm Med, Lorenskog, Norway; [Stavem, Knut] Univ Oslo, Akershus Univ Hosp, Fac Div, Fac Med, Lorenskog, Norway",University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Oslo,"Augestad, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, POB 1089 Blindern, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",l.a.augestad@medisin.uio.no,"Kristiansen, Ivar Sonbo/JXN-7976-2024","Rand, Kim/0000-0001-7692-4099; Augestad, Liv Ariane/0000-0003-3330-5081",South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority; Norwegian Research Council,South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),This study was indirectly funded through PhD scholarships to Liv Ariane Augestad and Kim Rand-Hendriksen.

Our analysis covers both the case in which the reduced form for the endogenous regressors is stable and the case in which it is unstable with multiple structural breaks. For stable reduced forms, we present a limiting distribution theory under two different scenarios: in the case where the parameter change is of fixed magnitude, it is shown that the resulting distribution depends on the distribution of the data and is not of much practical use for inference; in the case where the magnitude of the parameter change shrinks with the sample size, it is shown that the resulting distribution can be used to construct approximate large sample confidence intervals for the break points. For unstable reduced forms, we consider the case where the magnitudes of the parameter changes in both the equation of interest and the reduced forms shrink with the sample size at potentially different rates and not necessarily the same locations in the sample. The resulting limiting distribution theory can be used to construct approximate large sample confidence intervals for the break points. Its usefulness is illustrated via an application to the New Keynesian Phillips curve.","[Hall, Alastair R.] Univ Manchester, SoSS, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Boldea, Otilia] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Han, Sanggohn] SAS Inst, Cary, NC USA",University of Manchester; Tilburg University; SAS Institute Inc,"Hall, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, SoSS, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",alastair.hall@manchester.ac.uk,,,ESRC [RES-062-23-1351]; ESRC [ES/G002401/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G002401/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful for the comments of the participants at the World Congress of the Econometric Society, Shanghai, 2010, and to an anonymous referee for valuable comments.

Methods: A systematic literature search was performed, using the databases Academic Search Complete, Econlit, EMBASE and MEDLINE. Health economic evaluations of newer (second-generation) AEDs, published as full-length journal articles, were searched for. We focused on evaluations of newer AEDs as treatment for partial-onset seizures. 470 studies were initially identified and 19 were finally included. Information regarding (i) AEDs studied, (ii) cost effectiveness, and (iii) a variety of health economic modelling specifics was extracted from each study. Then, the included studies were summarized and a quality assessment was performed, according to the British Medical Journal's guidelines for economic studies. Results: The results were as follows: (i) the cost per additional QALY for newer AEDs used as adjunctive treatment, compared with standard therapy, ranged between $US19 139 (levetiracetam) and $US57 210 (pregabalin) [year 2010 values]; no cost-effectiveness evidence was identified for felbamate, eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine or tiagabine; and (ii) all studies met at least 60% of the British Medical Journal's guidelines criteria, and seven studies were found to satisfy more than 80% of the criteria. Guidelines criteria not met involve inadequate reporting of input data and modelling details, including validation and availability of models used for cost-effectiveness calculations. Conclusions: Although failure to meet good practice guidelines influences the reliability of the presented evidence adversely, a sufficient number of the included studies were found to comply enough with the guidelines in order for the qualitative content of the cost-effectiveness results that some of the newer AEDs are cost effective to be reliable. In fact, this conclusion is likely to be relatively robust, since the effect of improved seizure control on labour market performance was not included in the base-case results in any of the included studies and improved seizure control need only to have a moderate effect on sickness absenteeism in order for the corresponding treatment to be cost effective even when willingness to pay for an additional QALY is low. However, the cost effectiveness of newer AEDs has only been studied for a small number of settings, and hence future studies incorporating additional settings are needed.","[Bolin, Kristian] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Forsgren, Lars] Umea Univ, Sect Clin Neurosci, Dept Pharmacol & Clin Neurosci, Umea, Sweden",Lund University; Umea University,"Bolin, K (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 705, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden.",Kristian.Bolin@nek.lu.se,"Vyacheslav, Gromyko/I-5054-2012",,,,,,57,7,7,0,11,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,10,,,,,903,923,,,,,,21,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,012QO,22924967.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309251800004,0

We analyze an election in which (i)similar to the majority is divided between two alternatives and (ii)similar to the minority backs a third alternative, which the majority views as strictly inferior. Standard analyses assume voters have a fixed preference ordering over candidates. Coordination problems cannot be overcome in such a case, and it is possible that inferior candidates win. In our setup the majority is also divided as a result of information imperfections. The majority thus faces two problems: aggregating information and coordinating to defeat the minority candidate. We show that when the common value component is strong enough, approval voting produces full information and coordination equivalence: the equilibrium is unique and solves both problems. Thus, the need for information aggregation helps resolve the majority's coordination problem under approval voting. This is not the case under standard electoral systems.","[Bouton, Laurent] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Castanheira, Micael] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Boston University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Bouton, L (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",lbouton@bu.edu; mcasta@ulb.ac.be,,"Castanheira, Micael/0000-0002-3511-9947",,,,,32,56,58,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2012,80.0,1,,,,,43,87,,10.3982/ECTA9111,0.0,,,45,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,874KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000298957400002,0

This approach takes advantage of boosting's feature selection capability to select an optimal combination of technical indicators and design a new set of trading rules. We tested this approach with high-frequency data of the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index Futures (FESX) and the DAX Futures (FDAX) for March 2009. Our method was implemented with different learning algorithms and outperformed a combination of the same group of technical analysis indicators using the parameters typically recommended by practitioners. We incorporated this method of model calibration in a trading agent that relies on a layered structure consisting of the machine learning algorithm described above, an online learning utility, a trading strategy, and a risk management overlay. The online learning layer combines the output of several experts and suggests a short or long position. If the expected position is positive (negative), the trading agent sends a buy (sell) limit order at prices slightly lower (higher) than the bid price at the top of the buy (sell) order book less (plus) transaction costs. If the order is not 100% filled within a fixed period (i.e. 1 minute) of being issued, the existent limit orders are cancelled, and limit orders are reissued according to the new experts' forecast. As part of its risk management capability, the trading agent eliminates any weak trading signal. The trading agent algorithm generated positive returns for the two major European index futures (FESX and FDAX) and outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy.","Stevens Inst Technol, Hoboken, NJ 07302 USA",Stevens Institute of Technology,"Creamer, G (通讯作者)，Stevens Inst Technol, Hoboken, NJ 07302 USA.",gcreamer@stevens.edu,,,,,,,61,23,27,2,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

More precisely, we aim to determine an optimal selling (buying) time to maximize (minimize) the expectation of the ratio of the selling (buying) price to the ultimate average price over the period. This is an optimal stopping time problem which can be formulated as a variational inequality problem. The problem gives rise to a free boundary that corresponds to the optimal selling (buying) strategy. We provide a partial differential equation approach to characterize the free boundary (or equivalently, the optimal selling (buying) region). It turns out that the optimal selling strategy is bang-bang, which is the same as that obtained by Shiryaev, Xu, and Zhou taking the ultimate maximum of the stock price as benchmark, whereas the optimal buying strategy can be a feedback one subject to the type of averaging and parameter values. Moreover, by a thorough characterization of free boundary, we reveal that the bang-bang optimal selling strategy heavily depends on the assumption that no time-vesting restrictions are imposed. If a time-vested stock is considered, then the optimal selling strategy can also be a feedback one. In terms of a similar analysis developed by the present paper, the same phenomenon can be proved when taking the ultimate maximum as benchmark.","[Dai, Min] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Zhong, Yifei] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",National University of Singapore; University of Oxford,"Dai, M (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",matdm@nus.edu.sg,"Dai, Min/H-5328-2012","Dai, Min/0000-0002-8270-9413",Singapore Tier 1 [R-146-000-096-112]; NUS RMI [R-146-000-117-720/646],Singapore Tier 1; NUS RMI,This project is supported by Singapore Tier 1 AcR grant (No. R-146-000-096-112) and NUS RMI research grant (No. R-146-000-117-720/646).

Economic evaluation has a great potential to contribute toward cost-effective healthcare delivery in South Africa. Little is known about the characteristics and quality of health economic (including pharmacoeconomic) research in South Africa. Objective and Methods: This study assessed the state of health economic (including pharmacoeconomic) research in South Africa. PUBMED, MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, EconLit and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify health economic articles pertaining to South Africa published between 1 January 1977 and 30 April 2010. The searches used the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and text words alone and in combination: 'costs', 'health' and 'South Africa'. Our study included only original economic studies/analyses that pertained to South Africa, addressed a health-related topic, and had a statement or word in the title, abstract or keywords that indicated that an economic (including cost) analysis had been conducted. The study only included complete peer-reviewed publications (e.g. abstracts were excluded) that were reported in the English language. Two reviewers independently scored each article in the final sample using the data collection form designed for the study. Results: In total, 108 studies investigating a wide variety of diseases were included in the study. These articles were published in 39 different journals mostly based outside of South Africa between 1977 and 2010. On average, each article was written by three authors. Most first authors had medical/clinical training and resided in South Africa at the time of publication of their study. Based on a 1-10 scale, with 10 indicating the highest quality, the mean quality score for all studies was 7.59 (SD 1.42) and half of the articles were of good quality (score 8-10) The quality of studies was related to the country in which the journal publishing the article was based (outside South Africa = higher); current residence of the primary author (outside South Africa = higher); method of economic analysis (economic evaluations higher than cost studies); type of data used (secondary higher than primary); primary training of the first author (health economics/pharmacoeconomics = higher); type of medical function (diagnosis = higher); study perspective (societal = higher); primary health intervention (pharmaceuticals = higher); study design (modelling = higher); number of authors (more = higher); and year of publication (more recent = higher) [p <= 0.05]. Conclusion: Half of the articles were of poor or fair quality. Measures are needed to promote the commissioning of more and better quality health economic and pharmacoeconomic studies in South Africa.","[Gavaza, Paul] Appalachian Coll Pharm, Oakwood, VA 24631 USA; [Rascati, Karen L.; Oladapo, Abiola O.; Khoza, Star] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Pharm, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Gavaza, P (通讯作者)，Appalachian Coll Pharm, 1060 Dragon Rd, Oakwood, VA 24631 USA.",pgavaza@gmail.com,,"Gavaza, Paul/0000-0002-4538-8622",,,,,212,28,30,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,10,,,,,925,940,,,,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,012QO,22809450.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309251800005,0

Copula models are widely used in financial econometrics and risk management. They are considered to be a competitive alternative to the Gaussian dependence structure. The dynamic structure of the dependence between the data can be modeled by allowing either the copula function or the dependence parameter to be time-varying. First, we give a brief description of eight different models, among which there are fully parametric, semiparametric, and adaptive methods. The purpose of this study is to compare the applicability of each particular model in different cases. We conduct a simulation study to show the performance for model selection, to compare the model fit for different setups and to study the ability of the models to estimate the (latent) time-varying dependence parameter. Finally, we provide an illustration by applying the competing models on the same financial dataset and compare their performance by means of Value-at-Risk.","[Manner, Hans] Univ Cologne, Dept Social & Econ Stat, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Reznikova, Olga] Risk Dynam, Brussels, Belgium",University of Cologne,"Manner, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Dept Social & Econ Stat, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.",manner@statistik.uni-koeln.de,"Reznikova, Olga/A-7218-2018; Manner, Hans/IYS-1311-2023","Reznikova, Olga/0000-0001-8715-224X; Manner, Hans/0000-0002-3334-4251",,,,,51,99,113,1,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

The primary example concerns inference on impulse responses. A new asymptotic framework is suggested and some new theoretical properties of known procedures are demonstrated. I show that the likelihood ratio (LR) and LR +/- statistics for a linear hypothesis in an AR(p) can be uniformly approximated by a weighted average of local-to-unity and normal distributions. The corresponding weights depend on the weight placed on the largest root in the null hypothesis. The suggested approximation is uniform over the set of all linear hypotheses. The same family of distributions approximates the LR and LR +/- statistics for tests about impulse responses, and the approximation is uniform over the horizon of the impulse response. I establish the size properties of tests about impulse responses proposed by Inoue and Kilian (2002) and Gospodinov (2004), and theoretically explain some of the empirical findings of Pesavento and Rossi (2007).

The force that drives a negative correlation is identified as the substitution effect. In combination, the two effects help determine the actual correlation between stock and bond returns. We contribute to the literature by proposing an empirical method, the structural vector autoregression (VAR) identification method, to identify the two-income and substitution-effects and to measure the relative importance of the two effects that determine the actual net relation between the two asset returns. We further provide some evidence that the income and substitution effects are related to, among other things, the size of the financial market, the growth and volatility (risk) of the economy, and the business cycle over time.

The reinsurance is purchased by the insurer for each line of business separately. The premium principles used to compute the reinsurance premiums are allowed to differ from one line of business to another, but they all satisfy three mild conditions: distribution invariance, risk loading and preserving the convex order, which are satisfied by many popular premium principles. Our results show that an optimal strategy for the insurer is to buy a two-layer reinsurance policy for each line of business, and it reduces to be a one-layer reinsurance contract for premium principles satisfying some additional mild conditions, which are met by the expected value principle, standard deviation principle and Wang's principle among many others. In the end of this paper, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effects of marginal distributions, risk dependence structure and reinsurance premium principles on the optimal layer reinsurance.

Objective compilation and evaluation of current pharmacoeconomic evidence can assist payers and decision makers in determining the appropriate place in therapy of a new medication. Our objective was to review the existing pharmacoeconomic literature evaluating the cost effectiveness and overall costs of treatment associated with liraglutide in type II diabetes. Medical literature indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EconLit through 1 June 2014 was searched. Full-text, English-language cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and other cost analyses in type II diabetes that compared liraglutide to one or more anti-diabetic agents were included. Initial screening was based on relevance of titles and abstracts followed by examination of the study methods of each remaining manuscript. Studies conducting original pharmacoeconomic analyses were chosen for inclusion. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were retrieved, and information on the study design and results was abstracted. Abstracted data elements were chosen and assessed based on the authors' experience as well as criteria set forth by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines Task Force. Additionally, reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and selected sensitivity analysis results were converted to $US, year 2012 values, in order to facilitate comparison across studies. A total of six cost studies and seven cost-utility studies were identified for inclusion. Across cost studies, liraglutide treatment resulted in costs ranging from a loss of $US2,730 (liraglutide 1.8 mg vs. sitagliptin; pharmacy costs only) over a 1-year time horizon to a savings of $US9,367 (liraglutide 1.8 mg vs. glimepiride; diabetes-related complication costs only) over a 30-year time horizon. Cost-utility analysis results reported base-case ICERs ranging from $US15,774 (vs. glimepiride) to $US40,128 (vs. rosiglitazone) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) ($US, year 2012) for liraglutide 1.2 mg and $US8,497 (vs. exenatide) to $US66,031 (vs. rosiglitazone)/QALY ($US, year 2012) for liraglutide 1.8 mg. Estimates were most sensitive to variations in time horizon and cardiovascular complication rates. Based on frequently cited, country-specific cost-utility thresholds, liraglutide was determined to have a probability of being cost effective of between 58 % (liraglutide 1.8 mg vs. sitagliptin) and 93 % (liraglutide 1.2 mg vs. glimepiride). Weaknesses of included studies related primarily to study model inputs that assumed long-term morbidity and mortality benefits in favor of liraglutide based on improvements in clinical biomarkers observed in short-term clinical trials. The exclusion of drug acquisition costs in two identified cost studies as well as the assumed lifetime duration of treatment with liraglutide in several cost-utility studies were also identified as weaknesses. The authors' review was limited by the possibility of incomplete literature retrieval, unintended omission of relevant data elements, and comparison of costs and ICERs generated from healthcare systems from differing countries. The current literature presents liraglutide as a cost-effective adjunct treatment for type II diabetes that may also be associated with a reduction in diabetes-related complication costs; however, ICER values are largely dependent on assumptions regarding the benefits of long-term liraglutide treatment and the time horizon of the analysis. Real-world use may make liraglutide unattractive from a payer and policy-maker perspective.","[Zueger, Patrick M.; Lee, Todd A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Pharm Syst Outcomes & Policy, Coll Pharm, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Schultz, Neil M.] Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice & Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Arizona,"Zueger, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Pharm Syst Outcomes & Policy, Coll Pharm, 833 South Wood St,Room 164,M-C 886, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",pzueger2@uic.edu,,"Lee, Todd/0000-0003-3619-5367; Zueger, Patrick/0000-0002-3412-9895",,,,,32,18,18,2,35,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2014,32.0,11,,,,,1079,1091,,10.1007/s40273-014-0192-4,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0LJ,25052903.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344627300006,0

In this paper, we consider a limit order book model that allows for time-dependent, deterministic depth and resilience of the book and determine optimal portfolio liquidation strategies. In a first model variant, we propose a trading-dependent spread that increases when market orders are matched against the order book. In this model, no price manipulation occurs and the optimal strategy is of the wait region/buy region type often encountered in singular control problems. In a second model, we assume that there is no spread in the order book. Under this assumption, we find that price manipulation can occur, depending on the model parameters. Even in the absence of classical price manipulation, there may be transaction triggered price manipulation.

We analyse the European market of standardized CDOs using tranches of the iTraxx index in the periods before and during the global financial crisis. We investigate the evolution of the correlations using different copula models: the standard Gaussian, the NIG, the double-t, and the Gumbel copula model. After calibration of these models, one obtains a time varying vector of parameters. We analyse the dynamic pattern of these coefficients.

Both the underlying Brownian motion and the Markov process are unobservable. We study a discretized version, which is a discrete-time hidden Markov process. The objective is to control trading at each time step to maximize an expected utility function of terminal wealth.

A central goal of the paper is to present a unified and general treatment of the basic question of what constitutes the appropriate solution concept-Cournot or Stackelberg-in such duopolies. We show that simultaneous play never emerges as a subgame-perfect equilibrium of the extended game, in sharp contrast to private duopoly games. We demonstrate that this result is due to the objective function of the public firm being increasing in the rival's output (instead of decreasing for a private firm). We provide sufficient conditions for the emergence of public and/or private leadership equilibrium. In all cases, private profits and social welfare are higher than under the corresponding Cournot equilibrium. We make extensive use of the basic results from the theory of supermodular games in order to avoid common extraneous assumptions such as concavity, existence and uniqueness of the different equilibria, whenever possible.

The paper characterizes the optimal canonical mechanism and shows that this approach loses no generality with respect to the direct (multi-dimensional) mechanism.","Otaru Univ, Otaru, Hokkaido 0478501, Japan",Otaru University of Commerce,"Kojima, N (通讯作者)，Otaru Univ, 3-5-21 Midori, Otaru, Hokkaido 0478501, Japan.",naokisan@res.otaru-uc.ac.jp,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The process includes heteroskedasticity with long memory, leverage, fat-tail innovations, relative return, price granularity, and holidays. Its adequacy to describe empirical data is controlled over a broad panel of statistics, including (robust L-statistics) skew, (robust) kurtosis, shape factor for the volatility distribution, and lagged correlations between combinations of return and volatility. These statistics are computed for returns and volatilities with characteristic time intervals ranging from 1 day to 1 year. This wide cross-check between stock time series and simulations ensures that the most important features of the data are correctly captured by the process up to 1 year. The by-products of the statistical analyses and estimations are (1) a positive skew, (2) a cross-sectional relation between kurtosis and heteroskedasticity, (3) a very similar cross-sectional distribution for the statistics evaluated over the empirical data set or for the process with one set of parameters and (4) the heteroskedasticity is very close to an integrated volatility process.","[Zumbach, Gilles] Consulting Financial Res, CH-1228 Saconnex Darve, Switzerland; [Fernandez, Luis] JP Morgan, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland; [Weber, Caroline] Lombard Odier & Cie, CH-1204 Geneva, Switzerland; [Zumbach, Gilles; Fernandez, Luis; Weber, Caroline] Swissquote Bank, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland",,"Zumbach, G (通讯作者)，Consulting Financial Res, Ch Charles Baudouin 8, CH-1228 Saconnex Darve, Switzerland.",gilles.zumbach@bluewin.ch,,,,,,,16,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

(2012), the authors have introduced a methodology based on stochastic modeling to properly assess the risk-return profiles-i.e. the probability distribution of future benefits - of various old-age provision products. In this paper, we additionally consider the impact of inflation on the risk-return profile of old-age provision products. In a model with stochastic interest rates, stochastic inflation and equity returns including stochastic equity volatility, we derive risk-return-profiles for various types of existing unit-linked products with and without embedded guarantees and especially focus on the difference between nominal and real returns. We find that typical rule of thumb approximations for considering inflation risk are inappropriate and further show that products that are considered particularly safe by practitioners because of nominal guarantees may bear significant inflation risk.

It is unclear which view is supported by the current evidence. Our objective was to systematically review the health economic evidence related to IM and to derive general statements on its cost-effectiveness. A literature search of MEDLINE database for English- and German-language studies was conducted. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies for technologies meeting the MEDLINE medical subject headings (MeSH) definition of IM (genetically targeted interventions) were reviewed. This was followed by a standardized extraction of general study characteristics and cost-effectiveness results. Most of the 84 studies included in the synthesis were from the USA (n = 43, 51 %), cost-utility studies (n = 66, 79 %), and published since 2005 (n = 60, 71 %). The results ranged from dominant to dominated. The median value (cost-utility studies) was calculated to be rounded $US22,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (adjusted to $US, year 2008 values), which is equal to the rounded median cost-effectiveness in the peer-reviewed English-language literature according to a recent review. Many studies reported more than one strategy of IM with highly varying cost-effectiveness ratios. Generally, results differed according to test type, and tests for disease prognosis or screening appeared to be more favorable than tests to stratify patients by response or by risk of adverse effects. However, these results were not significant. Different definitions of IM could have been used. Quality assessment of the studies was restricted to analyzing transparency. IM neither seems to display superior cost-effectiveness than other types of medical interventions nor to be economically inferior. Instead, rather than 'whether' healthcare was individualized, the question of 'how' it was individualized was of economic relevance.","[Hatz, Maximilian H.

The present paper provides a framework for a joint analysis of financial and longevity guarantees, and applies this framework to different annuity conversion options in deferred unit-linked annuities. In particular, we analyze and compare different versions of so-called guaranteed annuity options and guaranteed minimum income benefits with respect to the value of the option and the resulting risk for the insurer. Furthermore, we examine whether and to what extent an insurance company is able to reduce the risk by typical risk management strategies. The analysis is based on a combined stochastic model for both financial market and future survival probabilities. We show that different annuity conversion options have significantly different option values, and that different risk management strategies lead to a significantly different risk for the insurance company.","[Kling, Alexander; Russ, Jochen] Inst Finanz & Aktuarwissensch, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Russ, Jochen] Univ Ulm, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Schilling, Katja] Univ Ulm, Inst Versicherungswissensch, D-89081 Ulm, Germany",Ulm University; Ulm University,"Schilling, K (通讯作者)，Univ Ulm, Inst Versicherungswissensch, Helmholtzstr 20, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.",a.kling@ifa-ulm.de; j.russ@ifa-ulm.de; katja.schilling@uni-ulm.de,"Russ, Jochen/AAO-6198-2021","Russ, Jochen/0000-0001-7510-9033",DFG Research Training Group 1100 at the University of Ulm,DFG Research Training Group 1100 at the University of Ulm,Katja Schilling acknowledges financial support from the DFG Research Training Group 1100 at the University of Ulm.,,36,6,6,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2014,44.0,2,,,,,197,236,,10.1017/asb.2014.7,0.0,,,40,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AP3UA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342002100002,0

By separating the utility maximization problem into a predefault and postdefault component, we deduce two coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for the post- and predefault optimal value functions, and show a novel verification theorem for their solutions. We obtain explicit constructions of value functions and investment strategies for investors with logarithmic and Constant Relative Risk Aversion utilities, and provide a precise characterization of the directionality of the bond investment strategies in terms of corporate returns, forward rates, and expected recovery at default.

The process is identified step by step by increasing the requirement of the model and introducing appropriate adjustments. The first part of the paper investigates the smile dynamics of forward swap rates at their setting dates. Comparing the SABR (with different ) and Heston stochastic volatility models informs us what different specifications of the driving SDEs have to offer in terms of reflecting the dynamics of the smile across dates. The outcome of the analysis is that a normal SABR model ( ) satisfactorily passes all tests and seems to provide a good match to the market. In contrast, we find that the Heston model does not. The next step is to seek a model of the forward swap rates (in their own swaption measure) based on only two Brownian motions that enables a specification with common parameters. It turns out that this can be done by extending the SABR model with a time-dependent volatility function and a mean-reverting volatility process. The performance of the extended (SABR with mean-reversion) model is analysed over several historical dates and is shown to be a stable and flexible choice that allows for good calibration across expiries and strikes. Finally, a time-homogeneous candidate stochastic volatility process that can be used as a driver for all swap rates is identified. This candidate process may in future work be used as a building block for a separable stochastic volatility LIBOR market model or a stochastic volatility Markov-functional model.","[Kaisajuntti, Linus] Danske Markets, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kennedy, Joanne] Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Kaisajuntti, L (通讯作者)，Danske Markets, Stockholm, Sweden.",linus.kaisajuntti@gmail.com,,,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,We are most grateful to an anonymous referee for helpful comments.

Empirical results show that, with regard to a long position, especially for the filter historical simulation (FHS) approach, both the variance specification of the ARJI approach and the FHS VaR approach can not only improve the VaR forecasting performance of GARCH-based models but also significantly reduce the influence of inappropriate return distribution settings on the VaR estimate of GARCH-based models. Moreover, FHS-ARJI-based models seem to be superior to FHS-GARCH-based models, but less significantly so than for the other groups competing above. As to short positions, both ARJI-based models and GARCH-based models seem to have similar VaR performance whereas FHS-GARCH-based models are superior to both GARCH-based models and ARJI-based models. In addition, the other three types of model (ARJI, FHS-GARCH and FHS-ARJI) can reduce more effectively the impact of incorrect return distribution specifications of GARCH-based models as compared with the case of a long position. Finally, within the same type of model, the SGED has just about the best performance among these three distribution specifications for a long position, whereas these phenomena seem to be less significant for a short position. Additionally, the VaR forecasting performance of a short position is less significantly affected by return distribution specifications, volatility specifications or VaR approaches as compared with that of a long position.","China Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Taipei 11581, Taiwan",,"Su, JB (通讯作者)，China Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, 245,Sec 3,Acad Rd, Taipei 11581, Taiwan.",jungbinsu@cc.cust.edu.tw,"Bin Su, Jung/B-9800-2018; Su, Jung-Bin/ABF-1877-2020","Bin Su, Jung/0000-0003-3271-3462; Su, Jung-Bin/0000-0003-3271-3462",,,,,31,11,11,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This cost is manifested through the defence capabilities of a country. In the new security environment the compilation of a National Defence Strategy is a priority of the Defence Ministry, which has more and more limited resources. This means that they should be treated as an economic activity. An economic activity is considered any purposeful activity, allocating and combining scarce resources among alternatives, making it possible to maximize the outcomes and minimize costs. The ratio between the costs and benefits of a given resource or combination of resources to achieve a pre -defined objective is pushed to the forefront and the rationalization of management decisions is based on it.

Interdependence relations among wide-sense-stationary (WSS) sequences can be formally analyzed using Granger-causality as a tool. However, many processes encountered in practice are non-stationary and are described by parameters that change periodically with time. In this paper, it is shown that useful information on the Granger-causality between two cyclostationary (CS) time series can be obtained simply by treating the processes as WSS, without a consideration of the periodic nature of the parameters or the exact knowledge of the period of cyclostationarity.

We fully characterize a multivariate Levy process whose margins are able to approximate any Levy type. Dependence is generated by one or more common sources of jump intensity separately in jumps of any sign and size and a parsimonious method to determine the intensities of these common factors is proposed. Such a new approach allows the calibration of any smooth transition between independence and a large amount of linear dependence and provides greater flexibility in calibrating nonlinear dependence than in other comparable Levy models in the literature. The model is analytically tractable and a straightforward multivariate simulation procedure is available. An empirical analysis shows an accurate multivariate fit of stock returns in terms of linear and nonlinear dependence.

In particular, the interaction between tectonic plates in order to analyze and establish the boundaries of subduction zones. The methodology is based on the analysis of time series obtained from observations of GNSS-GPS satellites. Once the GPS stations are surveyed, data are processed in order to get their displacement rates. There are several softwares for GPS data processing as GIPSY, GPSURVEY or BERNESE GPS software. Most of the receivers also provide a specific software to process their data, although a scientific software is recommended when more precise solutions are required. For the processing of the data of SPINA geodetic network (The southern region of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa) it was used the BERNESE v5.0 GPS scientific software developed by the Astronomy Institute of the University of Bern, Switzerland. The processing of GNSS observed data responds to the following schedule: a preliminary step to prepare and transform the orbit files into the required format, a preprocessing, where a first set of coordinates from the code observations are calculated and the double differences files are obtained, three programs for the real processing, that is, to obtain the coordinates for each session, and a final step where the session solutions are combined and adjusted to get a final and unique solution. The second step provides the positioning of the remaining stations of SPINA network in 24 hours sessions at 30 seconds of sample frequency. With this procedure we will get, on one hand, the determination of the geocentric coordinates of the stations under study, analyzing how this strategy affects the processing, and on the other hand, it will be also possible the study of some other characteristics in the data that are cannot be deduced from the usual processing, in particular those related to the noise characteristics and the existence of short period components.","[Rosado, Belen; Martin, Marta; Paez, Raul; Berrocoso, Manuel] Univ Cadiz, Lab Astron Geodesia & Cartog, Puerto Real 11510, Cadiz, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-UCM - Instituto de Astronomia y Geodesia (IAG); Universidad de Cadiz,"Rosado, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cadiz, Lab Astron Geodesia & Cartog, Campus Puerto Real, Puerto Real 11510, Cadiz, Spain.",marta.martin@uca.es,"BERROCOSO, MANUEL MBD/O-3818-2014; Páez Jiménez, Raúl/L-1041-2014","Páez Jiménez, Raúl/0000-0003-4617-261X",,,,,0,0,0,0,5,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1299,1302,,,,,,4,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600142,0

Several treatments are available for patients diagnosed at any disease stage. It remains unclear how medical expenditures vary across patients who remain untreated or undergo different modes of therapy. We evaluate the comparative and cost effectiveness of treatment modalities for HCC from a Medicare perspective. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries and linked Medicare database with claims from Parts A/B were used to identify Medicare enrollees with initial diagnosis of HCC between 2000 and 2007 and followed through 2009. Patients were assigned to treatment modalities based on HCC staging systems: transplant, resection, liver directed, radiation, chemotherapy or no treatment. Survival benefits and cumulative Medicare expenditures were estimated in multivariate models, stratified by initial disease stage, to control for confounding. Cost-effectiveness ratios compared costs and benefits of the modalities across initial stages. Cancer stages I, II, III, IV and unstaged represented 24, 9, 14, 17 and 37 % of 11,047 patients, respectively. Fewer than 40 % received any treatment. Relative to no treatment, transplant was most effective in reducing mortality, followed by resection, liver directed, and radiation or chemotherapy. Resection tended to be most cost effective in early staged and unstaged patients; transplant was least cost effective. In stage IV patients, liver directed therapy was more cost effective than chemotherapy or radiation. Survival benefit was attributable to all treatment modalities. More effective treatments incurred greater Medicare expenditures, but resection patients incurred the least expenditures per year of life gained.","[Shaya, Fadia T.; Breunig, Ian M.; Mullins, C.

The reserves of the two lines of business are modeled by a two-dimensional compound Poisson risk process or a common shock model. To protect from large losses and to reduce the ruin probability of the insurer, the insurer applies a reinsurance policy to each line of business, thus the two policies form a two-dimensional reinsurance policy. In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional reinsurance policy in a dynamic setting. By using the martingale central limit theorem, we first derive a two-dimensional diffusion approximation to the two-dimensional compound Poisson reserve risk process. We then formulate the total reserve of the insurer by a controlled diffusion process and reduce the problem of optimal reinsurance strategies to a dynamic control problem for the controlled diffusion process. Under this setting, we show that a two-dimensional excess-of-loss reinsurance policy is an optimal form that minimizes the ruin probability of the controlled diffusion process. By solving a HJB equation with two dependent controls, we derive the explicit expressions of the optimal two-dimensional retention levels of the optimal two-dimensional excess-of-loss reinsurance policy and the minimized ruin probability. The results show that optimal dynamic two-dimensional retention levels are constant and the optimal retention levels are related by a deterministic function. We also illustrate the results by numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Imposing on the underlying controls for both players a conditional independence property, we obtain the existence of the value in mixed strategies as the limit of the lower as well as of the upper value functions along a sequence of partitions which mesh tends to zero.

A non-parametric, time domain estimator, based on an autoregressive (AR) approximation is shown to have good theoretical and small sample properties for the estimation of the IRF. An alternative procedure of using a semi-parametric local Whittle (LW) estimator of the long-memory parameter and then obtaining estimates of the short run parameters and IRF is also considered. The second part of the paper investigates the most appropriate methods for estimating the variability and the construction of confidence intervals for the estimated IRF. Particular attention is given to a generic semi-parametric sieve bootstrap based on an autoregressive approximation of the unknown data generating mechanism. The validity of bootstrap inference on the IRF, based on the autoregressive approximation, is proven under mild assumptions. The findings in this paper indicate that a good strategy for analysing IRF is to estimate by semi-parametric AR approximations, and to use the sieve bootstrap for estimating confidence intervals. Simulation evidence indicates this approach appears to be a very good strategy for processes with either short or long memory.

Since payment vehicle is an intrinsic characteristic of a good, the choice of payment vehicle will naturally impact on the valuation of the good. Typical payment vehicles applied in the context of health are income tax levies, out-of-pocket payments at the point of consumption or private health insurance premiums. Where out-of-pocket payments will elicit use value only, private health insurance premiums will also disclose option value, i.e. the utility of knowing that one has access to a healthcare service should one need it. Income tax levies will disclose what in this paper is referred to as citizen's preferences, i.e. individual preferences that include use value, option value as well as (caring) externalities. This paper advocates that researchers design stated preference studies that encompass all relevant dimensions of value, and that serious thought is given to choice of payment vehicle. However, it is important to acknowledge that choice of payment vehicle has other potential implications for valuations. Payment vehicle and provider of services may be strongly linked in people's minds. If respondents implicitly associate a specific type of provider with a certain type of payment vehicle, it is important that any misperception is corrected by way of a precise description of the good being valued. Further, a pertinent issue is the extent to which respondents 'protest' to the stated preference question and how we should deal with these 'protesters'. No agreement currently exists about the procedure used to separate genuine zero values from protest values, nor about the treatment of protest responses in subsequent analyses. Beliefs are strongly associated with protesting, and exclusion of protest bids may therefore exclude individuals who have strong preferences for a payment vehicle. If it is acknowledged that payment vehicle is an intrinsic component of a good, exclusion of respondents who exhibit specific viewpoints may result in biased welfare estimates. Yet another issue is the presence of self-consciousness amongst respondents. If people derive utility from saying they are willing to pay for a public good (social desirability bias or warm glow), this potentially drives a wedge between people's stated value for a good in a survey and people's value for a good provided to them from the government. Tax payments are more binding than out-of-pocket payments. Payment towards public health programs via income tax may therefore generate lower consumer surplus than if the intervention was financed out-of-pocket with the option of opting out both in terms of participation as well as financially. Finally, only a few studies have looked at the impact of frequency of payments. The effect of temporal framing is clearly potentially important and at the same time an unavoidable component of the payment vehicle, yet it remains at present unexplored.","[Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Southern Denmark; University of Queensland,"Gyrd-Hansen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE, JB Winslowsvej 9B, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark.",dgyrd-hansen@health.sdu.dk,"Wang, Jing/B-2431-2014; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/A-3161-2011","Wang, Jing/0000-0002-0079-0773; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/0000-0003-1137-2304",,,,,61,8,8,2,28,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2013,31.0,10,,,,,853,861,,10.1007/s40273-013-0086-x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,232EN,24009048.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325473900002,0

It is the focus of much attention by payers, not least in the UK even though the cost of medicines represents less than 10 % of total UK National Health Service (NHS) expenditure. Projecting future medicines spending enables the likely cost pressure to be allowed for in planning the scale and allocation of NHS resources. Simple extrapolations of past trends in expenditure fail to account for changes in the rate and mix of new medicines becoming available and in the scope for windfall savings when some medicines lose their patent protection. The objective of this study is to develop and test an improved method to project NHS pharmaceutical expenditure in the UK for the period 2012-2015. We have adopted a product-by-product, bottom-up approach, which means that our projections are built up from individual products to the total market. Our projections of the impact of generic and biosimilars entry on prices and quantities of medicines sold, and of the rate of uptake of newly launched medicines, have been obtained from regression analysis of UK data. To address uncertainty, we have created a baseline and two other illustrative scenarios. We have compared our projections with actual expenditure for 2012. Our projections estimate that, between 2011 and 2015, with no change in policy or price regulation, the UK total medicines bill would increase at an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of between 3.1 and 4.1 %.

With the estimated daily term structure over the long horizon, we find that (i) changes in model-free volatilities are asymmetrically more positively impacted by a decrease in the index level than negatively impacted by an increase in the index level; (ii) the negative relationship between the daily change in model-free volatility and the daily change in index level is stronger in the near term than in the far term; and (iii) the slope of the term structure is positively associated with the index level, having a tendency to display a negative slope during bear markets and a positive slope during bull markets.

In this article, the authors have extended previous studies of collateralized derivative pricing to more generic situations, i.e. asymmetric and imperfect collateralization with the associated counterparty credit risk. By introducing the collateral coverage ratio, their framework can handle these issues in a unified manner. Although the resultant pricing formula becomes a nonlinear forwardbackward stochastic differential equation and cannot be solved exactly, its first-order approximation is provided using the Gateaux derivative. The authors have shown that it allows one to decompose the price of a generic contract into three parts: a market benchmark, a bilateral credit value adjustment (CVA), and a collateral cost adjustment (CCA) independent of the credit risk. Each term is studied closely, and the significant impact is demonstrated of asymmetric collateralization through CCA using numerical examples.","[Fujii, Masaaki; Takahashi, Akihiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Takahashi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",akihikot@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Fujii, Masaaki/0000-0002-3332-068X",CARF (Center for Advanced Research in Finance); global COE program; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25380389] Funding Source: KAKEN,"CARF (Center for Advanced Research in Finance); global COE program(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This research is supported by CARF (Center for Advanced Research in Finance) and the global COE program 'The research and training center for new developments in mathematics'.

We study a pricing and hedging model similar to the delta hedging strategy with an endogenous volatility parameter for the calculation of delta over time. The endogenous volatility depends on both the transaction costs and the option strike prices. The optimal hedging volatility is calculated using the criterion of minimizing the weighted upside and downside replication errors. The endogenous volatility model with equal weights on the up and down replication errors yields an option premium close to the Leland [J. Finance, 1985, 40, 12831301] heuristic approach. The model with weights being the probabilities of the option's moneyness provides option prices closest to the actual prices.

Though insurers know the values of the high-risk and low-risk accident probabilities, each individual customer's accident probability is unknown to the insurer. It is well known that if individual customers have state-independent utility functions, and insurers incur neither production costs nor interest costs, then in competitive markets with imperfect information on accident probabilities, if an equilibrium exists it entails separate contracts with the high-risk individuals obtaining complete insurance and low-risk individuals obtaining partial insurance. While in monopolistic markets with imperfect information on accident probabilities, the following four properties hold: (i) high-risk and low-risk individuals never purchase the same insurance policy (i.e., pooling is never optimal); (ii) the optimal contract for the high-risk individual is complete insurance; (iii) if the low-risk individual buys insurance, his/her utility is essentially the same as it would have been had he/she not purchased any insurance; and (iv) there exists a critical (finite) ratio of high- to low-risk individuals such that if the actual ratio exceeds the critical ratio, the low-risk individuals purchase no insurance. In this paper we will extend the traditional model by assuming that individual consumers have a common state-dependent utility function and assume insurers incur production costs that are proportional to the amount of insurance purchased and to the premium charged as well as interest costs. We derive results for both competitive markets and monopolistic markets with imperfect information on accident probabilities. We prove that even though pooling is never optimal in the traditional framework, it may be optimal in our model and high-risk individuals may optimally choose partial insurance. In addition, we develop extensions to the four properties listed above. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Building on their results we characterize when an allocation rule is outcome equivalent to the DA algorithm for every substitutable priority rule. In particular, an assignment rule satisfies mutual best (MB) if an agent is always assigned her most preferred object whenever she has the highest priority for it. This mild requirement is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for an assignment rule to be stable. We demonstrate that any allocation mechanism that satisfies MB along with non-wastefulness, population monotonicity and either individually rational monotonicity or weak Maskin monotonicity not only is a stable assignment mechanism but is equivalent to the agent proposing DA algorithm.","N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA",North Carolina State University,"Morrill, T (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA.",thayer_morrill@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,14,19,20,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The first part of the paper considers an arbitrary type of dependence of bidders' values and analyses identification under several observational scenarios, in which the highest bid is never observed. In a basic scenario, only the winner's identity and the winning price are observed. The most informative is the scenario in which all the identities and all the bids except for the highest bid are known. Using results from Athey and Haile (2002), the joint distribution of bidders' values in these scenarios is not identified. The paper uses the information available in auctions' outcomes to construct bounds on the joint distribution of values for any subset of bidders. The second part of the paper takes a different tack by showing how bounds can be improved under different types of positive dependence of bidders' values.","London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Komarova, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",t.komarova@lse.ac.uk,,"Komarova, Tatiana/0000-0002-6581-5097",,,,,20,6,8,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1368-4221,,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

However, their application to pharmacy practice is limited and the optimal method to inform policy developments is unknown. Objectives Our objective was to test the sensitivity of the EQ-5D and SF-6D within pharmacy when measuring whether changes in health status or other co-variates at baseline affect the effectiveness of the intervention at follow-up. A further objective was to consider the implications of the findings for pharmacy research and policy. Methods The EQ-5D and SF-6D utility measures were employed within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of community pharmacy-led medicines management for patients with coronary heart disease. The intervention covered a baseline visit with the potential for follow-up. Simultaneous quantile regression assessed the impact of the intervention on both EQ-5D and SF-6D measures at follow-up, controlling for baseline health, appropriateness of treatment, personal characteristics and self-reported satisfaction. Results No statistically significant difference in HR-QOL across the intervention and control groups at follow-up was reported for either measure. Increased health gain was however associated with the baseline utility score (with the EQ-5D more sensitive for those in worse health) and the appropriateness of treatment, but not patient characteristics or self-reported satisfaction. Conclusion Neither generic measure detected a gain in HR-QOL as a result of the introduction of an innovative pharmacy-based service. This finding supports other work in the area of pharmacy, where health gains have not changed following interventions. Disease-specific utility measures should be investigated as an alternative to generic approaches such as the EQ-5D and SF-6D. Given that the RCT found an increase in self-reported satisfaction, broader measures of benefit that value patient experiences, such as contingent valuation and discrete-choice experiments, should also be considered in pharmacy.","[Tinelli, Michela; Ryan, Mandy] Univ Aberdeen, HERU, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Tinelli, Michela; Bond, Christine] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Acad Primary Care, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Tinelli, Michela] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth & Social Care, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Scott, Anthony] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Melbourne,"Tinelli, M (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth & Social Care, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.tinelli@lse.ac.uk,"Scott, Anthony/E-6636-2010; Bond, Christine/ABF-5390-2020; Tinelli, Michela/C-3008-2016","Scott, Anthony/0000-0002-2851-5378; Bond, Christine/0000-0003-0429-5208; Tinelli, Michela/0000-0002-8816-4389","Department of Health for England; Department of Health for Wales; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Medical Research Council (MRC); Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health Directorate; Chief Scientist Office [HERU2, HERU1] Funding Source: researchfish",Department of Health for England(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Department of Health for Wales; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health Directorate(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland); Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland),"The authors would like to thank the medical statistician and senior lecturer Dr Lorna Aucott, University of Aberdeen, for her helpful comments and suggestions.

Considering the widespread use of ordinal variables in wellbeing measurement, and particularly in composite indices, I derive multivariate stochastic dominance conditions for ordinal variables. These are the analogues of the conditions for continuous variables (e.g., Bawa, 1975, and Atkinson and Bourguignon, 1982). The article also derives mixed-order-of-dominance conditions for any type of variable. Then I propose an extension of Anderson's nonparametric test in order to test these conditions for ordinal variables. In addition, I propose the use of vectors and matrices of positions in order to handle multivariate, multinomial distributions. An empirical application to multidimensional wellbeing in Peru illustrates these tests.","Univ Oxford, OPHI, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Yalonetzky, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, OPHI, Oxford, England.",gaston.yalonetzky@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,"Yalonetzky, Gaston/0000-0003-2438-0223",,,,,42,21,21,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

In contrast to models with symmetric costs, some firms may be inactive in equilibrium. (With symmetric costs, the results trivialize to all firms active or all firms inactive.) We concentrate on the linear demand structure with constant marginal but asymmetric costs. In static one-period models, we compare the number of active firms, i.e. the number of firms producing a positive quantity in equilibrium, across four different models of oligopoly: Cournot and Bertrand with homogeneous or differentiated goods. When firms have different costs, we show that, for fixed good type, Cournot always results in more active firms than Bertrand. Moreover, with a fixedmarket type, differentiated goods result in more active firms than homogeneous goods. In dynamic models, asymmetric costs induce different entry times into the market. We illustrate with a model of energy production in which multiple producers from costly but inexhaustible alternative sources such as solar or wind compete in a Cournot market against an oil producer with exhaustible supply.","[Ledvina, Andrew; Sircar, Ronnie] Princeton Univ, ORFE Dept, Sherrerd Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Sircar, R (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, ORFE Dept, Sherrerd Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",aledvina@princeton.edu; sircar@princeton.edu,,,,,,,25,27,34,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

We propose the amount of asymptotic confidence size distortion as a criterion to choose among competing inference methods. This criterion is then applied to compare across test statistics and critical values employed in the construction of CSs. We find two important results under weak assumptions. First, we show that CSs based on subsampling and generalized moment selection (Andrews and Soares (2010)) suffer from the same degree of asymptotic confidence size distortion, despite the fact that asymptotically the latter can lead to CSs with strictly smaller expected volume under correct model specification. Second, we show that the asymptotic confidence size of CSs based on the quasi-likelihood ratio test statistic can be an arbitrary small fraction of the asymptotic confidence size of CSs based on the modified method of moments test statistic.","[Bugni, Federico A.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Canay, Ivan A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Guggenberger, Patrik] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Duke University; Northwestern University; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Bugni, FA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",federico.bugni@duke.edu; iacanay@northwestern.edu; pguggenberger@ucsd.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1123771, SES-1123586, SES-1021101]; Alfred P.

This investigation is motivated by the incremental risk charge (IRC) introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In contrast to the standard market risk measure based on a 10-day value-at-risk calculated at 99% confidence, the IRC considers more extreme losses and is measured over a 1-year horizon. More importantly, whereas 10-day VaR is ordinarily calculated with a portfolios holdings held fixed, the IRC assumes a portfolio is managed dynamically to a target level of risk, with constraints on rebalancing frequency. The IRC uses discrete rebalancing intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) as a rough measure of potential illiquidity in underlying assets. We analyze the effect of these rebalancing intervals on the portfolios profit and loss distribution over a risk-measurement horizon. We derive limiting results, as the rebalancing frequency increases, for the difference between discretely and continuously rebalanced portfolios; we use these to approximate the loss distribution for the discretely rebalanced portfolio relative to the continuously rebalanced portfolio. Our analysis leads to explicit measures of the impact of discrete rebalancing under a simple model of asset dynamics.","Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Glasserman, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, 403 Uris Hall, New York, NY 10027 USA.",pg20@columbia.edu,,,NSF [DMS0914529],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I am grateful to John Kambhu of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for helpful discussions concerning the incremental risk charge and for comments that motivated the analysis in Section 4.1.

In this paper the two components are consistently separately estimated within a semimartingale framework with possibly infinite activity jumps. The threshold (or truncated) estimator (IC) over cap (n) is used, which substantially excludes from RC all terms containing jumps. Unlike in Jacod (2007, Universite de Paris-6) and Jacod (2008, Stochastic Processes and Their Applications 118, 517-559), no assumptions on the volatilities' dynamics are required. In the presence of only finite activity jumps: 1) central limit theorems (CLTs) for (IC) over cap (n) and for further measures of dependence between the two Brownian parts are obtained; the estimation error asymptotic variance is shown to be smaller than for the alternative estimators of IC in the literature; 2) by also selecting the observations as in Hayashi and Yoshida (2005, Bernoulli 11, 359-379), robustness to nonsynchronous data is obtained. The proposed estimators are shown to have good finite sample performances in Monte Carlo simulations even with an observation frequency low enough to make microstructure noises' impact on data negligible.","[Mancini, Cecilia] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Matemat Decis, I-50127 Florence, Italy; [Gobbi, Fabio] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Florence; University of Bologna,"Mancini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dipartimento Matemat Decis, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",cecilia.mancini@dmd.unifi.it,"Gobbi, Fabio/AAX-1200-2021","Gobbi, Fabio/0000-0003-3669-1619",Italian Government [MIUR 2006 n.2006132713-004],Italian Government,"The authors thank (in chronological order) Rama Coat, Roberto Reno, and the anonymous referees for important comments that helped improve and deepen our analysis; Christian Timothy Brownlees and Peter Tankov or help in the implementation of the CGMY model, and Jean Jacod for a discussion at the conference Stochastic processes and financial econometrics in Florence in September 2009.

We give a representation in terms of formation of the grand coalition according to an ordering of the players and define the corresponding compensation vector. Then, we generalize this idea to cooperative games with a communication graph in order to construct new allocation rules called the compensation solutions. Firstly, we consider cooperative games with arbitrary graphs and construct rooted spanning trees (see Demange, J Political Econ 112:754-778, 2004) instead of orderings of the players by using the classical algorithms DFS and BFS. If the graph is complete, we show that the compensation solutions associated with DFS and BFS coincide with the Shapley value and the equal surplus division respectively. Secondly, we consider cooperative games with a forest (cycle-free graph) and all its rooted spanning trees. The compensation solution is characterized by component efficiency and relative fairness. The latter axiom takes into account the relative position of a player with respect to his component in the communication graph.","[Beal, Sylvain] Univ Franche Comte, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Beal, Sylvain] CRESE, F-25009 Besancon, France; [Remila, Eric] Univ Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, LIP, CNRS ENS,UMR 5668, F-69364 Lyon 07, France; [Remila, Eric] Univ Lyon IXXI, F-69364 Lyon 07, France; [Solal, Philippe] Univ St Etienne, F-42023 St Etienne, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet,"Béal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, F-25030 Besancon, France.",sylvain.beal@univ-fcomte.fr; eric.remila@ens-lyon.fr; philippe.solal@univ-st-etienne.fr,,,Complex Systems Institute of Lyon (IXXI); National Agency for Research (ANR) [ANR.09.BLANC-0321.03],Complex Systems Institute of Lyon (IXXI); National Agency for Research (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors are grateful to Theo Driessen, Amandine Ghintran, Anna Khmelnitskaya and Aymeric Lardon for stimulating discussions, and to an associate editor and two anonymous referees for valuable suggestions.

This is a nonparametric nonlinear instrumental variables (IV) problem. We propose a class of penalized sieve minimum distance (PSMD) estimators, which are minimizers of a penalized empirical minimum distance criterion over a collection of sieve spaces that are dense in the infinite-dimensional function parameter space. Some of the PSMD procedures use slowly growing finite-dimensional sieves with flexible penalties or without any penalty; others use large dimensional sieves with lower semicompact and/or convex penalties. We establish their consistency and the convergence rates in Banach space norms (such as a sup-norm or a root mean squared norm), allowing for possibly noncompact infinite-dimensional parameter spaces. For both mildly and severely ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems, our convergence rates in Hilbert space norms (such as a root mean squared norm) achieve the known minimax optimal rate for the nonparametric mean IV regression. We illustrate the theory with a nonparametric additive quantile IV regression.

If the income of banks decreases, they mass-reduce their lendings; if corporations sales drop, and they cannot adjust their liquidities by further borrowing due to existing debt, then they must immediately reduce their expenses, lay off staff, and cancel investments. This hyperreaction produces a bifurcation mechanism, and eventually a strong dynamical instability in capital markets that is commonly called systemic risk. In this article, we show that this instability can be monitored by measuring the highest eigenvalue of a matrix of elasticities. These elasticities measure the reaction of each sector of the economy to a drop in its revenues from another sector. This highest eigenvalue-the spectral radius-of the elasticity matrix can be used as an early indicator of market instability and potential crisis. Grandmont and subsequent research showed the possibility that the 'invisible hand' of markets becomes chaotic, opening the door to uncontrolled swings. Our contribution is to provide an actual way of measuring how close to chaos the market is. Estimating elasticities and actually generating the indicators of instability will be the topic of forthcoming research.","[Douady, Raphael] Univ Paris 01, CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75001 Paris, France; [Choi, Youngna] Montclair State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Montclair State University,"Douady, R (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 6 Rue Amiral de Coligny, F-75001 Paris, France.",raphael.douady@riskdata.com,,,,,,,36,23,24,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

A further sub-period analysis reveals that the turnover effect is significant only before 1990, but cannot be explained by any multifactor models. In contrast, the BM premium is significant only after 1990, and can be explained by the Fama-French three-factor model.

Our test generalizes the panel unit root test of Harris and Tzavalis, which is based on an unaugmented DickeyFuller regression.

A general framework of inverting option prices for the implied risk-neutral PDF is formulated from the option pricing formula of Cox and Ross [J. Financial Econ., 1976, 3, 145166]. To overcome the non-uniqueness and instability inherent in the option inverse problem, the smoothness requirement for the shape of the PDF and a prior model are introduced by a penalty function. Positivity constraints are included as a hard bond on the PDF values. The option inverse problem then becomes a non-negative least-squares problem that can be solved by classic methods such as the non-negative least-squares program of Lawson and Hanson [Solving Least Squares Problems, 1974 (Prentice-Hall: Englewood Cliffs, NJ)]. The best solution is not the one that gives the best fit to the observed option prices or provides the smoothest PDF, but the one that gives the optimal trade-off between the goodness-of-fit and smoothness of the estimated risk-natural PDF. The proposed inversion technique is compared with the models of BlackScholes (BS), a mixture of two lognormals (MLN), Jarrow and Rudd's Edgeworth expansion (JR), and jump diffusion (JD) for the estimation of the PDF from the option prices associated with the September 2007 NYMEX natural gas futures. It is found that the inversion technique not only gives the best goodness-of-fit, but also a significantly better model resolution. An empirical study for the last three months of the September 2007 futures contract shows that the shapes of the estimated PDFs become more symmetric as the futures contract becomes closer to the expiration date. The dispersion of the estimated PDFs decreases with decreasing time to expiry, indicating the resolution of uncertainty with passing time.","[Du, Yijun; Wang, Chen] Lower Colorado River Author, Fuel & Energy Risk Management, Austin, TX 78703 USA; [Du, Yibing] Nationwide Insurance, Off Investment, Columbus, OH 43215 USA",,"Du, YJ (通讯作者)，Lower Colorado River Author, Fuel & Energy Risk Management, Austin, TX 78703 USA.",ydu@lcra.org,,,,,,,73,3,5,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The estimation of preference weights will allow the calculation of QALYs for use in paediatric economic evaluation. Methods: Valuation interviews were undertaken with 300 members of the UK adult general population to obtain preference weights for a sample of the health states in the CHU9D descriptive system. Both standard gamble and ranking valuation methods were used. Regression modelling was undertaken to estimate models that could predict a value for every health state defined by the system. A range of models were tested and were evaluated based on their predictive performance. Results: Models estimated on the standard gamble data performed better than the rank model. All models had a few inconsistencies or insignificant levels and so further modelling was done to estimate a parsimonious consistent regression model using the general-to-specific approach, by combining inconsistent levels and removing non-significant levels. The final preferred model was an ordinary least squares (OLS) model. All the coefficients in this model were significant, there were no inconsistencies and the model had the best predictive performance and a low mean absolute error. Conclusion: This research has demonstrated it is feasible to value the CHU9D descriptive system, and preference weights for each health state can be generated to allow the calculation of QALYs. The CHU9D can now be used in the economic evaluation of paediatric healthcare interventions. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of children's preferences for the health states and what methods could be used to obtain these preferences.","[Stevens, Katherine] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci HEDS, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Stevens, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",K.Stevens@Sheffield.ac.uk,"Stevens, Katherine/E-4679-2010","Stevens, Katherine/0000-0002-9018-6413",UK Medical Research Council in Health Services and Health of the Public Research; MRC [G0802298] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0802298] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Medical Research Council in Health Services and Health of the Public Research(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This research was funded as part of a UK Medical Research Council Special Training Fellowship in Health Services and Health of the Public Research.

We find two behavioral biases in the strategies of our participants: ignoring the mean-reverting process, and myopic behavior.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) to critically appraise the evidence presented by the manufacturer. This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from a single phase III randomized controlled trial (GO-REVEAL) that compared golimumab with placebo for the treatment of active and progressive patients who were symptomatic despite the use of previous DMARDs or NSAIDs. The 14-week data showed that, compared with placebo, golimumab 50 mg significantly improved joint disease response as measured by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 (relative risk [RR] 5.73, 95% CI 3.24, 10.56) and Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) [RR 3.45, 95% Cl 2.49, 4.87], and significantly improved skin disease response as measured by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (RR 15.95, 95% CI 4.62, 59.11). The 24-week absolute data showed that these treatment benefits were maintained. There was a significant improvement in patients' functional status as measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire change from baseline at 24 weeks (-0.33; p<0.001). The open-label extension data showed that these beneficial effects were also maintained at 52 and 104 weeks. The ERG identified several issues relating to the clinical effectiveness results. Analyses of the 24-week data were less robust, failing to adjust for treatment contamination due to patient crossover at week 16. It was also unclear if these results were generalizable to clinical practice. No randomized controlled trial compared the effectiveness of different biologic therapies head-to-head. To compare the effectiveness of the biologics etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab, the manufacturer conducted a network meta-analysis, including the comparator palliative care (usual care including use of NSAIDs or DMARDs). The ERG considered the assumption of exchangeability between the trials for the purpose of the network meta-analysis to be acceptable and the statistical approach to be reliable. The results indicated somewhat lower efficacy with golimumab than with comparator biologics. The ERG identified a number of issues relating to the cost-effectiveness results. The manufacturer calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) incorrectly by comparing golimumab with palliative care instead of the most cost-effective alternative (etanercept). Despite the manufacturer's claim that golimumab was a cost-effective treatment option, the manufacturer's own model showed that golimumab was unlikely to be cost effective, relative to currently accepted thresholds, when the ICERs were correctly calculated using an incremental analysis (i.e. comparing each treatment to the next best alternative). None of the sensitivity analyses carried out by the manufacturer or the ERG regarding uncertainty in the estimates of clinical effectiveness, the acquisition and administration cost of drugs, the cost of treating psoriasis and the utility functions estimated to generate health outcomes changed this conclusion. However, a key area in determining the cost effectiveness of biologics was whether they should be treated as a class. The ERG concluded that if all biologics were considered equally effective, then etanercept, adalimumab and golimumab had almost equal costs and equal QALYs, and all had an ICER of about 15000 pound per QALY versus palliative care, whilst infliximab, with a higher acquisition cost, was dominated by the other biologics. The Appraisal Committee altered its position between the Appraisal Consultation Document and the Final Appraisal Determination. It ultimately recommended that golimumab be provided as an option for the treatment of active and progressive PsA in adults only if (i) it is used as described for other tumour necrosis factor inhibitor treatments in 'Etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis' (NICE clinical guideline 199); and (ii) the manufacturer provides the 100 mg dose of golimumab at the same cost as the 50 mg dose.","[Yang, Huiqin; Craig, Dawn; Light, Kate; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Epstein, David; Bojke, Laura; Sculpher, Mark] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Epstein, David] Univ Granada, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Appl Econ, Granada, Spain; [Bruce, Ian N.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Arthrit Res UK Epidemiol Unit, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; University of Granada; University of Manchester,"Yang, HQ (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",huiqin.yang@york.ac.uk,"Bruce, Iain A/H-9508-2019; Epstein, David/I-2839-2019","Bruce, Iain A/0000-0003-0831-4760; Epstein, David/0000-0002-2275-0916; Bruce, Ian/0000-0003-3047-500X; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913",National Institute for Health [09/120/01],National Institute for Health,This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 09/120/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.[34] See the HTA programme website (http://www.hta.ac.uk) for further project information.

The key innovation in this paper is to employ an alternative asymptotic framework to assess the properties of these inference procedures. This theoretical approach is conceptually distinct from the traditional approach (based on asymptotic linearity of the estimator and Edgeworth expansions), and leads to different theoretical prescriptions for bootstrap-based semiparametric inference. First, we show that the conventional bootstrap-based approximations to the distribution of the estimator and its classical studentized version are both invalid in general. This result shows a fundamental lack of robustness of the associated, classical bootstrap-based inference procedures with respect to the bandwidth choice. Second, we present a new bootstrap-based inference procedure for density-weighted average derivatives that is more robust to perturbations of the bandwidth choice, and hence exhibits demonstrable superior theoretical statistical properties over the traditional bootstrap-based inference procedures. Finally, we also examine the validity and invalidity of related bootstrap-based inference procedures and discuss additional results that may be of independent interest.

Inappropriate methods to handle missing data can lead to misleading results and ultimately can affect the decision of whether an intervention is good value for money. This article provides practical guidance on how to handle missing data in within-trial CEAs following a principled approach: (i) the analysis should be based on a plausible assumption for the missing data mechanism, i.e. whether the probability that data are missing is independent of or dependent on the observed and/or unobserved values; (ii) the method chosen for the base-case should fit with the assumed mechanism; and (iii) sensitivity analysis should be conducted to explore to what extent the results change with the assumption made. This approach is implemented in three stages, which are described in detail: (1) descriptive analysis to inform the assumption on the missing data mechanism; (2) how to choose between alternative methods given their underlying assumptions; and (3) methods for sensitivity analysis. The case study illustrates how to apply this approach in practice, including software code.

Consequently, this paper adjusts the parameters from GRA and inserts the key elements into the fitted ANN model by comparing the learning effect of the Back-propagation Neural Network (BPN).

This review updates a previous systematic review and includes 72 new papers published between 2000 and 2013. Bladder cancer continues to be one of the most common and expensive malignancies. The annual cost of bladder cancer in the USA during 2010 was $US4 billion and is expected to rise to $US5 billion by 2020. Ten years ago, urinary markers held the potential to lower treatment costs of bladder cancer. However, subsequent real-world experiments have demonstrated that further work is necessary to identify situations in which these technologies can be applied in a cost-effective manner. Adjunct cytology remains a part of diagnostic standard of care, but recent research suggests that it is not cost effective due to its low diagnostic yield. Analysis of intravesical chemotherapy after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), neo-adjuvant therapy for cystectomy, and robot-assisted laparoscopic cystectomy suggests that these technologies are cost effective and should be implemented more widely for appropriate patients. The existing literature on the cost effectiveness of bladder cancer treatments has improved substantially since 2000. The body of work now includes many new models, registry analyses, and real-world studies. However, there is still a need for new implementation guidelines, new risk modeling tools, and a better understanding of the empirical burden of bladder cancer.","[Yeung, Christina; Tuan Dinh; Lee, Joseph] Evidera, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",Evidera,"Yeung, C (通讯作者)，Evidera, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",tina.yeung@evidera.com,,,,,,,108,147,163,1,31,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2014,32.0,11,,,,,1093,1104,,10.1007/s40273-014-0194-2,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0LJ,25056838.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344627300007,0

In general, the investment decision maker of the insurance company is assumed to be rational and risk averse. This is inconsistent with non fully rational decision-making way in the real world. In this paper we investigate an optimal portfolio selection problem for the insurer. The investment decision maker is assumed to be loss averse. The surplus process of the insurer is modeled by a Levy process. The insurer aims to maximize the expected utility when terminal wealth exceeds his aspiration level. With the help of martingale method, we translate the dynamic maximization problem into an equivalent static optimization problem. By solving the static optimization problem, we derive explicit expressions of the optimal portfolio and the optimal wealth process. (C) 2014 Elsevier BA/.

Through an extensive empirical study, we find that in addition to the agent's loss aversion and evaluation period, his reference point also has a significant effect on optimal asset allocation. We demonstrate that the agent's optimal allocation to equities is consistent with market observation when he has reasonable values of degree of loss aversion, evaluation period and reference point. We also find that the optimal allocation to equities is sensitive to these parameters. We then examine the implications of money illusion for asset allocation.

We show that a cognitive hierarchy model with quantal responses can explain the most important features of the experimental data on the action commitment game in (2002).

In this paper, we focus on testing for positive quadrant dependence. We propose two new tests for verifying positive quadrant dependence. We prove novel results on finite sample behavior of power function of one of the proposed tests as well as evaluate and compare the two new solutions with the best existing ones, via a simulation study. These comparisons demonstrate that the new solutions are slightly weaker in detecting positive quadrant dependence modeled by classical bivariate models and outperform the best existing solutions when some mixtures, regression and heavy-tailed models have to be detected. Finally, the methods introduced in the paper are applied to real life insurance data, to assess the dependence and test them for positive quadrant dependence. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our sample contains investors who invest either in a growth fund, a value fund, or both. We document behavioral differences between growth fund investors and value fund investors. We find that their trades depend on past returns in different ways: growth fund investors tend towards momentum trading and value fund investors tend towards contrarian trading. These differences may be due to inherent clientele characteristics, including beliefs about market prices, specific personality traits and cognitive strategies that cause them to self-select into one or the other style. We use a sample of investors that trade in both types of funds to test this proposition. Consistent with the contextual hypothesis, we find that investors who hold both types of funds trade growth fund shares differently than value fund shares.","[Blackburn, Douglas W.] Fordham Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Goetzmann, William N.] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ukhov, Andrey D.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Fordham University; Yale University; Cornell University,"Ukhov, AD (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 465C Statler Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",andrey.ukhov@gmail.com,,,,,,,68,9,9,1,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

However, there is a growing concern that the various 'multi-attribute utility' (MAU) instruments designed to measure the Q in the QALY yield disparate values, implying that results from different instruments are incommensurable. By reviewing cost-utility analyses published in 2010, we aim to contribute to improved knowledge on how QALYs are currently calculated in applied analyses; how transparently QALY measurement is presented; and how large the expected incremental QALY gains are. We searched Embase, MEDLINE and NHS EED for all cost-utility analyses published in 2010. All analyses that had estimated QALYs gained from health interventions were included. Of the 370 studies included in this review, 48 % were pharmacoeconomic evaluations. Active comparators were used in 71 % of studies. The median incremental QALY gain was 0.06, which translates to 3 weeks in best imaginable health. The EQ-5D-3L is the dominant instrument used. However, reporting of how QALY gains are estimated is generally inadequate. In 55 % of the studies there was no reference to which MAU instrument or direct valuation method QALY data came from. The methods used for estimating expected QALY gains are not transparently reported in published papers. Given the wide variation in utility scores that different methodologies may assign to an identical health state, it is important for journal editors to require a more transparent way of reporting the estimation of incremental QALY gains.","[Wisloff, Torbjorn; Hagen, Gunhild; Hamidi, Vida; Movik, Espen; Klemp, Marianne; Olsen, Jan Abel] Norwegian Knowledge Ctr Hlth Serv, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Wisloff, Torbjorn] Oslo Univ Hosp, Unit Biostat Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Wisloff, Torbjorn] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Hagen, Gunhild] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth & Gen Practice, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Klemp, Marianne] Univ Oslo, Dept Pharmacol, Oslo, Norway; [Olsen, Jan Abel] Univ Tromso, Inst Community Med, Tromso, Norway",Norwegian Knowledge Centre for Health Services; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Oslo; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Wisloff, T (通讯作者)，Norwegian Knowledge Ctr Hlth Serv, Postboks 7004 St Olavs Plass, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",twisloff@gmail.com,"Wisløff, Torbjørn/AFM-8289-2022; Klemp, Marianne/AAQ-5652-2021","Wisløff, Torbjørn/0000-0002-7539-082X; Klemp, Marianne/0000-0002-9530-8344; Hagen, Gunhild/0000-0001-7464-9652",,,,,23,121,128,2,18,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2014,32.0,4,,,,,367,375,,10.1007/s40273-014-0136-z,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AG9RP,24477679.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335757400006,0

The aim of the present study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin after a gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymph-node dissection, compared with a D2 gastrectomy alone, for patients with stage II-IIIB gastric cancer. On the basis of data from the CLASSIC trial, a Markov model was created to determine economic and clinical data for patients in the chemotherapy and surgery group (CSG) and the surgery-only group (SOG). The costs, presented in 2010 US dollars and estimated from the perspective of the Chinese health-care system, were obtained from the published literature and the local health system. The utilities were based on published literature. Costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated. A lifetime horizon and a 3 % annual discount rate were used. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. For the base case, the CSG compared with SOG would increase LYs and QALYs in a 3-, 5-, 10- or 30-year time horizon (except the QALYs at 3 or 5 years). In the short run (such as in 3 or 5 years), the medical costs would increase owing to adjuvant chemotherapy of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin after D2 gastrectomy, but in the long run the costs would decline. The ICERs suggested that the SOG was dominant at 3 or 5 years and the CSG was dominant at 10 or 30 years. The one-way sensitivity analysis showed that the utility of disease-free survival for 1-10 years for the SOG and the cost of oxaliplatin were the most influential parameters. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted a 98.6 % likelihood that the ICER for the CSG would be less than US$13,527/QALY (three times the per capita gross domestic product of China). For patients in China with resectable disease, our results suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin after a D2 gastrectomy is cost-saving and dominant in the long run on the basis of a current clinical trial, compared with treatment with a D2 gastrectomy alone.","[Tan Chongqing; Peng Liubao; Li Jianhe; Wan Xiaomin] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Dept Pharm, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Tan Chongqing; Peng Liubao; Zeng Xiaohui; Wang Siying; Ouyang Lihui; Zhao Ziying] Cent S Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Chen Gannong] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Dept Surg, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University; Central South University; Central South University,"Peng, LB (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Dept Pharm, 139 Ren Min Zhong Rd, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China.",pengliubao@126.com,"Wan, Xiaomin/GPX-4388-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81173028],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The manuscript was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81173028).

We answer this question by ranking the information relationship between a system and its components. The mutual information (M) measures dependence between the operational states of the system and a component for a mission time as well as between their life lengths. This measure ranks each component in terms of its expected utility for predicting the system's survival. We explore some relationships between the ordering of importance of components by M and by Zellner's Maximal Data Information (MDIP) criterion. For many systems the bivariate distribution of the component and system lifetimes does not have a density with respect to the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure. For these systems, M is not defined, so we use a modification of a mutual information index to cover such situations. Our results for ordering dependence are general in terms of binary structures, sum of random variables, and order statistics.","[Ebrahimi, Nader] No Illinois Univ, Div Stat, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Jalali, Nima Y.; Soofi, Ehsan S.] Univ Wisconsin, Sheldon B Lubar Sch Business, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Soofi, Ehsan S.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Soyer, Refik] George Washington Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Northern Illinois University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; George Washington University,"Soyer, R (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",soyer@gwu.edu,,,,,,,36,7,8,0,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

More data or better models by no means guarantee better estimators (e.g., with a smaller mean squared error), when you are not following probabilistically principled methods such as MLE (for large samples) or Bayesian approaches. Estimating equations are particularly vulnerable in this regard, almost a necessary price for their robustness. These points will be demonstrated via common tasks of estimating regression parameters and correlations, under simple models such as bivariate normal and ARCH(1). Some general strategies for detecting and avoiding such pitfalls are suggested, including checking for self-efficiency (Meng, 1994; Statistical Science) and adopting a guiding working model. Using the example of estimating the autocorrelation rho under a stationary AR(1) model, we also demonstrate the interaction between model assumptions and observation structures in seeking additional information, as the sampling interval s increases. Furthermore, for a given sample size, the optimal s for minimizing the asymptotic variance of (rho) over cap (MLE) is s = 1 if and only if rho(2) <= 1/3; beyond that region the optimal s increases at the rate of log(-1)(rho(-2)) as rho approaches a unit root, as does the gain in efficiency relative to using s = 1. A practical implication of this result is that the so-called non-informative Jeffreys prior can be far from non-informative even for stationary time series models, because here it converges rapidly to a point mass at a unit root as s increases. Our overall emphasis is that intuition and conventional wisdom need to be examined via critical thinking and theoretical verification before they can be trusted fully.","[Meng, Xiao-Li; Xie, Xianchao] Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Meng, XL (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, 1 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",meng@stat.harvard.edu,,,National Science Foundation; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1208799] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We thank Editor Ehsan Soofi for the invitation (and for his extraordinary patience) to contribute to this special volume in honor of Professor Arnold Zellner, who was a colleague and friend of one of us (Meng) during his Chicago years (1991-2001).

The developments have been most intensive in recent years.However, we are not aware of any comprehensive review of known estimation methods for expected shortfall.

We then specialize our analysis to credit default swaps (CDS) as underlying portfolios, and construct a numerical scheme to evaluate the adjustment under a doubly stochastic default framework. In particular, we show that for CDS contracts a perfect collateralization cannot be achieved, even under continuous collateralization, if the reference entity's and counterparty's default times are dependent.

In order to generate a human action model with the previous two features, a human action and a situation around a person are modeled as time series data expressed by Hidden Markov Model(HMM), which can model a time series data with temporal and spatial redundancy.

A new scenario of therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection is being established with the approval of two effective HCV protease inhibitors (PIs) in combination with the standard of care (SOC), peginterferon and ribavirin. Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of combination therapy with new PIs (boceprevir and telaprevir) plus peginterferon and ribavirin versus SOC in treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 according to data obtained from clinical trials (CTs). A Markov model simulating chronic HCV progression was used to estimate disease treatment costs and effects over patients' lifetimes, in the Spanish national public healthcare system. The target population was treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1, demographic characteristics for whom were obtained from the published pivotal CTs SPRINT and ADVANCE. Three options were analysed for each PI based on results from the two CTs: universal triple therapy, interleukin (IL)-28B-guided therapy and dual therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin. A univariate sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the uncertainty of certain parameters: age at start of treatment, transition probabilities, drug costs, CT efficacy results and a higher hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for patients with chronic HCV. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also carried out. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of a,not sign2012 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were used as outcome measures. According to the base-case analysis, using dual therapy as the comparator, the alternative IL28B-guided therapy presents a more favorable ICER (a,not sign18,079/QALY for boceprevir and a,not sign25,914/QALY for telaprevir) than the universal triple therapy option (a,not sign27,594/QALY for boceprevir and a,not sign33,751/QALY for telaprevir), with an ICER clearly below the efficiency threshold for medical interventions in the Spanish setting. Sensitivity analysis showed that age at the beginning of treatment was an important factor that influenced the ICER. A potential reduction in PI costs would also clearly improve the ICER, and transition probabilities influenced the results, but to a lesser extent. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that 95 % of the simulations presented an ICER below a,not sign40,000/QALY. Post hoc estimations of sustained virological responses of the IL28B-guided therapeutic option represented a limitation of the study. The therapeutic options analysed for the base-case cohort can be considered cost-effective interventions for the Spanish healthcare framework. Sensitivity analysis estimated an acceptability threshold of the IL28B-guided strategy of patients younger than 60 years.","[Blazquez-Perez, Antonio] Agencia Espanola Medicamentos & Prod Sanitarios, Dept Medicamentos Uso Humano, Madrid 28022, Spain; [San Miguel, Ramon] Complejo Hosp Navarra, Dept Pharm, Pamplona, Spain; [Mar, Javier] Hosp Alto Deba, Clin Management Serv, Arrasate Mondragon, Spain",Servicio Navarro de Salud - Osasunbidea,"Blázquez-Pérez, A (通讯作者)，Agencia Espanola Medicamentos & Prod Sanitarios, Dept Medicamentos Uso Humano, C Campezo 1 Edificio 8,Planta 2 Oeste E, Madrid 28022, Spain.",ablazquez@aemps.es,,,,,,,38,32,35,0,20,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2013,31.0,10,,,,,919,931,,10.1007/s40273-013-0080-3,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,232EN,24000086.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325473900007,0

For many institutional investors it is natural to consider investment in bonds where the time to maturity of the bonds in the portfolio is kept fixed over time. We show that the return and variance of such a portfolio of bonds which are continuously rolled over, also called rolling horizon bonds, can be expressed using the cumulant generating functions of the background driving Levy processes associated with the OU processes. This allows us to calculate the efficient mean-variance portfolio. We exemplify the results by a case study on euro swap rates. We also show that if the short rate, in a risk-neutral setting, is given by a linear combination of generalized OU processes, the implied term structure can be expressed in terms of the cumulant generating functions. This makes it possible to quite easily see what kind of term structures can be generated with a particular short rate dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

When a financial market is complete, every contingent claim can be hedged perfectly to eliminate any potential future obligations. When the financial market is incomplete, the investor may eliminate his risk exposure by superhedging. In practice, both hedging strategies are not satisfactory due to their high implementation costs, which erode the chance of making any profit. A more practical and desirable strategy is to resort to the partial hedging, which hedges the future obligation only partially. The quantile hedging of Follmer and Leukert (Finance and Stochastics, vol. 3, 1999, pp. 251-273), which maximizes the probability of a successful hedge for a given budget constraint, is an example of the partial hedging. Inspired by the principle underlying the partial hedging, this paper proposes a general partial hedging model by minimizing any desirable risk measure of the total risk exposure of an investor. By confining to the value-at-risk (VaR) measure, analytic optimal partial hedging strategies are derived. The optimal partial hedging strategy is either a knock-out call strategy or a bull call spread strategy, depending on the admissible classes of hedging strategies. Our proposed VaR-based partial hedging model has the advantage of its simplicity and robustness. The optimal hedging strategy is easy to determine. Furthermore, the structure of the optimal hedging strategy is independent of the assumed market model. This is in contrast to the quantile hedging, which is sensitive to the assumed model as well as the parameter values. Extensive numerical examples are provided to compare and contrast our proposed partial hedging to the quantile hedging.","[Cong, Jianfa; Tan, Ken Seng; Weng, Chengguo] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Tan, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",jcong@uwaterloo.ca; kstan@uwaterloo.ca; c2weng@uwaterloo.ca,,,"Waterloo Research Institute in Insurance, Securities and Quantitative Finance (WatRISQ); Global Risk Institute Financial Services; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities [11JJD790004, 11JJD790053]; Society of Actuaries Centers of Actuarial Excellence Research Grant; Global Risk Institute Financial Services Research Project; University of Waterloo Start-up Grant; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","Waterloo Research Institute in Insurance, Securities and Quantitative Finance (WatRISQ); Global Risk Institute Financial Services; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities; Society of Actuaries Centers of Actuarial Excellence Research Grant; Global Risk Institute Financial Services Research Project; University of Waterloo Start-up Grant; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","J.

The emergence of the European directive Solvency II, which promotes the development of internal risk models (among which a complete unit is dedicated to surrender risk management), strengthens the necessity to deeply study and understand this risk. In this paper, we investigate the topics of segmenting and modelling surrenders in order to better take into account the main risk factors impacting policyholders' decisions. We find that several complex aspects must be specifically dealt with to predict surrenders, in particular the heterogeneity of behaviour as well as the context faced by the insured.

J,"Pichler, A",,,,"Pichler, Alois",,,The natural Banach space for version independent risk measures,INSURANCE MATHEMATICS & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Risk measures; Rearrangement inequalities; Stochastic dominance; Dual representation,REPRESENTATION,"Risk measures, or coherent measures of risk, are often considered on the space L-infinity, and important theorems on risk measures build on that space. Other risk measures, among them the most important risk measure - the Average Value-at-Risk - are well defined on the larger space L-1 and this seems to be the natural domain space for this risk measure. Spectral risk measures constitute a further class of risk measures of central importance, and they are often considered on some L-P space. But in many situations this is possibly unnatural, because any L-P with p > p(0), say, is suitable to define the spectral risk measure as well. In addition to that, risk measures have also been considered on Orlicz and Zygmund spaces. So it remains for discussion and clarification, what the natural domain to consider a risk measure is? This paper introduces a norm, which is built from the risk measure, and a new Banach space, which carries the risk measure in a natural way.

In this paper, we construct very accurate approximations of such performance measures that provide small absolute and relative errors. Motivated by statistical analysis, we assume that the claim sizes are a mixture of a phase-type and a heavy-tailed distribution and with the aid of perturbation analysis we derive a series expansion for the performance measure under consideration. Our proposed approximations consist of the first two terms of this series expansion, where the first term is a phase-type approximation of our measure. We refer to our approximations collectively as corrected phase-type approximations. We show that the corrected phase-type approximations exhibit a nice behavior both in finite and infinite time horizon, and we check their accuracy through numerical experiments.

We present in this context a new primal-dual linear Monte Carlo algorithm that allows for efficient simulation of the lower and upper price bounds without using nested simulations (hence the terminology). The algorithm is essentially an extension of the primal-dual Monte Carlo algorithm for standard Bermudan options proposed by Schoenmakers et al. [SIAM J. Finance Math., 2013, 4, 86-116] to the case of multiple exercise rights. In particular, the algorithm constructs upwardly a system of dual martingales to be plugged into the dual representation of Schoenmakers. At each level, the respective martingale is constructed via a backward regression procedure starting at the last exercise date. The thus constructed martingales are finally used to compute an upper price bound. The algorithm also provides approximate continuation functions that may be used to construct a price lower bound. The algorithm is applied to the pricing of flexible caps in a Hull and White model setup. The simple model choice allows for comparison of the computed price bounds with the exact price obtained by means of a trinomial tree implementation. As a result, we obtain tight price bounds for the considered application. Moreover, the algorithm is generically designed for multi-dimensional problems and is tractable to implement.","[Balder, Sven; Mahayni, Antje] Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany; [Schoenmakers, John] Weierstrass Inst Appl Anal & Stochast, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis & Stochastics,"Schoenmakers, J (通讯作者)，Weierstrass Inst Appl Anal & Stochast, Mohrenstr 39, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",schoenma@wias-berlin.de,,,DFG Research Center MATHEON Mathematics for Key Technologies in Berlin,DFG Research Center MATHEON Mathematics for Key Technologies in Berlin(German Research Foundation (DFG)),J.

The outside option is not only a disagreement point, but reveals information privately held by the long-run player. In equilibrium, the uninformed short-run players' offers do not always respond to changes in reputation and the informed long-run player's payoffs are discontinuous. The long-run player invokes inefficient random outside options repeatedly to build reputation to a level where the subsequent short-run players succumb to his extraction of a larger payoff, but he also runs the risk of losing reputation and relinquishing bargaining power. We investigate equilibrium properties when the discount factor goes to 1 and when the informativeness of outside options diffuses. In both cases, bargaining outcomes become more inefficient and the limit reputation-building probabilities are interior.","[Lee, Jihong] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151746, South Korea; [Liu, Qingmin] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); Columbia University,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151746, South Korea.",jihonglee@snu.ac.kr; qingmin.liu@columbia.edu,"刘庆敏, Liu qingmin/AAQ-9255-2020",,National Research Foundation; Korean government [NRF-2011-330-B00063],National Research Foundation; Korean government(Korean Government),"The authors are grateful to a co-editor and the anonymous referees for their insightful suggestions.

Nowadays, there is a leap of literature on the optimal dividend problem. However, most of the literature focus on linear insurance risk processes which fail to take into account some realistic features such as the nonlinear effect on the insurance risk processes. In this paper, we articulate this problem and consider an optimal dividend problem with nonlinear insurance risk processes attributed to internal competition factors. We also incorporate other important features such as the presence of debts, constraints in regular control variables, fixed transaction costs and proportional taxes. This poses some theoretical challenges as the problem becomes a nonlinear regular-impulse control problem. Under some suitable hypotheses for the value function, we obtain the structure of the value function using its properties, without guessing its structure, which is widely used in the literature. By solving the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, closed-form solutions to the problem are obtained in various cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The assumption of non-Gaussianity is needed for reasons of identifiability. Assuming that the error distribution belongs to a fairly general class of elliptical distributions, we develop an asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation and statistical inference. We argue that allowing for noncausality is of particular importance in economic applications that currently use only conventional causal VAR models. Indeed, if noncausality is incorrectly ignored, the use of a causal VAR model may yield suboptimal forecasts and misleading economic inter-pretations. Therefore, we propose a procedure for discriminating between causality and noncausality.

We show that the fixed-b limits depend on nuisance parameters in a complicated way. These nonpivotal limits provide an alternative theoretical explanation for the well-known finite-sample problems of the PP tests. We also show that the fixed-b limits depend on whether deterministic trends are removed using one-step or two-step detrending approaches. This is in contrast to the asymptotic equivalence of the one-and two-step approaches under a consistency approximation for the long-run variance estimator. Based on these results we introduce modified PP tests that allow for asymptotically pivotal fixed-b inference. The theoretical analysis is cast in the framework of near-integrated processes, which allows us to study the asymptotic behavior both under the unit root null hypothesis and for local alternatives. The performance of the original and modified PP tests is compared by means of local asymptotic power and a small finite-sample simulation study.","[Vogelsang, Timothy J.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Wagner, Martin] Inst Adv Studies, Vienna, Austria; [Wagner, Martin] Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway",Michigan State University,"Vogelsang, TJ (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, 486 W Circle Dr,110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48224 USA.",tjv@msu.edu,,"Wagner, Martin/0000-0002-6123-4797",Jubilaumsfonds of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank [13398],Jubilaumsfonds of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank,"The authors thank a co-editor (A.M.

Using a stochastic model of the bid stack, we translate the demand for power and the prices of generating fuels into electricity spot prices. The stack structure allows for a range of generator efficiencies per fuel type and for the possibility of future changes in the merit order of the fuels. The derived spot price process captures important stylized facts of historical electricity prices, including both spikes and the complex dependence upon its underlying supply and demand drivers. Furthermore, under mild and commonly used assumptions on the distributions of the input factors, we obtain closed-form formulae for electricity forward contracts and for spark and dark spread options. As merit order dynamics and fuel forward prices are embedded into the model, we capture a much richer and more realistic dependence structure than can be achieved by classical reduced-form models. We illustrate these advantages by comparing with Margrabe's formula and a simple cointegration model, and highlight important implications for the valuation of power plants.","[Carmona, Rene; Coulon, Michael] Princeton Univ, ORFE Dept, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Schwarz, Daniel] Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst, Oxford OX2 6ED, England",Princeton University; University of Oxford,"Coulon, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, ORFE Dept, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",mcoulon@princeton.edu; rcarmona@princeton.edu; schwarz@maths.ox.ac.uk,,"Schwarz, Daniel/0000-0002-5898-0932",Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1211928] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),,,32,37,39,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

Our model is an extension of Davis and Lo's infectious default model. We consider an economy of n firms that may default directly or may be infected by other defaulting firms (a domino effect also being possible). Spontaneous defaults without external influence and infection are described by not necessarily independent Bernoulli-type random variables. Moreover, several sources of contamination could be required to infect another firm. In this paper we compute the probability distribution function of the total number of defaults in a dependency context. We also give a simple recursive algorithm to compute this distribution in an exchangeability context. Numerical applications illustrate the impact of exchangeability among direct defaults and among contaminations, on different indicators calculated from the law of the total number of defaults. We then calibrate the model on iTraxx data before and during the crisis. The dynamic feature together with the contagion effect have a significant impact on the model performance, especially during the recent distressed period.","[Cousin, Areski; Dorobantu, Diana; Rulliere, Didier] Univ Lyon 1, Lab SAF, EA 2429, Inst Sci Financiere & Assurances, F-69007 Lyon, France",Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1,"Rullière, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 1, Lab SAF, EA 2429, Inst Sci Financiere & Assurances, 50 Ave Tony Garnier, F-69007 Lyon, France.",didier.rulliere@univ-lyon1.fr,,,ANR [ANR-08-BLAN-0314-01]; Bnp Paribas Cardif 'chaire d'excellence Management de la Modelisation'; MIRACCLE-GICC project,ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Bnp Paribas Cardif 'chaire d'excellence Management de la Modelisation'; MIRACCLE-GICC project,This work was funded by ANR Research Project ANR-08-BLAN-0314-01.

We also discuss two methods of estimating an asset pricing model with a disequilibrium price adjustment effect. Finally, using price per share, dividend per share, and shares outstanding, we empirically test the existence of a price disequilibrium adjustment process with international index data and U.S. equity data. We find that a disequilibrium price adjustment process does, in fact, exist in our empirical data. Our results support the finding of Lo and Wang [Rev.

Methods Published VOI studies were identified by conducting a computerized search on Scopus and ISI Web of Science from 1980 until December 2011 using pre-specified search terms. Only full-text papers that outlined and discussed VOI methods for medical decision making, and studies that applied VOI and explicitly discussed the results with a view to informing healthcare decision makers, were included. The included papers were divided into methodological and applied papers, based on the aim of the study. Results A total of 118 papers were included of which 50 % (n = 59) are methodological. A rapidly accumulating literature base on VOI from 1999 onwards for methodological papers and from 2005 onwards for applied papers is observed. Expected value of sample information (EVSI) is the preferred method of VOI to inform decision making regarding specific future studies, but real-life applications of EVSI remain scarce. Methodological challenges to VOI are numerous and include the high computational demands, dealing with non-linear models and interdependency between parameters, estimations of effective time horizons and patient populations, and structural uncertainties. Conclusion VOI analysis receives increasing attention in both the methodological and the applied literature bases, but challenges to applying VOI in real-life decision making remain. For many technical and methodological challenges to VOI analytic solutions have been proposed in the literature, including leaner methods for VOI. Further research should also focus on the needs of decision makers regarding VOI.","[Steuten, Lotte; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Karin] Univ Twente, Dept Hlth Technol & Serv Res, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [van de Wetering, Gijs] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Hlth Technol Assessment, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Retel, Valesca] Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hosp, Netherlands Canc Inst, Dept Psychosocial Res & Epidemiol, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Twente; Radboud University Nijmegen; Netherlands Cancer Institute,"Steuten, L (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Dept Hlth Technol & Serv Res, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",l.m.g.steuten@utwente.nl,,"Retel, Valesca/0000-0002-5624-3234; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina/0000-0002-4875-5379; Steuten, Lotte M/0000-0002-5688-236X",,,,,152,54,59,1,38,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2013,31.0,1,,,,,25,48,,10.1007/s40273-012-0008-3,0.0,,,24,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,138TT,23329591.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318533600004,0

In some jurisdictions such as the UK and Canada, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to submit economic evaluations when seeking reimbursement. Objectives Our objectives were to describe the role of economic evidence in the cancer drug review process in Canada, and to investigate the nature of problems encountered in the review and interpretation of economic evidence used in the process. Design We conducted a retrospective review of cancer drug review meeting minutes and reviewers' comments on pharmacoeconomic studies submitted to the oncology drug review process in Canada. Data Sources We used pharmacoeconomic reviewers' reports and relevant cancer drug review expert advisory committee meeting minutes during the first year of the review process (April 2007 to March 2008). Results Fifteen economic submissions were reviewed. One-third of the studies had flaws significant enough that the advisory committee could not determine the cost effectiveness of the drugs from the results. The common issues outlined by the reviewers and committee were related to the uncertainty of comparative clinical benefits, quality of life and costs. The reviewers felt that few analyses provided sufficient sensitivity analyses around key variables to assess the robustness of results. Most problems identified by reviewers are simple to fix and do not involve advanced methods. Conclusions Canada has a separate review process for making cancer drug funding recommendations, and this process uses both clinical and economic evidence. The committee could not determine the value for money of the drugs from several of the submitted pharmacoeconomic analyses. Transparent analyses and detailed critique of evidence are crucial to the use of economic evidence in reimbursement decisions. Rigorous evaluation is resource intensive and may benefit from a shared drug review process among several jurisdictions.","[Yong, Jean H.

The model assumes that different types of claims arrive according to a Marked Markovian arrival process (MMAP) introduced by He and Neuts (1998) in the queuing literature. This approach enables us to allow dependencies among the claim frequencies, and among the claim sizes, as well as between claim frequencies and claim sizes. This model extends the (univariate) Markov modulated risk processes (sometimes referred to as regime switching models) widely used in insurance and financial analysis. For the proposed model, we provide formulas for calculating the joint moments of the present value of aggregate claims occurring in any time interval (0. t].

The payment depends on the price of a stock at that time and possibly also on the history of the stock price. lithe payment turns out to be the payoff of an option, we call the contract for the payment a (life) contingent option. Because each time-until-death distribution can be approximated by a combination of exponential distributions, the analysis is made for the case where the time until death is exponentially distributed, i.e., under the assumption of a constant force of mortality. The time-until-death random variable is assumed to be independent of the stock price process which is a geometric Brownian motion. Our key tool is a discounted joint density function. A substantial series of closed-form formulas is obtained, for the contingent call and put options, for lookback options, for barrier options, for dynamic fund protection, and for dynamic withdrawal benefits. In a section on several stocks, the method of Esscher transforms proves to be useful for finding among others an explicit result for valuing contingent Margrabe options or exchange options. For the case where the contracts have a finite expiry date, closed-form formulas are found for the contingent call and put options. From these, results for De Moivre's law are obtained as limits. We also discuss equity-linked death benefit reserves and investment strategies for maintaining such reserves. The elasticity of the reserve with respect to the stock price plays an important role. Whereas in the most important applications the stopping time is the time of death, it could be different in other applications, for example, the time of the next catastrophe. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, we obtain characterizations of the egalitarian value, which assigns to each player an equal share over an individual utility level.

The main feature of this model is its ability to replicate the changes of regimes observed in the mortality evolution. Changes of measure, preserving the dynamics of the mortality process under a pricing measure, are also studied. After a review of the calibration method, a 2D, 2-regimes model is fitted to the male and female French population, for the period 1946-2007. Our analysis reveals that one regime corresponds to longevity conditions observed during the decade following the second world war, while the second regime is related to longevity improvements observed during the last 30 years. To conclude, we analyze, in a numerical application, the influence of changes of measure affecting transition probabilities, on prices of life and death insurances. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed test is applicable to both univariate and multivariate time series with discrete or continuous distributions. Simulation studies show that with the use of a smoothed nonparametric transition density-based bootstrap procedure, the proposed test has reasonable sizes and all-around power against several popular non-Markov alternatives in finite samples.

Since then, due to substantial increases in market prices of systemic credit risk protection, more attention has been paid to recovery rate assumptions. In this paper, we use stochastic orders theory to assess the impact of recovery on CDOs and show that, in a factor copula framework, a decrease of recovery rates leads to an increase of the expected loss on senior tranches, even though the expected loss on the portfolio is kept fixed. This result applies to a wide range of latent factor models and is not specific to the Gaussian copula model. We then suggest introducing stochastic recovery rates in such a way that the conditional on the factor expected loss (or, equivalently, the large portfolio approximation) is the same as in the recovery markdown case. However, granular portfolios behave differently. We show that a markdown is associated with riskier portfolios than when using the stochastic recovery rate framework. As a consequence, the expected loss on a senior tranche is larger in the former case, whatever the attachment point. We also deal with implementation and numerical issues related to the pricing of CDOs within the stochastic recovery rate framework. Due to differences across names regarding the conditional (on the factor) losses given default, the standard recursion approach becomes problematic. We suggest approximating the conditional on the factor loss distributions, through expansions around some base distribution. Finally, we show that the independence and comonotonic cases provide some easy to compute bounds on expected losses of senior or equity tranches.","[Laurent, Jean-Paul] Univ Paris 01, PRISM, F-75005 Paris, France; [Laurent, Jean-Paul] Univ Paris 01, Labex Refi, F-75005 Paris, France; [Amraoui, Salah; Cousot, Laurent; Hitier, Sebastien] BNP Paribas, Dept Fixed Income, London, England",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; BNP Paribas,"Laurent, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, PRISM, 17 Rue Sorbonne, F-75005 Paris, France.",laurent.jeanpaul@free.fr,,"Laurent, Jean-Paul/0000-0001-9463-7464",BNP Paribas Cardiff chair 'Management de la Modelisation',BNP Paribas Cardiff chair 'Management de la Modelisation',"The authors thank the two referees, Xavier Burtschell, Laurent Carlier, Pierre Miralles, and Thierry Rehmann for numerous and helpful comments.

We show that when the shorter-run self is not completely myopic, this excess sensitivity goes away. To accommodate the combination of short time periods and convex costs of self-control, we introduce a cognitive resource variable that tracks how the control cost depends on the self-control that has been used in the recent past. We consider models with both linear and convex control costs, illustrating the theory through a series of examples. We examine when opportunities to consume will be avoided or delayed, and we consider the way in which the marginal interest declines with delay.","[Fudenberg, Drew] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 310, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Levine, David K.] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Harvard University; Washington University (WUSTL),"Fudenberg, D (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 310, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dfudenberg@harvard.edu; david@dklevine.com,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0951462, 0851315] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,36,67,77,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2012,80.0,1,,,,,1,42,,10.3982/ECTA9655,0.0,,,42,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,874KZ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000298957400001,0

However, there is little evidence about the relationship between medication adherence, outcomes and costs once controller therapy is initiated. Objective: This study examined the relationship between adherence to two commonly prescribed anti-inflammatory medications, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene inhibitors (LI), and healthcare utilization and expenditures among children enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program in Florida and Texas in the US. Methods: The sample for this retrospective observational study consisted of 18 456 children aged 2-18 years diagnosed with asthma, who had been continuously enrolled for 24 months during 2004-7 and were on monotherapy with ICS or LI. State administrative enrolment files were linked to medical claims data. Children were grouped into three adherence categories based on the percentage of days per year they had prescriptions filled (medication possession ratio). Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses that adjusted for the children's demographic and health characteristics were used to examine the relationship between adherence and ED visits, hospitalizations, and expenditures. Results: Average adherence was 20% for ICS-treated children and 28% for LI-treated children. Children in the highest adherence category had lower odds of an ED visit than those in the lowest adherence category (p < 0.001). We did not detect a statistically significant relationship between adherence and hospitalizations; however, only 3.7% of children had an asthma-related hospitalization. Overall asthma care expenditures increased with greater medication adherence. Conclusions: Although greater adherence was associated with lower rates of ED visits, higher medication expenditures outweighed the savings. The overall low adherence rates suggest that quality improvement initiatives should continue to target adherence regardless of the class of medication used. However, low baseline hospitalization rates may leave little opportunity to significantly decrease costs through better disease management, without also decreasing medication costs.","[Herndon, Jill Boylston; Shenkman, Elizabeth A.] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Inst Child Hlth Policy, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Herndon, Jill Boylston; Shenkman, Elizabeth A.] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Hlth Outcomes & Policy, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Mattke, Soeren] RAND Corp, Boston, MA USA; [Cuellar, Alison Evans] RAND Corp, Washington, DC USA; [Cuellar, Alison Evans] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Hong, Seo Yeon] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; RAND Corporation; RAND Corporation; George Mason University; RAND Corporation,"Herndon, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Coll Med, Inst Child Hlth Policy, POB 100147, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",,"Cuellar, Alison Evans/U-7984-2017","Cuellar, Alison Evans/0000-0001-6702-7601; Shenkman, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4903-1804; Herndon, Jill/0000-0003-4517-3776","Merck Childhood Asthma Network, Inc., Washington, DC, USA","Merck Childhood Asthma Network, Inc., Washington, DC, USA","The study was supported by the Merck Childhood Asthma Network, Inc., Washington, DC, USA.

These special considerations include the role of parent/caregiver as joint decision maker and co-participant in many types of interventions, how the effectiveness of an intervention varies by age and developmental stage, and the difficulties in translating short-term data from childhood into projected effectiveness over the lifespan. Each aspect of comparative effectiveness, such as conducting new studies, synthesizing existing evidence, emphasizing real-world settings, considering multiple decision makers, and measuring patient-relevant outcomes, will require expanded definitions when considered in the context of child health. This paper discusses how comparative effectiveness methods and concepts will differ when applied to child health and suggests a potential role for decision analysis as a method to synthesize data and project long-term outcomes. The initiation of comparative effectiveness studies for children represents an exciting opportunity to provide evidence that can guide clinical and policy decisions for child health.","[Prosser, Lisa A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Div Gen Pediat, Child Hlth Evaluat & Res Unit, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Prosser, Lisa A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Prosser, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan Hlth Syst, Div Gen Pediat, Child Hlth Evaluat & Res Unit, 300 N Ingalls St,Room 6E14,SPC 5456, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lisapros@med.umich.edu,,,,,,,42,7,8,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,8,,,,,637,645,,10.2165/11633830-000000000-00000,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,982HI,22788256.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307033300002,0

Under-treatment with oral anticoagulants has been a significant challenge of treatment, historically related to patient concerns over the safety and convenience of warfarin, which until recently was the only oral anticoagulant available. The aim of this study is to examine: (1) patient preferences for attributes of warfarin and the new oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) in AF; (2) which attributes are most important; and (3) whether current under-treatment is likely to improve with the new oral anticoagulants. This study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia, with members of the general public with or without AF aged a parts per thousand yen40 years, where those without AF proxy for newly-diagnosed patients. Participants completed a computerised best-best discrete choice experiment (and follow-up interview) as if they had AF with a moderate-to-high risk of stroke. Choice data were modelled using mixed rank-ordered logit. Relative value was explored via estimation of marginal rates of substitution with predicted probability analysis used to simulate potential uptake of oral anticoagulants. Seventy-six participants were recruited and completed the study. Efficacy (stroke risk) was more important than safety (bleed risk, antidote), which were both considerably more important than convenience factors (blood tests, dose frequency, drug or food interactions). Cost was also important. Predicted use of the new oral anticoagulants (and under-treatment of AF) using simulation, given moderate-to-high risk of stroke, is 25 % (52 %), 54 % (29 %) and 70 % (21 %) assuming a market price of AUD$120/month, AUD$30/month (subsidised price) and AUD$30/month with an antidote, respectively. Based on the study sample and the modelled attributes, the overall profiles of the new oral anticoagulants were preferred to warfarin as their cost decreased. Public subsidisation and the development of antidotes (such as vitamin K for warfarin) for the new oral anticoagulants may have a positive effect on the under-treatment of AF.","[Ghijben, Peter; Lancsar, Emily; Zavarsek, Silva] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Ghijben, P (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",peter.ghijben@monash.edu,,"Ghijben, Peter/0000-0002-7532-7847; Zavarsek, Silva/0000-0002-7898-1406; Lancsar, Emily/0000-0003-2404-6735","Centre for Health Economics, Monash University; Medical Research Council [G0902066] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0902066] Funding Source: UKRI","Centre for Health Economics, Monash University; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This study was funded by the Centre for Health Economics, Monash University.

Both the firm and the manager have exponential utility and can trade in a frictionless market. When the firm observes the manager's choice of effort and volatility, there is an optimal contract that induces the manager to not hedge. In a two factor specification of the model where an index and a bond are traded, the optimal contract is linear in output and the log return of the index. We also consider a manager who receives exogenous share or option compensation and illustrate how risk taking depends on the relative size of the systematic and firm-specific risk premia of the output and index. Whilst in most cases, options induce greater risk taking than shares, we find that there are also situations under which the hedging manager may take less risk than the non-hedging manager.","[Cvitanic, Jaksa] CALTECH, Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Henderson, Vicky] Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Henderson, Vicky] Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst, Oxford OX2 6ED, England; [Lazrak, Ali] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",California Institute of Technology; University of Warwick; University of Oxford; University of British Columbia,"Lazrak, A (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",cvitanic@hss.caltech.edu; Vicky.Henderson@warwick.ac.uk; Ali.lazrak@sauder.ubc.ca,,,Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1008219] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),,,25,2,4,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

J,"Chambers, JD",,,,"Chambers, James D.",,,Do Changes in Drug Coverage Policy Point to an Increased Role for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in the USA?,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HEALTH-CARE; MEDICARE; MEDICINE,"Compared with other countries, cost-effectiveness analysis has traditionally had a limited role in US health care. Rather, US payers have typically accommodated the introduction of expensive technology by passing an increasing proportion of costs to patients, through raising insurance premiums and/or by increasing copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. However, in what may prove to be a tipping point, the two largest pharmacy benefit managers have chosen to exclude drugs from their formularies that offer uncertain health benefit compared with cheaper alternatives. This paper argues that cost-effectiveness analysis should be used to inform these value-based decisions, and that by using information other than robust cost-effectiveness evidence, payers risk wrongly denying beneficiaries access to important medical technologies. If cost-effectiveness analysis were to be used in this way, it would be another in a growing number of examples of its use across public and private payers. In the absence of a centralized agency conducting cost-effectiveness analysis, the recently inaugurated 2nd Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine has an important role to play in standardizing methods and promoting best practice.","Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Tufts Medical Center,"Chambers, JD (通讯作者)，Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",JChambers@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,,,,,,,41,13,15,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2014,32.0,8,,,,,729,733,,10.1007/s40273-014-0166-6,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0KX,24859242.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344626100002,0

The financial component of the policies is described using the time dependent Black Scholes model and making a suitable choice for its time dependent parameter functions. Specifically, the integral of the time dependent risk free interest rate is modeled using an extension of the Nelson and Siegel yield curve (see Dielbold and Li, 2006). The time dependent volatility is expressed using two different models. One of these is based on an extension of the Nelson and Siegel model (Dielbold and Li, 2006), while the other assumes that the volatility is a piecewise function with respect to the time variable. The demographic component is modeled using a generalization of the geometric Brownian mean reverting Gompertz model while an asymptotic formula for survival probability is derived when the mortality risk volatility is small. The method has been tested on two policies. In these the risk free interest rate parameters are calibrated using the one-month, three-month, six-month, one-year, three-year and five-year US treasury constant maturity yields and the parameters of the volatility are calibrated using the VSTOXX volatility indices. The choice of the data employed in the calibration depends on the policy to be evaluated. The performance of the method is established comparing the observed values of the policies with the values obtained using this method. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Cohort-based state transition models are most common, though discrete event simulation (DES) is increasingly being used to implement more complex model structures. The benefits of DES relate to the greater flexibility around the implementation and population of complex models, which may provide more accurate or valid estimates of the incremental costs and benefits of alternative health technologies. The costs of DES relate to the time and expertise required to implement and review complex models, when perhaps a simpler model would suffice. The costs are not borne solely by the analyst, but also by reviewers. In particular, modelled economic evaluations are often submitted to support reimbursement decisions for new technologies, for which detailed model reviews are generally undertaken on behalf of the funding body. This paper reports the results from a review of published DES-based economic evaluations. Factors underlying the use of DES were defined, and the characteristics of applied models were considered, to inform options for assessing the potential benefits of DES in relation to each factor. Four broad factors underlying the use of DES were identified: baseline heterogeneity, continuous disease markers, time varying event rates, and the influence of prior events on subsequent event rates. If relevant, individual-level data are available, representation of the four factors is likely to improve model validity, and it is possible to assess the importance of their representation in individual cases. A thorough model performance evaluation is required to overcome the costs of DES from the users' perspective, but few of the reviewed DES models reported such a process. More generally, further direct, empirical comparisons of complex models with simpler models would better inform the benefits of DES to implement more complex models, and the circumstances in which such benefits are most likely.","[Karnon, Jonathan; Afzali, Hossein Haji Ali] Univ Adelaide, Sch Populat Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Karnon, J (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Populat Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",jonathan.karnon@adelaide.edu.au,,"Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099; Hajiali Afzali, Hossein/0000-0002-0198-8394",,,,,59,46,49,1,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2014,32.0,6,,,,,547,558,,10.1007/s40273-014-0147-9,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AT0KN,24627341.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344625200004,0

We compare them to full insurance and exogenously incomplete financial regimes (autarky, saving only, borrowing and lending in a single asset). We develop computational methods based on mechanism design, linear programming, and maximum likelihood to estimate, compare, and statistically test these alternative dynamic models with financial/information constraints. Our methods can use both cross-sectional and panel data and allow for measurement error and unobserved heterogeneity. We estimate the models using data on Thai households running small businesses from two separate samples. We find that in the rural sample, the exogenously incomplete saving only and borrowing regimes provide the best fit using data on consumption, business assets, investment, and income. Family and other networks help consumption smoothing there, as in a moral hazard constrained regime. In contrast, in urban areas, we find mechanism design financial/information regimes that are decidedly less constrained, with the moral hazard model fitting best combined business and consumption data. We perform numerous robustness checks in both the Thai data and in Monte Carlo simulations and compare our maximum likelihood criterion with results from other metrics and data not used in the estimation. A prototypical counterfactual policy evaluation exercise using the estimation results is also featured.","[Karaivanov, Alexander] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Townsend, Robert M.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Simon Fraser University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Karaivanov, A (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",akaraiva@sfu.ca; rtownsen@mit.edu,"Karaivanov, Alexander/AAX-4761-2021","Karaivanov, Alexander/0000-0002-5184-3126",NSF; NICHD; SSHRC; John Templeton Foundation; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); John Templeton Foundation; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"We are grateful to the co-editor, J.-M.

Such CIs are asymptotically valid when the true model has an autoregressive root that is local to unity (rho = 1 + c/n), but are shown here to be invalid at the limits of the domain of definition of the localizing coefficient c because of a failure in tightness and the escape of probability mass. Failure at the boundary implies that these CIs have zero asymptotic coverage probability in the stationary case and vicinities of unity that are wider than O(n(-1/3)). The inversion methods of Hansen (1999) and Mikusheva (2007) are asymptotically valid in such cases. Implications of these results for predictive regression tests are explored. When the predictive regressor is stationary, the popular Campbell and Yogo (2006) CIs for the regression coefficient have zero coverage probability asymptotically, and their predictive test statistic Q erroneously indicates predictability with probability approaching unity when the null of no predictability holds. These results have obvious cautionary implications for the use of the procedures in empirical practice.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Data were extracted on the objective of the study, methods employed, and decision makers' and study authors' reflections on the advantages and disadvantages of the methods. The recent interest in MCDA in healthcare is mirrored in an increase in the application of MCDA to evaluate healthcare interventions. Of the studies identified, the first was published in 1990, but more than half were published since 2011. They were undertaken in 18 different countries, and were designed to support investment (coverage and reimbursement), authorization, prescription, and research funding allocation decisions. Many intervention types were assessed: pharmaceuticals, public health interventions, screening, surgical interventions, and devices. Most used the value measurement approach and scored performance using predefined scales. Beyond these similarities, a diversity of different approaches were adopted, with only limited correspondence between the approach and the type of decision or product.

As opposed to many contributions where this correlation is assumed to be null, this framework allows one to describe the leverage effect widely observed in equity markets. The resulting model is non-exponential and driven by a degenerate noise, thus requiring a high level of care in designing the estimation algorithm. The way this difficulty is overcome provides guidelines concerning the development of an estimation algorithm in a non-standard framework. The authors propose using a block-type expectation maximization algorithm along with particle smoothing. This method results in an accurate calibration process able to identify up to three timescale factors. Furthermore, we introduce an intuitive heuristic which can be used to choose the number of factors.","[Dubarry, Cyrille; Douc, Randal] Telecom SudParis CITI, Evry, France",,"Dubarry, C (通讯作者)，Telecom SudParis CITI, Evry, France.",cyrille.dubarry@it-sudparis.eu,,"douc, randal/0000-0003-3910-9495",,,,,19,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Since the basic idea of the three-point covariance is based on conditional quantiles, we also provide two alternative procedures for finding approximated estimations in practical applications.

In both trials, progression-free survival was increased in the R-FC treatment groups compared with the FC treatment groups. In CLL-8, overall survival was also significantly increased. To develop an economic model to assess the cost effectiveness, from the Australian healthcare perspective, of rituximab when used as a treatment for both previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. A Markov model with three health states (unprogressed, progressed and death) was developed to extrapolate the trial results over a 15-year time horizon. A treatment algorithm was developed with Australian haematologists to inform the treatments to be modelled. The base-case compares up to three courses of six cycles of R-FC ('first-line' treatment) followed by three courses of post-progression salvage ('Salvage') treatment (including rituximab) with three courses of FC followed by three courses of Salvage treatment (excluding rituximab). Subsequent treatments are incorporated into the model by repeating the unprogressed and progressed health states for each treatment. Time-dependent transition probabilities for the model were estimated from an analysis of individual patient data from CLL-8 and REACH. Comparisons of the hazard rates for the CLL-8 and REACH trials enabled an assessment of the impact on the transitions of receiving the same regimen as the first or second treatment, and hence inform assumptions regarding transitions for third and subsequent treatments. Costs applied in the model were based on published Australian prices in 2009. The model predicts patients receive an average of approximately two courses of treatment, and the addition of rituximab results in an incremental gain of 0.94 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost associated with the addition of rituximab is A$40,268, and hence the cost per QALY gained (QALYG) is A$42,906. Rituximab, in combination with chemotherapy, when used multiple times throughout the treatment algorithm, appears to be cost effective for CLL from the Australian healthcare perspective, with a cost/QALYG within the range generally accepted as providing value.","[Adena, Michael] Datalyt Pty Ltd, Bruce, ACT, Australia; [Houltram, Jennifer] Covance, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Mulligan, Stephen P.] Royal N Shore Hosp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Todd, Carlene; Malanos, Grace] Roche Prod Pty Ltd, Dee Why, NSW 2099, Australia",University of Sydney; Royal North Shore Hospital; Roche Holding,"Todd, C (通讯作者)，Roche Prod Pty Ltd, 4-10 Inman Rd, Dee Why, NSW 2099, Australia.",carlene.todd@roche.com,,,Roche Products Pty Limited (Australia),Roche Products Pty Limited (Australia),"This study was funded by Roche Products Pty Limited (Australia).

However, the US shortage of propofol necessitated the use of alternative agents. This study sought to evaluate clinical and economic implications of substituting dexmedetomidine for propofol in patients undergoing CABG surgery. This was a retrospective cohort study. Patients undergoing isolated, elective CABG surgery and sedated with either propofol or dexmedetomidine during the study period were included. The cohorts were matched 1:1 based on important characteristics. The primary outcome was the number of patients achieving a post-operative duration of mechanical ventilation a parts per thousand currency sign6 h. Secondary outcomes were post-operative intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) a parts per thousand currency sign48 h, total post-operative LOS a parts per thousand currency sign5 days, the need for adjunctive opioid therapy and associated cost savings. Variables recorded included patient demographics, co-morbid medical conditions, health risks, sedation drug doses, post-operative medical complications and sedation-related adverse events. Univariate and multivariate analyses were completed to examine the relationship between these covariates and post-operative LOS. The cost analysis consisted of examination of the net financial benefit (or cost) of choosing dexmedetomidine versus propofol in the study population, with utilisation observed in the study converted to costs using institutional data from the Premier database. Eighty-four patients were included, with 42 patients per cohort. Mechanical ventilation duration a parts per thousand currency sign6 h was achieved in 24 (57.1 %) versus 7 (16.7 %) in the dexmedetomidine and propofol cohorts, respectively (p < 0.001). More patients treated with dexmedetomidine achieved ICU LOS a parts per thousand currency sign48 h (p < 0.05) and total hospital LOS a parts per thousand currency sign5 days (p < 0.05), as compared with the propofol group. Multivariate analysis revealed that having one or more post-operative medical complication was the most significant predictor of increased post-operative LOS, whereas choosing dexmedetomidine was also significant in terms of reduced post-operative LOS. The estimated net financial benefit of choosing dexmedetomidine versus propofol was US$2,613 per patient (year 2012 value). Findings suggest that use of dexmedetomidine as an alternative to propofol for sedation of CABG patients post-operatively contributes to reduced mechanical ventilation time, ICU LOS and post-operative LOS. Higher drug costs resulting from the propofol shortage were offset by savings in post-operative room and board costs. Additional savings may be possible by preventing medical complications to the extent possible.","[Thoma, Brandi N.; Li, Julius; McDaniel, Cara M.; Wordell, Cindy J.] Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Cavarocchi, Nicholas] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Jefferson Med Coll, Dept Surg, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Pizzi, Laura T.] Jefferson Sch Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice, Philadelphia, PA USA",Jefferson University; Jefferson University,"Thoma, BN (通讯作者)，Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, 111 South 11th St,Suite 2260, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",brandi.thoma@jeffersonhospital.org,,,,,,,19,24,27,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2014,32.0,2,,,,,149,157,,10.1007/s40273-013-0116-8,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AA3GR,24254138.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330981400004,0

Function autocorrelation is employed to analyze trends and other possible data periodicities. We use ARIMA models to predict type or exponential smoothing as serial or no correlation exists. The estimate is based on daily data from January 2006 to September 2013. The models are validated by obtaining predictions for the observed period through analysis of errors. For these data exponential smoothing models are more suitable for forecasting the ARIMA type, since trends or changes in the means of the observed values, are stabilized by taking differences, and no residual homoscedasticity is achieved. Despite being well known for its simplicity and accessibility models provide sufficiently reliable estimates for the future value data analyzed.","[Casado-Sanchez, Jose-Luis; Gonzalez Garcia, Concepcion; Ruizazcarate Varela, Carmen] Univ Politecn Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Casado-Sanchez, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",joseluis.casado@upm.es; concepcion.gonzalez@upm.es; cruizdeazcarate@gmail.com,"Varela, Christopher/HNQ-0337-2023; Gonzalez-Garcia, Concepcion/L-3880-2014","Casado-Sanchez, Jose-Luis/0000-0003-2804-9853",,,,,0,0,0,0,2,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1316,1316,,,,,,1,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600144,0

For many published health economic analyses in oncology, substantial differences in model structure exist, leading to differences in analysis outcomes and potentially impacting decision-making processes. The objectives of this analysis were (1) to identify differences in model structure and parameterization for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) comparing tamoxifen and anastrazole for adjuvant breast cancer (ABC) treatment; and (2) to quantify the impact of these differences on analysis outcome metrics. The analysis consisted of four steps: (1) review of the literature for identification of eligible CEAs; (2) definition and implementation of a base model structure, which included the core structural components for all identified CEAs; (3) definition and implementation of changes or additions in the base model structure or parameterization; and (4) quantification of the impact of changes in model structure or parameterizations on the analysis outcome metrics life-years gained (LYG), incremental costs (IC) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Eleven CEA analyses comparing anastrazole and tamoxifen as ABC treatment were identified. The base model consisted of the following health states: (1) on treatment; (2) off treatment; (3) local recurrence; (4) metastatic disease; (5) death due to breast cancer; and (6) death due to other causes. The base model estimates of anastrazole versus tamoxifen for the LYG, IC and ICER were 0.263 years, a,not sign3,647 and a,not sign13,868/LYG, respectively. In the published models that were evaluated, differences in model structure included the addition of different recurrence health states, and associated transition rates were identified. Differences in parameterization were related to the incidences of recurrence, local recurrence to metastatic disease, and metastatic disease to death. The separate impact of these model components on the LYG ranged from 0.207 to 0.356 years, while incremental costs ranged from a,not sign3,490 to a,not sign3,714 and ICERs ranged from a,not sign9,804/LYG to a,not sign17,966/LYG. When we re-analyzed the published CEAs in our framework by including their respective model properties, the LYG ranged from 0.207 to 0.383 years, IC ranged from a,not sign3,556 to a,not sign3,731 and ICERs ranged from a,not sign9,683/LYG to a,not sign17,570/LYG. Differences in model structure and parameterization lead to substantial differences in analysis outcome metrics. This analysis supports the need for more guidance regarding structural uncertainty and the use of standardized disease-specific models for health economic analyses of adjuvant endocrine breast cancer therapies. The developed approach in the current analysis could potentially serve as a template for further evaluations of structural uncertainty and development of disease-specific models.","[Frederix, Gerardus W.

The basic source of water is the precipitation in the form of rainfall or snowfall and is the most critical and key variable of hydrological cycle. The major source of water for agriculture and human consumption is direct or stored (above ground, underground and or soil zone) rainfall. The rainfall received during monsoon season is useful for the rainfed agriculture, while excess rainfall that is stored under ground or over ground is utilized for irrigating the crops during non monsoon seasons i.e. winter and summer. The knowledge of rainfall over future periods is thus useful for planning the rainfed agriculture and managing the irrigated agriculture properly.

The present study attempts to develop the ARIMA model for forecasting and generation of weekly rainfall. Data were collected from National Data Centre of India Meteorological Department, Pune. Rainfall data series of 31 years (1982 - 2012) of Rahuri region of Ahmednagar district were used for developing ARIMA models. The series of 30 years i.e. from 1982 to 2011 was used for the development of the models and series of 2012 was used for testing the validity of the models. ARIMA models of different orders were selected based on observing autocorrelation functions (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF) of the historical rainfall series. The parameters of selected model were obtained with the help of maximum likelihood method. The diagnostic checking of the selected models was then performed with the help of three test (standard error of parameters, ACF and PACF of residuals and Akaike Information Criteria) to know the adequacy of the selected models. The ARIMA models that passed the adequacy test were selected for forecasting. The weekly rainfall values 2012 year were forecasted with the help of these selected models and compared with the actual weekly rainfall values of the year 2012 by root mean square error (RMSE) The ARIMA (1,1,1) (1,0,1) (52) gave the lowest value of RMSE and hence is considered as the best model for generation and forecasting of weekly rainfall values.","Dr ASCAE Mahatma Phule Agr Univ, Dept Irrigat & Drainage Engn, Ahmednagar, MS, India",,"Popale, P (通讯作者)，Dr ASCAE Mahatma Phule Agr Univ, Dept Irrigat & Drainage Engn, Ahmednagar, MS, India.",pramod.popale@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1506,1516,,,,,,11,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600168,0

Among the usual goals, mining patterns along time plays a central role, since an accurate identification of patterns may improve significantly the accuracy of posterior classification models. Regularities, such as cycles and convergence, are of particular interest, revealing constancy or evolution on behaviors. Nevertheless, the explosion on the number of patterns identified impairs their usage on training classification models. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to identify and summarize a set of temporal patterns. The approach combines the discovery of cyclic and convergent patterns with the formulation of meta-patterns, a condensed but non-lossy representation. Experimental results on healthcare and climate datasets show a considerable reduction on the number of patterns discovered, without losing accuracy.","[Serrano, Daniel; Barreto, Antonio; Antunes, Claudia] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Serrano, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Lisbon, Portugal.",daniel.serrano@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; antonio.barreto@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; claudia.antunes@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Antunes, Claudia/M-2375-2013",,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,COPICENTRO GRANADA S L,GRANADA,"AV ANDALUCIA, 38, GRANADA, GRANADA 18014, SPAIN",,,978-84-15814-97-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1424,1435,,,,,,12,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BD2SE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359136600161,0

The manufacturer of vemurafenib, Roche Products Limited, was invited by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to submit evidence of the drug's clinical- and cost-effectiveness for its licenced indication, to inform the Institute's Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this appraisal. This article summarises the ERG's review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer and also includes a summary of the NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) decision. The ERG reviewed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in accordance with the decision problem defined by NICE. The ERG's analysis of the submitted economic model assessed the appropriateness of the approach taken by the manufacturer in modelling the decision problem. It also included an assessment of the reliability of model implementation and the extent of conformity to published standards and prevailing norms of practice within the health economics modelling community. Particular attention was paid to issues likely to impact substantially on the base-case cost-effectiveness results. The clinical evidence was derived from BRIM 3 (BRAF Inhibitor in Melanoma 3), a well-designed, multi-centre, multi-national, phase III, randomised controlled trial (RCT). Clinical outcome results from the October 2011 data cut showed that median overall survival for patients treated with vemurafenib was 13.2 months compared with 9.6 months for those treated with dacarbazinc. The ERG's main concern with the trial was the potential for confounding because of the early introduction of the crossover from the comparator drug to vemurafenib or another BRAF inhibitor. The submitted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was considered above the NICE threshold, even when end-of-life criteria were taken into account. The ERG questioned the submitted economic model on a number of grounds, particularly the approach used to project trial results. After the ERG had made appropriate corrections to the model and employed an alternative form of projective modelling, the ICER per quality-adjusted life year more than doubled. Additional evidence was submitted by the manufacturer for consideration at a second AC meeting and at their third meeting the AC concluded that vemurafenib could be recommended as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive malignant melanoma.","[Beale, Sophie; Dickson, Rumona; Bagust, Adrian; Blundell, Michaela; Dundar, Yenal; Boland, Angela] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England; [Marshall, Ernie] Clatterbridge Canc Ctr NHS Fdn Trust, Wirral CH63 4JY, Merseyside, England; [Plummer, Ruth] Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, Northern Inst Canc Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Proudlove, Chris] North West Med Informat Ctr, Pharm Practice Unit, Liverpool L69 3GF, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool; Newcastle University - UK,"Beale, S (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Whelan Bldg,Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England.",s.beale@liv.ac.uk,"Dundar, Yenal/AAU-8336-2020; Dundar, Yenal/JZT-0760-2024","Dundar, Yenal/0000-0002-9847-1622;",NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme [11/43/01],NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 11/43/01) and full details are available on the NICE website (http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA/Wave27/5).,,23,15,15,1,10,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2013,31.0,12,,,,,1121,1129,,10.1007/s40273-013-0094-x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,269CM,24114739.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328218100004,0

For the jump risk, we use a compound Poisson process with double exponential jump amplitude to describe the jumps. As for the boundedness of the fluctuation, we introduce two regulators to regulate (or control) the price dynamics. Based on such a dynamics, we then study the default events under the structural framework for credit risk. The explicit expression for the Laplace transform of the default time is derived. For exploring the effect of the jump risk and the regulation, we perform some numerical simulation. As a practical application, an analytic valuation of defaultable zero-coupon bonds is presented.

Under RUT, the error term is associated with the analyst's inability to properly capture the true choice processes of the respondent as well as the inconsistency or mistakes arising from the respondent themselves. Under such assumptions, it stands to reason that analysts should explore more complex nonlinear indirect utility functions, than currently used in healthcare, to strive for better estimates of preferences in healthcare. Objective To test whether complex indirect utility functions decrease error variance for models that either implicitly (i.e. the multinomial logit (MNL) model) or explicitly (i.e. entropy multinomial logit (EMNL) model) account for error variance in health(care)-related DCEs; and to determine the impact of complex indirect utility functions on willingness-to-pay (WTP) measures. Methods Using data from DCEs aimed at healthcare-related decisions, we empirically compared (1) complex and simple indirect utility specifications in terms of goodness of fit, (2) their impact on WTP measures, including confidence intervals (CIs) based on the Delta method, the Krinsky and Robb-procedure, and Bootstrapping, and (3) MNL and EMNL model results. Results Complex indirect utility functions had a better model fit than simple specifications (p < 0.05). WTP estimates were quite similar across alternative specifications. The Delta method produced the most narrow CIs. The EMNL model showed that respondents apply simplifying strategies when answering DCE questions. Conclusion Complex indirect utility functions reduce error arisen from researchers, which can have important implications for measures in healthcare such as the WTP, whereas EMNL provides insights into the behaviour of respondents when answering DCEs. Understanding how respondents answer DCE questions may allow researchers to construct DCEs that minimise scale differences, so that the decision error made across respondents is more homogeneous and therefore taken out as additional noise in the data. Hence, better estimates of preferences in healthcare can be provided.","[de Bekker-Grob, Esther W.] Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, Dept Publ Hlth, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Rose, John M.; Bliemer, Michiel C.

Preference elicitation using surveys, a common practice in the health sector, is subject to a range of framing effects. This research investigates the importance of (theoretically relevant) opportunity costs and (theoretically irrelevant) framing effects on stated preferences for prioritizing treatment of rare (orphan) diseases. We elicited preferences from Norwegians, aged 40-67, using simple trade-off exercises. Respondents were randomised to different opportunity costs of the rare disease or to different framings of the trade-off exercises. Respondents were quite sensitive to the visual presentation of the choice problem, and, to a lesser extent, to focusing and labelling effects. Elicited preferences varied little in response to large changes in opportunity costs, suggesting scope-insensitivity among respondents. Preferences for prioritizing treatment of rare diseases elicited using trade-off exercises are insensitive to (theoretically relevant) opportunity costs, but sensitive to (theoretically irrelevant) framing effects.","[Desser, Arna S.; Grepperud, Sverre] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Desser, Arna S.] Norwegian Knowledge Ctr Hlth Serv, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Olsen, Jan Abel] Univ Tromso, Dept Community Med, N-9019 Tromso, Norway",University of Oslo; Norwegian Knowledge Centre for Health Services; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Desser, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, POB 1089, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",arna.desser@gmail.com,,"Grepperud, Sverre Ole/0000-0002-8658-7345",Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"The authors thank John Cairns, Ivar Sonbo Kristiansen, Eline Aas, participants at the Health Economics Bergen/Health Economics Research Network at University of Oslo (HEB/HERO) Workshop, 2012, two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments, and Chris McCabe for his suggestion of a version in which the common disease was more costly.

These guarantees are proportional to the average market interest rate at contract inception and typically set at 60% of the 10-year rolling average of government bond yields. Currently, however, in the face of prolonged low interest rates and stricter solvency regulation, the continued viability of this type of product is in question. A discussion of alternative guarantee designs is thus highly relevant. To this end, we perform a comparative analysis of contracts sold in different interest rate environments with regard to the guarantee value and show that the current practice of proportional guarantees leads to higher guarantee values the lower the market interest rate. We also observe an increased interest rate sensitivity. Additionally, alternative product designs that mitigate the interest rate dependency of the guarantee value are illustrated and assessed from the policyholder perspective. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We consider changes over time within some frequency bands, permitting the coefficients to be different across frequency bands. Using standard assumptions, we show that the limit distributions obtained are similar to those in the time domain counterpart. We show that when the coefficients change only within some frequency band, we have increased efficiency of the estimates and power of the tests. We also discuss a very useful application related to contexts in which the data are contaminated by some low-frequency process (e.g. level shifts or trends) and that the researcher is interested in whether the original non-contaminated model is stable. All that is needed to obtain estimates of the break dates and tests for structural changes that are not affected by such low-frequency contaminations is to truncate a low-frequency band that shrinks to zero at rate log(T)/T. Simulations show that the tests have good sizes for a wide range of truncations so that the method is quite robust. We analyse the stability of the relation between hours worked and productivity. When applying structural change tests in the time domain, we document strong evidence of instabilities. When excluding a few low frequencies, none of the structural change tests are significant. Hence, the results provide evidence to the effect that the relation between hours worked and productivity is stable over any spectral band that excludes the lowest frequencies, in particular it is stable over the business-cycle band.","[Yamamoto, Yohei] Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Perron, Pierre] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Hitotsubashi University; Boston University,"Yamamoto, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, Naka 2-1, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",yohei.yamamoto@econ.hit-u.ac.jp; perron@bu.edu,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245042] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,32,14,15,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Our objectives were (i) to investigate the role of pharmacoeconomic evidence in Dutch and Swedish drug reimbursement decision making; and (ii) to determine the extent to which appraising the importance of full economic evaluations relative to other evidence is a transparent process. Data sources included all Dutch and Swedish drug reimbursement information published in the period January 2005 to July 2011. After categorising all the reimbursement applications and decisions in published data sources, we selected all dossiers-in both countries-that included a full economic evaluation (i.e. cost-effectiveness and/or cost-utility analysis) and then investigated how the evidence was appraised for its societal value. In The Netherlands, only 35 % of the 118 applications on List 1B (i.e. claiming added therapeutic value) were found to include pharmacoeconomic evidence. In all cases where drugs received a 'no' decision, combined with an evaluation that they were of similar (n = 7) or added (n = 5) therapeutic value, we found that the pharmacoeconomic evidence had been judged insufficiently robust. We also found that in 21 % of the 'yes' decisions, combined with an evaluation of similar (n = 2) or added (n = 2) therapeutic value, the pharmacoeconomic evidence had been judged insufficiently robust. In Sweden, we found that drugs that received a 'no' decision (n = 39) had been judged either not cost effective (74 %) or not supported by sufficiently credible data (26 %). Nearly all drugs that received a 'yes' decision (n = 252) had been judged cost effective (92 %). However, of all these judgements, 53 % were based on a price comparison and 10 % on a cost-minimisation analysis; only 33 % were based on a full economic evaluation. More economic evaluations were available in Sweden than in The Netherlands (97 vs. 31, respectively), mainly due to the numerous exemptions from pharmacoeconomic evidence in The Netherlands (65 %). Dossiers for only 11 drugs included a full economic evaluation in both countries; of these, the reimbursement decisions differed for four drugs. Appraisal elements were reported only descriptively; their actual influence on the final decision remained unclear. In four dossiers, the (high) severity of the treatable disease was explicitly mentioned in both countries; three of these were identical and related to indications in cancer. Both countries publish drug reimbursement information. Therapeutic value appears to be the most decisive criterion; the relative importance of full economic evaluations is more modest than would generally be expected, especially in The Netherlands. Although the assessment process is reasonably transparent, both countries could make the appraisal process more transparent by more explicitly showing the actual role of each different (societal) criterion in their decision making.","[Franken, Margreet; Sandmann, Frank; Koopmanschap, Marc] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Nilsson, Fredrik] Dent & Pharmaceut Benefits Agcy TLV, Stockholm, Sweden; [de Boer, Anthonius] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Clin Pharmacol, Utrecht, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Utrecht University,"Franken, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",franken@bmg.eur.nl,"Franken, Margreet MG/H-3200-2013","Franken, Margreet/0000-0003-4207-510X; Nilsson, Fredrik Olof Laurentius/0000-0002-1905-4047; Sandmann, Frank/0000-0001-5641-1931","Top Institute Pharma, Leiden, the Netherlands [T6-202]","Top Institute Pharma, Leiden, the Netherlands(Netherlands Government)","The study was partly performed in the context of the Escher project (T6-202), a project of Top Institute Pharma, Leiden, the Netherlands.",,25,24,24,1,13,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2013,31.0,9,,,,,781,797,,10.1007/s40273-013-0074-1,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,209FH,23839699.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323739500005,0

Also, posteriors are asymptotically centered at the MLE, normal, and of asymptotic variance that is, in general, different than the sandwich matrix. It is shown that due to this discrepancy, Bayesian inference about the pseudo-true parameter value is, in general, of lower asymptotic frequentist risk when the original posterior is substituted by an artificial normal posterior centered at the MLE with sandwich covariance matrix. An algorithm is suggested that allows the implementation of this artificial posterior also in models with high dimensional nuisance parameters which cannot reasonably be estimated by maximizing the likelihood.","Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Müller, UK (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",umueller@princeton.edu,,,,,,,48,60,73,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2013,81.0,5,,,,,1805,1849,,10.3982/ECTA9097,0.0,,,45,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,227BY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325084100003,0

Adding a fat-tail distribution for the innovations in this framework creates fundamental inconsistencies, essentially related to a diverging integral. The problems are related to (1) the (infinite) values of statistical quantities for processes with fat-tail innovations, (2) the robustness of computations when dealing with large events (genuine or noise), and (3) the pricing of options with heteroskedasticity and fat tails. Instead of logarithmic processes, we advocate using geometric processes and relative returns so that these problems do not occur. The mathematical properties of geometric processes are explored for setups of increasing complexity. For empirical time series and for processes, the skews are evaluated using a robust estimator and are compared for both return definitions. Finally, the European option pricing framework is modified to use geometric processes for the underlying, allowing the incorporation of natural fat-tail innovations.","[Zumbach, Gilles] Consulting Financial Res, CH-1228 Saconnex Darve, Switzerland",,"Zumbach, G (通讯作者)，Consulting Financial Res, Ch Charles Baudouin 8, CH-1228 Saconnex Darve, Switzerland.",gilles.zumbach@bluewin.ch,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Compared with Curran's sampling strategy, the new strategy gives a much better estimation of the standard normal distribution with a small number of sampling points. We then apply the willow tree algorithm with the new sampling strategy to price path-dependent options such as American, Asian and American moving-average options.

Systematic longevity risk also undermines the law of large numbers, a law that is relied on in the risk management of life insurance and annuity portfolios. This paper applies a multivariate gamma distribution to incorporate dependence. Lifetimes are modelled using a truncated multivariate gamma distribution that induces dependence through a shared gamma distributed component. Model parameter estimation is developed based on the method of moments and generalized to allow for truncated observations. The impact of dependence within a portfolio, or cohort, of lives with similar risk characteristics is demonstrated by applying the model to annuity valuation. Dependence is shown to have a significant impact on the risk of the annuity portfolio as compared with traditional actuarial methods that implicitly assume independent lifetimes.

To this goal, we limit the communication that is embedded in a neoclassical economy by allowing trading to be random and decentralized. We then show that the business cycle may be driven by a certain type of extrinsic shocks which we call sentiments. These shocks formalize shifts in expectations of economic activity without shifts in the underlying preferences and technologies; they are akin to sunspots, but operate in unique-equilibrium models. We further show how communication may help propagate these shocks in a way that resembles the spread of fads and rumors and that gives rise to boom-and-bust phenomena. We finally illustrate the quantitative potential of our insights within a variant of the RBC model.","[Angeletos, George-Marios] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Angeletos, George-Marios] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"Angeletos, GM (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",angelet@mit.edu,,,,,,,32,198,228,0,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2013,81.0,2,,,,,739,779,,10.3982/ECTA10008,0.0,,,41,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,112YO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316631600007,0

We show that many bounds characterizations in econometrics, for instance bounds on parameters under conditional moment inequalities, can be formulated as intersection bounds. Our approach is especially convenient for models comprised of a continuum of inequalities that are separable in parameters, and also applies to models with inequalities that are nonseparable in parameters. Since analog estimators for intersection bounds can be severely biased in finite samples, routinely underestimating the size of the identified set, we also offer a median-bias-corrected estimator of such bounds as a by-product of our inferential procedures. We develop theory for large sample inference based on the strong approximation of a sequence of series or kernel-based empirical processes by a sequence of penultimate Gaussian processes. These penultimate processes are generally not weakly convergent, and thus are non-Donsker. Our theoretical results establish that we can nonetheless perform asymptotically valid inference based on these processes. Our construction also provides new adaptive inequality/moment selection methods. We provide conditions for the use of nonparametric kernel and series estimators, including a novel result that establishes strong approximation for any general series estimator admitting linearization, which may be of independent interest.","[Chernozhukov, Victor] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lee, Sokbae] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Rosen, Adam M.] UCL, Dept Econ, Inst Fiscal Studies, Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, London WC1E 6BT, England",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Seoul National University (SNU); University of London; University College London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Chernozhukov, V (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",vchern@mit.edu; sokbae@gmail.com; adam.rosen@ucl.ac.uk,"Lee, Sokbae/F-7514-2011","Lee, Sokbae/0000-0003-4080-7733","National Science Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-589-28-0001, RES-000-22-2761]; European Research Council [ERC-2009-StG-240910-ROMETA]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1, ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1061841] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are especially grateful to D.

We derive an efficient approximate semi-closed pricing formula for two types of inflation dependent options: index and year-on-year inflation options. The derived pricing formulas allow for an efficient calibration of the inflation model.

The time of singularity that is supposed to give an estimate of the day of the crash belongs to the latter category. We discuss in detail why and how the fitting procedure must take into account the sloppy nature of this kind of model. We then test the reliability of LPPLs on synthetic AR(1) data replicating the Hang Seng 1987 crash and show that even this case is borderline regarding the predictability of the divergence time.

In this paper, first the construction and interpretation of the CEAC is explained, both in the context of modelling studies and in the context of cost-effectiveness (CE) studies alongside clinical trials. Additionally, this paper reviews the advantages and limitations of the CEAC. Many of the perceived limitations can be attributed to the practice of interpreting the CEAC as a decision rule while it was not developed as such. It is argued that the CEAC is still a useful tool in describing and quantifying uncertainty around the ICER, especially in combination with other tools such as plots on the CE plane and value-of-information analysis.","Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Al, MJ (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",al@bmg.eur.nl,"Al, Maiwenn J/E-3272-2014","Al, Maiwenn J/0000-0001-9763-0436",,,,,38,23,26,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2013,31.0,2,,,,,93,100,,10.1007/s40273-012-0011-8,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,138TV,23329426.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318533800001,0

It is also well known that in estimating Jensens alpha, a nonzero value can be obtained by using incorrect factors or not employing time varying betas. This paper makes two additional contributions to the performance evaluation literature. First, we show that a stronger statement is true regarding the meaning of a nonzero Jensens alpha. In fact, a nonzero Jensens alpha represents an arbitrage opportunity. Second, we show that even if the correct factors and time varying betas are used, a nonzero Jensens alpha can result if the estimate is conditioned on the wrong information set in the presence of an asset price bubble.

Objective The objective of this study was to systematically review the current evidence on the humanistic and economic burden of SLE in terms of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and costs, and summarize the evidence on the factors found to be associated with this burden. Methods Relevant literature for the years 1990 to February 2011 were obtained from systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. Articles reporting the humanistic (preference-based outcome measures or an SLE disease-specific HR-QOL measure) or economic burden (costs) of SLE in adult populations published in English were identified. The following exclusion criteria were applied: studies specifically examining lupus nephritis, SLE not being the main condition of focus (e.g. SLE is a co-existing condition), studies focusing on diagnostics or tests (including genetics and antibodies), mixed patient groups from which SLE could not be separated, paediatric populations, case studies, abstract unavailable, and non-English language studies. Estimates of the burden in terms of either HR-QOL or costs were extracted, tabulated and reported narratively. Annual cost figures were also converted into year 2010 US dollars using the consumer price index (CPI) and the purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor to allow for greater comparability across studies. Evidence on the factors found to be independently associated with either HR-QOL or costs was also examined. Results Of the 1969 studies initially identified as being potentially relevant, 32 papers were retained for the final review. Eighteen of these presented estimates of the burden in terms of HR-QOL, and 14 in terms of the economic cost. Mean utility scores reported on preference-based measures of HR-QOL ranged from 0.6 to 0.75. Mean annual direct costs per patient ranged from US$2,214 to US$16,875, and mean annual indirect cost estimates from US$2,239 to US$35,540 (year 2010 values). Disease activity and damage, along with poor mental and physical health, were repeatedly reported to predict both reduced HR-QOL and increased costs. Conclusions The burden of SLE was found to be substantial, not only for patients but also for the health services that provide care for them. Treatments that are able to alleviate this burden are therefore likely to be highly valued by sufferers. After an extended period in which few therapeutic advances were made or treatments licensed, fundamental developments are finally being made. These new treatments will need to be evaluated for both clinical and cost effectiveness if their use is to be widely implemented.","[Meacock, Rachel; Harrison, Mark J.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Inst Populat Hlth, Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Dale, Nicola] Univ Manchester, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Inst Inflammat & Repair, Arthrit Res UK Epidemiol Unit,Ctr Musculoskeletal, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Harrison, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Inst Populat Hlth, Ctr Hlth Econ, 1-320 Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",mark.harrison@manchester.ac.uk,"Meacock, Rachel/JLM-7182-2023; Harrison, Mark/AFP-1095-2022","Harrison, Mark/0000-0002-2115-2447; Meacock, Rachel/0000-0001-8933-5058",,,,,69,58,64,2,24,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2013,31.0,1,,,,,49,61,,10.1007/s40273-012-0007-4,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,138TT,23329592.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318533600005,0

Existing results in the Sparre Andersen risk models are mainly based on an exponential assumption either on the interclaim times or on the claim sizes. In this paper, we utilize the multivariate version of Lagrange expansion theorem to obtain a series expansion for the density of the time to ruin under a more general distribution assumption, namely the combination of n exponentials. A remark is further made to emphasize that this technique can also be applied to other areas of applied probability. For instance, the proposed methodology can be used to obtain the distribution of some first passage times for particular stochastic processes. As an illustration, the duration of a busy period in a queueing risk model will be examined.","[Shi, Tianxiang; Landriault, David] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Shi, TX (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",t5shi@uwaterloo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Society of Actuaries,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Society of Actuaries,Support for David Landriault from grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada is gratefully acknowledged.

We prove that if the intertemporal production function is strictly concave, an equilibrium must converge to a unique steady state in which there is recurrent endogenous risk-taking. (The role played by concavity is clarified by considering a special case in which the production function is instead convex, in which there is no persistent risk-taking.) The steady state is fully characterized. It displays features that are consistent with the stylized facts that individuals both insure downside risk and gamble over upside risk, and it generates similar patterns of risk-taking and avoidance across environments with quite different overall wealth levels. Endogenous risk-taking here is generally Pareto-inefficient. A concern for status thus implies that persistent and inefficient risk-taking hinders the attainment of full equality.","[Ray, Debraj] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Robson, Arthur] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",New York University; Simon Fraser University,"Ray, D (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",debraj.ray@nyu.edu; robson@sfu.ca,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0962124]; Fulbright Foundation; Canada Research Chair; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0962124] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fulbright Foundation; Canada Research Chair(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","1Ray's research was funded by National Science Foundation Grant SES-0962124 and the Fulbright Foundation; Robson's by a Canada Research Chair and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

In addition, our model can generate a variety of dynamic asset-pricing phenomena, including the procyclical variation of pricedividend ratios, the countercyclical variation of equity premia and equity volatility, the leverage effect, and the mean reversion of excess returns.

In order to evaluate both market timing abilities in these balanced pension plans, we extend the traditional equity market timing models to also account for bond market timing. As far as we know, we are among the first to apply this multifactor timing model to investigate equity and bond market timing simultaneously. This performance evaluation has been conducted on two samples of Spanish balanced pension plans, one with Euro Zone and one with World investment focus. This allows us to decompose managers' skills into three components: selectivity, equity market timing, and bond market timing. Our findings suggest that the average stock-picking ability of pension plans is positive. World schemes tend to have positive bond timing skills, while Euro Zone pension plans are on average not able to time equity or bond markets.","[Swinkels, Laurens] Erasmus Res Inst Management, NL-30000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Andreu, Laura] Univ Zaragoza, Sch Business & Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Swinkels, L (通讯作者)，Erasmus Res Inst Management, POB 1738, NL-30000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",lswinkels@few.eur.nl,"Swinkels, Laurens/A-4038-2011; , LAURA/K-5620-2017","Swinkels, Laurens/0000-0002-1174-8079; , LAURA/0000-0003-3661-5448",DGA (CONAID); CAI through CAI Europe,DGA (CONAID); CAI through CAI Europe,We would like to thank Jose Luis Sarto for valuable comments and DGA (CONAID) and CAI for the funds provided through the research programme CAI Europe.

Health economic evaluation of smoking-cessation interventions, applying a lifetime perspective, is made possible by available epidemiological knowledge. The well established method of performing cost-effectiveness analyses of smoking-cessation interventions involves mathematical modelling (both deterministic and stochastic) of future events important for cost effectiveness. Objectives: This study surveys cost-effectiveness analyses of smoking cessation, with a particular focus on the mathematical modelling and simulation analyses performed. Data Sources: A systematic literature search was performed using the databases MEDLINE, Econlit and Academic Search Complete. Study Selection: Health economic evaluations, published as full-length journal articles, were searched for. Results: 423 studies were identified and 78 were finally included, of which 30 were assessed as being highly relevant, based on the application of simulation modelling. Conclusions: In general, studies are well performed as regards modelling. Common weaknesses include reporting of modelling details; validation of used simulation models; and the handling of structural uncertainty and different types of heterogeneity.","Lund Univ, Dept Econ, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Bolin, K (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 705, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden.",Kristian.Bolin@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,66,21,21,0,19,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2012,30.0,7,,,,,551,564,,,,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,966DG,22591112.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305817200002,0

The advantages of using the bootstrap to rank fund performance are many. It eliminates the need to specify the exact shape of the distribution from which returns are drawn and does not require estimating correlations between portfolio returns. It also eliminates the need to explicitly control for potential 'data snooping' biases that arise from an ex-post sort. Our results show evidence of enhanced-return index funds with positive and significant alphas after controlling for luck and sampling variability. The results are robust to both stock-only and derivative-enhanced index funds, although the spread of cross-sectional alphas for derivative-enhanced funds is slightly more pronounced.

As such it extends the simulated method of moments (SMM) of Duffie and Singleton (1993) to allow for the use of conditional moments, instead of unconditional ones. It can also be seen as a generalisation of the SMM for static models as proposed in McFadden (1989). It is shown that, as the number of simulations diverges and the bandwidth used in the kernel smoothing shrinks, the estimator is consistent and a higher order expansion reveals the stochastic difference between the infeasible GMM estimator based on exact computation of the conditional moment conditions and the simulated version. In particular, the expansion demonstrates how simulations impact the bias and variance of the proposed estimator. Extensive Monte Carlo results show how the estimator may be applied to a range of DLV models, and that it performs well in comparison to several other estimators that have been proposed in the literature.","[Creel, Michael] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Catalonia 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Creel, Michael] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona 08005, Catalonia, Spain; [Kristensen, Dennis] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kristensen, Dennis] Inst Fiscal Studies, CEMMAP, London WC1E 7AE, England; [Kristensen, Dennis] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, CREATES, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; CREATES; Aarhus University,"Creel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Edifici B Campus Bellaterra, Catalonia 08193, Barcelona, Spain.",michael.creel@uab.es; d.kristensen@ucl.ac.uk,"Creel, Michael/P-2743-2019; Creel, Michael/ABC-7429-2021; Kristensen, Dennis/A-7894-2009","Creel, Michael/0000-0002-0944-8405; Kristensen, Dennis/0000-0001-9713-1784","National Science Foundation [SES-0961596]; Danish Research Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice grant [RES-589-28-0001]; [MICINN-ECO2009-11857]; [SGR-2009-578]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1, ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F015879/1, ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: UKRI",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Danish Research Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ; ; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank participants at the 14th International Conference on Computing in Economics and Finance (2008), the NBER-NSF Time Series Conference (2009) and the International Symposium on Econometric Theory and Applications (2009) for comments and suggestions.

We define probability unbiasedness for the alpha-quantile estimator from a finite amount of data ((Q) over cap (alpha)) for the distribution function F-theta with parameter theta such that the estimator also has this probabilistic 'threshold property' in expectation of a F-theta distributed random variable X for all theta, i.e. E-(Q) over cap alpha[F-theta((Q) over cap (alpha))] = alpha. Probability unbiasedness means that the alpha-quantile estimated from a finite amount of data is only exceeded by probability alpha for the next observation from the same distribution. Moreover, we show that plug-in estimators for estimating quantiles at a given probability are not unbiased with respect to the probability unbiasedness property, i.e. using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator for the parameters and plugging in the estimated values into the distribution function to obtain the quantile values. Therefore, estimating a quantile needs to be corrected for observing only finitely many samples with a distortion function to obtain a probability-unbiased estimator. In the case of estimating the VaR (quantile) of a normally distributed random variable, the distortion function is calculated via the distribution of the VaR/quantile. Using the distribution derived for the VaR estimate, we also quantify the approximate probability-unbiased confidence bands of the VaR for a finite amount of data. In the last part, the new VaR estimator is tested on a time series. It outperforms the other models examined, all of which are much more complex.","[Herzog, Florian] SwissQuant Grp AG, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; ETH, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Herzog, F (通讯作者)，SwissQuant Grp AG, Univ Str 9, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",herzog@swissquant.ch,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We find an increase in the long-memory parameter in the early 1990s by applying a test recently proposed by Sibbertsen and Kruse [J. Time Series Anal., 2009, 30, 263-285]. An application of the unit root test against long memory of Demetrescu et al. [Econometr. Theory, 2008, 24, 176-215] suggests that the pre-break data can be characterized by long memory, while the post-break sample contains a unit root. These results reconcile two empirical findings that are seen as contradictory: on the one hand, they confirm the existence of fractional integration in the S&P500 log-dividend-price ratio and, on the other, they are consistent with the existence of a rational bubble. The result of a changing memory parameter in the dividend-price ratio has an important implication for the literature on return predictability: the shift from a stationary dividend-price ratio to a unit root process in 1991 is likely to have caused the well-documented failure of conventional return prediction models since the 1990s.","[Kruse, Robinson] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Sch Econ & Management, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Frommel, Michael] Univ Ghent, Dept Financial Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",CREATES; Aarhus University; Ghent University,"Kruse, R (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Sch Econ & Management, Bldg 1322,Bartholins Alle 10, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",rkruse@creates.au.dk,"Froemmel, Michael/B-8334-2008",,CREATES; Danish National Research Foundation,CREATES; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"We would like to thank three anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions which improved the quality of the paper significantly.

Accordingly, the new emerging discipline requires one to replace the production function, one of the key ideas in conventional economics, by an alternative that can take explicit account of the distribution of firms' production activities. In this paper we propose a new idea referred to as a production copula; a copula is an analytic means for modeling the dependence among variables. Such a production copula predicts the value added by firms with given capital and labor in a probabilistic way. It is thereby in sharp contrast to the production function, where the output of firms is completely deterministic. We demonstrate the empirical construction of a production copula using financial data of listed Japanese firms. Analysis of the data shows that there are significant correlations among capital, labor and value added, and confirms that the values added are too widely scattered to be represented by a production function. We employ four models for the production copula, that is trivariate versions of Frank, Gumbel and survival Clayton and non-exchangeable trivariate Gumbel. The latter was found to be the best.","[Iyetomi, Hiroshi] Niigata Univ, Dept Phys, Niigata 9502181, Japan; [Aoyama, Hideaki] Kyoto Univ, Dept Phys, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Fujiwara, Yoshi] ATR Labs, Kyoto 6190288, Japan; [Ikeda, Yuichi] Hitachi Ltd, Hitachi Res Lab, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3191221, Japan; [Souma, Wataru] Nihon Univ, Coll Sci & Technol, Funabashi, Chiba 2748501, Japan",Niigata University; Kyoto University; Hitachi Limited; Nihon University,"Iyetomi, H (通讯作者)，Niigata Univ, Dept Phys, Niigata 9502181, Japan.",hiyetomi@sc.niigata-u.ac.jp,"; Souma, Wataru/L-3652-2018","Ikeda, Yuichi/0000-0002-9929-3813; Souma, Wataru/0000-0002-1051-4350","Hitachi Research Institute; Program for Promoting Methodological Innovation in Humanities and Social Sciences by the Cross-Disciplinary Fusing of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture [22300080]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22300080] Funding Source: KAKEN","Hitachi Research Institute; Program for Promoting Methodological Innovation in Humanities and Social Sciences by the Cross-Disciplinary Fusing of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank Em.

We propose a new method that provides a consistent estimator of the effect when the variable of interest is conditional mean independent of excluded variables.

Objective: The objective was to conduct an in-depth analysis of Canadian Expert Drug Advisory Committee (CEDAC) recommendations to date, to explore predictors and possible explanatory factors associated with negative recommendations. Methods: Final recommendations were identified from inception (September 2003) to 31 December 2009. Using only publicly available information, recommendations were analysed under the following categories: submission specifics, drug characteristics, clinical factors and economic factors. Descriptive analyses were conducted, followed by statistical analyses, to determine which factors independently predicted a 'do not list' (DNL) recommendation. Results: The database consisted of 138 unique final recommendations. The overall DNL rate was 48%. Significant differences in DNL rates were observed between therapeutic areas, ranging from 0% for HIV antivirals up to 88% for analgesic drugs. In the univariate analysis, several factors were significantly associated with a DNL recommendation, including first-in-class drugs and use of clinical scales as an outcome. In the multivariate regression, four factors were significantly predictive of a DNL recommendation: clinical uncertainty (odds ratio [OR] 14), price higher than comparators (OR 9), request for reconsideration (OR 10) and price as the only economic evidence used (OR 18). Incremental cost-effectiveness thresholds were not predictive of recommendations. The hypothesis that economic factors did not impact recommendations when clinical factors were included first was supported by the analysis. Conclusions: This analysis documented an evidence-driven process that simultaneously weighted multiple factors. Clinical uncertainty and price considerations, but not economic results, had a strong impact on the recommendations. Insufficiency of clinical evidence may have resulted from the gap in evidence available at the time of product launch and the absence of demonstrated benefits to support innovative drugs.","[Rocchi, Angela; Miller, Elizabeth] Axia Res, Burlington, ON L7M 3W2, Canada; [Hopkins, Robert B.; Goeree, Ron] Programs Assessment Technol Hlth PATH Res Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Hopkins, Robert B.; Goeree, Ron] McMaster Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostatist, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Rocchi, A (通讯作者)，Axia Res, 2068 Waterbridge Dr, Burlington, ON L7M 3W2, Canada.",angela@axiaresearch.com,,"Hopkins, Robert/0000-0002-7229-5480",Axia Research; PATH Research Institute; Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies,Axia Research; PATH Research Institute; Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies,"This project was supported through an in-kind contribution from Axia Research and PATH Research Institute.

Exploiting a database where the broker that initiates an order book event can be identified, we decompose the correlation and response functions into contributions coming from different market participants and study how their behaviour is interconnected. We find evidence for the following. (1) Brokers are very heterogeneous in liquidity provision-some appear to be primarily liquidity providers while others are primarily liquidity takers. (2) The behaviour of brokers is strongly conditioned on the actions of other brokers. In contrast, brokers are only weakly influenced by the impact of their own previous orders. (3) The total impact of market orders is the result of a subtle compensation between the same broker pushing the price in one direction and the liquidity provision of other brokers pushing it in the opposite direction. These results enforce the picture of market dynamics being the result of the competition between heterogeneous participants, interacting to form a complex market ecology.","[Toth, B.; Eisler, Z.; Kockelkoren, J.; Bouchaud, J-P] Capital Fund Management, F-75009 Paris, France; [Toth, B.; Lillo, F.; Farmer, J.

At the planning level, for a given network design, this trade-off is captured by the timetabling (TT) and vehicle scheduling (VS) problems. In the TT problem we try to maximize the number of passengers benefited by well timed transfers, while in the VS problem we seek to minimize the operating costs, which are related to the fleet size. This paper presents two integer linear programming models for the TT and VS problems, and combines them in a hi-objective integrated model. We propose and implement an e-constraint method to jointly solve this TT and VS hi-objective problem. This allows to analyze the trade-off between these two criteria in terms of Pareto fronts. Numerical experiments show that our proposed approach can solve scenarios with up to 50 bus lines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to solve this problem, we propose a dynamic train scheduling and control framework. First, we forecast the passenger demand, and determine the headway and cycle time for the next cycle. Then we optimize the reference timetable and speed profile for trains at the next cycle subject to the headway and cycle time constraints. Finally, the automatic train control system is used to operate trains with real-life conditions based on the reference timetable and speed profile. In this paper, we focus on the optimization of the timetable and speed profile. Generally speaking, the former distributes the cycle time to different stations and inter-stations under the headway constraint, and the latter controls the trains' speeds at inter-stations to reduce the consumption on tractive energy and increase the storage on regenerative energy. In order to achieve a global optimality on energy saving, we formulate an integrated energy-efficient timetable and speed profile optimization model, which is transformed to a convex optimization problem by using the linear approximation method. We use the Kuhn-Tucker conditions to solve the optimal solution and present some numerical experiments based on the actual operation data of Beijing Metro Yizhuang Line of China, which shows that the integrated approach can reduce the net energy consumption around 11% than the practical timetable. Furthermore, with given passenger demand sequence at off-peak hours, the dynamic scheduling and integrated optimization approach with adaptive cycle time can reduce the net energy consumption around 7% than the static scheduling and integrated optimization approach with fixed cycle time.

In theoretical investigations of wide-scatter in flow-density data, the statistical features of flow density relations have played a central role. In real-time estimation and traffic forecasting applications, probabilistic extensions of macroscopic relations are widely used. However, how to obtain such relations, in a manner that results in physically reasonable behavior has not been addressed. This paper presents the derivation of probabilistic macroscopic traffic flow relations from Newell's simplified car-following model. The probabilistic nature of the model allows for investigating the impact of driver heterogeneity on macroscopic relations of traffic flow. The physical features of the model are verified analytically and shown to produce behavior which is consistent with well-established traffic flow principles. An empirical investigation is carried out using trajectory data from the New Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) program and the model's ability to reproduce real-world traffic data is validated.

To address this, a time-varying heterogeneity approach to model unobserved heterogeneity in ordered response data is considered. A Markov switching random parameters structure (which accounts for heterogeneity across observations) is proposed to accommodate both time-varying and time-constant (cross-sectional) unobserved heterogeneity in an ordered discrete-response probability model. A data augmented Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for non-linear model estimation is developed to facilitate model estimation. The performance of the cross-sectional heterogeneity model and time-varying heterogeneity model are examined with vehicle crash-injury severity data. The time-varying heterogeneity model (Markov switching random parameters ordered probit) is found to provide the best overall model fit. Two roadway safety states are shown to exist and roadway segments transition between these two states according to Markov transition probabilities. The results demonstrate considerable promise for Markov switching models in a wide variety of applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

According to traffic flow theory, such variability should induce a similar variability in travel times, but this internal consistency is generally not captured by existing network equilibrium models. We present an internally-consistent network equilibrium approach, which considers two potential sources of flow variability: (i) daily variation in route choice and (ii) daily variation in origin-destination demand. We particularly aspire to a flexible formulation that permits alternative statistical assumptions, which allows the best fit to be made to observed variability data in particular applications. Joint probability distributions of route-and therefore link-flows are derived under several assumptions concerning stochastic driver behavior. A stochastic network equilibrium model with stochastic demands and route choices is formulated as a fixed point problem. We explore limiting cases which allow an equivalent convex optimization problem to be defined, and finally apply this method to a real-life network of Kanazawa City, Japan. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the DPDPRC considers intra-day transportation services of express courier service companies and integrates real-world aspects that are crucial for a practical application. Vehicles have heterogeneous properties and operate on a detailed real road network. Various dynamic events that may occur unexpectedly during the day, such as new request arrivals, traffic congestion, and vehicle disturbances, are integrated. Because of the mentioned urgency, minimizing lateness at request locations is the primary objective. As a secondary objective, the minimization of vehicle operating costs is pursued. In order to adapt the transportation plan in response to dynamic events and enable a timely service of requests, a real-time control approach that performs plan adaptations simultaneous to the execution of the transportation service is applied. Plan adaptations are carried out by a Tabu Search algorithm whose search process is guided by a multi-stage neighborhood operator selection scheme which dynamically switches between intensification and diversification phases. We evaluate various test scenarios which comprise different occurrences of the dynamic events. Computational results show that a continuous adaptation of the transportation plan according to dynamic events improves the solution quality in many scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Raw data are provided by a mesoscopic simulation tool for two typical networks that mimic an urban corridor and a meshed urban center. We mainly focus on homogenous network loading in order to fairly cross-compare the different methods with the analytical reference. It appears that the only way to estimate the MFD without bias is to have the full information of vehicle trajectories over the network and to apply Edie's definitions. Combining information from probes (mean network speed) and loop detectors (mean network flow) also provides accurate results even for low sampling rate (<10%). Loop detectors fail to provide a good estimation for mean network speed or density because they cannot capture the traffic spatial dynamics over links. This paper proposes a simple adjustment technic in order to reduce the discrepancy when only loop detectors are available. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Spectral envelops can reveal not only the salient frequencies of periodic oscillations of traffic flow, but also the relative strength of these oscillations at different locations. This paper first introduces time dimension into the existing spectral envelope method so that it can be applied to study the evolution of vehicular traffic oscillations. The extended spectral envelope method proposed in this paper, or ESPE, discards the normalization procedure in the standard method. A new Contributing Index (CI) is proposed to measure the relative strength of oscillations at different locations. The extended spectral envelops can be constructed on long-term or short-term time scales. While the long-term analysis helps extract salient frequencies of traffic oscillations, the short-term analysis promises to reveal their detailed spatial-temporal profiles. ESPE offers two distinctive advantages. First, it is more robust against the impacts of noises. Second, it is able to uncover complicated oscillatory behaviors which are otherwise difficult to notice. These advantages are demonstrated in case studies constructed on both simulated and real data.

Although this paper is motivated by a third-party logistics e-marketplace, the underlying model is applicable in the general bilateral exchange contexts. We first address TSP in a transportation spot market with stochastic but balanced or symmetric demand and supply. A periodic sealed double auction (PSDA) is proposed for TSP. Using a packing approach that considers possible bids and/or asks in an integral manner, we then devise a modified PSDA (M-PSDA) to address TSP with asymmetric demand and supply. We show that both PSDA and M-PSDA realize incentive compatibility and asymptotic efficiency. Also, the auctioneer is likely to gain higher profits from PSDA with a relatively short auction length. Under asymmetric demand and supply, this optimal auction length increases with the degree of supply-demand imbalance. However, it is optimal to run the auction (either PSDA or M-PSDA) with a relatively large auction length, when maximizing either the social welfare or the utility of shippers and carriers (agents). Finally, when the degree of supply-demand imbalance is low, the auctioneer's myopic optimal expected profit per unit of time under supply-demand imbalance is larger than that under symmetric demand and supply. But the agents' expected utility per unit of time under supply-demand imbalance significantly decreases when the degree of supply-demand imbalance increases, thereby resulting in a lower market efficiency.

In principle, traffic management decisions for different sub-systems of a transport network (urban, freeway) are controlled by operational rules that are network specific and independent from one traffic authority to another. In this paper, the macroscopic traffic modeling and control of a large-scale mixed transportation network consisting of a freeway and an urban network is tackled. The urban network is partitioned into two regions, each one with a well-defined Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), i.e. a unimodal and low-scatter relationship between region density and outflow. The freeway is regarded as one alternative commuting route which has one on-ramp and one off-ramp within each urban region. The urban and freeway flow dynamics are formulated with the tool of MFD and asymmetric cell transmission model, respectively. Perimeter controllers on the border of the urban regions operating to manipulate the perimeter interflow between the two regions, and controllers at the on-ramps for ramp metering are considered to control the flow distribution in the mixed network. The optimal traffic control problem is solved by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach in order to minimize total delay in the entire network. Several control policies with different levels of urban-freeway control coordination are introduced and tested to scrutinize the characteristics of the proposed controllers. Numerical results demonstrate how different levels of coordination improve the performance once compared with independent control for freeway and urban network. The approach presented in this paper can be extended to implement efficient real-world control strategies for large-scale mixed traffic networks. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we develop a reliable uncapacitated fixed-charge location model with fortification to support the design of distribution networks. The model considers heterogeneous facility failure probabilities, one layer of supplier backup, and facility fortification within a finite budget. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer programming model which is proved to be NP-hard.

In simulation methods, the lack of empirical identification when the number of parameters increases is usually known as the curse of dimensionality in the simulation methods. We investigate this problem in the case of the random coefficients Logit model. We compare the traditional Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL) method with two alternative estimation methods: the Expectation-Maximization (EM) and the Laplace Approximation (HH) methods that do not require simulation. We use Monte Carlo experimentation to investigate systematically the performance of the methods under different circumstances, including different numbers of variables, sample sizes and structures of the variance-covariance matrix. Results show that indeed MSL suffers from lack of empirical identification as the dimensionality grows while EM deals much better with this estimation problem. On the other hand, the HH method, although not being simulation-based, showed poor performance with large dimensions, principally because of the necessity of inverting large matrices. The results also show that when MSL is empirically identified this method seems superior to EM and HH in terms of ability to recover the true parameters and estimation time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, there is a need to establish the level of inspection (i.e. the number of inspectors) to tackle fare dodgers as a possible option. By building on previous models, this paper develops a formal economic framework to derive the optimum inspection level in a long time window, based on system-wide profit maximization when fare evasion exists. The framework takes into account: (i) the refined segmentation of passengers and potential fare evaders, (ii) the variability of perceived inspection level by passengers, and (iii) the fact that an inspector cannot fine every passenger caught evading. Its implementation is illustrated by using three years of real data from an Italian PTC. Based on 27,514 stop-level inspections and 10,586 on-board personal interviews, the results show that the optimum inspection level is 3.8%. Put differently, it is sufficient to check 38 passengers out of every 1000 to maximize profit in the presence of fare evasion. This outcome is very useful, because it improves the one obtained in previous formulations. Indeed, profit maximization is achieved with a lower number of inspectors, thus reducing inspection costs, which are relevant determinants in proficient Pits. Finally, the framework is flexible and may be applied to public transport modes other than buses as long as proof-of-payment systems are in use. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The key principle is to impose VSL control some distance upstream of a bottleneck to starve the inflow to the bottleneck and dissipate the queue. Once the queue near the bottleneck vanishes, another less restrictive VSL is imposed upstream to (i) resolve the heavy queue generated by the first VSL and (ii) regulate the inflow to the bottleneck to sustain the stable maximum bottleneck discharge rate and prevent traffic breakdown. Several strategies are developed for each scenario ranging from the simplest strategy that maximizes the delay saving to more sophisticated strategies for upstream queue management. An analysis of the model parameters suggests that a wide range of the first speed limit (to clear the queue around the bottleneck) can be imposed to realize significant delay savings.

However, in the conventional trip-based approach, the decisions that commuters make during the day about their activity schedules and time use are not explicitly considered. This study extends the bottleneck model to address the scheduling problem of commuters' morning home-to-work and evening work-to-home journeys by using an activity-based approach. A day-long activity-travel scheduling model is proposed for the simultaneous determination of departure times for morning and evening commutes, together with allocations of time during the day among travel and activities undertaken at home or at the workplace. The proposed model maximizes the total net utility of the home-based tour, which is the difference between the benefits derived from participating in activities and the disutility incurred by travel between activity locations. The properties of the model solution are analytically explored and compared with the conventional bottleneck model for a special case with constant marginal-activity utility. For the case with linear marginal-activity utility, we develop a heuristic procedure to seek the equilibrium scheduling solution. We also explore the effects of marginal-work utility (or the employees' average wage level) and of flexible work-hour schemes on the scheduling problem in relation to the morning and evening commuting tours.

In these models, the random variables enter additively or multiplicatively and the noise distributions take a particular parametric form. We show that the same qualitative results, with closed-form choice probabilities, can be obtained for a wide class of distributions without such specifications. This class generalizes the statistically independent distributions where any two c.d.f.:s are powers of each others to a class that allows for statistical dependence, in a way analogous to how the independent distributions in the MNL models were generalized into the subclass of MEV distributions that generates the GEV choice models. We show that this generalization is sufficient, and under statistical independence also necessary, for the following invariance property: all conditional random variables, when conditioning upon a certain alternative having been chosen, are identically distributed. While some of these results have been published earlier, we place them in a general unified framework that allows us to extend several of the results and to provide proofs that are simpler, more direct and transparent. Well-known results are obtained as special cases, and we characterize the Gumbel, Frechet and Weibull distributions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is postulated that an individual's choice of activities depends not only on socio-demographic characteristics but also on previous activities of individual on the same day. In the paper, Markov Chain models are used to study the sequential choice of activities. The dependencies among activity type, activity sequence and socio-demographic data are captured by employing hidden Markov models. In order to learn model parameters, we use sequential multinomial logit models (MNL) and multi-class Support Vector Machines (K-SVM) with two different dependency structures. In the first dependency structure, it is assumed that type of activity at time 't' depends on the last previous activity and socio-demographic data, whereas in the second structure we assume that activity selection at time 't' depends on all of the individual's previous activity types on the same day and socio-demographic characteristics. The models are applied to data drawn from a set of California households and a comparison of the accuracy of estimation of activity types and their sequence in the agenda, indicates the superiority of K-SVM models over MNL. Additionally, we show that accuracy in estimating activity patterns increases using different sets of explanatory variables or tuning parameters of the kernel function in K-SVM.

Such contradictory observations suggest that the stationary states be unstable. In this study we develop a systematic approach to investigate the stability property of stationary states in this and other networks within the framework of network kinematic wave theories. Based on the observation that kinematic waves propagate in a circular path when only one of the two intermediate links is congested, we derive a one-dimensional, discrete Poincare map in the out-flux at a Poincare section. We then prove that the fixed points of the Poincare map correspond to stationary flow-rates on the two links. With Lyapunov's first method, we demonstrate that the Poincare map can be finite-time stable, asymptotically stable, or unstable. When unstable, the map is found to have periodical points of period two, but no chaotic solutions. We further analyze the bifurcation in the stability of the Poincare map caused by varying route choice proportions. We apply the Poincare map approach to analyzing traffic patterns in more general (DM)(n) and beltway networks, which are sufficient and necessary structures for network-induced unstable traffic and gridlock, respectively. This study demonstrates that the Poincare map approach can be efficiently applied to analyze traffic dynamics in any road networks with circular information propagation and provides new insights into unstable traffic dynamics caused by interactions among network bottlenecks.

The objective of this problem is to minimise the total cost incurred from a liner long-haul service route, including ship related costs, fuel consumption costs, port related costs, laden containers and empty container inventory-in-transition costs. We propose a three-stage optimisation method to tackle the problem. We introduce the notions of topological structure and ship load factors, which lead to a classification of shipping route structures and the relationships between the container flow pattern and the route structure. This greatly simplifies the route structure design decisions at the first stage and enables us to develop an efficient heuristic algorithm to reposition empty containers at the second stage. The ship deployment problem concerning the number of ships and their capacity and sailing speeds is considered at the third stage. The model takes advantage of the characteristics of the existing route structures and can solve the service route design problems effectively from the practical perspective.

By observing the actual flight-cancellation choices made by airline dispatchers, the airlines' cancellation utility functions can be inferred through the use of binary choice models. The model captures how delays to a given flight and potential delay savings to other flights affect flight cancellation decisions. We also find larger, fuller, less frequent, shorter-distance, and spoke-bound flights are less likely to be cancelled, and that there is inter-airline variation in flight cancellation behaviour.

They seek to reduce transportation costs through consolidation of shipments at hubs, but are restricted by the high levels of service to provide less circuitous routings. This paper develops a continuous approximation model for time definite transportation from many origins to many destinations. We consider a transportation carrier serving a fixed geographic region in which demand is modeled as a continuous distribution and time definite service levels are imposed by limiting the maximum travel distance via the hub network. Analytical expressions are developed for the optimal number of hubs, hub locations, and transportation costs. Computational results for an analogous discrete demand model are presented to illustrate the behavior observed with the continuous approximation models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The notion of space-time inhomogeneity refers to the fact that governing laws of traffic, essentially dictated by fundamental diagrams (FD), differ from each other in distinct space-time regions. Such a scenario is common when exogenous inputs, e.g. a group of slowly moving vehicles, emerge in the modeling process. We will prove the well-posedness of this class of problems. More importantly, we show that if the boundary delineating two neighboring regions is continuous and has bounded speed, this problem can be greatly simplified by introducing a piecewise linear approximation to the boundary. In particular, we utilize the variational formulation of the kinematic wave model and prove that this approximation results in uniformly bounded errors in cumulative flow N which are proportional to the L-infinity deviation of the approximation. The numerical solution of this simplified problem is well understood, and this result means that a kinematic wave model with space-time inhomogeneity can be solved accurately with any existing Godunov type scheme. Finally, using the inhomogeneous LWR model, we explain the capacity drop as a natural result of space-time inhomogeneity. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Li, Jia; Zhang, H.

Such investments are costly but allow liners to provide better service. Most of these new terminals are dedicated terminals but some are non-exclusive and let rivals access them for a fee. In this paper, we show that a shipping line that builds its own terminal finds it strategically profitable (i) to continue routing part of its cargo through the open port facilities, and (ii) to keep its terminal non-exclusive. In this way, the liner investor pushes part of the rival's freight from the open to the new terminal. Besides, under non-exclusivities, the shipping lines offer a wider variety of services, total freight increases and the resulting equilibrium fares are higher than with a dedicated terminal.

Using concepts from the activity-based modeling and social networks fields, a prototype model was created using Python incorporating utility-based agents who used a protocol to communicate with each other about potential activities in order to negotiate a suitable day and location. It can be shown that agents with a large number of acquaintances participated in more activities.

On the basis of an in-depth analysis of the demand and supply sides of the bimodal transportation system, the mode choice equilibrium of travelers along the continuum corridor is first presented and formulated as an equivalent variational inequality problem. The solution properties of the bimodal continuum equilibrium formulation are analytically explored. Two models, which account for different infrastructure/system regulatory regimes (public and private), are then proposed. In the public regulatory model, the road toll location and charge level are simultaneously optimized together with the bus service fare and frequency. In the private regulatory model, the fare and frequency of bus services, which are operated by a profit-driven private operator, are optimized for exogenously given toll pricing schemes. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the application of the proposed models. Sensitivity analysis of residential/household distribution along the corridor is carried out together with a comparison of four different toll pricing schemes (no toll, first best, distance based, and location based). Insightful findings are reported on the interrelationships among modal competition, market regulatory regimes, toll pricing schemes, and urban configurations as well as their implications in practice.

However, this raises the question of route choice behavior in case of heterogeneous urban networks, where different parts of the city are subject to different types of control. Traffic equilibrium phenomena have not been thoroughly investigated in these models. Approximate traffic equilibrium conditions can be integrated within the parsimonious traffic models to develop regional routing strategies, while detailed route choice strategies can be incorporated at a later stage in a hierarchical framework. In this study, we develop an aggregated and approximate dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) procedure to be incorporated in the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) dynamics, and establish dynamic stochastic user equilibrium (DSUE) conditions. The methodology consists of two main components; stochastic network loading and a fixed-point solution method. Loading procedure is designed to handle stochastic components in the model such as trip length uncertainty, variation of speeds across the links, perception error of travelers. The results taken from this procedure are averaged through the well-known method of successive averages (MSA) to reach fixed-point solution for the system. Real-time route guidance strategies can be revisited towards a system of systems approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In monitoring practice, it is often that cracking type with its worst damage level is selected as a representative condition state, while other cracking types and their damage levels are neglected in records, remaining as hidden information. Therefore, the practice in monitoring has a potential to conceal with a bias selection process, which possibly result in not optimal intervention strategies. In overcoming these problems, our paper presents a non-homogeneous Markov hazard model, with competing hazard rates. Cracking condition states are classified in three types (longitudinal crack, horizontal crack, and alligator crack), with three respective damage levels. The dynamic selection of cracking condition states are undergone a competing process of cracking types and damage levels. We apply a numerical solution using Bayesian estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to solve the problem of high-order integration of complete likelihood function.

A commonly used solution to give priority to buses at signalized intersections is to dedicate a lane for bus-use only. However this strategy can waste valuable green time at signals and impose additional delays to cars, especially when bus flows are low. Overall, the total person hours of delays in the system (i.e., buses and cars) can increase due to excessive delays experienced by car users. To this end, an additional signal upstream of the main signal, called a pre-signal, can be used to better utilize the capacity of the main signal while still providing bus priority to reduce the system-wide person hours of delays. The aim of this research is to analytically quantify and empirically evaluate the delays encountered by cars and buses with the use of pre-signals. The ultimate goal is to provide domains of applications for the proposed strategy. The paper presents analytical formulations to compute bus and car delays using queuing theory. The analytical models show that for a wide range of cases pre-signals can minimize the system-wide person hours of delays, as compared to dedicating a lane for bus-use only or operating buses and cars completely mixed. The analytical model is validated with empirical data collected at an existing pre-signal, which shows that the delay predictions of the model closely follow reality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Data received from such vehicles can provide valuable traffic and traffic safety information in respect of the covered routes and the connecting road network. In this study, trucks negotiating their normal daily haulage trips were used as probe-vehicles and the data recording their vehicular emergency events, such as abrupt braking events, detected by their on-board vehicular safety systems were analysed. The motivation for such an analysis is manifold. The aspect emphasized here is that the recorded vehicular emergency actions and events can be seen as surrogate safety events. Some of these surrogate safety events mark traffic incidents and therefore can be used as input by the surrogate safety assessment methodology. Though the vehicular emergency data used herein provides only sparse spatial and temporal coverage of the road network investigated, its analysis led to some interesting findings about interactions between drivers, trucks and roads.

Stochastic service and travel times on road segments are considered. The problem is formulated as a variation of the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP). A chance-constrained programming model is firstly developed and solved by a branch-and-cut algorithm. A stochastic programming model with recourse is also proposed to take into account the recourse costs in case of route failure. The problem is solved by an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm. The computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Train platformability depends not only on the infrastructure, buffer times, and the desired departure and arrival times of the trains, but also on route durations, which depend on train speeds and lengths, as well as on conflicts between routes at any given time. We consider all these factors in this paper. We assume a current train set and a future one, where the second is based on the expected traffic increase through the station considered. The platforming problem is about assigning a platform to each train, together with suitable in-and out-routes. Route choices lead to different route durations and imply different in-route-begin and out-route-end times. Our module platforms the maximum possible weighted sum of trains in the current and future train set. The resulting number of trains can be seen as the realistic capacity consumption of the schedule. Our goal function allows for current trains to be preferably allocated to their current platforms. Our module is able to deal with real stations and train sets in a few seconds and has been fully integrated by Infrabel, the Belgian Infrastructure Management Company, in their application called Ocapi, which is now used to platform existing and projected train sets and to determine the capacity consumption.

When these transport services follow in a natural transport chain they are characterized as complementarities and the firms providing the services can, as for substitutes, to some extent influence the demand facing the other firms by their own behaviour. A model is presented in this paper where two firms compete in complementary transport services differentiated by travel distance. Equilibria are derived for collusion and competition in price and quantity, and these are analyzed with respect to the degree of complementarity and distance. The analysis shows that the influence of type of competition on equilibrium price and quantity increases with the complementarity of the products. Moreover, it is discussed how marginal operating costs for the firms, marginal time cost for the passenger and the type of competition influences whether fares will increase with distance and which of the two firms will set the higher price. The commonly accepted ranking for complements that the collusive price is lower than the Bertrand price is not necessarily true. It is demonstrated that the collusive price of the shorter (longer) distance could be set above (lower) that of price competition. It is also addressed how mark-up of price over marginal cost is influenced by changes in own and competitors distance for the different types of competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Following an oscillation, traffic initially exhibits lower density and flow; then it evolves toward and eventually exceeds the equilibrium, whereupon another oscillation is instigated by an aggressive driver(s) with relatively small response time and minimum spacing. Thereafter, traffic reverts to lower density and flow and repeats the evolutionary cycle. Aggressive driver behavior also leads to hysteresis loops that induce the upstream propagation of oscillations; with larger hysteresis loops inducing larger oscillation growth. Our finding also suggests that the bottleneck discharge rate can diminish by 8-23% when drivers adopt larger response times in reaction to disturbances. This finding suggests that existing capacity-drop theories, with lane-changes as the main factor, may be incomplete. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This property is then used to discuss the characteristics and magnitudes of microscopic hysteresis in stop-and-go traffic. At the macroscopic level, according to the distribution of neutral lines for heterogeneous drivers, different congestion propagation patterns are reproduced and found to be consistent with Newell's car following theory. The connection between the asymmetric driving behavior and macroscopic hysteresis in the flow-density diagram is also analyzed and their magnitudes are shown to be positively related.

J,"Daganzo, CF",,,,"Daganzo, Carlos F.",,,On the design of public infrastructure systems with elastic demand,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,System design; Elastic demand; Optimization,,"This paper considers the optimization of public infrastructure systems, recognizing that these systems serve multiple user classes. Example application domains include: public transportation systems, electricity distribution grids, urban water distribution systems, and maintenance of pavement and bridge systems. Under the guidance of a policy-making body, the analyst chooses both the system design, including its layout and control, and the prices to be charged for the service. The goal of the optimization is to maximize society's welfare recognizing that the system's performance will in general depend on the system's demand, and vice versa. The optimization problem is first formulated in its full complexity, where the prices, the demand and the system design are to be determined. It is then shown that if the user classes recognized in the analysis can be priced independently, and if the policy setting body specifies either the demand levels or the generalized prices experienced by each user group, then the resulting welfare maximization problem decomposes into three sub-problems that can be solved sequentially: demand estimation, system design and pricing. It also turns out that the optimum design can always be obtained by minimizing the generalized cost of the system to society for the known fixed demand, as is conventionally done in practice. The resulting design is independent of how net user benefits are measured and of the pricing scheme. If the policy-making body does not specify cost or demand targets, and instead assesses benefits by means of consumer surplus then the optimum design is still the solution of a conventional design problem with fixed demand. In this case, however, the demand has to be obtained iteratively using a marginal cost pricing rule. The paper finally shows how government can structure payments to a for-profit agency so it will be induced to design and operate the system optimally for society. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the future weather condition is only predictable with a certain degree of accuracy, managing traffic in the weather-affected airspace is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a geometric model to generate an optimal combination of ground delay and route choice to hedge against weather risk. The geometric recourse model (GRM) is a strategic Probabilistic Air Traffic Management (PATM) model that generates optimal route choice, incorporating route hedging and en-route recourse to respond to weather change: hedged routes are routes other than the nominal or the detour one, and recourse occurs when the weather restricted airspace becomes flyable and aircraft are re-routed to fly direct to the destination. Among several variations of the GRM, we focus on the hybrid Dual Recourse Model (DRM), which allows ground delay as well as route hedging and recourses, when the weather clearance time follows a uniform distribution. The formulation of the hybrid DRM involves two decision variables - ground delay and route choice - and four parameters: storm location, storm size, maximum storm duration time, and ground-airborne cost ratio. The objective function has two components: expected total ground delay cost and expected total airborne cost. We propose a solution algorithm that guarantees to find the global optimum of the hybrid-DRM. Based on the numerical analysis, we find that ground-holding is effective only when combined with the nominal route. Otherwise, it is optimal to fly on the route determined by the DRM without ground delay. We also find the formula of the threshold ground-airborne cost ratio, which we call the Critical Cost Ratio (CCR), that determines the efficacy of ground delay: the higher the CCR, the more effective the strategies involving ground delay. We conclude that both ground delay and route hedging should be considered together to produce the best ATM decisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The DF approach was developed to predict traffic oscillation propagation across a platoon of vehicles following each other by a nonlinear car-following law with only the leading vehicle's input. We first simplify the DF approach and prove a set of properties (e.g., existence and uniqueness of its solution) that assure its prediction is always consistent with observed traffic oscillation patterns. Then we integrate the DF approach with existing estimation models of fuel consumption and emission to analytically predict environmental impacts (i.e., unit-distance fuel consumption and emission) from traffic oscillation. The prediction results by the DF approach are validated with both computer simulation and field measurements. Further, we explore how to utilize advantageous features of emerging sensing, communication and control technologies, such as fast response and information sharing, to smooth traffic oscillation and reduce its environmental impacts. We extend the studied car-following law to incorporate these features and apply the DF approach to demonstrate how these features can help dampen the growth of oscillation and environmental impact measurements. For information sharing, we convert the corresponding extended car-following law into a new fixed point problem and propose a simple bisecting based algorithm to efficiently solve it. Numerical experiments show that these new car-following control strategies can effectively suppress development of oscillation amplitude and consequently mitigate fuel consumption and emission.

The mathematical model is a complicated nonlinear mixed-integer programming. The object of the model reflects sensitivity of trains with different types or travelling mileages on delay. A heuristic method based on the global conflicts distribution prediction (COP) is presented. In the CDP, two critical problems restricting the development of simulation method, i.e., train deadlock and near-optimal travel strategy of train, are effectively solved. Numerical experiments show that the CDP can obtain a solution close enough to the optimal solution within a very short computational time.

Researchers claim that this paradox affects most firms and that it explains the inconsistent VOR estimates found in the transportation economics literature. Our investigation reveals that firms interested in high product availability may safely ignore the paradox and that less lead-time variability consistently increases VOR, the paradox notwithstanding.

We adopt a model based on the classical two-route network in which free-flow travel times and/or capacities on each route vary unpredictably due to such shocks as bad weather, accidents, and special events. We show that the benefits of information depend on differences between routes in free-flow costs, the shape of the travel cost functions, the severity of congestion and capacity shocks, and the degree of correlation between routes in travel conditions. Information is more likely to be welfare-reducing when free-flow travel costs differ appreciably, travel cost functions are convex, shocks are similar in size on the routes, and route conditions are strongly and positively correlated.

Pre-disaster planning requires assumptions about how the transport network may degrade. This paper presents a game theoretic approach modelling network degradation and applies this to depot location, with a case study based on Sichuan province in China, which is prone to earthquakes. To facilitate a cautious approach to depot location, the method assumes that the transport network is subject to attack by node-specific demons with the power to degrade links. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the non-cooperative zero sum game between dispatchers and demons is used to define rescue hyperpaths. These in turn define the best depot locations. Two forms of the drop heuristic are used to find good depot locations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Bell, Michael G.

Metro network resilience to disruptions can be enhanced by leveraging on public bus services. To ensure better acceptance among operators and commuters, we focus on introducing localized integration with bus services instead of designing an entirely new bus network to achieve the desired resilience to potential disruptions. This is accomplished by increasing the capacity of bus services that run in parallel with affected metro lines as well as those connecting to different metro lines. Our analysis starts with a network representation to model the integrated metro and bus system. A two-stage stochastic programming model is further developed to assess the intrinsic metro network resilience as well as to optimize the localized integration with bus services. The approach is applied to a case study based on the Singapore public transit system and actual travel demand data. The results show that the metro network resilience to disruptions can be enhanced significantly from localized integration with public bus services. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that such cooperation reduces traffic in markets where prior modal competition occurs, but may increase traffic in other markets of the network. The cooperation improves welfare, independent of whether or not the hub capacity is constrained, as long as the modal substitutability in the overlapping markets is low. However, if the modal substitutability is high, then hub capacity plays an important role in assessing the welfare impact: If the hub airports are significantly capacity-constrained, the cooperation improves welfare; otherwise, it is likely welfare reducing. Through simulations we further study the welfare effects of modal asymmetries in the demands and costs, heterogeneous passenger types, and economies of traffic density. Our analysis shows that the economies of traffic density alone cannot justify airline-HSR cooperation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

When the user has (alpha, beta, gamma) scheduling preferences, we show that the optimal head start decreases with service reliability, as expected. It does not necessarily decrease with service frequency, however. We derive the value of service headway (VoSH) and the value of service reliability (VoSR), which measure the marginal effect on the expected travel cost of a change in the mean and in the standard deviation of headways, respectively. The VoSH and the VoSR complete the value of time and the value of reliability for the economic appraisal of public transit projects by capturing the specific link between headways, waiting times, and congestion.

Currently, the focus is on treating synthesis as a fitting problem and thus various techniques have been developed, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and Combinatorial Optimization based techniques. The key shortcomings of these procedures include: (a) fitting of one contingency table, while there may be other solutions matching the available data (b) due to cloning rather than true synthesis of the population, losing the heterogeneity that may not have been captured in the microdata (c) over reliance on the accuracy of the data to determine the cloning weights (d) poor scalability with respect to the increase in number of attributes of the synthesized agents. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation based approach. Partial views of the joint distribution of agent's attributes that are available from various data sources can be used to simulate draws from the original distribution. The real population from Swiss census is used to compare the performance of simulation based synthesis with the standard IPF. The standard root mean square error statistics indicated that even the worst case simulation based synthesis (SRMSE = 0.35) outperformed the best case IPF synthesis (SRMSE = 0.64). We also used this methodology to generate the synthetic population for Brussels, Belgium where the data availability was highly limited. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Classic queuing concepts were used to develop a method by which an intermediate, or counterfactual, queuing scenario could be constructed, to isolate the delay effects due to shifts in demand and throughput. This method includes the development of a stochastic throughput function that is based entirely on data and has three key features. Firstly, the function relies on non-parametric, empirically-based probability distributions of throughput counts. Secondly, facility capacity needs not be explicitly defined, as it is implicitly included in the probability distributions of throughput. Thirdly, the throughput performance function preserves the effect of factors that cause capacity (and, therefore, throughput) to fluctuate over a given period. Temporal sequences of high, moderate, and low capacity are maintained between the observed and counterfactual scenarios. The method was applied to a case study of the three major New York area airports of LaGuardia (LGA), Newark Liberty (EWR), and John F. Kennedy (JFK), using operational data extracted from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) database. The focus was on the peak summer travel seasons of 2006 and 2007, as these airports experienced record levels of delay in 2007. The results indicate that decreases in both demand and throughput were experienced at LGA and EWR, although the decreases in throughput had more significant effects on operational delays as they increased overall at these airports. At JFK, the increase in departure throughput was not sufficient to offset the increase in departure demands. For arrivals, demand increased and throughput decreased. These trends caused a significant growth in delay at JFK between 2006 and 2007. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

On one hand, EV batteries are still expensive and limited by range, owing to the lack of technology breakthrough. On the other hand, the underdeveloped supporting infrastructure, particularly the lack of fast refueling facilities, makes EVs unsuitable for medium and long distance travel. The primary purpose of this study is to better understand these hurdles and to develop strategies to overcome them. To this end, a conceptual optimization model is proposed to analyze travel by EVs along a long corridor. The objective of the model is to select the battery size and charging capacity (in terms of both the charging power at each station and the number of stations needed along the corridor) to meet a given level of service in such a way that the total social cost is minimized. Two extensions of the base model are also considered. The first relaxes the assumption that the charging power at the stations is a continuous variable. The second variant considers battery swapping as an alternative to charging. Our analysis suggests that (1) the current paradigm of charging facility development that focuses on level 2 charging delivers poor level of service for long distance travel; (2) the level 3 charging method is necessary not only to achieve a reasonable level of service, but also to minimize the social cost; (3) investing on battery technology to reduce battery cost is likely to have larger impacts on reducing the charging cost; and (4) battery swapping promises high level of service, but it may not be socially optimal for a modest level of service, especially when the costs of constructing swapping and charging stations are close.

Congestion from intercontinental flights is common across intercontinental airports since departure and arrival airports are linked one to one, while purely domestic traffic also uses each airport. The paper focuses on two questions. First, if both continents can strategically set separate airport charges for domestic and intercontinental flights, how will the outcome differ from the first-best solution? Second, how is strategic airport behavior affected by the extent of market power of the airlines serving the intercontinental market? We see that strategic airport pricing and capacity choices by regulators lead to a welfare loss: the regulators both behave as monopolists in the market for intercontinental flights, charging a mark-up and decreasing capacity. This welfare loss even overshadows possible negative effects from imperfect competition within the intercontinental airline market. We further discuss how the presence of multiple regulators on one continent or a simple pricing rule might constrain the welfare loss created by strategic airport regulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effect that this guardian-supervising practice has on adolescent drivers' crash-injury severity (should a crash occur) is not well understood. This paper seeks to provide insights into the injury-prevention effectiveness of guardian supervision by developing an appropriate econometric structure to account for the complex interactions that are likely to occur in the study of the heterogeneous effects of guardian supervision on crash-injury severities. As opposed to conventional heterogeneity models with standard distributional assumptions, this paper deals with the heterogeneous effects by accounting for the possible multivariate characteristics of parameter distributions in addition to allowing for multimodality, skewness and kurtosis. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for estimation and the permutation sampler proposed by Fruhwirth-Schnatter (2001) is extended for model identification. The econometric analysis shows the presence of two distinct driving environments (defined by roadway geometric and traffic conditions). Model estimation results show that, in both of these driving environments, the presence of guardian supervision reduces the crash-injury severity, but in interestingly different ways. Based on the findings of this research, a case could easily be made for extending the time-requirement for guardian supervision in current graduated driver license programs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we apply a robust optimization (RO) approach based on a bi-level cellular particle swarm optimization (BCPSO) to optimal congestion pricing problems when flows correspond to dynamic user equilibrium on the network of interest. Such a formulation is recognized as a second-best pricing problem, and we refer to it as the dynamic optimal toll problem with equilibrium constraints (DOTPEC). We then present numerical experiments in which BCPSO is compared with two alternative robust dynamic solution approaches: bi-level simulated annealing (BSA) and cutting plane-based simulated annealing (CPSA), as well as a nominal dynamic solution and a robust static solution. We show that robust dynamic solutions improve the worst case, average, and stability of total travel cost in comparison with the nominal dynamic and the robust static solutions. The numerical results also show that BCPSO outperforms BSA and CPSA in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This is done by developing a nonlinear optimization model with the objective to maximize the opportunities to predict empty dilemma zones during a look-ahead time period subject to the prediction accuracy which is manifested through prediction efficiency and safety constraints in the model. The distance of the APTD from the stop bar of the intersection represents the decision variable. The Golden-Section line search algorithm combined with numerical integration techniques is proposed to identify the feasible region and the optimal solution. The proposed methodology is analyzed using field data from a high-speed isolated intersection in Lincoln, Nebraska. The numerical experiments demonstrate that as the constraints associated with prediction efficiency and safety are relaxed, the feasible range to deploy the APTD increases. The optimal solution is influenced by the relationship between the prediction error and the location of the APTD, illustrating the need to robustly calibrate the function used to estimate the variance of the prediction error using field data. From a practice standpoint, the study confirms the potential concerns related to the performance efficiency of green termination systems using a point detector; typical field implementations locate the detector 750-1000 ft from the stop bar, which can potentially lead to significant levels of missed opportunities to terminate green safely. Overall, the proposed approach not only provides a systematic analytical methodology to determine the optimal location of the advance detector, but also to identify its feasible range based on user-specified thresholds related to efficiency and safety.

Most previous studies up to date focus on investigation of the effects of speed limits from a local perspective, while network-wide traffic reallocation effects are overlooked. This paper makes the first attempt to investigate how a link-specific speed limit law reallocates traffic flow in an equilibrium manner at a macroscopic network level. We find that, although the link travel time-flow relationship is altered after a speed limit is imposed, the standard traffic assignment method still applies. With the commonly adopted assumptions, the uniqueness of link travel times at user equilibrium (UE) remains valid, and the UE flows on links with non-binding speed limits are still unique. The UE flows on other links with binding speed limits may not be unique but can be explicitly characterized by a polyhedron or a linear system of equalities and inequalities. Furthermore, taking into account the traffic reallocation effects of speed limits, we compare the capability of speed limits and road pricing for decentralizing desirable network flow patterns. Although from a different perspective for regulating traffic flows with a different mechanism, a speed limit law may play the same role as a toll charge scheme and perform better than some negative (rebate) toll schemes under certain conditions for network flow management.

Both target's and bidder's shareholders are better-off, but most of the synergistic gains accrue to the target's shareholders. Targets' valuation effects are greater for vertical rather than horizontal mergers, indicating a positive valuation for firms that control and manage a more extensive supply chain.

We consider the fundamental tradeoff between benefits from queuing delay reduction and costs due to simultaneous schedule delay increase to passengers while imposing slot limits at airports. A set of quantitative models and simulation procedures are developed to explore the possible airline scheduling responses through reallocating and trimming flights. We find that, of the 35 major US airports, a more widespread use of slot controls would improve travelers' welfare. The results from our analyses suggest that slot caps at the four airports that currently have slot controls (Washington Reagan, Newark, New York LaGuardia, New York John F. Kennedy) are set too high. Further slot reduction by removing some of the flights at these airports could generate additional benefits to passengers. Slot controls can potentially reduce two thirds of the total system delays caused by congestion. A number of implementation and design issues related to the use of slot controls are also discussed in the paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The results also indicate that if passengers choose access mode in advance they consider service frequency: departure timing from home, and the arrival timing at the airport.

Two sources of uncertainty are considered: the set-up costs for the hubs and the demands to be transported between the nodes. Generic models are presented for single and multiple allocation versions of the problems. Firstly, the two sources of uncertainty are analyzed separately and afterwards a more comprehensive model is proposed considering all sources of uncertainty. Using a set of computational tests performed, we analyze the changes in the solutions driven by the different sources of uncertainty considered isolated and combined. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study proposes an adaptive information fusion model to predict the short-term link travel time distribution by iteratively combining past information on link travel time on the current day with the real-time link travel time information available at discrete time points. The past link travel time information is represented as a discrete distribution. The real-time link travel time is represented as a range, and is characterized using information quality in terms of information accuracy and time delay. A nonlinear programming formulation is used to specify the adaptive information fusion model to update the short-term link travel time distribution by focusing on information quality. The model adapts good information by weighing it higher while shielding the effects of bad information by reducing its weight. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed model adequately represents the short-term link travel time distribution in terms of accuracy and robustness, while ensuring consistency with ambient traffic flow conditions. Further, they illustrate that the mean of a representative short-term travel time distribution is not necessarily a good tracking indicator of the actual (ground truth) time-dependent travel time on that link. Parametric sensitivity analysis illustrates that information accuracy significantly influences the model, and dominates the effects of time delay and the consistency constraint parameter. The proposed information fusion model bridges key methodological gaps in the ITS deployment context related to information fusion and the need for short-term travel time distributions.

Similar routing and allocation decisions are studied for commercial settings where efficiency, in terms of minimizing cost, is the primary objective. Humanitarian relief is complicated by the presence of multiple objectives beyond minimizing cost. Routing and allocation decisions should result in quick and sufficient distribution of relief supplies, with a focus on equitable service to all aid recipients. However, quantifying such goals can be challenging. In this paper, we define and formulate performance metrics in relief distribution. We focus on efficacy (i.e., the extent to which the goals of quick and sufficient distribution are met) and equity (i.e., the extent to which all recipients receive comparable service). We explore how efficiency, efficacy, and equity influence the structure of vehicle routes and the distribution of resources. We identify trends and routing principles for humanitarian relief based on the analytical properties of the resulting problems and a series of computational tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the paper proves that the covariances in any GEV model are always expressed by a one-dimensional integral, whose integrand function is available in closed form as a function of the generating function of the GEV model. This integral may be simulated very easily with a parsimonious computational burden. Two practical examples are also presented. The first is an application to the CNL model, so as to check the consistency of the proposed method with the results already established in the literature. The second deals with the calculation of the covariances of the Network GEV (NGEV) model: notably, the NGEV is the most general type of GEV model available so far, and its covariances have not yet been calculated. On this basis, insights on the domain of the covariances reproduced by the NGEV model are also presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on European data for 2002-2013, we find that network airlines reduce frequencies when the share of low-cost airlines increases both on the route and at the hub airport. On the contrary, frequency choices of network airlines are not affected by competition from low-cost airlines operating in nearby secondary airports. We also find some evidence that mergers in Europe may result in a re-organization of the route structure in favor of the hubs of the larger airline. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The upper-level problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear program with the objective of minimizing the number of passenger transfers, and the lower-level problem is the transit assignment problem with capacity constraints. A hybrid artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is developed to solve the bi-level problem. This algorithm relies on the ABC algorithm to design route structures and a proposed descent direction search method to determine an optimal frequency setting for a given route structure. The descent direction search method is developed by analyzing the optimality conditions of the lower-level problem and using the relationship between the lower- and upper-level objective functions. The step size for updating the frequency setting is determined by solving a linear integer program. To efficiently repair route structures, a node insertion and deletion strategy is proposed based on the average passenger demand for the direct services concerned. To increase the computation speed, a lower bound of the objective value for each route design solution is derived and used in the fitness evaluation of the proposed algorithm. Various experiments are set up to demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm and the properties of the problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Szeto, W.

We first construct a one-sided Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (O-VCG) combinatorial auction for the DTPP where carriers are allowed to bid on bundles of lanes. The O-VCG auction minimizes the total transportation cost (i.e., allocative efficiency) and induces truthful bidding from carriers (i.e., incentive compatibility). To simplify the execution of auction, we next propose a primal-dual Vickrey (PDV) auction based on insights from the known Ausubel auctions and the primal-dual algorithm. The PDV auction is actually a multi-round descending auction that seems simple enough for bidders. The PDV auction realizes VCG payments and truthful bidding under the condition of seller-submodularity, which implies that the effect of each individual carrier is decreasing when the coalition increases. Such is the case for the DTPP in an oversupplied transportation market. The winner determination problem of O-VCG auction is solved by the proposed primal-dual algorithm when seller-submodularity holds. Finally, carriers may reveal less private information in the PDV auction due to its dynamic procedures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The preference structure reflects that there is a distinction between the (exogenous) 'long-run preferred arrival time', which would be relevant if consumers were unconstrained in the scheduling of their activities, and the 'short-run preferred arrival time', which is the result of an adaptation of travel routines in the face of constraints caused by, in particular, time-varying congestion levels. We characterize the unpriced equilibrium, the social optimum as well as second-best situations where the availability of the pricing instruments is restricted. All of them entail a dispersed distribution of short-run preferred arrival times. We obtain the intriguing results that the dispersion is lower in the social optimum than in the unpriced equilibrium, and that the application of first-best short-run tolls does not induce efficient long-run choices of travel routines.

We assume further that users have different preferences in the sense that for any given path with a specific toll, there is a limit on the time that an individual would be willing to spend. Different users can have different preferences represented by this indifference curve between toll and time. Time surplus is defined as the maximum time minus the actual time. Given a set of paths, the one with the highest (or least negative) time surplus will be the preferred path for the individual. This will result in a bi-objective equilibrium solution satisfying the time surplus maximisation bi-objective user equilibrium (TSmaxBUE) condition. That is, for each O-D pair, all individuals are travelling on the path with the highest time surplus value among all the efficient paths between this O-D pair. We show that the TSmaxBUE condition is a proper generalisation of user equilibrium with generalised cost function, and that it is equivalent to bi-objective user equilibrium. We also present a multi-user class version of the TSmaxBUE condition and demonstrate our concepts with illustrative examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Wang, Judith Y.

The advantage of this approach over conventional within-day dynamic estimators is that of reducing drastically the number of unknowns given the same set of observed time-varying traffic counts. Obviously, the gain in accuracy depends on how realistic is the underlying assumption that total demand levels vary more rapidly over time than o-d shares. Firstly, the paper proposes a theoretical specification of the quasi-dynamic estimator. Subsequently, it proposes empirical and statistical tests to check the quasi-dynamic assumption and then compares the performances of the quasi-dynamic estimator of o-d flows with both classical off-line simultaneous dynamic estimators and on-line recursive Kalman filter-based estimators. Experiments are carried out on the real test site of A4-A23 motorways in North-Eastern Italy. Results confirm the acceptability of the assumption of quasi-dynamic o-d flows, even under the hypothesis of constant distribution shares for the whole day and show that the quasi-dynamic estimator outperforms significantly the simultaneous estimator. Data also suggest that using the quasi-dynamic estimates instead of the simultaneous estimates as historical o-d flows improves significantly the performances of the Kalman filter, which strongly depends of the quality of the seed o-d flows. In addition, it is shown that the aggregation of quasi-dynamic o-d estimates across subsequent time slices represents also the most effective way to obtain o-d estimates for larger time horizons (e.g. hourly estimates). Finally, a validation based on an hold-out sample of link flows (i.e. counts not used as inputs in the o-d estimation/updating process) revealed the quasi-dynamic estimator to be overall more robust and effective with respect to the other tested estimators.

It has also been shown that heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of density can significantly decrease the network flow for the same value of density. Analytical theories have been developed to explore the connection between network structure and an MFD for urban neighborhoods with cars controlled by traffic signals. However these theories have been applied only in cities with deterministic values of topological and control variables for the whole network and by ignoring the effect of turns. In our study we are aiming to generate an MFD for streets with variable link lengths and signal characteristics and understand the effect of variability for different cities and signal structures. Furthermore, this variability gives the opportunity to mimic the effect of turning movements. Route or network capacity can be significantly smaller than the capacity of a single link, because of the correlations developed through the different values of offsets. The above analysis would not be possible using standard traffic engineering techniques. This will be a key issue in planning the signal regimes such a way that maximizes the network capacity and/or the density range of the maximum capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we focus on the estimation of probability distribution of arterial route travel time, which contains more information regarding arterial performance measurements and travel time reliability. One of the fundamental contributions of this work is the integration of travel time correlation of route's successive links within the methodology. In the proposed technique, given probe vehicles travel times of the traversing links, a two-dimensional (2D) diagram is established with data points representing travel times of a probe vehicle crossing two consecutive links. A heuristic grid clustering method is developed to cluster each 2D diagram to rectangular sub spaces (states) with regard to travel time homogeneity. By applying a Markov chain procedure, we integrate the correlation between states of 2D diagrams for successive links. We then compute the transition probabilities and link partial travel time distributions to obtain the arterial route travel time distribution. The procedure with various probe vehicle sample sizes is tested on two study sites with time dependent conditions, with field measurements and simulated data. The results are very close to the Markov chain procedure and more accurate once compared to the convolution of links travel time distributions for different levels of congestion, even for small penetration rates of probe vehicles.

Observation of the video recordings made during the experiments reveals several typical forms of behavior related to preference for destination, effect of capacity, interaction between pedestrians, following behavior and evacuation efficiency. Based on these forms of behavior, a microscopic pedestrian model with discrete space representation is developed. In the model, two algorithms are proposed to describe the movement of pedestrians to a destination under conditions of both good and zero visibility, respectively.

Two heuristic procedures, Ant Colony and Genetic Algorithms, are developed for constructing optimal schedules for a fixed bus route. The paper presents a comparison of the fundamental features of the two algorithms. They are then calibrated based on data generated from micro-simulation of a bus route in Melbourne, Australia, to give rise to (near) optimal schedule designs. The algorithms are compared in terms of their accuracy and efficiency in providing the minimum cost solution. Although both procedures prove the ability to find the optimal solution, the Ant Colony procedure demonstrates a higher efficiency by evaluating less schedule designs to arrive at a 'good' solution. Potential benefits of the developed algorithms in bus route planning are also discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The main objective is to minimize the sum of vehicle fixed costs and routing cost, where the latter can be defined with respect to the cost of fuel and CO2 emissions, and driver cost. Solving this problem poses several methodological challenges. To this end, we have developed a powerful metaheuristic which was successfully applied to a large pool of realistic benchmark instances. Several analyses were conducted to shed light on the trade-offs between various performance indicators, including capacity utilization, fuel and emissions and costs pertaining to vehicle acquisition, fuel consumption and drivers.

The classic bottleneck theory is extended to include a uniformly distributed capacity and the commuters' equilibrium departure patterns are derived for two different merging rules. The results show that uncertainty in the bottleneck capacity increases the commuters' mean trip cost and lengthens the peak period, and that the system total cost is lower under give-way merging than under a fixed-rate merging. Capacity paradoxes with dynamic user responses are found under both merging rules. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the investigated model, a retailer is faced with uncertain lead time (LT) due to shipping time instability. Reducing lead time fluctuations is used as an incentive scheme to induce the retailer for participation in the coordination plan. Range of LT fluctuation which is acceptable for both parties is extracted. It is shown that using more reliable shipping equipment as an incentive could coordinate SC.

Existing methods for liner shipping network design mainly deal with port-to-port demand. However, most of the demand has inland origins and/or destinations. Thus, it is necessary to cope with inland origin-destination (OD) pairs involving a change in transport mode from inland transportation to maritime shipping. A method is first proposed to convert inland OD demand to port-to-port demand. Then, a framework for global intermodal liner shipping network design is proposed.

The main purpose of this paper is to present a method for precise computations of equilibrium derivatives.

This allows expressing the CNL covariances as a function of just a one-dimensional integral, which can be evaluated easily and effectively by means of standard numerical techniques, implementable also in basic computer spreadsheets. Firstly, a formal theoretical proof of the procedure is illustrated. Then, a comparison with the calculations performed by Marzano and Papola [Marzano, V., Papola, A., 2008. On the covariance structure of the Cross-Nested Logit model. Transportation Research B 42(2), 83-98] is proposed, and details about the practical implementation of the procedure are discussed.

These facilities themselves are often subject to service disruptions during or after the emergency. This paper proposes a reliable emergency facility location model that determines both pre-emergency facility location planning and the evacuation operations afterwards, while facilities are subject to the risk of disruptions. We analyze how evacuation resource availability leverages individual evacuees' response to service disruptions, and show how equilibrium of the evacuee arrival process could be reached at a functioning pick-up facility. Based on this equilibrium, an optimal resource allocation strategy is found to balance the tradeoff between the evacuees' risks and the evacuation agency's operation costs. This leads to the development of a compact polynomial-size linear integer programming formulation that minimizes the total expected system cost from both pre-emergency planning (e.g., facility set-up) and the evacuation operations (e.g., fleet management, transportation, and exposure to hazardous surroundings) across an exponential number of possible disruption scenarios. We also show how the model can be flexibly used to plan not only pre-disaster evacuation but also post-disaster rescue actions. Numerical experiments and an empirical case study for three coastal cities in the State of Mississippi (Biloxi, Gulfport, and D'Iberville) are conducted to study the performance of the proposed models and to draw managerial insights.

In this paper, we focus on this frequently-discussed question, and have succeeded in making a theoretical framework of a driving technique how to absorb a traffic jam by using a minimal microscopic model. Jam-absorption driving comes from Beaty (Beaty, 1998; Beaty, 2013), and it is composed of a sequence of two actions termed the slow-in and fast-out. The slow-in is the action to avoid being captured by a jam and remove it by decelerating and taking a longer headway in advance. The fast-out is performed after the slow-in, and it is the action to follow the car in front without unnecessary time gaps by accelerating quickly. In our theoretical framework, we have represented the recipe of the actions such as the time-space points and the velocity. Moreover, we have clarified the condition of no secondary jams due to this driving, i.e., the condition that compression and expansion waves caused by this driving meet each other and disappear. Particularly, we have calculated how these waves propagates to the following cars and the point where and when they disappear. Besides, we have analyzed how this point moves in time-space diagrams by varying the timing to start the jam-absorption, and revealed that the pattern of this movement is not constant but changes greatly by the velocity-headway relationships. Furthermore, as a more realistic problem, we have formulated the driving for jam-absorption in two steps of deceleration, which brings rich patterns of collisions among compression and expansion waves.

One popular formulation of this model is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that is discontinuous with respect to its state variable. As explained in Ban et al. (2011) and Han et al. (2013), such an irregularity induces difficulties in both continuous-time analysis and discrete-time computation. In Han et al. (2013), the authors proposed a reformulation of the Vickrey model as a partial differential equation (PDE) and derived a closed-form solution to the aforementioned ODE. This reformulation enables us to rigorously prove analytical properties of the Vickrey model and related DTA models. In this paper, we present the second of a two-part exploration regarding the PDE formulation of the Vickrey model. As proposed by Han et al. (2013), we continue research on the generalized Vickrey model (GVM) in a discrete-time framework and in the context of DTA by presenting a highly computable solution methodology. Our new computational scheme for the GVM is based on the closed-form solution mentioned above. Unlike finite-difference discretization schemes which could yield non-physical solutions (Ban et al., 2011), the proposed numerical scheme guarantees non-negativity of the queue size and the exit flow as well as first-in-first-out (FIFO). Numerical errors and convergence of the computed solutions are investigated in full mathematical rigor. As an application of the GVM, a class of network system optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA) problems is analyzed. We show existence of a continuous-time optimal solution and propose a discrete-time mixed integer linear program (MILP) as an approximation to the original SO-DTA. We also provide convergence results for the proposed MILP approximation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed maximum and minimum liner ship route capacity utilization problems are formulated as a linear programming model and a min-max model, respectively. We examine two fundamental properties of the min-max model. These two nice properties enable us to develop two epsilon-optimal global optimization algorithms for solving the min-max model, which find a globally epsilon-optimal solution by iteratively cutting off the bounded polyhedral container shipment demand set with a cut. The latter algorithm overcomes non-convexity of the remaining feasible demand set generated by the former algorithm via a novel hyperplane cut. Each hyperplane cut can assure that the current vertex of the polyhedral demand set is cut off, whereas solutions that may improve the current one by more than a factor of epsilon are retained. Extensive numerical experiments for problems larger than those encountered in real applications demonstrate the computational efficacy of the latter algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that the occurrence and type of traffic hysteresis is closely correlated with driver behavior when experiencing traffic oscillations and with the time driver reaction begins relative to the starting deceleration wave. Statistical results suggest that driver behavior is different depending on its position along the oscillation. This suggests that different car-following models should be used inside the different stages of an oscillation in order to replicate realistic congestion features.

Optimizing the production team (i.e., large maintenance team) schedule is a very complex problem with major cost implications. In current practice, the decision making process for production team scheduling is largely manual and primarily relies on the knowledge and judgment of experts. This paper addressed the production team scheduling problem by formulating it as a time space network model with many types of challenging side constraints. Some of these constraints are identified from industry practice and formulated for the first time. Multiple neighborhood search and other enhancement algorithms were proposed to solve the model. The proposed modeling approach has been tested through numerical experiments and also applied to large-scale real-world problem instances, and superior computational performances were found. The proposed approach has been adopted by a Class I railroad to help make annual network maintenance scheduling decisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective is to minimize the total relevant costs in the planning horizon including: container lifting on/off costs at ports, customer demand backlog costs, the demurrage (or waiting) costs at the transhipment ports for temporarily storing laden containers, the empty container inventory costs at ports, and the empty container transportation costs. The laden container routing from the original port to the destination port is limited with at most three service routes. Two solution methods are proposed to solve the optimization problem. The first is a two-stage shortest-path based integer programming method, which combines a cargo routing algorithm with an integer programming of the dynamic system. The second is a two-stage heuristic-rules based integer programming method, which combines an integer programming of the static system with a heuristic implementation algorithm in dynamic system. The two solution methods are applied to two case studies with 30 different scenarios and compared with a practical policy. The results show that two solution methods perform substantially better than the practical policy. The shortest-path based method is preferable for relatively small-scale problems as it yields slightly better solution than the heuristic-rules based method. However, the heuristic-rules based method has advantages in its applicability to large-scale realistic systems while producing good performance, to which the shortest-path based method may be computationally inapplicable. Moreover, the heuristic-rules based method can also be applied to stochastic situations because its second stage is rule-based and dynamical. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective function of the unconstrained formulation consists of two terms, in which the first term specifies the routing principle of the target problem through a satisfaction function and the sum of the first and second terms denotes the system cost or optimization objective. This formulation proves to be the Lagrangian dual of a generic primal formulation proposed by Maher et al. (2005) for the stochastic system-optimal problem. The primal-dual modeling framework presents such a common functional form that can accommodate a wide range of different traffic assignment problems. Our particular attention is given to the dual formulation in that its unconstrained feature opens the door of applying unconstrained optimization algorithms for its embraced traffic assignment problems. Numerical examples are provided to support the insights and facts derived from applying the primal and dual formulations to model stochastic system-optimal and user-equilibrium problems and justify the conjugate relationship between the primal and dual models.

The model assumes that users can come to the bus stop or rail station at random or they can plan their trips; the fraction of users who plan their trips is endogenous and depends on the frequency of service and on the quality of information provided. Four institutional regimes are considered, reflecting various degrees of government regulation. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical results. Findings include the following. First, fare regulation induces the firm to provide less frequency and less information than is socially optimal. Second, if information and frequency did not affect the number of planning users a higher fare always induces the firm to raise both frequency and the quality of information. With endogenous planning, however, this need not be the case, as the effect of higher fares strongly depends on how frequency and information quality affect the number of planners. Third, a profit-maximizing firm offers more information than a fare-regulated firm. Fourth, if the agency regulates both the fare and the quality of information then more stringent information requirements induce the firm to reduce frequency; this strongly limits the welfare improvement of information regulation. Finally, of all institutional structures considered, socially optimal fares, frequency and quality of information stimulate passengers least to plan their trips, because the high frequency offered reduces the benefits of trip planning.

The obtained insights indicate that longer optimized replenishment cycles reduce a node's transportation cost and CO2 emissions but increase its inventory costs. Moreover, under a fixed replenishment cycle, a node's service level increases when supplied by a satellite warehouse. Finally: (i) the costs of implementing optimal green network design decisions could be misleading if inventory planning is neglected, (ii) greening of supply chains could become expensive, (iii) current legislative CO2 ton prices hardly influence logistics networks.

The users' route choice behaviour is assumed to follow the Logit-based stochastic user equilibrium (SUE). We first propose a link-based convex programming model for the Logit-based SUE problem with a joint distance and time toll pattern. A mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) is developed to formulate the optimal joint distance and time toll design problem. The developed MPEC model is equivalently transformed into a semi-infinite programming (SIP) model. A global optimization method named Incremental Constraint Method (ICM) is designed for solving the SIP model. Finally, two numerical examples are used to assess the proposed methodology.

However, it omits taste heterogeneity, shorter travel times far out in the larger network arising from less blocking back of upstream links and the possibility for drivers to reschedule. Taking account of these factors, using a dynamic scheduling model with heterogeneous users we find that all three add significantly to the benefit of the Stockholm congestion charges and that drivers as a group benefit from these charges even without recycling of revenues.

Two equivalent formulas to obtain the number of links to be observed for complete link observability in non-planar hole-generated networks are given in terms of the numbers of links, nodes, holes, cycle added links and centroid node types. These formulas are applicable without any limitation in the number of centroids and possible link connections. Some simple methods are given to obtain first the maximum number of linearly independent (Li.) paths and next a minimum set of links to be counted in order to get observability of all link flows. It is demonstrated that the number of Li. paths in a non-planar hole-generated network coincides with the number of holes and cycle added links in the network and that any path can be obtained by linear combinations of the vectors associated with the hole and cycle added links.

We introduce a VRP based MIP model which assigns different types of towing tractors to jobs with specified service time windows. The objective function minimizes operating costs subject to operational restrictions such as technical compatibility of tractor types with plane types. Our modeling approach allows for multiple depots as well as multiple trips. To solve the model we develop a column generation heuristic. Computational results show the superior behavior of the proposed heuristic compared to the original MIP formulation solved with CPLEX. In a case study we derive insights which support schedulers in their daily work. For this, we identify cost drivers and evaluate the efficiency of manual schedules in retrospect.

We also examine the route structure configuration that maximizes welfare and whether it can arise as an equilibrium when a regulator implements optimal airport pricing, but does not regulate directly the route structure choice. We find that this is not always the case and that, therefore, an instrument directly aimed at regulating route structure choice may be needed to maximize welfare, in addition to per-passenger and per-flight tolls designed to correct output inefficiencies. This holds true when the regulator is constrained to set non-negative tolls, but also for unconstrained tolling.

In this hybrid flow model, the vehicles satisfy the LWR equation whenever possible, and have a constant acceleration otherwise. We first propose a mathematical definition of the solution as a minimization problem. We use this formulation to build a grid-free solution method for this model based on the minimization of component function. We then derive these component functions analytically for triangular fundamental diagrams, which are commonly used to model traffic flow. We also show that the proposed computational method can handle fixed or moving bottlenecks.

The opposite may also occur: high demand will induce the operator to increase supply, e.g. through an increase in frequency, which results in a higher level-of-service and a subsequent increase in passenger numbers, triggering another round of service improvements. This paper adds to the literature by presenting an analytic model for analyzing these phenomena that we call vicious and virtuous cycles. Based on field data regarding passengers' variation in willingness-to-wait for a public transport service, we investigate the dynamics of the line service and show how the emergence of a vicious or virtuous cycle depends on the total number of potential passengers, the share of captive riders, and bus capacity. The paper ends with a discussion of the implications of the findings for the planning of public transport services. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing reliability may lower productivity, as it requires inputs, that can't be used to produce outputs. The relationship between reliability and productivity also runs through other factors, in which case a positive relationship may be expected. We apply data envelopment analysis and the Malmquist index approach to a panel of seven European railway systems to explore this relationship. Our empirical results suggest that increasing reliability does not harm the productivity of railway operations and aiming to improve both may be a feasible strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we propose a method to approximate PMC in general networks when traffic dynamics are modeled by either the point-queue or the kinematic wave traffic flow model. This study examines in detail the flow interactions between downstream and upstream bottleneck links, and shows that the changes in cumulative flows on all the network links caused by an arbitrary flow perturbation can be computed. This offers a way to approximate PMC, which is incorporated in the solution of the least marginal cost problem, a central component of the path-based SO-DTA problem. The approximation scheme allows us to solve path-based SO-DTA problems for general networks with and without queue spillback and/or departure time choices. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that the SO state produces considerably lower total network cost, shorter congestion duration, and smaller travel delay on bottleneck links than those of produced by the user-optimal state, particularly when the departure time choice is considered.

However, the decisions taken in one area may influence the quality and even the feasibility of train schedules in the other areas. Regional control centers coordinate the dispatchers' work for multiple areas in order to regulate traffic at the global level and to avoid situations of global infeasibility. Differently from the dispatcher problem, the coordination activity of regional control centers is still underinvestigated, even if this activity is a key factor for effective traffic management. This paper studies the problem of coordinating several dispatchers with the objective of driving their behavior towards globally optimal solutions. With our model, a coordinator may impose constraints at the border of each dispatching area. Each dispatcher must then schedule trains in its area by producing a locally feasible solution compliant with the border constraints imposed by the coordinator. The problem faced by the coordinator is therefore a bilevel programming problem in which the variables controlled by the coordinator are the border constraints. We demonstrate that the coordinator problem can be solved to optimality with a branch and bound procedure. The coordination algorithm has been tested on a large real railway network in the Netherlands with busy traffic conditions. Our experimental results show that a proven optimal solution is frequently found for various network divisions within computation times compatible with real-time operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

By carefully studying the driving behavioral changes after the collapse of I-35W Mississippi River Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, we found that most of the existing day-to-day traffic assignment models would not be suitable for modeling the traffic evolution under network disruption, because they assume that drivers' travel cost perception depends solely on their experiences from previous days. When a significant network change occurs unexpectedly, travelers' past experience on a traffic network may not be entirely useful because the unexpected network change could disturb the traffic greatly. To remedy this, in this paper, we propose a prediction-correction model to describe the traffic equilibration process. A predicted flow pattern is constructed inside the model to accommodate the imperfect perception of congestion that is gradually corrected by actual travel experiences. We also prove rigorously that, under mild assumptions, the proposed prediction-correction process has the user equilibrium flow as a globally attractive point. The proposed model is calibrated and validated with the field data collected after the collapse of I-35W Bridge. This study bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and practical applications of day-to-day traffic equilibration approaches and furthers the understanding of traffic equilibration process after network disruption.

We consider a system with stochastic demand and a single consolidation point near the suppliers. We propose a look-ahead heuristic that takes advantage of economies of scale by aiming to ship larger quantities. We experimentally compare the heuristic's performance against other simple policies, a rolling horizon algorithm, and a stochastic dynamic programming model. Our numerical results demonstrate that the heuristic provides solutions that are near the lower bound provided by the dynamic programming model, and that the benefits of consolidating depend on the size of the suppliers' demand. We also propose a proportional cost allocation rule that encourages the suppliers to cooperate with each other instead of operating independently. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates economic spillovers between the freight and commodity derivatives markets. The economic relationship tested links the derivative price of the commodity transported with the derivative price on the freight rate. High frequency data on commodities are synchronised with freight data and freight rates of different vessels are matched with portfolios (baskets) of commodities that these vessels carry. The investigation of various types of commodities transported under different types of freight contracts reveal that in most cases new information appears first in the returns and volatilities of the commodities futures markets, before it is spilled over into the freight derivatives markets. Thus, agricultural commodity futures informationally lead the freight markets. The results can help improve the understanding of the information transmission mechanisms between freight and commodity markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper focuses on the analysis and optimization of travel time (including stopped delays) Reliability on the Urban Road Network in Chennai. Specifically, two objectives are investigated. The first objective involves the quantification of travel time reliability at the link and path level. In particular, the distribution of link travel times is quantified for the Chennai Urban road network using empirical data. The results indicate that the shifted log-normal distribution (SLN) reasonably represents link travel time for all facility types and relevant facility wise distribution parameters are estimated. Further, the resulting path travel time distribution is approximated by a SLN distribution, which is computationally less expensive than traditional Monte-Carlo estimation techniques with an acceptable compromise on accuracy. The second objective addresses the optimal reliability path problem on a network with SLN link travel times with general correlation structure. For this problem, it is shown that the sub-path optimality property of shortest path problems does not hold making traditional label-setting/label correcting algorithms inapplicable. Consequently, a sufficient optimality condition based on reliability bounds is established and a new network optimization algorithm is proposed and proof of correctness is presented. The convergence rate of the algorithm was shown to increase at every iteration under some mild conditions. The computational performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated using synthetic and real-world networks and found to be reasonably accurate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Pedestrians' street-crossing behavior is in general the outcome of interaction between pedestrians and vehicles: the gaps between vehicles provide an opportunity for pedestrians to cross the street, and pedestrians may or may not accept the street-crossing risk during the red-man phase. In this paper, we propose a multivariate method to investigate pedestrians' risk exposure associated with unsafe crossings. The proposed method consists of two hierarchically interconnected generalized linear models that characterize two different facets of the unsafe crossing behavior. It gauges pedestrians' attitudes toward risk-taking and also measures the impact of potential risk factors on pedestrians' intended waiting times during the red-man phase of the traffic lights. A Bayesian approach with the data augmentation method is used to draw statistical inference for the parameters associated with risk exposure. The proposed method is illustrated using field traffic data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, more and more transport studies start to make use of stated preference data to obtain precise knowledge on travelers' preferences. Accounting for the individual-specific coefficients in the mixed logit choice model, this research advocates an individualized design approach to generate these stated choice experiments. Individualized designs are sequentially generated for each person separately, using the answers from previous choice sets to select the next best set in a survey. In this way they are adapted to the specific preferences of an individual and therefore more efficient than an aggregate design. In order for individual sequential designs to be practicable, the speed of designing an additional choice set in an experiment is obviously a key issue. This paper introduces three design criteria used in optimal test design, based on Kullback-Leibler information, and compares them with the well known D-efficiency criterion to obtain individually adapted choice designs for the mixed logit choice model. Being equally efficient to D-efficiency and at the same time much faster, the Kullback-Leibler criteria are well suited for the design of individualized choice experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The latter are used less frequently, mainly because of the difficulties to collect the data required for the model estimation. One main requirement is knowledge of the (expected) travel times for both chosen and unchosen departure time alternatives. As the availability of such data is limited, most RP-based scheduling models only take into account travel times on trip segments rather than door-to-door travel times, or use very rough measures of door-to-door travel times. We show that ignoring the temporal and spatial variation of travel times, and, in particular, the correlation of travel times across links may lead to biased estimates of the value of time (VOT). To approximate door-to-door travel times for which no complete measurement is possible, we develop a method that relates travel times on links with continuous speed measurements to travel times on links where relatively infrequent GPS-based speed measurements are available. We use geographically weighted regression to estimate the location-specific relation between the speeds on these two types of links, which is then used for travel time prediction at different locations, days, and times of the day. This method is not only useful for the approximation of door-to-door travel times in departure time choice models, but is generally relevant for predicting travel times in situations where continuous speed measurements can be enriched with GPS data.

This study assesses the statistical significance of differences in the safety performance between owner-operators and employee drivers. This study also expands on previous driver focused safety models by examining how driver and carrier characteristics affect safety performance. Data for this study were derived from the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS), and the Commercial Driver's License Information System (CDLIS) databases. Study results provide evidence that owner-operators are associated with more driver- and vehicle-out-of-service violations but experience lower crash rates than do employee drivers.

Most models in the literature do not consider slot-purchasing, multi-type containers, empty container repositioning, or ship repositioning, and they formulate the numbers of containers to transport as continuous variables. This paper develops a mixed-integer linear programming model that captures all these elements. It further examines from the theoretical point of view the additional computational burden introduced by incorporating these elements in the planning model. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the effects of the elements on tactical planning decisions. Results demonstrate that slot-purchasing and empty container repositioning have the largest impact on tactical planning decisions and relaxing the numbers of containers as continuous variables has little impact on the decisions.

In this paper, we propose a kinematic wave theory for modeling dynamics of non-cooperative diverging traffic, in which traffic dynamics of vehicles to one direction are assumed to be independent of those to other directions instantaneously. During a short time interval, the kinematic wave model of diverging traffic is decoupled into a number of nonlinear resonant systems. From analytical solutions to the Riemann problem of a decoupled system, a new definition of partial traffic demand is introduced, so that diverging flows can be easily computed with the supply-demand method. Then a Cell Transmission Model is proposed to solve the kinematic wave model of diverging traffic by taking into account of the interactions among different traffic streams. Simulation results demonstrate that vehicles follow the First-In-First-Out principle in the long run, and the model converges when we decrease the cell and time-step sizes. In addition, it is shown that traffic streams to different directions segregate in a selfish manner, and the total throughput of a diverging junction is not maximized as in existing diverge models. In the future, more theoretical and empirical studies are needed for a better understanding of this and other diverge models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

They serve a mega-ship from two sides at dedicated berths. One of the key issues for higher utilization is how the dedicated berths serve other ships efficiently when they are idle. For this, we develop efficient heuristics for the berth allocation of the two terminals to identify a more productive terminal among them in terms of the total service time of both ordinary and mega-ships. A wide variety of experiments show the channel terminal is the most preferred. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It first derives the optimality condition for the sailing speed function with sea contingency and subsequently demonstrates the convexity of the bunker consumption function. A mixed-integer non-linear stochastic programming model is developed for the proposed liner ship route schedule design problem by minimizing the ship cost and expected bunker cost while maintaining a required transit time service level. In view of the special structure of the model, an exact cutting-plane based solution algorithm is proposed. Numerical experiments on real data provided by a global liner shipping company demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently solve real-case problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimization problem is formulated as a nonlinear mathematical program with continuous pavement state and continuous time, and optimality conditions are derived. Managerial insights and practical implications are drawn from two realistic application scenarios, where the maintenance cost is either independent of or linearly dependent on pavement condition, to address impacts of routine maintenance activities on pavement resurfacing planning decisions. Numerical examples demonstrate clear trade-offs between maintenance and resurfacing activities in terms of both pavement improvement effectiveness and costs. This paper shows that maintenance activities, if applied optimally, have the potential to significantly prolong pavement service life between consecutive rehabilitations and reduce overall pavement lifecycle costs.

These models are used extensively in travel behavior research. We consider popular RQMC constructions such as randomized Sobol', Faure, and Halton points, but our main emphasis is on randomly-shifted lattice rules, for which we study how to select the parameters as a function of the considered class of integrands. We compare the effectiveness of all these methods and of standard Monte Carlo (MC) to reduce both the variance and the bias when estimating the log-likelihood function at a given parameter value. In our numerical experiments, randomized lattice rules (with carefully selected parameters) and digital nets are the best performers and they reduce the bias as much as the variance. With panel data, in our examples, the performance of all RQMC methods degrades rapidly when we simultaneously increase the dimension and the number of observations per individual.

A fixed number of identical vehicles travel along a single-lane road of constant width from a common origin to a common destination, with LWR flow congestion and Greenshields' Relation. Vehicles have a common work start time, late arrivals are not permitted, and trip cost is linear in travel time and time early. The paper explores traffic dynamics for the social optimum, in which total trip cost is minimized, and for the user optimum, in which no vehicle's trip cost can be reduced by altering its departure time. Closed-form solutions for the social optimum and quasi-analytic solutions for the user optimum are presented, along with numerical examples, and it is shown that this model includes the bottleneck model (with no late arrivals) as a limit case where the length of the road shrinks to zero.

We differentiate between the short and long-term effects. Based on a large sample of international airports, we find in the short-run the majority of the improvements are from reducing technical inefficiency, which come for the most part from adjusting output, something that can be accomplished in the short-term. There are relatively small changes, in the short run, resulting from improving allocative efficiency. We find that adding economic regulation leads to a decrease in technical efficiency in the short-run. Quite different conclusions hold for the long-term; there are improvements available from reducing allocative inefficiency and comparable benefits are available from cutting technical inefficiency. In the long-run we find that technical and allocative inefficiency decreases by moving away from government owned to fully privatized airports and moving away from rigid regulation.

This paper identifies two fundamental properties of the problem and uses them to design an efficient solution procedure. We first show that the non-convexity of the problem can be circumvented by first solving a relaxed problem and then applying a traffic holding elimination procedure to obtain the solution(s) of the original problem. To efficiently solve the relaxed problem, we explore the relationship between the relaxed problems based on different traffic flow models (PQ, SQ, CTM) and a minimal cost flow (MCF) problem for a special space-expansion network. It is shown that all the four problem formulations produce the same minimal system cost and share one common solution which does not involve inside queues in the network. Efficient solution algorithms such as the network simplex method can be applied to solve the MCF problem and identify such an optimal traffic pattern. Numerical examples are also presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution procedure.

Despite the efforts of the European community on this issue, the design, construction and operation of Heavy Good Vehicles (HGVs) parking areas are yet not well defined, with a lot of differences from country to country. The result is that the number of existing and planned infrastructures is far from being capable of satisfying the driver demand for secure and comfortable parking spaces. This paper focuses on a security HGVs parking plan for the Lazio Region in Italy. The study outlines a methodology to plan future actions to improve security in parking areas. Several steps of the methodology are based on data collected by a detailed survey to Public and Private Administrations, Italian haulage companies and truck drivers; the survey covers a large section of the study. Based on the defined methodology the lack of secure parking areas for HGVs in Lazio Region is proved and measures to provide more secure parking areas are planned. Moreover the costs of improving security in parking areas are quantified and compared with the willingness to pay of truck drivers to ensure the parking areas will be financially sustainable.

The upper level problem of PNDP designs continuous/discrete link capacities shared by multi-commodity flows, and the lower level problem differentiates the corresponding QoS for demand satisfaction, to prioritize customers and/or commodities. We consider PNDP variants that have either fixed flows (formulated at the upper level) or recourse flows (at the lower level) according to different applications. We transform each probabilistic model into a mixed-integer program, and derive polynomial-time algorithms for special cases with single-row chance constraints. The paper formulates benchmark stochastic programming models by either enforcing to meet all demand or penalizing unmet demand via a linear penalty function. We compare different models and approaches by testing randomly generated network instances and an instance built on the Sioux-Falls network. Numerical results demonstrate the computational efficacy of the solution approaches and derive managerial insights. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous econometric approaches have been employed to identify attribute nonattendance (ANA), with the most prevalent in the literature being an adaptation of the latent class model. However, the two latent class structures so far employed either incur a potentially very high parametric cost, or rely on an assumption that nonattendance is independent across all attributes. We present a generalised model that allows for an arbitrary degree of correlation of nonattendance across attributes. In the presented stated choice study investigating short haul flights, this generalised model outperforms the existing approaches. Like two recent papers, the model handles both ANA and preference heterogeneity by combining continuously distributed random parameters with latent classes. However, we present recommendations regarding a number of identification issues stemming from the combination of these two forms of random parameters not covered in those papers. Further, covariates can be introduced into our generalised model to allow insights to be gained into ANA behaviour. We investigate stated ANA as a covariate, and find inferred ANA rates to be more aligned with stated ANA responses than alternative methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Data needs for transportation modeling and privacy protection should be deliberately balanced for different applications. This paper focuses on developing privacy mechanisms that would simultaneously satisfy privacy protection and data needs for fine-grained urban traffic modeling applications using mobile sensors. To accomplish this, a virtual trip lines (VTLs) zone-based system and related filtering approaches are developed. Traffic-knowledge-based adversary models are proposed and tested to evaluate the effectiveness of such a privacy protection system by making privacy attacks. The results show that in addition to ensuring an acceptable level of privacy, the released datasets from the privacy-enhancing system can also be applied to urban traffic modeling with satisfactory results.

The port rotation directions of ship routes not only affect the transit time of containers, as has been recognized by the literature, but also the shipping capacity and transshipment cost. This paper aims to obtain the optimal port rotation directions that minimize the generalized network-wide cost including transshipment cost, slot-purchasing cost and inventory cost. A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed for the optimal port rotation direction optimization problem and it nests a minimum cost multi-commodity network flow model. The proposed model is applied to a liner shipping network operated by a global liner shipping company. Results demonstrate that real-case instances could be efficiently solved and significant cost reductions are gained by optimization of port rotation directions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the controlled setting of the laboratory, we systematically investigate supply chain features that lead to production smoothing. in contrast to prior laboratory studies of the bullwhip effect, we find that the bullwhip effect disappears in several of our experiments. More importantly, our study shows that when customer demand has a predictable seasonal component, retailers smooth orders. This behavior is more pronounced when changing order levels is costly. The results demonstrate how simplifying the structure of the supply chain leads to production smoothing behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TCS problem is modeled as a bi-level programming problem. The upper-level is intended to find an optimal train connection service, and the lower-level is used for assigning each shipment to a sequence of train services and determining the frequency of services. Our model solves the TCS problem of the China railway system, which is one of the largest railway systems in the world. The system consists of 5544 stations, and over 520,000 shipments using this system for a year period. A subnetwork is defined with 127 yards having some minimum level of reclassification resources and 14,440 demands obtained by aggregating 520,000 shipments to the subnetwork. We apply a simulated annealing algorithm to the data for optimal computation after pre-processing and get an excellent result. Comparing our optimal solution with the existing plan result, there are improvements of about 20.8% in the total cost. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This is so because so-called internal supply constraints, bounding flows due to crossing and merging conflicts inherent to the intersection itself, are missing. This paper discusses the problems that arise upon introducing such constraints. A general framework for the distribution of (internal) supply is adopted, which is based on the definition of priority parameters that describe the strength of each flow in the competition for a particular supply. Using this representation, it is shown that intersection models - with realistic behavioral assumptions, and in simple configurations - can produce non-unique flow patterns under identical boundary conditions. This solution non-uniqueness is thoroughly discussed and approaches on how it can be dealt with are provided. Also, it is revealed that the undesirable model properties are not solved - but rather enhanced - when diverting from a point-like to a spatial modeling approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Combining this MNP-based ICLV model formulation with Bhat's maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) inference approach resolves the specification and estimation challenges that are typically encountered with the traditional ICLV formulation estimated using simulation approaches. Our proposed approach can provide very substantial computational time advantages, because the dimensionality of integration in the log-likelihood function is independent of the number of latent variables. Further, our proposed approach easily accommodates ordinal indicators for the latent variables, as well as combinations of ordinal and continuous response indicators. The approach can be extended in a relatively straightforward fashion to also include nominal indicator variables. A simulation exercise in the virtual context of travel mode choice shows that the MACML inference approach is very effective at recovering parameters. The time for convergence is of the order of 30-80 min for sample sizes ranging from 500 observations to 2000 observations, in contrast to much longer times for convergence experienced in typical ICLV model estimations.

With different considerations of flow dependency of energy consumption of BEVs and recharging time, three mathematical models are formulated to describe the resulting network equilibrium flow distributions on regional or metropolitan road networks.

The configurations of competitive suppliers and integrated transportation are studied for recycled materials with low economic value but high environmental impact. Arguments are embodied in a competitive game that manifests interactions among competing manufacturers, suppliers of virgin materials, suppliers of recycled materials, and the government. Because of market size and technology limitation, long hauling to few remote treatment facilities is observed in practice. Demand-dependent transportation efficiency arisen from economies of scale thus affects the equilibrium states in the game of this recycling system. Managerial insights are provided to encourage the use of low-value recycled materials. A tax-subsidy system is conditionally effective when using recycled materials maintains quality. When quality becomes compromised by mixing recycled materials, we find that integrating suppliers of recycled materials with those of virgin materials can make the tax-subsidy system effective again.

The relaxed model is further decomposed into two sub-problems, which can be solved directly by using a modified label-correcting algorithm and a simple single-value linear programming method. Several solution algorithms, including a sub-gradient method, a branch and bound method, and heuristics with additional constraints on Lagrangian multipliers, are proposed to improve solution quality and find approximate optimal solutions.

A generic mathematical model for multi-reservoir networks with well-defined MFDs for each reservoir is presented first. Then, two modeling variations lead to two alternative optimal control methodologies for the design of perimeter and boundary flow control strategies that aim at distributing the accumulation in each reservoir as homogeneously as possible, and maintaining the rate of vehicles that are allowed to enter each reservoir around a desired point, while the system's throughput is maximized. Based on the two control methodologies, perimeter and boundary control actions may be computed in real-time through a linear multivariable feedback regulator or a linear multivariable integral feedback regulator. Perimeter control occurs at the periphery of the network while boundary control occurs at the inter-transfers between neighborhood reservoirs. To this end, the heterogeneous network of San Francisco is partitioned into three homogeneous reservoirs and the proposed feedback regulators are compared with a pre-timed signal plan and a single-reservoir perimeter control strategy. Finally, the impact of the perimeter and boundary control actions is demonstrated via simulation by the use of the corresponding MFDs and other performance measures. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not require high computational effort and future demand data if the current state of each reservoir can be observed with loop detector data.

This study investigates how the green practices on shipping design for compliance (SDC) adopted by shipping firms is related to their financial and service performance with the role of company policy and procedures and shipper cooperation examined. We find that SDC is beneficial for the financial and service performance of shipping firms. Based on the contingency theory, we argue further that company policy and procedure as well as shipper cooperation differentiates the performance outcomes of shipping firms in their SDC for environmental management. Our empirical findings show a positive relationship of SDC with service performance particularly when their company policy and procedure and shipper cooperation are characterized at high than low levels in the process. However, such strengthening effects are not found for the relationship between SDC and the financial performance of shipping firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings show that a firm's green performance and external green collaboration act as mediator variables between internal green practices and firm competitiveness, and they influence firm competitiveness positively. We also discuss in this paper the managerial implications for container shipping firms to improve their green performance and competitiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, sometimes passenger trains have to share some portions of the railway with freight trains and passenger trains are traveling faster and faster nowadays. The major drawback of this dedicated rule is that a fast train can be caught behind a slow train and experience significant knock-on delay. In this paper, we propose a switchable dispatching policy for a double-track segment. The new dispatching rule enables the fast train to pass the slow train by using the track traveled by trains in the opposite direction if the track is empty. We use queueing theory techniques to derive the delay functions of this policy. The numerical experiments show that a switchable policy can reduce the fast train knock-on delay by as high as 30% compared to a dedicated policy. When there are crossovers at the middle of the double-track segment, our proposed switchable policy can reduce the delay of the fast trains by as high as 65%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we present a theory of multi-commodity network traffic flow based on the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model. In particular, we attempt to analyze kinematic waves of the Riemann problem for a general junction with multiple upstream and downstream links. In this theory, kinematic waves on a link can be determined by its initial condition and prevailing stationary state. In addition to a stationary state, a flimsy interior state can develop next to the junction on a link. In order to pick out unique, physical solutions, we introduce two types of entropy conditions in supply-demand space such that (i) speeds of kinematic waves should be negative on upstream links and positive on downstream links, and (ii) fair merging and First-In-First-Out diverging rules are used to prescribe fluxes from interior states. We prove that, for given initial upstream demands, turning proportions, and downstream supplies, there exists a unique critical demand level satisfying the entropy conditions. It follows that stationary states and kinematic waves on all links exist and are unique, since they are uniquely determined by the critical demand level. For a simple model of urban or freeway intersections with four upstream and four downstream links, we demonstrate that theoretical solutions are consistent with numerical ones from a multi-commodity Cell Transmission Model. In a sense, the proposed theory can be considered as the continuous version of the multi-commodity Cell Transmission Model with fair merging and First-In-First-Out diverging rules. Finally we discuss future research topics along this line. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in reality, consumers face multiple resource constraints such as those associated with time, money, and capacity. Ignoring such multiple constraints and instead using a single constraint can, and in general will, lead to poor data fit and inconsistent preference estimation, which can then have a serious negative downstream effect on forecasting and welfare/policy analysis. In this paper, we extend the multiple-discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model to accommodate multiple constraints. The formulation uses a flexible and general utility function form, and is applicable to the case of complete demand systems as well as incomplete demand systems. The proposed MC-MDCEV model is applied to time-use decisions, where individuals are assumed to maximize their utility from time-use in one or more activities subject to monetary and time availability constraints. The sample for the empirical exercise is generated by combining time-use information from the 2008 American Time Use Survey and expenditure records from the 2008 US Consumer Expenditure Survey. The estimation results show that preferences can get severely mis-estimated, and the data fit can degrade substantially, when only a subset of active resource constraints is used.

The first step in this comprehensive research is to gain a thorough understanding of some continuous-time point-queue models, which will be used as the building block of a computationally tractable model for the continuous-time DUE problem that we will study in detail in the accompanying paper (Ban et al., in press). Starting with the original point-queue model introduced by Vickrey (1969), we summarize some desirable properties that a continuous-time point-queue model should possess, and show that one of these properties-the nonnegativity of the queue lengths-is violated by Vickrey's original model. As a remedy to this drawback of Vickrey's model and with the goal of extending it to a continuous-time setting, we introduce two continuous-time point-queue models and show that they satisfy the properties we propose. Discretizations of the continuous-time models are discussed and construction of numerical trajectories is presented; convergence of such trajectories as the time step approaches zero is established; regularity of a solution to the continuous-time problem is clarified, and numerical results are presented.

As a result, air passenger travel decisions can be expected to be influenced by delay information. In addition, delays affect airline operations, resulting in increased block times on routes and, in general, higher carrier costs and airfares. This paper examines the impact of flight delays on both passenger demand and airfares. Delays are calculated against scheduled block times as well as against more idealized feasible flight times. Based on econometric estimations, welfare impacts of flight delays are calculated. We find that flight delays on a route reduce passenger demand and raise airfares, producing significant decreases in both consumer and producer welfare. Since producer welfare effects are estimated to be three times as large as consumer welfare effects, we conclude that from an economic efficiency rationale, airlines should be required to pay for the bulk of flight delay remediation efforts.

However, because the number of temporary shelters is insufficient, as are shelter building capabilities, victims must be evacuated and resettled in batches. The perceived psychological penalty to victims may increase due to heightened panic when waiting for evacuation and resettlement, whereas psychological interventions can decrease the magnitude of this panic. Based on the susceptible infective-removal model, panic spread among homeless victims and other disaster-affected people is modeled, while considering the effects of psychological interventions on panic spread. A function is derived to compute the increase in the number of victims to be evacuated due to panic spread. A novel mixed-integer linear program is constructed for multi-step evacuation and temporary resettlement under minimization of panic-induced psychological penalty cost, psychological intervention cost, and costs associated with transportation and building shelters. The model is solved by aggregating objectives into a single objective by assigning weights to these objectives. With Wenchuan County as the test case, the epicenter of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, the influence and the sensitivity of parameters, tradeoff among costs, and the effects of various functions of panic strength on psychological penalty and monetary costs are assessed using six experimental scenarios. Analytical results reveal the complexity and managerial insights gained by applying the proposed method to post-disaster evacuation and temporary resettlement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The advantage of the unconstrained minimization programming formulation is that it allows the development of a link-based algorithm, which obviates path storage and enumeration. The methodological contributions lie in the derivation of the expected perceived travel cost (or the satisfaction function) that enables the development of an unconstrained MNW-SUE minimization program and a link-based stochastic loading mechanism combined with recent advances in line search strategies in the link-based algorithm.

Understanding and enhancing the economic mechanisms that lead to freight consolidation can ease the implementation of these strategies, increase profits for shippers and carriers, and reduce freight-related negative externalities. An important mechanism that has recently been studied for cost reduction in the freight industry is combinatorial auctions. In these auctions, a shipper invites a set of carriers to submit bids for freight lane contracts. Carriers can bid for individual lanes or bundles of them according to their operational characteristics. These bids are constructed considering direct shipments (Truckload operations) and several biding advisory models have been proposed for this purpose. However, there are economies of scale that can be achieved if shipments are consolidated inside vehicles, which have not been explored in the construction of competitive bids. This paper investigates such benefits and provides insights on the competitiveness and challenges associated to the development of consolidated bids (suitable for Less-Than-Truckload operations). Consolidated bids are constructed using a multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery vehicle routing problem that is solved using a branch-and-price algorithm. The numerical experiment shows that non-consolidated bids are dominated by consolidated bids, which implies that this type of operation can increase the likelihood of a carrier to win auctioned lanes, while increasing its profits margins over truckload companies (non-consolidated bids), and keeping the reported benefits that combinatorial auctions represent for shippers.

Secondary incidents - i.e., incidents that occur within a certain temporal and spatial distance from the first/primary incident can further complicate clearance and add to delays. While there are numerous studies on the empirical analysis of incident data, to the best of our knowledge, an analytical model that can be used for primary and secondary incident management planning that explicitly considers both the stochastic as well as the dynamic nature of traffic does not exist. In this paper, we present such a complementary model using a semi-Markov stochastic process approach. The model allows for unprecedented generality in the modeling of stochastics during incidents on freeways. Particularly, we relax the oftentimes restrictive Poisson assumption (in the modeling of vehicle arrivals, vehicle travel times, and incidence occurrence and recovery times) and explicitly model secondary incidents.

However, there lacks a systematic method to define and solve stationary states in a road network with complex junctions. In this study we propose a kinematic wave approach to defining, analyzing, and simulating static and dynamic traffic characteristics in a network of two ring roads connected by a 2 x 2 junction, which can be either an uninterrupted interchange or a signalized intersection. This study is enabled by recently developed macroscopic junction models of general junctions. With a junction model based on fair merging and first-in-first-out diverging rules, we first define and solve stationary states and then derive the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) of a stationary uninterrupted network. We conclude that the flow-density relationship of the uninterrupted double-ring network is not unique for high average network densities (i.e., when one ring becomes congested) and unveil the existence of infinitely many stationary states that can arise with a zero-speed shockwave. From simulation results with a corresponding Cell Transmission Model, we verify that all stationary states in the MFD are stable and can be reached, but show that randomness in the retaining ratio of each ring drives the network to more symmetric traffic patterns and higher flow-rates. Furthermore we model a signalized intersection as two alternate diverge junctions and demonstrate that the signalized double-ring network can reach asymptotically periodic traffic patterns, which are therefore defined as stationary states in signalized networks. With simulations we show that the flow-density relation is well defined in such stationary states, and asymptotic traffic patterns can be impacted by signal cycle lengths and retaining ratios. But compared with uninterrupted interchanges, signalized intersections lead to more asymmetric traffic patterns, lower flow-rates, and even gridlocks when the average density is higher than half of the jam density. The results are consistent between this study and existing studies, but the network kinematic wave model, with appropriate junction models, is mathematically tractable and physically meaningful. It has offered a more complete picture regarding the number and type of stationary states, their stability, and MFD in freeway and signalized networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It aims at enhancing inventory management by reducing lead time. In addition to employing a faster delivery mode, QR can be achieved by local sourcing (instead of offshore sourcing). This paper analytically studies how a properly designed carbon footprint taxation scheme can be imposed on a QR system to enhance environmental sustainability via employing a local manufacturer by offsetting the probable higher total logistics and production costs. By examining both the single-ordering and the dual-ordering QR systems, we illustrate how the carbon footprint taxation scheme affects the optimal choice of sourcing decision. Our analytical findings reveal that a properly designed carbon footprint taxation scheme by governing body not only can successfully entice the fashion retailer to source from a local manufacturer, but it can also lead to a lower level of risk for the fashion retailer. A mean-risk improving scenario hence results and it provides a significant incentive to convince the fashion retailer to support the idea of joining QR when the carbon footprint tax is in place.

We extend this methodology to a non-storable commodity, freight, where hitherto this analysis has not been carried out. The freight futures market is mature and increasingly liquid, making it a good case for diversification and trading opportunities. We carry out a comprehensive study of quantitative trading strategies in the FFA (Forward Freight Agreements) market on a wide variety of contracts and maturities with a number of trading rules. We find that in spite of robustness checks, trading rules do outperform the buy-and-hold benchmark in general. We also explore the possibility that illiquidity and a small sample size may impact the results of the tests and therefore offer an intuitive approach to mitigate their effects.

To address the difficulty posed by the power function between fuel consumption rate and sailing speed, they formulated a tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programming model. We propose two quadratic outer approximation approaches that can handle general fuel consumption rate functions more efficiently. In the static quadratic outer approximation approach, the approximation lines are generated a priori. In the dynamic quadratic outer approximation approach, the approximation lines are generated dynamically. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of the two approaches.

If buses are dispatched at low rates, the converted lanes will be under-utilized and squander road space. The bottlenecks within the city's road network would then impart even greater delays to cars. The present paper addresses this problem by exploring novel ways in which buses and cars can share lanes within select bottlenecks. The details of a shared-lane strategy vary, depending upon certain details of its bottleneck. In all cases, the idea is to insert cars into a shared lane so as to put available road space to use without delaying buses. Ordinary lane conversions would occur elsewhere throughout the road network, and these would connect to the shared lanes within the bottlenecks. Analytical assessments unveil a wide range of cases for which the proposed strategies increase a bottleneck's car-carrying capacity, as compared against reserving one of its lanes for buses only. Simulations of a real site indicate that significant reductions in car delays can result. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Guler, S.

A portion of sites requiring assistance arrive dynamically over the decision horizon and key problem characteristics are known only with uncertainty a priori. The problem seeks to identify a set of tours for USAR teams so as to maximize the total expected number of people that can be saved by attending to all or a subset of disaster sites within the disaster region. Decisions are taken dynamically over the decision horizon as situational awareness improves and survival likelihood diminishes with the aim of increasing the expected number of saved lives. To overcome the expensive computational effort associated with solving a MSP, a column generation-based strategy that consists of solving a series of interrelated two-stage stochastic programs with recourse within a shrinking time horizon is developed.

Using this equivalent latent variable-based generalized ordered response framework for count data models, we are then able to gainfully and efficiently introduce temporal and spatial dependencies through the latent continuous variables. Our formulation also allows handling excess zeros in correlated count data, a phenomenon that is commonly found in practice. A composite marginal likelihood inference approach is used to estimate model parameters. The modeling framework is applied to predict crash frequency at urban intersections in Arlington, Texas. The sample is drawn from the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) crash incident files between 2003 and 2009, resulting in 1190 intersection-year observations. The results reveal the presence of intersection-specific time-invariant unobserved components influencing crash propensity and a spatial lag structure to characterize spatial dependence. Roadway configuration, approach roadway functional types, traffic control type, total daily entering traffic volumes and the split of volumes between approaches are all important variables in determining crash frequency at intersections.

We compare the performance of the proposed transit system with those of comparable systems (e.g., fixed-route transit network and taxi service), and show how each system is advantageous under certain passenger demand levels.

Capacity sold on an allotment basis is guaranteed. We optimally solve the problem of determining how much of the total weight and volume capacity to sell on an allotment basis, by deriving a closed-form expression of the objective function. We provide numerical examples of industry-size problems and perform sensitivity analysis by changing some problem parameters. The sensitivity analysis illustrates the dependency of the optimal decisions on the spot and allotment booking types. The remaining capacity is then sold over a booking horizon in the spot market. Allotment bookings and spot requests can arrive any time over the booking horizon. Since some of the allotment bookings might not show up at departure, cargo carriers tend to overbook the remaining capacity allocated to spot requests. For these requests, we formulate a discrete-time dynamic capacity control model, to decide which of the spot requests to accept, based on the total weight and volume of the allotment show-ups and spot bookings accepted at the time of an arrival. We solve the exact dynamic programming model for medium-size industry problems. Since the booking policy based on critical booking levels or time periods is not optimal, we propose several heuristics to solve large industry problems and derive an upper bound on the value function. We test their performance via simulation against the optimal solution, the upper bound, and the first-come first-served policy, and recommend a heuristic that performs well in a wide variety of numerical cases. Finally, we show via simulation, that our model outperforms the one existing in the literature, for small and medium-size industry problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Scheduled block time (SBT) setting is a crucial part in airlines' scheduling. Interviews with an airline and relevant work in ground transportation have shown that SBT and the historical block time distribution, reflecting block time reliability, have a close relationship. This paper investigates how the change in actual block time distribution will affect SBT and system performance. Firstly this relationship is studied with empirical data and multiple regression models. The distribution of the historical block time for a flight is depicted by the difference between every 10th percentiles. We found that gate delay plays a minor role in setting SBT and that SBTs have decreasing sensitivity to historical flight times toward the right tail of the distribution. To specifically link SBT setting with the flight's on-time performance, a SBT adjustment model is further developed. Poor on-time performance leads to increased SBT in the next year. With the behavior model results showing that both the median block time and the inner right tail of the distribution affect SBT setting, an impact study is conducted to validate these impacts with historical data. The impact of historical block time distribution on SBT is validated with real data in year 2006-2008 and 2009-2011. Furthermore, by studying the flight performance difference based on different changes in SBT, we conclude that ignoring the impact on SBT changes when considering potential benefits of improved block time distribution could lead to inaccurate results.

The perimeter controller is located on the region border, and manipulates the transfer flows across the border, while aiming at regulating around (nearby) the critical densities or accumulations, whereby the system throughput is maximized. While the desired state in the one urban region system is known in advance (given the MFD shape), for the system with multiple urban regions the desired accumulation points are not well known. Moreover, in some traffic scenarios the controller cannot regulate around the critical accumulations for both systems, e.g. because of high demand. In this paper, a robust perimeter controller for an urban region is designed. The controller aims at satisfying the control specifications and having a good performance for the whole accumulation set, uncongested and congested accumulations, and not necessary for a value range nearby the critical accumulation set-point. Moreover, unlike previous works, the robust controller is also designed to handle uncertainty in the MFD and the control constraints within the design level in a systematic way, where the constraints are explicitly integrated utilizing the so-called describing function. Comparison results show that the performances of the robust controller are significantly better than a standard feedback controller, for different traffic scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Such change has significant potential to reduce environmental externalities and can contribute to alleviating energy policy concerns. However, little work has been conducted to assess the tradeoffs between selecting various fuels for taxis, or to design alternative fuel taxi systems. These tradeoffs exist as a result of the differing costs associated with fleet replacement, infrastructure deployment, operations and maintenance decisions, and costs to users. This paper aims to address this issue by providing an optimization framework for the design of electric taxi systems, and an assessment of optimal costs associated with various options. We focus on comparing the costs of taxi systems made up of gasoline vehicles, hybrid-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with AC Level 2 infrastructure, electric vehicles with battery switching infrastructure, and electric vehicles with DC Level 2 fast charging infrastructure. This approach is based on transit systems design methods and focuses on developing an approximate analytic model for electric taxi systems, which can be expanded upon in future research, to address large-scale taxi systems design problems. Scenario results are presented for various city types. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The downward sloping mean-SD indifference curve is introduced to geometrically analyze the risk-taking behavior of travelers. Both the diversifying and plunging behaviors of risk-averse travelers are investigated by examining the curvature of the mean-SD indifference curves at traffic equilibria based on the PIT, TTB, METT and QDF.

To realize a target flow pattern through imposing anonymous path tolls, we propose a time difference-based pricing in which every user is charged a toll computed from the time difference between adjacent paths ordered in the decreasing order of travel times. We find that, whenever travel disutility is measured in cost or time units, the anonymous marginal cost pricing does not exist.

However, previous formulations of selective VRPs have all been deterministic. Three new formulations are proposed to account for different optimization strategies under uncertain demand (or utility) level: reliable, robust, and fuzzy selective vehicle routing problems. Three parallel genetic algorithms (PGAs) and a classic genetic algorithm are developed and compared to the deterministic solution. PGAs differ based on their communication strategies and diversity in sub-populations. Results show that a PGA, wherein communication between demes, or subpopulations, occurs in every generation and does not eliminate repeated chromosomes, outperforms other algorithms at the cost of higher computation time. A faster variation of PGA is used to solve the non-convex reliable selective VRP, robust selective VRP and the large-scale fuzzy selective VRP, consisting of 200 nodes. Large scale application demonstrates the value of fuzzy selective vehicle routing problem FSVRP in humanitarian logistics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

One feature of the proposed methodology is that it embeds psychological benefits/costs of consumers to characterize consumer attitudes to the increases in airline fare adjustments and improvements in green transportation. This study then investigates the equilibrium solutions for airfare adjustment and green transportation investment margins in different scenarios. The analytical results reveal specific operational conditions under which a cost-efficient airline can gain supreme competitive advantage by increasing both airfare and green transportation investment margins beyond the increases made by competitors under the emission trading scheme, whereas certain specific conditions may favor a cost leadership strategy. Conversely, a cost-inefficient airline can compete with a cost-efficient airline in both market share and profitability using the green transportation investment-differentiation strategy, particularly when consumers perceive the airfare difference as equaling the increased psychological benefit induced by the airline's green effort.

This problem is common in marketing and revenue management applications, and is essentially an extreme form of choice-based sampling. We review estimators typically used with GEV models, describe why many of these estimators cannot be used for these censored samples, and present two approaches that can be used to estimate parameters associated with censored alternatives. We detail necessary conditions for the identification of parameters associated exclusively with the utility of censored alternatives. These conditions are derived for single-level nested logit, multi-level nested logit and cross-nested logit models. One of the more surprising results shows that alternative specific constants for multiple censored alternatives that belong to the same nest can still be separately identified in nested logit models. Empirical examples based on simulated datasets demonstrate the large-sample consistency of estimators and provide insights into data requirements needed to estimate these models for finite samples.

Effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated by applying it to a case study in Wenchuan County of China. The county was the epicenter of the Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008. A multi-objective linear programming model is also formulated capable of systematically minimizing total reverse logistical costs, corresponding environmental and operational risks, and psychological trauma experienced by local residents why they waited for medical treatment and removal of debris. The psychological stress induced during the debris reverse logistic process is the integral of an increasing marginal function of the waiting time for medical treatment and debris removal. Numerical results indicate that when considering risk-induced and psychological costs, the proposed model can reduce such costs associated with post-disaster debris reverse logistics by 22.62% and 54.93%, respectively, from their values when only the logistical costs are minimized. Although reducing the psychological cost of disaster victims, the temporary storage of disaster-hit sites increases the psychological costs of individuals who are processing the debris. We recommend increasing on-site storage and treatment capacities to reduce risk-induced and psychological costs with a lower increase in logistical costs. When the risk tolerance ranges from its minimum value to +25%, the Pareto fronts are closer than those of the risk tolerance increase by more than +25%. Efforts are underway to design a tool based on the Pareto analysis method for future decision making. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we analyze the difference between markets with a monopolistic public transport operator, which operates all public transport links, and markets in which separate operators own each public transport link. To do so, we consider a simple dynamic transport network consisting of two serial segments and two parallel congestible modes of transport. We obtain a reduced form of the public transport operator's optimal fare setting problem and show that, even if the total travel demand is inelastic, serial Bertrand-Nash competition on the public transport links leads to different fares than a serial monopoly; a result not observed in a static model. This results from the fact that trip timing decisions, and therefore the generalized prices of all commuters, are influenced by all fares in the network. We then use numerical simulations to show that, contrary to the results obtained in classic studies on vertical competition, monopolistic fares are not always lower than duopolistic fares; the opposite can also occur. We also explore how different parameters influence the price differential, and how this affects welfare. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Operators offer differentiated services and there are economies of scale in the oligopolistic shipping line sector. Two types of integration between shipping lines are considered: in one of them the liners production processes remain separate (like in an alliance); in another economies of scale are further exploited. Typically maritime freight post-merger goes down. However, it may increase if the merger exploits further economies of scale, they are important and transport services are sufficiently differentiated. An empirical application to the routes Valencia-Antwerp and Valencia-Genoa is undertaken to confirm the predictions of the model. It is shown that, for both types of merger, user surplus increases when transport services are weakly differentiated and economies of scale are sufficiently small. These conditions also guarantee that a merger is socially beneficial. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The model incorporates congestion, reflected in higher waiting times at bus stops and increasing in-vehicle travel time. The stochastic behavior of passengers is introduced through a probability for passengers to choose boarding a specific bus of a certain service. The modeling approach generates a stochastic common-lines problem, in which every line has a chance to be chosen by each passenger. The formulation is a generalization of deterministic transit assignment models where passengers are assumed to travel according to shortest hyperpaths. We prove existence of equilibrium in the simplified case of parallel lines (stochastic common-lines problem) and provide a formulation for a more general network problem (stochastic transit equilibrium). The resulting waiting time and network load expressions are validated through simulation. An algorithm to solve the general stochastic transit equilibrium is proposed and applied to a sample network; the algorithm works well and generates consistent results when considering the stochastic nature of the decisions, which motivates the implementation of the methodology on a real-size network case as the next step of this research.

The network sensor installation is carried out to supply such information. In this paper, we present a graphical approach to determine the smallest subset of links in a traffic network for counting sensor installation, so as to infer the flows on all remaining links. The elegant assumption-free character of the problem introduced by Hu, Peeta and Chu is still kept in this approach. This study points out the topological tree feature of solutions that makes it possible for traffic management agencies to easily and flexibly select links for sensor installation in practice. Addressing from the same graphical perspective, we provide solutions to four other important problems about sensor locations. The preceding two problems are, in traffic networks that already have sensors installed on some links, to identify the subset of links on which link flows can be inferred from sensor measurements and to determine the smallest subset of links on which counting sensors also need to be installed so as to infer link flows on all remaining non-equipped links. The third is to identify the optimal locations for a given number of sensors so as to infer flows on as many links as possible by gradually enlarging the number of links included in circuits. The last one is to determine the smallest subset of links on which to install sensors, in such a way that it becomes possible at the same time to satisfy prior requirements and infer the flows on all remaining links, through building a minimum spanning tree. These methods can be applied to all kinds of long-term planning and link-based applications in traffic networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In a competing risks framework, we simultaneously estimate effects on three types of contractual events: cancellations, upgrades, and downgrades. Focusing on customer relationship management (CRM) practices, we find several factors affecting these events, some of which railway companies can influence to their advantage. Intuitively, installing auto-renewal procedures for loyalty cards decreases cancellation hazards. However, automated electronic mailings (e.g., reminders and account statements) and advertising (e.g., ticket offers) can be counterproductive and increase the risk of cancellation.

Those agglomerations of logistics actors could be referred to as colloidal structures. The proposed approach combines insights from physics and economics. Typical logistics decisions are considered to be dynamic choices of consumers and providers resulting in temporally stable-market equilibria. The development of colloidal structures is driven by economies of scale on one hand and the preference for variety on the other hand. A case study with regards to intermodal terminals in Germany shows possible applications of the model for transport-policy analysis and planning.

An intermodal network flow model is developed and used to analyze congestion in the logistics system for container imports. The results indicate that congestion exists at most ports and its consequences are to raise costs at these nodes, and in some cases to divert traffic to other routes. Finally, if each of the ports expanded, the value of marginal capacity would converge to nil, and expansion would reduce congestion costs and waiting times. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Vickrey's morning commute model is extended to incorporate travelers' choices between two parking areas (clusters). We first derive the travel patterns under different parking capacities, parking fees and accessibility to the destination; then perform a sensitivity analysis to reveal the effect of each factor on network performance and travel profiles. Some interesting findings are: (1) enlarging the central parking lots is not always desirable; (2) parking fee and capacity should be set in a way that commuters prefer to park in the farther area during early arrival; and (3) a shorter access time always reduces the social costs. Finally, we derive the optimal parking fees, capacities and access times which altogether yield the minimum total social costs. When the closer parking cluster does not have too large an accessibility advantage over the farther one, the optimal travel profile is such that both parking clusters are utilized. As a result, the optimal parking solution can effectively reduce both the social costs and the queuing delay. Even more intriguing is that, compared to the case without parking choices, all travelers are better off under the optimal parking solution, which cannot be achieved by only imposing a system-optimal dynamic toll.

The service variables designed are a combination of rail line length, number and locations of stations, headway and fare. Two profit maximization models, which account for the effects of different transit pricing structures (flat and distance-based fare regimes), are proposed. In the proposed models, the effects of passenger demand elasticity and population density along the urban corridor are explicitly considered. The solution properties of the proposed models are explored and compared analytically, and the indifference condition for the two fare regimes in terms of the operator's net profit is identified. A heuristic solution algorithm to solve the proposed models is presented. Numerical examples are provided to show the effects of the fare regimes, rail capital cost and urban configuration (in terms of urban population distribution and corridor length) on the design of the rail transit line and the profitability of the rail transit operations.

In this paper, we study the design and optimization of train timetables for a rail rapid transit (RRT) line adapted to a dynamic demand environment, which focuses on creating convenient timetables for passengers. The objective is to minimize the average passenger waiting time at the stations, thus focusing on passenger welfare. We first propose two mathematical programming formulations which generalize the non-periodic train timetabling problem on a single line under a dynamic demand pattern. We then analyze the properties of the problem before introducing a fast adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) metaheuristic in order to solve large instances of the problem within short computation times. The algorithm yields timetables that may not be regular or periodic, but are adjusted to a dynamic demand behavior. Through extensive computational experiments on artificial and real-world based instances, we demonstrate the computational superiority of our ALNS compared with a truncated branch-and-cut algorithm. The average reduction in passenger waiting times is 26%, while the computational time of our metaheuristic is less than 1% of that required by the alternative CPLEX-based algorithm. Out of 120 open instances, we obtain 84 new best known solutions and we reach the optimum on 10 out of 14 instances with known optimal solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Several new algorithms have been developed such as bush based methods of Bar-Gera (2002), Dial (2006), and Gentile (2012) that are able to obtain very fine solutions of network equilibrium models. These solutions can be post processed (Bar-Gera, 2006) in order to ensure proportionality and class uniqueness of the flows. Recently developed, the TAPAS, algorithm (Bar Gera, 2010) is able to produce solutions that have proportionality embedded, without requiring post processing. It was generally accepted that these methods for solving UE traffic assignment are the only way to obtain unique path and class link flows. The purpose of this paper is to show that the linear approximation method and some of its variants satisfy these conditions as well. In addition, some analytical results regarding the relation between steps of the linear approximation algorithm and the path flows entropy are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Sharing taxis which has been prominent in several developing countries is also becoming common in several cities around the world. Sharing taxis presents several advantages as it minimizes vacant seats in cars thus reducing costs on taxi operators which results in significantly lower taxi fares for passengers. Besides the economical advantages, taxi sharing is highly important for reducing congestion on the roads and for minimizing the impact of transportation on the environment. In this paper, we formulate the problem of assigning passengers to taxis and computing the optimal routes of taxis as a mixed integer program. To solve the proposed model, we present a Lagrangian decomposition approach which exploits the structure of the problem leading to smaller problems that are solved separately. Furthermore, we propose two heuristics that are used to obtain good quality feasible solutions. The Lagrangian approach along with the heuristics are implemented and compared to solving the full problem using CPLEX. The computational results indicate the efficiency of the methodology in providing tighter bounds than CPLEX in shorter computational time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The G-RRM model is created by recasting a fixed constant in the attribute-specific regret functions of the conventional RRM model, into an attribute-specific regret-weight. Given that regret-weights of different attributes can take on different values, the G-RRM model allows for additional flexibility when compared to the conventional RRM model, as it allows the researcher to capture choice behavior that equals that implied by, respectively, the canonical linear-in-parameters Random Utility Maximization (RUM) model, the conventional Random Regret Minimization (RRM) model, and hybrid RUM-RRM specifications. Furthermore, for particular values of the attribute-specific regret-weights, models are obtained where regret minimization (i.e., reference dependency and asymmetry of preferences) is present for the attribute, but in a less pronounced way than in a conventional RRM model. When regret-weights are written as binary logit functions, the G-RRM model can be estimated on choice data using conventional software packages. As an empirical proof of concept, the G-RRM model is estimated on a stated route choice dataset as well as on synthetic data, and its outcomes are compared with RUM, RRM, hybrid RUM-RRM and latent class counterparts.

It presents and discusses an experiment designed to test a model recently proposed in a companion paper by Lindsey et al. (2013). That model predicts that if free-flow costs on the two routes are unequal, travel cost functions are convex, and capacities are positively and perfectly correlated, then in equilibrium, paradoxically, total expected travel costs increase with the provision of pre-trip information about travel conditions on each route. By contrast, when capacities vary independently, total expected travel costs are predicted to decrease with pre-trip information. We reformulate the model for finite populations, and then test and find support for its predictions in an experiment where under different capacity scenarios, and with and without pre-trip information, subjects are asked to choose routes with payoff contingent on their performance.

We contribute to theory by providing evidence that the relationships between FMCs and performance are more complex than previously theorized. Namely, excessive activity control will adversely affect market performance, especially when output control is low. However, when output control is high, increasing activity control improves market performance-up to a point. Accordingly, we provide managerial guidance on appropriate levels of FMC use.

We then analyze how transaction costs would affect the trading and route-choice behaviors of both CN and WE players, and discuss the equilibrium conditions on the coupled credit market and transportation network in the presence of transaction costs. A variational inequality is formulated to describe the equilibrium and is subsequently applied to a numerical example to assess the impacts of transaction costs on a tradable credit system. As expected, transaction costs reduce the trading volume of credits and change their market price. They also change the way how players respond to credit charges in their route choices and cause efficiency losses to the credit schemes that are previously designed without considering transaction costs. With transaction costs, travel costs of WE players will likely increase while those of CN players may decrease due to their higher adaptability in routing strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the Weibull distributed random error term handles the identically distributed assumption such that the perception variance with respect to different trip lengths can be distinguished, and a path-size factor term is introduced to resolve the route overlapping issue by adjusting the choice probabilities for routes with strong couplings with other routes. A multiplicative Beckmann's transformation (MBec) combined with an entropy term are used to develop the MP formulation for the PSW-SUE model. A path-based algorithm based on the partial linearization method is adopted for solving the PSW-SUE model.

Ex post evaluations indicate a bias where investment costs are higher and benefits lower on average than predicted ex ante. These authors argue that the bias must be attributed to intentional misrepresentation by project developers. This paper shows that the bias may arise simply as a selection bias, without there being any bias at all in predictions ex ante, and that such a bias is bound to arise whenever ex ante predictions are related to the decisions whether to implement projects. Using a database of projects we present examples indicating that the selection bias may be substantial. The examples also indicate that benefit-cost ratios remain a useful selection criterion even when cost and benefits are highly uncertain, gainsaying the argument that such uncertainties render cost-benefit analyses useless.

Rationing policies, including vehicle ownership quota and vehicle usage restrictions, have been implemented in several megaregions to address congestion and other negative transportation externalities, but not well explored in literature. Other strategies such as Vehicle Mileage Fee have not been well accepted by policy makers, but attract growing research interest. As policy makers face an increasing number of policy tools, a theoretical framework is needed to analyze these policies and provide a direct comparison of their welfare implications such as efficiency and equity. However, such a comprehensive framework does not exist in literature. To bridge this gap, this study develops an analytical framework for analyzing and comparing travel demand management policies, which consists of a mathematical model of joint household vehicle ownership and usage decisions and welfare analysis methods based on compensating variation and consumer surplus. Under the assumptions of homogenous users and single time period, this study finds that vehicle usage rationing performs better when relatively small percentages of users (i.e. low rationing ratio) are rationed off the roads and when induced demand elasticity resulting from congestion mitigation is low. When the amount of induced demand exceeds a certain level, it is shown analytically that vehicle usage restrictions will always cause welfare losses. When the policy goal is to reduce vehicle travel by a fixed portion, road pricing provides a larger welfare gain. The performance of different policies is influenced by network congestion and congestibility. This paper further generalizes the model to consider heterogenous users and demonstrates how it can be applied for policy analysis on a real network after careful calibration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In turn, HOT lanes maintain a minimal level of service by regulating the volume of entering LOVs. The focus of this paper is how to model the choice process of individual drivers, which dictates the volume of LOVs that choose to pay and take the HOT lane. Such models and the insights they provide can be very helpful for the toll setting process. Two simple formulations (an all-or-nothing assignment and an additive logit model) are compared with a proposed formulation based on the population value of time (VOT) distribution. Both static and dynamic toll setting algorithms are studied based on the proposed lane choice model, and their performance is compared under deterministic traffic behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The global aircraft-engine market is viewed from the regulatory perspective in order to compare the single environmental and operational efficient frontier to that of the airline carriers, and environmental objectives. The results of DEED are then applied in order to substitute the fleets serving Schipol, Amsterdam and Arlanda, Stockholm airports in June 2010 with the benchmark aircraft. The results highlight the inefficiencies of the current airline fleets and that the IPCC values of externalities are a magnitude of TEN too low to encourage changes in the global fleet hence the need for government intervention.

We propose a phase transition model of non-stationary traffic in conservation form, capable of propagating joint measurements from fixed and mobile sensors, to model complex traffic phenomena such as hysteresis and phantom jams, and to account for forward propagation of information in congested traffic. The model is shown to reduce to the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model within each traffic phase for the case of stationary states, and to have a physical mesoscopic interpretation in terms of drivers' behavior. A corresponding discrete formulation appropriate for practical implementation is shown to provide accurate numerical solution to the proposed model.

Methods: Retrospective study of outcomes associated with implementation of a pregabalin step-therapy protocol using claims data from Humana ('restricted' cohort) and Thomson Reuters MarketScan ('unrestricted' cohort). Members aged 18-65 years receiving treatment for pDPN, PHN, or FM during 2008 or 2009 were identified; cohorts were matched on diagnosis and geographic region. Baseline to follow-up changes in healthcare resource utilization and costs were determined using difference-in-differences (DID) analysis. Statistical models adjusting for covariates explored relationships between restricted access and outcomes. Results: A total of 3876 restricted cohort members were identified and matched to 3876 unrestricted cohort members. FM was the predominant diagnosis (84.7%). The unrestricted cohort was older (mean = 49.0 (SD - 10.4) years vs 47.6 (SD - 10.5) years; p<0.001), and had greater comorbidity (RxRisk-V score = 5.4 (SD = 3.2) vs 4.4 (SD = 2.9), p<0.001) than the restricted cohort. Compared with the unrestricted cohort, the restricted cohort demonstrated a greater year-over-year decrease in pregabalin utilization (-2.6%, p = 0.008), and greater increases in physical therapy and disease-related outpatient utilization (3.7%, p = 0.010 and 3.6%, p = 0.022, respectively). There were no statistically significant net differences in all-cause or disease-related total healthcare, medical, or pharmacy costs between cohorts. After adjusting for baseline compositional differences between cohorts, restricted plan membership was associated with a net increase in all-cause medical ($1222; p = 0.016) and disease-related healthcare costs ($859; p = 0.002). Limitations include use of a combined analysis for pDPN, PHN, and FM, especially since the observed results were likely driven by FM; an inability to link the prescribing of a medication with the condition of interest, which is common to claims analyses; and lack of pain severity information.

Under such situations, travelers may find it advantageous to delay reaching the bottleneck by slowing down or waiting beside, even when there is still capacity left to serve them without delay. In this paper, we show that a flat toll during the morning commute potentially incurs tactical waiting under the assumptions of First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue discipline and identical commuters; and derive all the possible equilibrium traffic patterns resulting from different choices of toll level and tolling period. Under the optimal toll pattern which minimizes the total system cost, we prove that there is no queue at the bottleneck at the starting or ending point of the tolling period and bottleneck capacity is fully utilized except during the period of tactical waiting. The optimal flat toll can reduce up to half of the queuing delay, but is in general not pareto-improving. However, if the revenue collected by the optimal flat toll is redistributed to the road users in the form of capacity expansion, the trip cost of each commuter will be reduced in the long-run. We also show that when building a new highway, the revenue from the optimal flat toll can never cover the capital cost of constructing the optimal capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The formulations are based on the assumption that a traveler would use a P&R facility if and only if the corresponding generalized cost is lower than the drive only alternative. The paper considers two different scenarios: a linear city (or a travel corridor), and a two-dimensional city with Euclidean travel. Analytical derivations were obtained for both cases using, as starting point, the necessary condition for P&R use. In the case of the linear city, the paper identifies two breakeven distances (BEDs) of great import to the estimation of the potential P&R market: the (trip) origin BED, i.e., the distance below which a traveler could drive upstream to use the P&R facility to access its downstream destination, and still be better off; and the (trip) destination BED, i.e., the travel distance using transit below which it does not make sense to use P&R. The paper proves that the optimal location of P&R sites is shifted upstream of what seems to be an intuitive solution, i.e., the edge of the congested region. by a distance that depends on the relative values of the origin and destination BEDs. In the two-dimensional city case, the analytical derivations prove that, for a given trip from i to j, the set of feasible locations follows an ellipse-like figure with the trip origin as a focus. These shapes-referred to as limiting functions-depend on variables such as trip distance, transit level of service (LOS), and the like. The analyses indicate that the area enclosed by the limiting functions increases with the transit LOS and trip distance, and so do the corresponding catchment areas. This is because the catchment area is determined by the marginal trip origins, i.e., those for which the P&R facility is just inside the limiting function. In its final section, the paper develops a parabolic approximation to the catchment area for a given P&R site. The approximating parabola is defined by three critical points: the origin BED, and two points that identify the marginal trip origins at the chord of parabola evaluated at the P&R. The numerical experiments indicate that the parabolic approximation provides a fairly good estimate of the catchment area that is easy to produce, conceptually valid, and overcomes the limitations of alternative approaches and rules of thumb used by practitioners and researchers.

Each feasible toll-charge function is evaluated by a probit-based SUE (Stochastic User Equilibrium) problem with elastic demand, asymmetric link travel time functions, and continuously distributed VOT, solved by a convergent Cost Averaging (CA) method. The toll design problem is formulated as a mixed-integer mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) model, which is solved by a Hybrid GA (Genetic Algorithm) CA method.

The combination of skew-normal mixing and the MNP kernel lends itself nicely to estimation using Bhat's (2011) maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) approach. Simulation results for the cross-sectional case show that our proposed approach does well in recovering the underlying parameters, and also highlights the pitfalls of ignoring non-normality of the continuous mixing distribution when such non-normality is present. At the same time, the proposed model obviates the need to assume a pre-specified parametric distribution for the mixing, and allows the estimation of a very flexible, but still parsimonious, mixing distribution form.

Conversely, estimation is straightforward if we observe the path taken by each vehicle. We consider an intermediate problem of increasing practical importance, in which link count data is supplemented by routing information for a fraction of vehicles on the network. We develop a statistical model for these combined data sources and derive some tractable normal approximations thereof. We examine likelihood-based inference for these normal models under the assumption that the probability of vehicle tracking is known. We show that the likelihood theory can be non-standard because of boundary effects, and provide conditions under which such irregular behaviour will be observed in practice. For regular cases we outline connections with existing generalised least squares methods. We then consider estimation of OD matrices under estimated and/or misspecified models for the probability of vehicle tracking. Theoretical developments are complemented by simulation experiments and an illustrative example using a section of road network from the English city of Leicester. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Included in the set of models are those that predict the expected delays that cars collectively incur when a bus blocks one of multiple lanes while loading and unloading passengers at the stop. Others in this set predict the expected added delays incurred by the bus due to car queues. Each model is consistent with the kinematic wave theory of highway traffic, as is confirmed through a battery of tests. And each accounts for the randomness in both, bus arrival times at a stop, and the durations that buses dwell there to serve passengers. Though the models are analytical in form, solutions come through iteration. Hence model applications are performed with the aid of a computer. The applications presented herein show that bus delays can often be shortened by placing the bus stop downstream of its neighboring signalized intersection, rather than upstream of it. In contrast, car delays are often shortened by placing the stop some distance upstream of the intersection, rather than downstream. We further show how exerting a measure of control on bus arrivals can further enhance these benefits to cars without further delaying the buses. The models are also used to assess the net person delays collectively incurred by car- and bus-travelers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike other schedule-based models in the literature, we consider supply uncertainties and assume that users adopt strategies to travel from their origins to their destinations. We present an analytical formulation to ensure that on-board passengers continuing to the next stop have priority and waiting passengers are loaded on a first-come-first-serve basis. We propose an analytical model that captures the stochastic nature of the transit schedules and in-vehicle travel times due to road conditions, incidents, or adverse weather. We adopt a mean variance approach that can consider the covariance of travel time between links in a space time graph but still lead to a robust transit network loading procedure when optimal strategies are adopted. The proposed model is formulated as a user equilibrium problem and solved by an MSA-type algorithm.

This paper develops an innovative integer programming model for the problem of train dispatching on an N-track network by means of simultaneously rerouting and rescheduling trains. Based on a time-space network modeling framework, we first adapt a commonly used big-M method to represent complex if-then conditions for train safety headways in a multi-track context. The track occupancy consideration on typical single and double tracks is then reformulated using a vector of cumulative flow variables. This new reformulation technique can provide an efficient decomposition mechanism through modeling track capacities as side constraints which are further dualized through a proposed Lagrangian relaxation solution framework. We further decompose the original complex rerouting and rescheduling problem into a sequence of single train optimization subproblems. For each subproblem, a standard label correcting algorithm is embedded for finding the time dependent least cost path on a time-space network. The resulting dual solutions can be transformed to feasible solutions through priority rules. We present a set of numerical experiments to demonstrate the system-wide performance benefits of simultaneous train rerouting and rescheduling, compared to commonly-used sequential train rerouting and rescheduling approaches.

The proposed method primarily involves three stage multi-objective (travel distance minimization, operational cost minimization, and psychological cost minimization), mixed-integer linear programming models. The three sub-networks are designed using the proposed programming models. The distinctive features of the proposed method are as follows. (1) The proposed method is demand-driven. The order of the designed sub-networks is shelter, medical, and distribution, with the connections of the latter networks based on the arrangements for the former. (2) The objective functions of three stage programming models include not only traditional objectives such as minimizing total travel distance and operational cost, which supply-side members focus on, but also minimizing the psychological cost experienced by demand-side members. Model tests are conducted to demonstrate that the superiority of a centralized emergency supply network designed by the proposed method over a decentralized one, especially with regard to distribution network design.

The new transit network structure is also composed of two types of schemes: radial/circular in the central area and hub and spoke in the periphery. This analytical model defines the optimal network layout through minimizing its objective function, which is composed of agency and user costs. Its decision variables are central area size, headway, line spacing, and stop spacing. In this reformulation, stops with single coverage, those only served by one line, are introduced in the hybrid model to improve spatial accessibility to avoid an increase in agency investment. This model is a tool to design competitive transit systems topologically characterized by simple schemes adapted to the urban structure and concentrated transit flows, and also operatively by high frequencies and speeds. Ultimately, all this allows for easy use and management of transit networks. The model's robustness with regard to input parameters and decision variables reinforces its results and estimates what implementations on real road networks would be like. It presents coherent behavior regarding real-world standards, where high, concentrated and temporally well distributed demands lead to more efficient and effective transit systems. High performance bus (HPB) is the transport technology used throughout this paper because, as has been proved in this paper, it is the best transit mode in urban areas for a wide range of demand values. Main system characteristics have been obtained such as central areas greater than a 25% of the city, low headways of around 2 min, high commercial speeds ranges between 14 and 17 km/h, and suitable spatial accessibility, where stop spacing moves between 350 and 550 m.

We contribute an integrated, generally-applicable (to various types of structural response data) statistical approach that links the literatures on statistical performance modeling and on structural health monitoring. The framework consists of two parts: The first, estimation of statistical models to explain, predict, and control for common-cause variation in the data, i.e., changes, including serial dependence, that can be attributed to usual operating conditions. The ensuing standardized innovation series are analyzed in the second part of the framework, which consists of using Shewhart and Memory Control Charts to detect special-cause or unusual events. We apply the framework to analyze strain and displacement data from the monitoring system on the Hurley Bridge (Wisconsin Structure B-26-7). Data were collected from April 1, 2010 to June 29, 2011. Our analysis reveals that, after controlling for seasonal effects, linear trends are significant components of the response measurements. Persistent displacement may be an indication of deterioration of the bridge supports. Trends in the strain data may indicate changes in the material properties, i.e., fatigue, sensor calibration, or traffic loading. The results also show that autocorrelation and conditional heteroscedasticity are significant sources of common-cause variation. Use of the control charts detected 43 possible special-cause events, with approximately 50% displaying persisting effects, and 25% lasting longer than one week. Analysis of traffic data shows that unusually heavy loading is a possible cause of the longest special-cause event, which lasted 11 days. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To ensure the search efficiency, a suitable chromosome representation has to be determined first. Unlike a canonical GA for crew scheduling where the chromosome length is fixed, the chromosome length in the proposed approach may vary adaptively during the iterative process, and its initial value is elaborately designated as the lower bound of the number of shifts to be used in an unachievable optimal solution. Next, the hybrid GA with such a short chromosome length is employed to find a feasible schedule. During the GA process, the adaptation on chromosome lengths is achieved by genetic operations of crossover and mutation with removal and replenishment strategies aided by a simple greedy algorithm. If a feasible schedule cannot be found when the GA's termination condition is met, the GA will restart with one more gene added. The above process is repeated until a feasible solution is found. Computational experiments based on 11 real-world crew scheduling problems in China show that, compared to a fuzzy GA known to be well performed for crew scheduling, better solutions are found for all the testing problems. Moreover, the algorithm works fast, has achieved results close to the lower bounds obtained by a standard linear programming solver in terms of the number of shifts, and has much potential for future developments.

Since the traffic data collected in real time reflects the past or current conditions on the roadway, a predictive travel time methodology should be used to obtain the information to be disseminated. However, an important part of the literature either uses instantaneous travel time assumption, and sums the travel time of roadway segments at the starting time of the trip, or uses statistical forecasting algorithms to predict the future travel time. This study benefits from the available traffic flow fundamentals (e.g. shockwave analysis and bottleneck identification), and makes use of both historical and real time traffic information to provide travel time prediction. The methodological framework of this approach sequentially includes a bottleneck identification algorithm, clustering of traffic data in traffic regimes with similar characteristics, development of stochastic congestion maps for clustered data and an online congestion search algorithm, which combines historical data analysis and real-time data to predict experienced travel times at the starting time of the trip. The experimental results based on the loop detector data on Californian freeways indicate that the proposed method provides promising travel time predictions under varying traffic conditions.

Using the existing transportation planning models of Fresno, we examine the effects of privatization on a number of typical system performance measures including total travel time and vehicle miles traveled (VMT), the possibility of including arterials, and the differences between social cost prices and profit maximizing prices. Some interesting insights emerge from our analysis: (1) roads cannot be considered as isolated elements in a concession model for a road network; (2) roads can function as complements at some levels of demand and become substitutes at other levels; (3) policy makers/officials should consider privatizing/pricing arterials along with privatizing highways; (4) temporally flexible but limited price schedule regulations should be part of leasing agreements; and (5) non-restricted pricing may actually worsen system performance, while limited pricing can raise enormous profits as well as improve system performance.

This extension recognizes that street space is shared by cars and public transit. It is assumed that transit is operated independently of traffic conditions, and that when it is operated it consumes a fixed amount of space. As a first step, a single fixed-capacity bottleneck that can serve both cars and transit is studied. Commuters choose which mode to use and when to travel in order to minimize the generalized cost of their own trip. The transit agency chooses the headway and when to operate. Transit operations reduce the bottleneck's capacity for cars by a fixed amount. The following results are shown for this type of bottleneck: 1. If the transit agency charges a fixed fare and operates at a given headway, and only when there is demand, then there is a unique user equilibrium. 2. If the transit agency chooses its headway and time of operation for the common good, and users choose when to travel for the common good, then there is a system optimum solution with less cost and no queuing. 3. Time-dependent tolls and fares that achieve this system optimum are given. Finally, it is also shown that Results 2 and 3 apply to urban networks that serve a demand which is distributed in time and space, and which may include a population of captive transit riders. It is found that in many cases, additional transit service should be provided during a specified period in the rush. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this problem, we are interested in finding stationary states on all links when origin demands, destination supplies, and route choice proportions are constant. After discussing the properties of four types of stationary states on a road link and presenting stationary entropy conditions at both the merging and diverging junctions, we derive a system of algebraic equations as necessary conditions for all 16 combinations of stationary states on the two intermediate links. Under different network conditions in road capacities, route choice proportions, and merging priorities, we analytically show that the traffic statics problem always admits stationary solutions, which, however, may not be unique. In particular, such stationary solutions exist even under network conditions when an initially empty diverge-merge network can settle in persistent periodic oscillations after a long time. In the future, we will be interested in discussing the stability property of the stationary states and studying the traffic statics problem in general networks. Analytical insights from the simpler traffic statics problems would be helpful for understanding complex traffic dynamics in a road network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem of OD estimation is traditionally modeled as a bilevel network design problem (NDP), which is challenging to solve in large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a new one-level convex optimization formulation to reasonably approximate the bilevel structure, thus allowing the development of more efficient solution algorithms. This one-level approach is consistent with user equilibrium conditions, and improves previous one-level relaxed OD estimation formulations in the literature by 'equilibrating' path flows using external path cost parameters. Our new formulation can, in fact, be viewed as a special case of the user equilibrium assignment problem with elastic demand, and hence can be solved efficiently by standard path-based traffic assignment algorithms with an iterative parameter updating scheme. Numerical experiments indicate that this new one-level approach performs very well. Estimation results are robust to network topology, sensor coverage, and observation error, and can achieve further improvements when additional data sources are included. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is well-known and additionally demonstrated by data in this paper, that the fluctuations are much larger than these models predict. Typically, the fluctuation in speed difference is around +/-2 m/s, while the fluctuation in the net time headway T=g/v can be as big as one or even two seconds, which is as large as the mean time headway itself. By analyzing data from loop detectors as well as data from vehicle trajectories, evidence is provided that this randomness is not due to driver heterogeneity, but can be attributed to an internal stochasticity of the driver itself. A final model-based analysis supports the hypothesis, that the preferred headway of the driver is the parameter that is not kept constant but fluctuates strongly, thus causing the even macroscopically observable randomness in traffic flow.

Developing integrated transport supply and demand management (TS-DM) strategies is crucial for ensuring sustainable urban development. TS-DM strategies will not only affect the transport system performance, but also induce changes in the land use pattern and hence changes in land value. Moreover, the implementation of TS-DM strategies typically involves a progressively phased schedule; one must account for the costs and effects that accrue over time. This paper develops a formulation to study the impact of TS-DM strategies on the overall system performance and activity location costs expressed as land value. Specifically, a nested multinomial logit model combined with the bid-rent process is formulated to model residents' location and travel choices, with the problem of housing supply integrated in this framework. The overall combined network equilibrium problem is expressed as a non-linear complementarity problem. The existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium solutions are investigated through an equivalent mathematical programming formulation. Moreover, analytical results are derived to study the distribution of benefits due to transport infrastructure improvement among different stakeholders for networks with one origin-destination (OD) pair, for scenarios of homogenous and heterogeneous values of time. The analytical results show that transport improvements benefit landowners or developers rather than tenants under the scenario of homogeneous value of time; and benefit people with a higher income more under the scenario of heterogeneous value of time. Finally, a mathematical program is developed to determine the optimal TS-DM strategies over time in order to optimize the overall system performance. For general networks with multiple OD pairs, where analytical results are not available, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effects of TS-DM strategies, which generally echo the analytical results developed for the case with one OD pair.

An empirical case demonstrates the superiority of the proposed models in identifying the less efficient routs/companies as well as in reducing the input slacks without subjective conjectures.

The usual approach to constructing such models involves the addition of random noise terms to deterministic equations, which could lead to negative traffic densities and mean dynamics that are inconsistent with the original deterministic dynamics. This paper offers a new stochastic model of traffic flow that addresses these issues. The source of randomness in the proposed model is the uncertainty inherent in driver gap choice, which is represented by random state dependent vehicle time headways. A wide range of time headway distributions is allowed. From the random time headways, counting processes are defined, which represent cumulative flows across cell boundaries in a discrete space and continuous time conservation framework. We show that our construction implicitly ensures non-negativity of traffic densities and that the fluid limit of the stochastic model is consistent with cell transmission model (CTM) based deterministic dynamics.

This paper examines the effects of transaction costs on two types of markets: an auction market and a negotiated market. In an auction market, users purchase all of the needed mobility credits through a competitive bidding process. In a negotiated market, the users initially receive certain amount of mobility credits from the government and trade with each other through negotiation to fulfill their needs. We assume that a brokerage service is built in both markets to facilitate transactions and accordingly, the users have to pay a commission fee proportional to the value of trade. The users are also given the option to purchase credits from the government if for some reasons they cannot use or wish to avoid the markets. Our analyses suggest that the auction market can achieve the desired equilibrium allocation of mobility credits as long as the government sets its price properly and the unit transaction cost is lower than the price that the market would reach in absence of transaction costs. However, in the negotiated market, transaction costs could divert the system from the desired equilibrium regardless of their magnitude. More importantly, the initial allocation of mobility credits may affect the final equilibrium even when marginal transaction costs are constant. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Problems focusing on where to strategically extract this information can be broadly subdivided into observability problems, which rely on the topological properties of the network, and flow-estimation problems, where (prior) information on observed flows is needed to identify optimal sensor locations. This paper contributes mainly to the first category: more specifically, it presents a new methodology and an intuitive metric able to quantify the quality of a solution in case of partial observability, i.e. when not all flow variables are observed or can be uniquely determined from the observed flows. This methodology is based on existing approaches that can efficiently find solutions for full observability (i.e., the set of sensors needed to make the system fully determined), and exploits only the algebraic relations between link, route and origin destination flow variables to quantify the information contained in any arbitrary subset of these variables. The new metric allows, through its adoption within simple search algorithms, to efficiently select sensor locations when the number of available sensors is limited by, for example, budget constraints and is less than the number needed to guarantee full observability. The chosen positions aim at selecting those locations that contain the largest information content on the whole network. This is an important contribution in this field, since even in small sized networks the solution for full observability requires an exceedingly large amount of sensors. The assessment of partial observability solutions, based on explicit route enumeration, allows one to categorize families of full observability solutions, and shows that these contain different information potential. This way, it is possible to rank solutions requiring a lower number of sensors while containing the same information content. We tested this new methodology both on toy networks, in order to analyse the properties of the metric and illustrate its logic, and to explain and test heuristic search algorithms for optimal sensor positioning on a real-sized network. Analysis of partial observability solutions shows that the basic search algorithms succeed in finding the links that contain the largest deal of information in a network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our model allows for traveler's partial understanding and inertial effect in perceiving varying network conditions and provides a different perspective (from existing stochastic and Markovian network equilibrium approaches) to describe traffic flow variations across multiple network scenarios. A disaggregate simplicial decomposition algorithm is suggested to solve the variational inequality problem. Numerical results from a few stochastic network examples demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our methodology in modeling the inertia phenomenon within route choice behavior and the efficacy of using traveler information systems to eliminate the inertia effect.

The main results are: First, the second-best discriminating business fare exceeds the first-best uniform fare (which equals the external part of the marginal congestion costs), while the second-best discriminating leisure fare is lower than the first-best uniform fare. Second, the optimal airport charge implements the first-best uniform or second-best discriminating fares. Importantly, this charge can always be higher than what would be expected when all passengers were treated as having the same time valuation. This result provides some support to the finding that the welfare losses associated with an atomistic airport congestion charge may be low. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

But city logistics measures involve several actors and choice dimensions. It is therefore important to have methods and models able to assess the effectiveness of the measures to be implemented. The current models were mainly developed to simulate some aspects of urban freight transport, and are not able to forecast many impacts of implementing traffic and transportation measures at an urban scale. This paper presents a modelling approach that tries to point out the relations existing among city logistics measures, actors and choice dimensions. It comprises three model sub-systems to estimate the quantity O-D matrices by transport service type (e.g. retailer on own account or wholesaler on own account or by carrier), the delivery O-D matrices by delivery time period, and the vehicle O-D matrices according to delivery tour departure time and vehicle type. This modelling system is a multi-stage model and considers a discrete choice approach for each decisional level. It was first tested using some data collected in the inner area of Rome, including traffic counts and interviews with retailers and truck-drivers. The model estimations were also compared with the experimental ones, and quite satisfactory results were obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In our previous studies (Jin, 2010a,b), a phenomenological model of lane-changing traffic flow was proposed, calibrated, and analyzed based on a new concept of lane-changing intensity. In this study, we further consider weaving and non-weaving vehicles as two commodities and develop a multi-commodity, behavioral Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model of lane-changing traffic flow. Based on a macroscopic model of lane-changing behaviors, we derive a fundamental diagram with parameters determined by car-following and lane-changing characteristics as well as road geometry and traffic composition. We further calibrate and validate fundamental diagrams corresponding to a triangular car-following fundamental diagram with NGSIM data. We introduce an entropy condition for the multi-commodity LWR model and solve the Riemann problem inside a homogeneous lane-changing area. From the Riemann solutions, we derive a flux function in terms of traffic demand and supply. Then we apply the model to study lane-changing traffic dynamics inside a lane-drop area and show that the smoothing effect of HOV lanes is consistent with observations in existing studies. The new theory of lane-changing traffic flow can be readily incorporated into Cell Transmission Model, and this study could lead to better strategies for mitigating bottleneck effects of lane-changing traffic flow.

A systematic uncertainty analysis can provide insights into the level of confidence on the model outputs, and also identify critical sources of uncertainty for enhancing the robustness of the travel demand model. In this paper, we develop a systematic framework for quantitative uncertainty analysis of a combined travel demand model (CTDM) using the analytical sensitivity-based method. The CTDM overcomes limitations of the sequential four-step procedure since it is based on a single unifying rationale. The analytical sensitivity-based method requires less computational effort than the sampling-based method. Meanwhile, the uncertainties stemming from inputs and parameters can be treated separately so that the individual and collective effects of uncertainty on the outputs can be clearly assessed and quantified. Numerical examples are finally used to demonstrate the proposed sensitivity-based uncertainty analysis method for the CTDM.

We find consistent evidence indicating that network-based global optimization always leads to greater expected profits than does local (i.e., market by market) optimization. Further, the magnitude of profit improvement is found to be most significant when local shipments have a relatively higher freight yield compared to flow-through shipments. Finally, our results indicate that global optimization contributes to greater profit improvement as offloading penalty costs become higher. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A public agency manages the system's capacities optimally. Commuters are identical except for the times at which they wish to complete their morning trips and start their evening trips, which are given by an arbitrary joint distribution. They value unpunctuality their lateness or earliness relative to their wish times with a common penalty function. They must use the same mode for both trips. Commuters are assigned personalized mode and travel start times that collectively minimize society's generalized cost for the whole day. This includes unpunctuality penalties, queuing delays, travel times and out-of-pocket costs for users, as well as travel supply costs and externalities for society. It is shown that in a SO solution there can be no queuing and that the set of SO solutions forms a convex set. Furthermore, if the schedule penalty that users suffer due to unpunctuality is separable into morning and evening components, then the set of commuters traveling by the same mode arrive at work and depart from work in the order of their wishes. These orders are in general different in the morning and the evening. It is also shown that there always is a SO solution in which users are at all times, and on both modes, either punctual or flowing at capacity. These problem properties are used to identify search methods, both, for SO solutions and for time-dependent tolls and transit fares that preserve the solutions as Nash equilibriums. In every case studied, these prices exist. They must peak concurrently for the two modes in both periods. In special cases involving only one mode, only one period or concentrated demand the solution to the complete problem decomposes by period conditional on the number of transit users, and this facilitates the solution. In these cases the day-long SO cost is the sum of the SO costs for the two peaks considered separately. However, this is not true in general the solution obtained by combining the two single-period solutions can be infeasible. When this happens, the optimum day-long cost will exceed the sum of the single-period costs. The discrepancy is about 40% of the total schedule penalty for an example representing a large city. Thus, to develop realistic policies the day-long problem must be addressed head on. An approximate method that yields closed form formulas for the case with uniformly distributed wishes is presented.

Using a real options methodology, it is demonstrated that the time-varying properties of the spread is the outcome of the strategic decision to time-commit company resources in the industry. During a market upturn (downturn) managers choose to commit company resources for a short period (long period), and thus, maintain flexibility (commitment) in better exploiting the upcoming business opportunities (protecting company resources from lack of business opportunities). Overall, the fluctuations of the time-varying spread between voyage and time-charter rates offer managerial insights in resource allocation that can better shape up chartering, budgeting and financial management decisions on the time commitment of resources in the maritime industry.

We consider the problem of statistical inference for such models based on daily observations of traffic counts on a subset of network links. Like other inference problems for network-based models, the critical difficulty lies in the underdetermined nature of the linear system of equations that relates link flows to the latent path flows. In particular, Bayesian inference implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods requires that we sample from the set of route flows consistent with the observed link flows, but enumeration of this set is usually computationally infeasible. We show how two existing conditional route flow samplers can be adapted and extended for use with day-to-day dynamic traffic. The first sampler employs an iterative route-by-route acceptance-rejection algorithm for path flows, while the second employs a simple Markov model for traveller behaviour to generate candidate entire route flow patterns when the network has a tree structure. We illustrate the application of these methods for estimation of parameters that describe traveller behaviour based on daily link count data alone. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

But little attention has been given to pricing under uncertainty, especially for heterogeneous commuters. In this paper, we investigate congestion externalities by considering commuters' risk preferences and heterogeneity. In particular, when price involves exogenous uncertainty which is independent of both central authority and individual commuters, we are able to express commuters' departure equilibria and the total social cost in closed-form in terms of the departure time and uncertainty. Moreover, we find that uncertainty will lead heterogeneous risk-averse commuters not only to avoid traveling at the time when uncertainty level is high, but also to deviate from their optimal departure sequence. Hence, we are able to show that uncertainty can tremendously increase the total social cost. Furthermore, we also prove that both the central planner and the market-base mechanism have the potential to reduce the total social cost and alter commuters' departure behavior. Specifically, we find out that the central planner can always find a class of financial derivatives to induce the socially optimal departure behavior, while the market-based mechanism may do so at specific cases. Finally, numerical formulation and experiments are given to assess the robustness of our results for more general forms of uncertainties and derivatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies show that parallel competitors set a volume/capacity ratio (and thereby a travel time or service quality) that is socially optimal if they take the actions of the others as given. We find that this result does not hold when capacity and toll setting are separate stages-as then firms aim to limit toll competition by setting lower capacities, and thus higher travel times-or when firms set capacities sequentially, as then firms aim to limit the capacities of later entrants by setting higher capacities. In our Stackelberg competition, the last firm to act has no capacity decisions to influence. Hence, it is only concerned with the toll-competition substage, and sets a travel time that is longer than socially optimal. The first firm cares mostly about the competitors' capacities that it can influence: it sets a travel time that is shorter than socially optimal. The average travel time will be too short from a societal point of view. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[van den Berg, Vincent A.

The behavior of each carrier is characterized by an optimization model with the objective to maximize his payoff by setting optimal freight rate and shipping deployment (a combination of service frequency and ship capacity setting). The market share for each carrier is determined by the Logit-based discrete choice model. Three competitive game strategic interactions are further investigated, namely, Nash game, Stackelberg game and deterrence by taking account of the economies of scale of the ship capacity settings. Three corresponding competition models with discrete pure strategy are formulated as the variables in shipment deployment are indivisible and the pricing adjustment is step-wise in practice. A 8 -approximate equilibrium and related numerical solution algorithm are proposed to analyze the effect of Nash equilibrium. Finally, the developed models are numerically evaluated by a case study. The case study shows that, with increasing container demand in the market, expanding ship capacity setting is preferable due to its low marginal cost. Furthermore, Stackelberg equilibrium is a prevailing strategy in most market situations since it makes players attain more benefits from the accommodating market. Moreover, the deterrence effects largely depend on the deterrence objective. An aggressive deterrence strategy may make potential monopolist suffer large benefit loss and an easing strategy has little deterrence effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

By efficiently integrating conventional and flexible services and thus matching service type to various regions, the total cost of transit services may be significantly reduced, especially in regions with substantial demand variations over time and space. Additionally, transit passengers must often transfer among routes because it is prohibitively expensive to provide direct routes for among all origin-destination pairs in large networks. Coordinating vehicle arrivals at transfer terminals can greatly reduce the transfer times of passengers. In this paper, probabilistic optimization models, which are proposed to deal with stochastic variability in travel times and wait times, are formulated for integrating and coordinating bus transit services for one terminal and multiple local regions. Solutions for decision variables, which include the selected service type for particular regions, the vehicle size, the number of zones, headways, fleet, and slack times, are found here with analytic optimization or numerical methods.

At the retailer, used containers are collected and returned to the supplier. The supplier inspects returned containers, and either repairs and reuses or disposes them. This paper studies the case where the fraction of containers that are returned to the supplier is stochastic, and where an RFID system can be used to support the tracking of container positions in the supply chain. The use of RFID leads to improved information on the return of containers and better return predictability as well as higher return rates, which we model as an increase in the mean return rate of containers and a reduction in return variance. The paper first develops a mathematical planning model for this scenario, and it then studies how the use of RFID impacts the performance of the system. In addition, it analyzes under which conditions the use of RFID is economical, and in which situations traditional container systems should be preferred. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we consider game-theoretic interactions between the transit agency and passengers for the barrier-free system and suppose that frequencies of free rides of passengers as well as inspections of the transit agency are given as a Nash equilibrium. Then the optimal choice of fare collection system is described as a subgame perfection solution in an extensive form game. We also conduct a comparative static analysis and examine how each parameter can affect the choice.

This work intends to understand how space distributions for modes and interactions among modes affect network traffic performance. While the connection between performance of transport systems and general land allocation is the subject of extensive research, space allocation for interacting modes of transport is an open research question. Quantifying the impact of road space distribution on the performance of a congested multimodal transport system with a dynamic aggregated model remains a challenge. In this paper, a multimodal macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is developed to represent the traffic dynamics of a multimodal transport system. Optimization is performed with the objective of minimizing the total passenger hours traveled (PHT) to serve the total demand by redistributing road space among modes. Pricing strategies are also investigated to provide a higher demand shift to more efficient modes. We find by an application to a bi-modal two-region city that (i) the proposed model captures the operational characteristics of each mode, and (ii) optimal dynamic space distribution strategies can be developed. In practice, the approach can serve as a physical dynamic model to inform space distribution strategies for policy makers with different goals of mobility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results also indicate that safety is the most important item in the choice of access mode and user friendly and convenience for storing luggage as the next most important items for the elderly. Elderly passengers are found to be less likely to use public transport than private transport. Factors such as possessing a car in their household, carrying more luggage, spending more time spent in the vehicle, and higher ticket prices for public transport increase the propensity for the elderly to use private transport.

Transportation Research Part B 45 (2), 343-363) proposed a predictive continuum dynamic user-optimaDUO-1 to investigate the dynamic characteristics of traffic flow and the corresponding route-choice behavior of travelers. Their modeled region is a dense urban city that is arbitrary in shape and has a single central business district (CBD). However, we argue that the model is not well posed due to an inconsistency in the route-choice strategy under certain conditions. To overcome this inconsistency, we revisit the PDUO-C problem, and construct an improved path-choice strategy. The improved model consists of a conservation law to govern the density, in which the flow direction is determined by the improved path-choice strategy, and a Hamilton-Jacobi equation to compute the total travel cost. The simultaneous satisfaction of both equations can be treated as a fixed-point problem. A self-adaptive method of successive averages (MSA) is proposed to solve this fixed-point problem. This method can automatically determine the optimal MSA step size using the least squares approach. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and the solution algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

When this is the case, it may not be sufficient to project market shares accurately, but also to correctly replicate the spatial pattern of choices. Analysts might then be interested in assessing the results of a model's fit relative to the spatial distribution of the observed responses. While canonical approaches exist for the exploratory spatial analysis of continuous variables, similar tools have not been widely implemented for discrete choice models, where the variable of interest is categorical. For this reason, despite recent progress with spatial models for discrete outcomes, there is still not a simple and intuitive tool to assess the quality of the spatial fit of a discrete choice model.

Bearing in mind the importance of the relation between asset returns and liquidity in water transportation, this paper examines this relation within the context of US traded international water freight transportation firms. Using a Fama-MacBeth analysis, it is shown that the illiquidity risk premium is priced in the water transportation sector beyond the Fama and French and market-wide illiquidity risk factors, indicating higher average returns for stocks with greater illiquidity measures. It is also shown that the market-wide illiquidity factor and the Fama-French SMB and HML risk factors are significant in explaining stock returns. In contrast, market risk is found not to be priced in the water transportation sector. The results are also robust to asset pricing tests over two alternative sub-periods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The share of customer demand in a market depends on the functionality of service facilities and the presence of nearby competitors, as customers normally seek the nearest functioning facility for service. Our game-theoretical models incorporate these complicating factors into an integrated framework, and use continuous and differentiable density functions to represent discrete location decisions. We first analyze the existence of Nash equilibria in a symmetric two-company competition case. Then we build a leader-follower Stackelberg competition model to derive the optimal facility location design when one of the companies has the first mover advantage over its competitor. Both models are solved effectively, and closed-form analytical solutions can be obtained for special cases. Numerical experiments (with hypothetical and empirical data) are conducted to show the impacts of competition, facility disruption risks and transportation cost metrics on the optimal design. Properties of the models are analyzed to cast interesting managerial insights. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Proposed mechanisms ensure incentive compatibility, individual rationality, budget balance and asymptotical efficiency. We first consider one-sided VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) combinatorial auctions for a complex transportation marketplace with multiple lanes, realizing the maximal social welfare. We then design three alternative multi-unit trade reduction (MTR) mechanisms for the bilateral exchange transportation marketplace where all the lanes are partitioned into distinct markets. Compared to the base MTR mechanism, more buyers/shippers win the tickets for competing in the final trade in the MTR-BA (buyer augment) mechanism; likewise, more sellers/carriers win these tickets in the MTR-SA (seller augment) mechanism. Under the buyer and seller augment mechanisms, both shippers' and carriers' expected utilities are higher than those in the base MTR mechanism. Numerical study further shows that MTR-BA and MTR-SA mechanisms lead to higher expected utilities for shippers and carriers respectively than social welfare maximization. However, the base MTR mechanism provides a higher payoff to the market broker than MTR-BA and MTR-SA mechanisms. Finally, we propose a randomized mechanism that integrates one-sided VCG mechanisms and MTR mechanisms. As a result, this randomized mechanism is practical in both the one-sided and bilateral exchange transportation marketplaces, even with the less-than-truckload constraint. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

An MFD is further well defined if the network is homogeneous with links of similar properties. This collective behavior concept can also be utilized to introduce simple control strategies to improve mobility in homogeneous city centers without the need for details in individual links. However many real urban transportation networks are heterogeneous with different levels of congestion. In order to study the existence of MFD and the feasibility of simple control strategies to improve network performance in heterogeneously congested networks, this paper focuses on the clustering of transportation networks based on the spatial features of congestion during a specific time period. Insights are provided on how to extend this framework in the dynamic case. The objectives of partitioning are to obtain (i) small variance of link densities within a cluster which increases the network flow for the same average density and (ii) spatial compactness of each cluster which makes feasible the application of perimeter control strategies. Therefore, a partitioning mechanism which consists of three consecutive algorithms, is designed to minimize the variance of link densities while maintaining the spatial compactness of the clusters. Firstly, an over segmenting of the network is provided by a sophisticated algorithm (Normalized Cut). Secondly, a merging algorithm is developed based on initial segmenting and a rough partitioning of the network is obtained. Finally, a boundary adjustment algorithm is designed to further improve the quality of partitioning by decreasing the variance of link densities while keeping the spatial compactness of the clusters. In addition, both density variance and shape smoothness metrics are introduced to identify the desired number of clusters and evaluate the partitioning results. These results show that both the objectives of small variance and spatial compactness can be achieved with this partitioning mechanism. A simulation in a real urban transportation network further demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in effectiveness and robustness compared with other clustering algorithms.

The proposed approach is based on a specific measure, termed synthetic dispersion measure (SDM), related to the trace of the covariance matrix of the posterior demand estimate conditional upon a set of sensor locations. Under the mild assumption of multivariate normal distribution for the prior demand estimate, the proposed SDM does not depend on the specific values of the counted flows - unknown in the planning stage but just on the locations of such sensors. From a practical standpoint, a stepwise algorithm is implemented for calculating the proposed measure given a set of link counts, which avoids matrix inversion. In addition, a sequential heuristic algorithm is presented for the application of the proposed NSLP to real contexts. The methodology also allows a formal budget allocation problem to be set between surveys and counts in the planning stage, in order to maximize the overall quality of the demand estimation process.

This work proposes a new mathematical programming model to control vehicles operating on a transit corridor minimizing total delays. The model can handle a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles with different capacities without using binary variables, which make solution times compatible with real-time requirements. Two control policies are studied within a rolling horizon framework: (i) vehicle holding (HRT), which can be applied at any stop and (ii) holding combined with boarding limits (HBLRT), in which the number of boarding passengers at any stop can be limited in order to increase operational speed. Both strategies are evaluated in a simulation environment under different operational conditions. The results show that HBLRT and HRT outperform other benchmark control strategies in all scenarios, with savings of excess waiting time of up to 77% and very low variability in performance. HBLRT shows significant benefits in relation to HRT only under short headway operation and high passenger demand. Moreover, our results suggest implementing boarding limits only when the next arriving vehicle is nearby. Interestingly, in these cases HBLRT not only reduces an extra 6.3% the expected waiting time in comparison with HRT, but also outperforms other control schemes in terms of comfort and reliability to both passengers and operators. To passengers HBLRT provide a more balanced load factor across vehicles yielding a more comfortable experience. To operators the use of boarding limits speed up vehicles reducing the average cycle time and its variability, which is key for a smooth operation at terminals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The research has led to a paradigm shift in that optimal experimental design is now considered the state-of-the-art design approach for these kinds of studies. The optimal experimental design approach for stated preference studies, as presented in the literature, is Bayesian in nature and builds on the Fisher information matrix. The Bayesian approach is necessary for coping with the problem that the optimal design depend:; on the unknown parameters in the stated choice model. However, the reliance of the approach on maximum likelihood estimation of the logit models of interest and on the corresponding Fisher information matrix (and its inverse) is a weakness. This is because maximum likelihood is known to produce biased estimates for finite sample sizes and the Fisher information matrix, used to evaluate the quality of stated preference designs and to perform hypothesis tests, is only asymptotically valid. In this article, we study various alternatives to the Fisher information matrix as a basis for constructing Bayesian optimal designs for stated preference studies. The alternatives we consider to quantify the information content of a stated preference study are known to have better finite sample properties than the Fisher information matrix, because they are based on Bayesian estimation procedures that are considered more appropriate than maximum likelihood procedures when the sample size is small. We compare designs based on the Fisher information matrix with designs based on the generalized Fisher information matrix, the expected posterior covariance matrix, and the expected gain in Shannon information. We perform our comparison in a scenario where a Bayesian analysis is performed as well as in a scenario in which maximum likelihood estimation is used. Our simulation results favor Bayesian design criteria based on the generalized Fisher information matrix and on the expected posterior covariance matrix. For computational reasons, we recommend using the generalized Fisher information matrix as a basis for determining efficient designs for stated preference studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It proceeds to investigate the optimal sailing speed of container ships on each leg of each ship route in a liner shipping network while considering transshipment and container routing. This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. In view of the convexity, non-negativity, and univariate properties of the bunker consumption function, an efficient outer-approximation method is proposed to obtain an E-optimal solution with a predetermined optimality tolerance level c.

This instability causes a natural tendency towards spatially inhomogeneous vehicle distributions and less consistent and reproducible relationships between urban traffic variables. It is important to find ways to mitigate this unstable behavior since well-defined relationships between average network flow and density - the MFD - are useful to aid network design and control. This paper examines the impacts of locally adaptive traffic signals - e.g., those that allocate green times proportionally to upstream approach densities - on network stability and the MFD. A family of adaptive signal control strategies is examined on two abstractions of an idealized grid network using an analytical model and an interactive simulation. The results suggest that locally adaptive traffic signals provide stability when the network is moderately congested, which increases average flows and decreases the likelihood of gridlock. These benefits increase with the overall adaptivity of the signals. However, adaptive signals appear to have little to no effect on network stability or the MFD in heavily congested networks as vehicle movement becomes more constrained by downstream congestion and queue spillbacks. Under these conditions, other strategies should be used to mitigate the instability, such as adaptively routing drivers to avoid locally congested regions. These behaviors are verified using more realistic micro-simulations and are consistent with other observations documented in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As epsilon reduces to zero, the user equilibrium solution is reached. The proposed method is a variant of bush-based algorithms, and also a variant of the min-mean cycle algorithm to solve the min-cost flow by successive approximation. In epsilon-BA, the restricted master problem, implying traffic equilibration restricted on a bush, is solved to epsilon-optimality by cost scaling before bush reconstruction. We show that epsilon-BA can reduce the number of flow operations substantially in contrast to Dial's Algorithm B, as the former operates flows on a set of deliberately selected cycles whose mean values are sufficiently small. Further, the bushes can be constructed effectively even if the restricted master problem is not solved to a high level of convergence, by leveraging the epsilon-optimality condition. As a result, the algorithm can solve a highly precise solution with faster convergence on large-scale networks compared to our implementation of Dial's Algorithm B. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing the frequency of flights may result with congestion which could stimulate demand for concessions, but may also harm the demand for flights. When passengers have a low valuation for the concession good, the opportunity for concession revenue is small and the airport focuses its revenue on the aeronautical (i.e., landing) fees. With a sufficiently large valuation for concession goods, the airport may lower the aeronautical charges to stimulate greater flight frequency in order to lower airfares thereby attracting more passengers ultimately to increase concessions revenues. It is in the latter case where we observe minimal loss of aeronautical welfare when airports are privatized. Thus, our research could help guide decision makers in the airport privatization process. Namely, we find that privatization is not recommended unless the potential for concession revenues is sufficiently large. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we study a parking space reservation policy in which, upon rental, the users are required to state their destination and the system then reserves a parking space for them until they arrive at their destinations. We measure the performance of the vehicle sharing system by the total excess time users spend in the system. The excess time is defined as the difference between the actual journey time and the shortest possible travel time from the desired origin to the desired destination. A Markovian model of the system is formulated. Using this model, we prove that under realistic demand rates, this policy improves the performance of the system. This result is confirmed via a simulation study of a large real system, Tel-O-Fun, the bike-sharing system in Tel-Aviv. For all the tested demand scenarios, the parking reservation policy reduces the total excess time users spend in the system, with a relative reduction varying between 14% and 34%. Through the simulation we examine additional service-oriented performance measures and demonstrate that they all improve under the parking reservation policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to providing safe and efficient transit services, reducing auto dependence and therefore less need for highway expansions, the improved accessibility of TOD influences commuters' residential location choices and the resultant housing value. Traditionally, statistical approaches have been used to estimate the relationship between railway development and housing value for individual sites. To some degree, TOD has also been studied with integrated land-use transport models. While useful, they lack an analytical framework to study the region-wide impacts of TOD on residential location and travel choices and the resultant land value changes. In this study, the joint railway and housing development strategy is modeled based on a combined equilibrium formulation with the bid-rent process. The problem is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, in which the upper level optimizes the objective for the joint development strategy by deciding on the combination of housing supplies and railway service levels. Analytical results are obtained for a single corridor in a multi-modal transport network, which are further illustrated by sensitivity analyses. A numerical example is constructed to demonstrate the approach and compare with other separate development strategies. The results generally confirm the synergy between railway and housing developments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

LUCE's promise comes mainly from its use of the greedy method for solving the quadratic approximation of node-based subproblems, which determines the search direction. While the greedy algorithm accelerates the solution of the subproblems and reduces the cost of line search, it unexpectedly disrupts the overall convergence performance in our experiments, which consistently show that LUCE failed to converge beyond certain threshold of relative gap. Our analysis suggests that the root cause to this interesting behavior is the inaccurate quadratic approximation constructed on faulty information of second-order derivatives. Because the quadratic approximations themselves are inaccurate, the search directions generated from them are sub-optimal. Unlike OBA, however, LUCE does not have a mechanism to correct these search directions through line search, which explains why its convergence performance suffers the observed breakdowns. We also attempt to improve LUCE using the ideas that have been experimented for the improvement of OBA. While these improvements do work, their effects are not enough to counteract the inability to adjust sub-optimal search directions. Importantly, the fact that the search direction has to be corrected in line search to ensure smooth convergence attests to the limitation of origin-based flow aggregation shared by both OBA and LUCE. These findings offer guidelines for the design of high performance traffic assignment algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine the decision to invest in rail transit infrastructure (i.e., transport improvement) by treating population scale and the attitudes of decision-makers or social planners as sources of risk and ambiguity. An alpha-maxmin multiple-priors expected utility framework is developed to solve for the option value of rail transit investment under Knightian uncertainty. We find that the threshold for investment varies with the ambiguity attitudes (i.e., pessimism or optimism) of decision-makers regarding future population dynamics, and show that option value can in fact either increase or decrease with uncertainty subject to alpha-ignorance and ambiguity. We also underline the effect of transport improvement on traffic congestion under various states of nature, and determine the specific population scale ranges for which investment is warranted under (1) risk and (2) Knightian uncertainty. These dynamics are illustrated in a numerical application adapted from a Chinese rail transit initiative specific to the Xiamen region. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

One possibility to decrease emissions originating from transportation is to utilize more rails instead of relying simply on road transportation. In the dry port concept an inland intermodal terminal is connected to a sea port using railways. This study analyzes impacts of dry ports in a Finnish context. We compare two different configurations: In the first one shippers drive directly to a sea port, while in the second one they use dry ports. The systems are evaluated by using discrete-event simulation. In the systems we are interested in two issues: (1) Level of CO2 emissions, and (2) Costs to transport the goods in different configurations. We use different scenarios for future energy prices and estimate both the costs and CO2 emission development in these scenarios. We also compare the results to a situation, where emissions are minimized instead of costs. Implications on larger scale are also discussed, for example in the Baltic Sea and North Sea area, where strict sulfur emission restrictions are seen to harm sea transport and increase concentration on small number of sea ports.

One of the possible actions towards a solution to this problem is the planning, design and implementation of efficient feeder transit services. This paper develops an analytical model which allows for an easy computation of near optimal terminal-to-terminal cycle length of a demand responsive feeder service to maximize service quality provided to customers, defined as the inverse of a weighted sum of waiting and riding times. The model estimates the recommended cycle length by only plugging in geometrical parameters and demand data, without relying on extensive simulation analyses or rule of thumbs. Simulation experiments and comparisons with real services validate our model, which would allow planners, decision makers and practitioners to quickly identify the best feeder transit operating design of any given residential area.

In particular, we simulate realistic signal systems that include signal linking and adaptive cycle times, and compare their performance against a highly adaptive system of self-organizing traffic signals which is designed to uniformly distribute the network density. We find that for networks with time-independent boundary conditions, well-defined stationary MFDs are observed, whose shape depends on the particular signal system used, and also on the level of heterogeneity in the system. We find that the spatial heterogeneity of both density and flow provide important indicators of network performance. We also study networks with time-dependent boundary conditions, containing morning and afternoon peaks. In this case, intricate hysteresis loops are observed in the MFDs which are strongly correlated with the density heterogeneity. Our results show that the MFD of the self-organizing traffic signals lies above the MFD for the realistic systems, suggesting that by adaptively homogenizing the network density, overall better performance and higher capacity can be achieved.

This approach allows for an efficient computational scheme for large-scale networks. We embed this network loading procedure into the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) model proposed by Friesz et al. (1993). The DUE model is solved as a differential variational inequality (DVI) using a fixed-point algorithm. Several numerical examples of DUE on networks of varying sizes are presented, including the Sioux Falls network with a significant number of paths and origin-destination pairs (OD). The DUE model presented in this article can be formulated as a variational inequality (VI) as reported in Friesz et al. (1993). We will present the Kuhn-Tucker (KT) conditions for that VI, which is a linear system for any given feasible solution, and use them to check whether a DUE solution has been attained. In order to solve for the KT multiplier we present a decomposition of the linear system that allows efficient computation of the dual variables. The numerical solutions of DUE obtained from fixed-point iterations will be tested against the KT conditions and validated as legitimate solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In practice, transportation agencies adopt threshold-based rules for maintenance planning because they are intuitive and easy to implement. However, the thresholds are often determined based on engineering judgment without any systematic approach. Therefore, maintenance budgets cannot be used effectively and facility conditions are not optimized. This research uses hybrid dynamic models to represent threshold-based maintenance for transportation infrastructure in a realistic manner. Hybrid dynamic models combine continuous states such as pavement roughness and age with discrete states such as maintenance history. These models are also capable of considering multiple maintenance actions with heterogeneous effects. Based on facility conditions and maintenance thresholds, corresponding maintenance actions are selected automatically and the facility switches between deterioration modes to reflect the effects of the chosen action. Further-more, to consider users' reactions to maintenance actions and accurately predict deterioration for a network of facilities, threshold-based maintenance is formulated as an upper-level problem, and user response is incorporated as a lower-level problem. This leads to a bi-level programming problem where maintenance thresholds are decision variables, which is solved with a modified tabu search algorithm. The proposed methodology is validated with the road network of an urban area and the generated maintenance thresholds are reasonable and robust, which shows that the methodology has great potential to support transportation infrastructure life-cycle management in practice.

It aims to optimize the network performance via expansion of existing links subject to the Wardrop user equilibrium constraint. As one of the extremely challenging problems in the transportation research field, various solution methods have been proposed for solving the CNDP. However, most of the algorithms developed up to date can only find a local optimum due to inherent nonconvexity of the MPEC. This paper proposes a viable global optimization method for the CNDP. Based on the concepts of gap function and penalty, the CNDP is transferred into a sequence of single level concave programs, which is amenable to a global solution. It is proved that any accumulation of the solutions to the sequence of concave programs is a globally optimal solution to the original CNDP. Owing to their special structure, all concave programs can be solved by a multicutting plane method. The penalty term in each step of the inner sub-problem can be calculated by simply executing an all-or-nothing assignment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Most bus systems try to achieve this by adherence to a schedule; but this is undermined by the tendency of headways to collapse, so that buses travel in bunches. To counter this, we propose a new method of coordinating buses. Our method abandons the idea of a schedule and even any a priori target headway. Under our scheme headways are dynamically self-equalizing and the natural headway of the system tends to emerge spontaneously. Headways also become self-correcting in that after disturbances they reequalize without intervention by management or even awareness of the drivers. We report on a successful implementation to control a bus route in Atlanta. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a new graphic solution approach to DFA and proposes a systematic framework to validate DFA using observed vehicle trajectory data. A set of new empirical measures are defined to extract steady-state traffic properties and oscillation characteristics from vehicle trajectory data. A frequency-domain calibration approach based on DFA is developed to construct a proper nonlinear car-following model that fits these empirical measurements. The analytical DFA predictions of oscillation propagation patterns of the calibrated car-following law are then compared with (i) the observed oscillation properties, and (ii) the simulated oscillation characteristics from the same car-following law. Empirical experiments with real-world trajectory data show that the prediction, the simulation, and the field observation typically match very nicely. This not only validates the analytical prediction approach in the previous study, but also shows that the framework proposed in this paper is capable of calibrating a realistic nonlinear car-following law that reproduces the observed oscillation propagation phenomenon. Our proposed modeling method also brings theoretical analyses and empirical observations into one integrated framework that potentially lays the foundation to understand how nonlinearities in a car-following law affect traffic oscillation evolution, and develop possible counteracting strategies.

Single inductive loop detectors are widely deployed in road networks, supplying a wealth of information on the current status of traffic flow. In this paper, we perform Bayesian analysis to online estimate average vehicle time headway using the data collected from a single inductive loop detector. We consider three different scenarios, i.e. light, congested, and disturbed traffic conditions, and have developed a set of unified recursive estimation equations that can be applied to all three scenarios. The computational overhead of updating the estimate is kept to a minimum. The developed recursive method provides an efficient way for the online monitoring of roadway safety and level of service. The method is illustrated using a simulation study and real traffic data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

With coarse tolling, the toll equals a fixed value during the centre of the peak, whereas outside this period it is zero. This paper separately investigates three dimensions of heterogeneity. With the first, all values of time and schedule delay vary in fixed proportions, and this heterogeneity may stem from income differences. The second has differences in the flexibility of users in when to arrive. The third captures differences in willingness to arrive before or after the preferred arrival time. The paper uses three models of coarse tolling: the 'Laih', 'ADL' and 'Braking' model. All three dimensions affect the welfare gain of coarse tolling. In the Laih model, the generalised price with coarse tolling is always in between the no-toll and first-best prices. In the other models, this is not the case, and the distributional effects of coarse tolling may be non-monotonic and very different from the distributional effects with first-best tolling. In the Braking model, the bottleneck capacity goes unused for some time during the tolled period. Compared to in the Laih model, this raises the total cost, and it is most harmful for users with low values of time and schedule delay and for users with a relatively high value of schedule delay late: these users could, for instance, be low-income users with a strict work start time or travelling to a doctor's appointment.

The main challenge is to strike a balance between two conflicting objectives: low network setup costs and low expected operational costs. Together these have a significant impact on the quality of freight services. Increasing redundancy at crucial network links is a common way to improve network flexibility. However, in a highly uncertain environment, a single predefined network is unlikely to suit all possible future scenarios, unless it is prohibitively costly. Hence, rescheduling is often an effective alternative. In this paper, we proposed a new stochastic freight service network design model with vehicle rerouting options. The proposed model explicitly introduces a set of integer variables for vehicle rerouting in the second stage of the stochastic program. Although computationally more expensive, the resultant model provides more options (i.e. rerouting) and flexibility for planners to deal with uncertainties more effectively. The new model was tested on a set of instances adapted from the literature and its performance and characteristics are studied through both comparative studies and detailed analyses at the solution structure level. Implications for practical applications are discussed and further research directions are also provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Not only are the consequences of their choices uncertain, but they generally involve several attributes, such as time and money. Time-money tradeoffs have been studied in depth in transport economics, and research is now paying increasing attention to the role of uncertainty and information in transport decisions. This paper aims to measure the impact of uncertainty and information on multi-attribute decisions using Prospect Theory. In doing so, the study makes two contributions to transportation literature: one methodological and the other empirical. First, we propose a fast and tractable method for measuring Prospect Theory parameters that capture attitudes towards probabilities (probability weighting function) and attitudes towards losses (loss aversion). The elicitation method does not require the elicitation of the utility function. This makes it particularly suitable in complex multi-attribute decisions where the shape of the utility function is unknown. Second, we present the results of an experiment that uses the proposed method to measure, at the individual level, probability weighting in decisions involving joint time and money consequences in two decision contexts: risk (where probabilities are given) and ambiguity (where the probability distribution is unknown). An experimental setup that exposes subjects to real gains and losses for money and time has been built for this purpose. We observe inverse S-shaped probability weighting and loss aversion for risk. Probability weighting is even more pronounced in ambiguity, where subjects do not have precise information about the probability distribution. We explain how these results and the analysis of ambiguity attitudes in general can offer a better understanding of travelers' route or transport mode choices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Raising several questions about certainty indexing, researchers are advised to apply such methods cautiously. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper incorporates the RIN system into the design of a biofuel supply chain that addresses independent decisions of non-cooperative farmers, biofuel manufacturers, and blenders. Game-theoretic models are developed to examine the impacts of the RIN system on individual stakeholders' decisions (e.g., on farmland use, bi-orefinery investment, biofuel production) and the competition between food and biofuel industries, in both a perfectly competitive scenario and a monopoly scenario. For the perfectly competitive scenario, Nash equilibrium can be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. For the monopoly scenario, a bi-level Stackelberg leader-follower model is developed, from which we found that a rigid mandate on blenders may suppress the total biofuel production. To avoid such unintended consequences, a relaxed unit-RIN based penalty scheme is proposed and shown to improve the overall biofuel supply chain performance. Managerial insights are drawn from a numerical case study for the state of Illinois. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The scheme defines a peak time window and charges those who use the primary route within that window in the form of mobility credits. Those who avoid the peak-time window, by either traveling outside the peak time window or switching to the alternative route, may be rewarded credits. A market is created such that those who need to pay credits can purchase them from those who acquire them from their rewarding travel choices. A general analytical framework is proposed for a system of two parallel routes. The framework (1) considers a variety of assumptions about commuters' behavior in response to the discontinuous credit charge introduced at the-boundary of the peak-time window, (2) allows modeling congestion effects (or demand elasticity) on the alternative route, and (3) enables both the design of system optimal TCS and the analysis of the efficiency of any given TCS. Our analyses indicate that the proposed TCS not only achieves up to 33% efficiency gains in the base scenario, but also distributes the benefits among all the commuters directly through the credit trading. The results also suggest that very simple TCS schemes could provide substantial efficiency gains for a wide range of scenarios. Such simplicity and robustness are important to practicability of the proposed scheme. Numerical experiments are conducted to examine the sensitivity of TCS designs to various system parameters.

Even though there have been developments related to HDC model estimation and theoretical parameter identification, many practical and empirical issues related with HDC modelling have not been treated yet. In particular, it is known that as the HDC model estimates are not unique, it is necessary to impose some constraints on the model estimation process. In this paper we analyse the impact of different normalization approaches on parameter recovery in a simulated environment, identifying their advantages and disadvantages; we also analyse the impact of data variability on parameter recovery. We found serious problems when arbitrary values are used for normalization and when data variability is low, especially regarding the generation of the latent variables. The discrete choice model component appears to be more robust to these issues.

The model is based on a well-established theory of traffic flow through signalized intersections and is combined with a machine learning framework to both learn static parameters of the roadways (such as free flow velocity or traffic signal parameters) as well as to estimate and predict travel times through the arterial network. The machine learning component of the approach uses the significant amount of historical data collected by the Mobile Millennium system since March 2009 with over 500 probe vehicles reporting their position once per minute in San Francisco, CA. The hybrid model provides a distinct advantage over pure statistical or pure traffic theory models in that it is robust to noisy data (due to the large volumes of historical data) and it produces forecasts using traffic flow theory principles consistent with the physics of traffic. Validation of the model is performed in two different ways. First, a large scale test of the model is performed by splitting the data source into two sets, using the first to produce the estimates and the second to validate them. Second, an alternate validation approach is presented. It consists of a 3-day experiment in which GPS data was collected once per second from 20 drivers on four routes through San Francisco, allowing for precise calculation of actual travel times. The model is run by down-sampling the data and validated using the travel times from these 20 drivers. The results indicate that this approach is a significant step forward in estimating traffic states throughout the arterial network using a relatively small amount of real-time data. The estimates from our model are compared to those given by a data-driven baseline algorithm, for which we achieve a 16% improvement in terms of the root mean squared error of travel time estimates. The primary reason for success is the reliance on a flow model of traffic, which ensures that estimates are consistent with the physics of traffic. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Data were analyzed from PharMetrics IMS LifeLink (TM) US Claims Database (2006-2008). Patients (>= 18 years) with 36 months continuous enrollment, ICD-9 code for low back pain, and claims in 3 out of 4 consecutive months in the 12-month prospective period were included and classified with CLBP. Patients were further classified with a neuropathic component (wNP) and without a neuropathic component (woNP) based on ICD-9 codes. Healthcare resources, physical therapy, prescription medication use, and associated costs were assessed for the period January 1-December 31, 2008. Results: A number of patients (39,425) were identified with CLBP (90.4% wNP). Patients wNP included more women, were older and more likely to have clinically diagnosed depression, and made significantly greater use of arty prescription medication at index event, opioids (particularly schedule II), and healthcare resources. Total direct costs of CLBP-related resource use were similar to US$96 million over a 12-month follow-up. CLBP wNP accounted for 96% of total costs and mean annual cost of care/patient was similar to 160% higher than CLBP patients woNP (US$ 2577 vs US$ 1007, p<0.0001). Limitations: This study was descriptive and was not designed to demonstrate causality between diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. Resource use and costs for reasons other than LBP were not included. Patients with neuropathic pain are more likely to seek treatment; therefore CLBP patients with a non-neuropathic component may be under-represented. Conclusions: The disproportionately high share of interventional resource use in CLBP wNP suggests greater need for new treatment options that more comprehensively manage the range of pain symptoms and signaling mechanisms involved, to help improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.",,,"Mehra, M (通讯作者)，Janssen Global Serv LLC, 700 US Highway 202 S,POB 300, Raritan, NJ 08869 USA.",mmehra@its.jnj.com,,,,,,,0,97,108,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In a very recent paper, a variational principle has been proved for models of the Generic Second Order Modeling (GSOM) family, yielding an adequate framework for effective numerical methods. Any model of the GSOM family can be recast into its Lagrangian form as a Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJ) for which the solution is interpreted as the position of vehicles. This solution can be computed thanks to Lax-Hopf like formulas and a generalization of the inf-morphism property. The efficiency of this computational method is illustrated through a numerical example and finally a discussion about future developments is provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Different from the conventional OD estimation methods, the proposed modeling approach aims to estimate not only the mean but also the variation (in terms of covariance matrix) of the OD demands during the same peak hour periods due to day-to-day fluctuation over the whole year. For this purpose, this paper fully considers the first- and second-order statistical properties of the day-to-day hourly traffic count data so as to capture the stochastic characteristics of the OD demands. The proposed model is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. In the upper-level problem, a weighted least squares method is used to estimate the mean and covariance matrix of the OD demands. In the lower-level problem, a reliability-based traffic assignment model is adopted to take account of travelers' risk-taking path choice behaviors under OD demand variation. A heuristic iterative estimation-assignment algorithm is proposed for solving the bi-level optimization problem. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applications of the proposed model for assessment of network performance over the whole year. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We identify functional dependencies among network metrics through regression analysis. We build a graph for the network metrics, with each metric as a node and a link existing if there is a functional dependency between two metrics. We find that the air navigation route systems in France and Italy are most similar. The air navigation route systems in Oceania ensemble common features of most countries and should be used as representatives for analysis of new air traffic management operational procedures.

The contributions of this paper are a new mathematical programming model for the CTPP and two solution methods for its solution.

While accurate, the use of binary variables can cause problems when studying large networks with many intersections. Instead, the signal control can be approximated through a continuum approach where the on-and-off control variable is replaced by a continuous priority parameter. Advantages of such approximation include elimination of the need for binary variables, lower time resolution requirements, and more flexibility and robustness in a decision environment. It also resolves the issue of discontinuous travel time functions arising from the context of dynamic traffic assignment. Despite these advantages in application, it is not clear from a theoretical point of view how accurate is such continuum approach; i.e., to what extent is this a valid approximation for the on-and-off case. The goal of this paper is to answer these basic research questions and provide further guidance for the application of such continuum signal model. In particular, by employing the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model (Lighthill and Whitham, 1955; Richards, 1956) on a traffic network, we investigate the convergence of the on-and-off signal model to the continuum model in regimes of diminishing signal cycles. We also provide numerical analyses on the continuum approximation error when the signal cycles are not infinitesimal. As we explain, such convergence results and error estimates depend on the type of fundamental diagram assumed and whether or not vehicle spillback occurs to the signalized intersection in question. Finally, a traffic signal optimization problem is presented and solved which illustrates the unique advantages of applying the continuum signal model instead of the on-and-off model.

Study of traffic network paradox and its robustness is an important topic of traffic assignment.

Using the Logit model and Braess' network, we find that paradox occurs when the congestion of a newly added road meets certain criterion. Paradox severity and the ranking of the network components are both affected by the new congestion. This finding can be applied in the planning of urban traffic network. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

They formulated an integer programming problem of minimizing the total travel time of flights in the National Airspace System of the United States subject to sector capacity constraints. The integer program was relaxed to a linear program for computational efficiency. In this paper the authors formulate the optimization problem in a standard linear programming form. We analyze the total unimodular property of the constraint matrix, and prove that the linear programming relaxation generates an optimal integral solution for the original integer program. It is guaranteed to be optimal and integral if solved by a simplex related method. In order to speed up the computation, we apply the Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition algorithm, which is shown to preserve the total unimodularity of the constraint matrix. Finally, we evaluate the performances of Sun and Bayen's relaxation solved by the interior point method and our decomposition algorithm with large-scale air traffic data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been addressed by different solution strategies, including labeling methods, ranking methods, constraint methods, and parametric methods. Increasing attention has been paid to parametric methods in recent years, partially because of its simple algorithmic logic and its flexibility of being used in different user-preference decision-making environments. The core idea of a parametric algorithm is scalarization, by which a multiobjective shortest path problem can be tackled by repeatedly solving a single-objective subproblem. However, existing parametric algorithms suffer two notorious deficiencies, which considerably limit its further applications: first, typical subroutines for the single-objective subproblem in general cannot capture nonextreme Pareto-optimal paths; second, parametric algorithms for biobjective problems cannot be directly extended to solving multiobjective problems. This paper provides some algorithmic improvements that can partially overcome these deficiencies. In particular, the contribution of this work is twofold: first, in the biobjective parametric solution framework, we propose an approximate label-setting algorithm for the parameterized, constrained single-objective subproblem, which is capable of identifying all extreme paths and a large percentage (i.e., 85-100%) of nonextreme paths; second, we suggest a general projection scheme that can decompose a multiobjective problem into a number of biobjective problems. The approximate parametric algorithm runs in polynomial time. The algorithmic design and solution performance of the algorithm for multiobjective shortest path problems are illustrated, and numerically evaluated and compared with a benchmark algorithm in terms of solution completeness and efficiency.

A problem with this approach is that the obtained valuation will in general depend on the standardized travel time distribution, and hence cannot be transferred from one context to another. A recently suggested remedy for this problem has been to estimate a scheduling model, which in theory is transferrable, and use the implied reduced-form to derive valuations for use in appraisal. In this paper we estimate both a scheduling model and the implied reduced-form model, using stated choice data. The valuation of travel time variability implied by the scheduling model turns out to be substantially smaller than what is obtained from a reduced-form model estimated on the same sample. The results suggest that the scheduling model does not capture all of the disutility arising from travel time variability. Hence, although it can be shown that scheduling and reduced-form models are theoretically equivalent, that hypothesized equivalence is not reflected in the empirical evidence. We speculate that the derivation of reduced-form models from an underlying scheduling model omits two essential features: first, the notion of an exogenously fixed preferred arrival time neglects the fact that most activities can be rescheduled given full information about the travel times in advance, and second, disutility may be derived from uncertainty as such, in the form of anxiety, decisions costs or costs for having contingency plans. We also report our estimates of the valuation of travel time variability for public transit trips, for use in applied appraisal. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The Markov chain models employ monitoring data from visual inspection activities over a period of time in order to predict the deterioration progress of infrastructure systems. Monitoring data play a vital part in the managerial framework of infrastructure management. As a matter of course, the accuracy of deterioration prediction and life cycle cost analysis largely depends on the soundness of monitoring data. However, in reality, monitoring data often contain measurement errors and selection biases, which tend to weaken the correctness of estimation results. In this paper, the authors present a hidden Markov model to tackle selection biases in monitoring data. Selection biases are assumed as random variables. Bayesian estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation are employed as techniques in tackling the posterior probability distribution, the random generation of condition states, and the model's parameters. An empirical application to the Japanese national road system is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Estimation results highlight the fact that the properties of the Markov transition matrix have greatly improved in comparison with the properties obtained from applying the conventional multi-stage exponential Markov model.

This is particularly important in network design, second-best pricing, or other bilevel problems in which many equilibrium runs must be solved as a subproblem to a master optimization program. A fixed trip table based on an equilibrium path flow solution is often used, but this ignores important attraction and diversion effects as drivers (globally) change routes in response to (local) subnetwork changes. This paper presents an approach for replacing a regional network with a smaller one, containing all of the subnetwork, and zones. Artificial arcs are created to represent all paths between each origin and subnetwork boundary node, under the assumption that the set of equilibrium routes does not change. The primary contribution of the paper is a procedure for estimating a cost function on these artificial arcs, using derivatives of the equilibrium travel times between the end nodes to create a Taylor series. A bush-based representation allows rapid calculation of these derivatives. Two methods for calculating these derivatives are presented, one based on network transformations and resembling techniques used in the analysis of resistive circuits, and another based on iterated solution of a nested set of linear equations. These methods are applied to two networks, one small and artificial, and the other a regional network representing the Austin, Texas metropolitan area. These demonstrations show substantial improvement in accuracy as compared to using a fixed table, and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This non-linear model can be linearized because of the special structure achieved by the binary leader decision variables and subsequently solved by a Benders Decomposition Algorithm to global optimality. We illustrate the capability of the approach on the Discrete Network Design Problem which adds arcs to an existing road network at the leader stage and anticipates the traffic equilibrium for the follower stage. Because of the non-linear objective functions of this problem, we use a linearization method for increasing, convex and non-linear functions based on continuous variables.

However, good methods that convert these data into useful information are needed to leverage these data. In this study a new method to estimate traffic states on arterials based on trajectory data is presented and assessed. The method is based on the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) theory. By using this theory, traffic dynamics on arterials can be better captured by extracting more information from the same piece of data. Trajectory data used consist of the trajectory of the latest equipped vehicle that crossed the segment under study. Preliminary analysis based on micro-simulation suggests that this method yields good traffic state estimates both at congested and uncongested situations, even for very low penetration rates (1%). The method is also able to forecast queue length at intersections and travel times along a road section. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The new methodology seeks to address several sources of noise present in conventional measures of the traffic state that arise from the data aggregation process, e.g., averaging across all vehicles over a fixed time period. In the new methodology vehicles are no longer taken successively in the order in which they arrived and there is no requirement to seek out stationary traffic conditions; rather, the traffic state is measured over the headway for each individual vehicle passage and the vehicles are grouped by similar lengths and speeds before aggregation. Care is also taken to exclude measurements that might be corrupted by detector errors. The result is a homogeneous set of vehicles and speeds in each bin. While conventional fixed time averages may have fewer than 10 vehicles in a sample, the new binning process ensures a large number of vehicles in each bin before aggregation. We calculate the median flow and median occupancy for each combined length and speed bin. Then we connect these median points across all of the speed bins for a given vehicle length to derive the empirical fundamental relationship for that length. This use of the median is also important; unlike conventional aggregation techniques that find the average, the median is far less sensitive to outliers arising from uncommon driver behavior or occasional detector errors. The work is applied to real data from a dual loop detector station and it yields consistent results across 18 independent days, 4 independent lanes, and 7 independent length bins. These empirical results from non-stationary traffic are also shown to be consistent with hypothetical results generated with homogeneous vehicles under stationary traffic conditions.

However, when the perfect rationality assumption is relaxed to bounded rationality, which assumes that travelers can take any route whose travel cost is within an 'indifference band' of the shortest path cost, it remains unclear under what conditions the Braess paradox occurs. This paper fills this gap by exploring relationships between the occurrence of the Braess paradox and the indifference band as well as the demand level in the setting of the boundedly rational user equilibrium (BRUE). The definition of the Braess paradox is extended based on planners' risk-taking attitudes, i.e., risk-averse, risk-prone and risk-neutral, due to the non-uniqueness of BRUE. The paradox occurrence conditions under different risk-taking attitudes are investigated using the classical Braess network and compared with those under the user equilibrium. Then we generalize the paradox conditions to simple and ordinary grid networks with regular Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) link performance functions. The impact of the link cost congestion sensitivity along with the indfference band on the occurrence of the Braess paradox is also studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our method is an extension of previous results for Logit and MEV models. We show that the practical application of the proposed method for Logit Mixture can result in a Naive approach, in which the kernel is replaced by the usual sampling correction for Logit. We give theoretical support for previous applications of the Naive approach, showing not only that it yields consistent estimators, but also providing its asymptotic distribution for proper hypothesis testing. We illustrate the proposed method using Monte Carlo experimentation and real data. Results provide further evidence that the Naive approach is suitable and practical.

Willingness-to-pay (WTP) measures, such as the value of travel time savings (VTTS) are, in the case of RCL models estimated in preference space, ratios of random parameters. In this paper we apply the Delta method to compute the confidence intervals of such WTP measures, taking into account the variance-covariance matrix of the estimates of the distributional parameters. The same Delta method can be applied when the model is estimated in WTP space. Compared to simulation methods such as proposed by Krinsky and Robb, the Delta method is able to avoid most of the simulations by deriving partly analytical expressions for the standard errors.

A bus need not wait to perform this exit maneuver, even if it requires circumventing one or more other buses that are still dwelling in the stop's downstream berths. Yet, many jurisdictions impose restrictions on bus entry maneuvers into a stop to limit disruptions to cars and other buses. Buses are typically prohibited from entering a stop whenever this would require maneuvering around other buses still dwelling in upstream berths. An entering bus is instead required to wait in queue until the upstream berths are vacated. Analytical models are formulated to predict how bus discharge flows from busy, multi-berth stops are affected by allowing buses to freely exit, but not freely enter berths. These models apply when: a bus queue is always present at the stop's entrance; buses depart the entry queue and enter the stop as per the restriction described above; and the stop is isolated from the effects of nearby traffic signals and other bus stops. We find that for these restricted-entry stops, bus-carrying capacities can often be improved by regulating the exit maneuvers as well. This turns out to be particularly true when the stop's number of berths is large. Simulations show that these findings still hold when a stop is only moderately busy with entry queues that persist for much, but not all of the time. The simulations also indicate that removing any restrictions on bus exit maneuvers is almost always productive when stops are not busy, such that short entry queues form only on occasion, and only for short periods. We argue why certain simple policies for regulating exit maneuvers would likely enhance bus-stop discharge flows. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The main difference with previous research is that we take all possible walks that a traveler can make into consideration. This large number of possible walks poses a potential computational difficulty. However, in this paper we derive theorems for identifying a small subset of walks that only need to be considered. These results are embedded in a solution algorithm, which is tested in a real-life setting for bus transportation in a medium sized city. An extensive numerical study leads to encouraging results. First, only 1% of all possible walks needs to be considered, so that the optimal itinerary can be determined very efficiently. Second, allowing walks has considerable benefits; reducing the travel time in about 6% of all randomly generated examples by more than 10% on average. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

At low demand densities flexible bus service has lower average costs and provides convenient door-to-door service. Bus size and operation type are related since larger buses have lower average cost per passenger at higher demand densities. The operation type and other decisions are jointly optimized here for a bus transit system connecting a major terminal to local regions. Conventional and flexible bus sizes, conventional bus route spacings, areas of service zones for flexible buses, headways, and fleet sizes are jointly optimized in multi-dimensional nonlinear mixed integer optimization problems. To solve them, we propose a hybrid approach, which combines analytic optimization with a Genetic Algorithm. Numerical analysis confirms that the proposed method provides near-optimal solutions and shows how the proposed Mixed Fleet Variable Type Bus Operation (MFV) can reduce total cost compared to alternative operations such as Single Fleet Conventional Bus (SFC), Single Fleet Flexible Bus (SFF), Mixed Fleet Conventional Bus (MFC) and Mixed Fleet Flexible Bus (MFF). With consistent system-wide bus sizes, capital costs are reduced by sharing fleets over times and over regions. The sensitivity of results to several important parameters is also explored.

This paper explores the mechanism of pedestrian street crossings during the red-man phase of traffic light signals and proposes a model for pedestrians' waiting times at signalized intersections. We start from a simplified scenario for a particular pedestrian under specific traffic conditions. Then we take into account the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians via statistical unconditioning. We show that this in general leads to a U-shaped distribution of the pedestrians' intended waiting time. This U-shaped distribution characterizes the nature of pedestrian street-crossing behavior, showing that in general there are a large proportion of pedestrians who cross the street immediately after arriving at the crossing point, and a large proportion of pedestrians who are willing to wait for the entire red-man phase. The U-shaped distribution is shown to reduce to a J-shaped or L-shaped distribution for certain traffic scenarios. The proposed statistical model was applied to analyze real field data.

The previous derivation depends on the assumption that the user equilibrium flow on the private toll road is continuously differentiable with respect to its capacity and toll charge. In this paper, it is shown that the constant v/c ratio phenomenon still holds via relaxing this assumption. Such phenomenon is further examined in different scenarios: the v/c ratio remains constant under the demand regulation, markup charge regulation, and social cost minimization scheme; it may change under the rate-of-return regulation; it may decrease under capacity regulation and increase under the price-cap regulation. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that the v/c ratio may change if there are decreasing or increasing returns to scale in road construction, or the road capacity can only take discrete values, or link flow interactions are involved, whereas the v/c ratio remains constant in case of elastic demand.

We hypothesize that four known effects in freeway traffic can interact upstream of a bottleneck in ways that trigger periodic bursts in its discharge flow. Repeated observations of a 3-km freeway stretch support the hypothesis. Controlled experiments show that the capacity-increasing mechanism can be favorably modulated by metering the site's on-ramps in an unconventional manner. The unconventional strategy repeatedly produced higher average discharge flows and shorter on-ramp queues than did a more traditional metering policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a multi-stage stochastic programming approach, we show that the VMTT and VTTV on a trip is conditional on the realized travel times on preceding trips, first through the arrival time to the preceding activity and second through the information provided about subsequent travel times. Analytical formulas for the VMTT and VTTV are obtained for two special cases with piecewise constant and linear marginal cost functions, respectively. With flexible scheduling, there is typically a cost associated with a positive correlation of travel times, arising from persistent deviations from typical travel demand or supply on a given day. However, there is also a strict benefit in the dependence since it allows for a more efficient scheduling of later trips. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed model allows an explicit consideration of the interaction between two types of agents in the economy: (1) a private rail operator who seeks to optimize rail service variables-rail line length, number and spacing of stations, headway and fare-to maximize its own net profit, which is the sum of revenues from passenger fare-box and property development; and (2) households who choose the residential locations that maximize their own utilities subject to a budget constraint. The solution properties of the proposed model are analyzed, and a heuristic solution algorithm is presented. An illustrative example is used to show the application of the proposed model. The findings show that integrated rail and property development can change a city's land-use pattern and housing market (in terms of housing density, space, and price), and its economic viability is closely related to household income level and residential density of the city.

J,"Bar-Gera, H; Boyce, D; Nie, Y",,,,"Bar-Gera, Hillel; Boyce, David; Nie, Yu (Marco)",,,User-equilibrium route flows and the condition of proportionality,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,User-equilibrium; Route flows; Multiple-class link flows; Proportionality,TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; ALGORITHM; MATRIX,"User-equilibrium (UE) static deterministic traffic assignment is a widely accepted model among researchers, and is extensively applied in travel forecasting practice. UE route flows are also quite commonly used in methodological research as well as in practical applications, even though it is well known that route flows are not uniquely determined by the UE conditions. One way to resolve this dilemma is by imposing an additional condition, such as the condition of proportionality. The purpose of the research findings presented here is to examine the nature and magnitude of the differences in route flows and multi-class link flows in a realistic setting by applying three assignment software tools in a case study based on the network of the Chicago region. The case study includes a single class version as well as a multi-class version with two classes: private cars and trucks. The assignment tools represent three categories of algorithms: link-based, route-based and pairs-of-alternative-segments-based. For each of the first two types we chose one tool that is commonly used in practice. For the third type, a research tool was used. Select link analyses from the various solutions are compared in a pair-wise manner, showing that the differences in the results cannot be neglected. A method to evaluate the satisfaction of proportionality for each assignment solution by itself is presented, and applied to all the solutions. The link-based solutions satisfy proportionality reasonably well, but satisfactory levels of UE convergence require very substantial computation times. The route-based assignment tool offers quick and precise convergence, but the resulting solutions deviate considerably from the condition of proportionality. The pairs-of-alternative-segments-based tool offers quick and precise convergence and generally satisfies proportionality. The authors believe that these findings stem from the nature of link-based and route-based algorithms, and thus apply to most algorithms in these categories. These conclusions should be taken into consideration by researchers in developing new algorithms, as well as by practitioners in choosing which software tool to apply. Additional assignment tools that aim to offer quick and precise convergence as well as proportionality have been announced more recently; however, they were not available for evaluation at the time the research was conducted. Their evaluation is a task that remains for future studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that a four-segment latent class nested logit model with individual characteristics in segment membership functions is the most preferred specification.

Finally, based on the observation that both models use standard deviation of travel time within their measure of travel time reliability, we propose a general travel time reliability bi-objective user equilibrium model.

It can be formalized as the real-time railway traffic management problem, which seeks for the best train routing and scheduling in case of perturbation, in a given time horizon. We propose a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for tackling this problem, representing the infrastructure with fine granularity. This is seldom done in the literature, unless stringent artificial constraints are imposed for reducing the size of the search space. In a thorough experimental analysis, we assess the impact of the granularity of the representation of the infrastructure on the optimal solution. We tackle randomly generated instances representing traffic in the control area named triangle of Gagny, and instances obtained from the real timetable of the control area including the Lille-Flandres station (both in France) and we consider multiple perturbation scenarios. In these experiments, the negative impact of a rough granularity on the delay suffered by trains is remarkable and statistically significant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Towards this end, an endogenous segmentation approach is proposed that allocates decision makers probabilistically to various segments as a function of exogenous variables. Within each endogenously determined segment, a segment specific MDCEV model is estimated. This approach provides insights on the various population segments present while evaluating distinct choice regimes for each of these segments. The segmentation approach addresses two concerns: (1) ensures that the parameters are estimated employing the full sample for each segment while using all the population records for model estimation, and (2) provides valuable insights on how the exogenous variables affect segmentation. An Expectation-Maximization algorithm is proposed to address the challenges of estimating the resulting endogenous segmentation based econometric model. A prediction procedure to employ the estimated latent MDCEV models for forecasting is also developed. The proposed model is estimated using data from 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) for the New York region. The results of the model estimates and prediction exercises illustrate the benefits of employing an endogenous segmentation based MDCEV model. The challenges associated with the estimation of latent MDCEV models are also documented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This formulation extends the minimum principle observed by the LWR model.

The cost function includes emissions and driver costs, taking into account traffic congestion which, at peak periods, significantly restricts vehicle speeds and increases emissions. We describe an integer linear programming formulation of the TDPRP and provide illustrative examples to motivate the problem and give insights about the tradeoffs it involves. We also provide an analytical characterization of the optimal solutions for a single-arc version of the problem, identifying conditions under which it is optimal to wait idly at certain locations in order to avoid congestion and to reduce the cost of emissions. Building on these analytical results we describe a novel departure time and speed optimization algorithm for the cases when the route is fixed.

Four market structures are analysed: a monopoly and 3 duopolies that differ in how firms interact. It is well known that private supply leads too high usage fees, and that a serial duopoly leads to even higher fees than a monopoly, as firms are monopolists on their sections. But, as this paper finds, a duopoly can also lead to a different capacity rule than the first-best one, and this distortion differs from with two parallel facilities. Finally, four auction formats for the right to build and operate facilities are investigated. With a bid auction, the competition is on how much to pay the government. This auction leads to the same outcome as no auction. An auction on the facility's capacity leads to an even lower welfare than no auction, as firms set overly large high capacities. Conversely, an auction on the generalised price or number of users leads to the first-best outcome, which they do when the facilities go to one or two winners and both with serial as with parallel facilities.

A simulation exercise is undertaken to evaluate the ability of the proposed approach to recover parameters from a cross-sectional MDCP model. The results show that the MACML approach does very well in recovering parameters, as well as appears to accurately capture the curvature of the Hessian of the log-likelihood function. The paper also demonstrates the application of the proposed approach through a study of individuals' recreational (i.e., long distance leisure) choice among alternative destination locations and the number of trips to each recreational destination location, using data drawn from the 2004 to 2005 Michigan statewide household travel survey.

One congested hub and two linked local airports serve symmetric hub carriers. Passengers valuate the congestion delay cost and benefit from greater frequencies. The government considers privatizing either the hub or local airports. We find that in each privatizing scenario, welfare-maximizing public airport(s) set a charge below their operating costs in order to fully coordinate the high charge of privatized airport(s). If this fiscal deficit is not allowed, each scenario causes distortion. Interestingly, the distortion and hence welfare losses in privatizing a hub are smaller (larger) than those in privatizing both local airports when both passengers' valuations are small (large); this is exactly the case when privatized local airports are strategic substitutes (complements). We also surprisingly find that retaining the hub airport as public and privatizing one or both local airports achieves the same market outcomes. We further find that if all airports are privatized, welfare becomes worse than the other scenarios; the hub airport charges lower (higher) prices than local airports when both local airports are strategic substitutes (complements).

The modeling approach enables the joint modeling of the injury severity of multiple individuals involved in a crash, while also recognizing the endogeneity of seat belt use in predicting injury severity levels as well as accommodating unobserved heterogeneity in the effects of variables. The proposed model is applied to analyze the injury severity of drivers involved in two-vehicle road crashes in Denmark. The empirical analysis provides strong support for the notion that people offset the restraint benefits of seat belt use by driving more aggressively. Also, men and those individuals driving heavy vehicles have a lower injury risk than women and those driving lighter vehicles, respectively. At the same time, men and individuals driving heavy vehicles pose more of a danger to other drivers on the roadway when involved in a crash. Other important determinants of injury severity include speed limit on roadways where crash occurs, the presence (or absence) of center dividers (median barriers), and whether the crash involves a head-on collision. These and other results are discussed, along with implications for countermeasures to reduce injury severities in crashes. The analysis also underscores the importance of considering injury severity at a crash level, while accommodating seat belt endogeneity effects and unobserved heterogeneity effects.

To address time-sensitivity, the routing problem is modeled with the objective of minimizing the sum of arrival times to beneficiaries. We propose a continuous approximation approach which uses aggregated instance data to develop routing policies and cost approximations. Numerical tests are performed that demonstrate the effectiveness of the cost approximations at predicting the true implementation costs of the policies and compare the policies against more complex solution approaches. The continuous approximation approach yields solutions which can be easily implemented; further, this approach reduces the need for detailed data and the computational requirements to solve the problem.

The Gaussian approximation is characterized by deterministic mean and covariance dynamics; the mean dynamics are those of the Godunov scheme. By deriving the Gaussian model, as opposed to assuming Gaussian noise arbitrarily, covariance matrices of traffic variables follow from the physics of traffic flow and can be computed using only few parameters, regardless of system size or how finely the system is discretized. Stationary behavior of the covariance dynamics is analyzed and it is shown that the covariance matrices are bounded. Consequently, Kalman filters that use the proposed model are stochastically observable, which is a critical issue in real time estimation of traffic dynamics. Model validation was carried out in a real-world signalized arterial setting, where cycle-by-cycle maximum queue sizes were estimated using the Gaussian model as a description of state dynamics. The estimated queue sizes were compared to observed maximum queue sizes and the results indicate very good agreement between estimated and observed queue sizes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, car-following is an essential component of micro-simulation models. Over the last decade the use of microscopic simulation models as a tool for investigating traffic systems, ITS applications, and emission impacts, is becoming increasingly popular. The paper presents a flexible framework for modeling car-following behavior that relaxes some limitations and assumptions of the most commonly used car following models. The proposed approach recognizes different regimes in driving such as car-following, free-flow, emergency stopping, and incorporates different decisions in each regime, such as acceleration, deceleration, and do-nothing depending on the situation. A case study using NGSIM vehicle trajectory data is used to illustrate the proposed model structure. Statistical tests suggest that the model performs better than previous models.

A DCS with constant time delay is then introduced to formulate the continuous-time model of instantaneous dynamic traffic equilibria (IDUE) with a fixed demand profile. We develop a time decomposition scheme based on link free flow travel times to convert the delay DCS to a series of DCSs without time delays that are solved by a numerical time-stepping method. We provide rigorous numerical treatment of the time-decomposed IDUE model, including solvability of the discrete-time complementarity problems and convergence of the numerical trajectories to a continuous-time solution. We present numerical results to validate the IDUE on a small network and also on the Sioux Falls network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Inverse optimization is proposed for estimating parameters of the household activity pattern problem such that the observed behavior is optimal, the patterns can be replicated, and the distribution of the parameters is consistent. In order to fit the model to both the sequencing of activities and the arrival times to those activities, an inverse problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem such that coefficients of the objectives are jointly estimated along with the goal arrival times to the activities. The formulation is designed to be structurally similar to the equivalent problems defined by Ahuja and Orlin and can be solved exactly with a cutting plane algorithm. The concept of a unique invariant common prior is used to regularize the estimation method, and proven to converge using the Method of Successive Averages. The inverse model is tested on sample households from the 2001 California Household Travel Survey and results indicate a significant improvement over the standard inverse problem in the literature as well as baseline prescriptive models that do not make use of sample data for calibration. Although, not unexpectedly, the estimated optimization model by itself is a relatively poor forecasting model, it may be used in determining responses of a population to spatio-temporal scenarios where revealed preference data is absent.

The first model is formulated as a utility maximization problem under monotonic and separable link travel times, whereas the second model is formulated as a utility maximization problem under non-monotonic and non-separable link travel times. The proposed models have the same structure as a user equilibrium CUE) traffic assignment problem with elastic demand. It is shown that the first model, which addresses independent stochastic capacity, is formulated as an optimization problem with a unique solution and is solved by using an algorithm for a UE traffic assignment problem with fixed demand. The second model, which addresses both stochastic Origin-Destination (O-D) flow and stochastic link capacity, is formulated as a nonlinear complementary problem. O-D demand functions formulated in the proposed models are derived from the utility maximization behavior of the driver in the network. Therefore, the network models proposed in this study are consistent with those of studies that address the value of travel time and of travel time reliability based on utility maximization behavior without considering the driver's route choice. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the models presented in this study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these models suffer from some problems or deficiencies namely (a) the link outflows can violate first-in-first-out (FIFO), (b) the link outflows can exceed the link outflow capacities, (c) the link inflows can exceed the link inflow capacities, and (d) the link occupancies can exceed the link occupancy capacities. In this paper we introduce methods to overcome each of these problems. To remove problems (a) and (b) we extend the link travel-time model to better reflect behaviour when traffic flow is varying over time. To remove problems (c) and (d) we introduce more substantial changes in the model, to introduce capacities, spillback and queues compatible with the model. These extensions strengthen the realism, behavioural basis and usability of the link travel-time model and the DNL and DTA models that are based on it. They have no obvious adverse implications or side effects and require little additional computational effort. The original model is a special case of the new/extended model: the above extensions are activated if and only if any of the problems (a)-(d) arise, otherwise the new model reduces to the original model.

Furthermore, the higher the containerization index, the greater the occupancy rate and the bigger the bulk rate, then the lower the inefficiency in terminals is.

The former synchronizes the accelerating and braking actions of trains to maximize the utilization of regenerative energy, and the latter controls the train driving strategy to minimize the tractive energy consumption under the timetable constraints. To achieve a better performance on the net energy consumption, i.e., the difference between the tractive energy consumption and the utilization of regenerative energy, this paper formulates an integrated energy-efficient operation model to jointly optimize the timetable and speed profile. We design a genetic algorithm to solve the model and present some numerical experiments based on the actual operation data of Beijing Metro Yizhuang Line of China. It is shown that a larger headway leads to smaller energy saving rate, and the maximum energy saving rate achieved is around 25% when we use the minimum allowable headway of 90 s. In addition, compared with the two-step approach optimizing the timetable and speed profile separately, the integrated approach can reduce the net energy consumption around 20%.

The main objective for the model is to find the most profitable selection from a set of cargo to be loaded on an aircraft. The secondary objective is to minimise the deviation between the aircraft's centre of gravity, and a known target value so as to reduce fuel consumption and improve stability. The model is subject to a large number of constraints that ensure structural integrity and stability of the aircraft, as well as the safety of the cargo and crew. A set of additional constraints guarantees safe and efficient loading and unloading. Experimental results on real-life data show that the model outperforms human expert planners on both objectives, while remaining computationally fast enough for interactive use. This advocates the use of such a decision support model for all air cargo load planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to this more general framework considering two modes, the paper focuses on the evening rush, when commuters travel from work to home. Commuters choose which mode to use and when to travel in order to minimize the generalized cost of their own trips, including queueing delay and penalties for deviation from a preferred schedule of arrival and departure to and from work. The user equilibrium for the isolated morning and evening commutes are shown to be asymmetric because the schedule penalty in the morning is the difference between the departure and wished curves, and the schedule penalty in the evening is the difference between the arrival and wished curves. It is shown that the system optimum in the morning and evening peaks are symmetric because queueing delay is eliminated and the optimal arrival curves are the same as the departure curves. The paper then-considers both the morning and evening peaks together for a single mode bottleneck (all cars) with identical travelers that share the same wished times. For a schedule penalty function of the morning departure and evening arrival times that is positive definite and has certain properties, a user equilibrium is shown to exist in which commuters travel in the same order in both peaks. The result is used to illustrate the user equilibrium for two cases: (i) commuters have decoupled schedule preferences in the morning and evening and (ii) commuters must work a fixed shift length but have flexibility when to start. Finally, a special case is considered with cars and transit: commuters have the same wished order in the morning and evening peaks. Commuters must use the same mode in both directions, and the complete user equilibrium solution reveals the number of commuters using cars and transit and the period in the middle of each rush when transit is used.

To support these applications, increasingly sophisticated methods have been developed to model pavement deterioration and solve for optimal management strategies. Recently a simpler optimization approach for the system-level resurfacing problem has been developed, which is bottom-up rather than top-down, preserving facility-specific features to develop informative budget allocation results (Sathaye and Madanat, 2011). In this paper we expand upon and enhance this approach for application to large-scale, heterogeneous road networks. The methodological enhancements allow for the approach to be applied to a broader spectrum of real-world problems and efficiently for large-scale networks. These developments are implemented and presented in a case study which uses empirical models. The results are shown to be robust to deterioration model uncertainty, which is consistent with previous findings for small networks and single facilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results were used in the 2008 regulatory review of the British infrastructure manager, Network Rail, and showed that the company faced an efficiency gap of around 40% against European best practice - in line with engineering-based evidence. More widely, the paper highlights the advantages of the inefficiency specification adopted for use in economic regulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Smith, Andrew S.

Methods: Administrative claims from Medicare- and privately-insured individuals during 2004-2008 were used in this retrospective database study of patients with advanced HNC. Patients diagnosed with HNC were matched 1:1 to cancer-free controls to measure the incremental economic burden of HNC. Outcomes of interest were measured during the 6 months following the date of a secondary tumor diagnosis for metastatic patients or the date of a diagnosis indicating rHNC. To assess treatment patterns, HNC patients were evaluated for the use frequency of treatments (radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery). Costs were reported in 2008 US$ from a third-party payer perspective and were analyzed using generalized linear models and two-part regression models adjusting for differences in age and baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index (excluding cancer diagnoses) between the HNC and control cohorts. Components of cost included inpatient, outpatient and other medical services as well as pharmacy costs. Results: The mHNC cohort consisted of 1042 patients and the rHNC cohort included 324 patients. The most common treatments for mHNC patients were supportive care (90.2%), radiation therapy (48.5%), surgery (41.9%) and chemotherapy (38.3%). Patients with rHNC frequently received HNC-related supportive care (71.0%), radiation therapy (67.9%) and chemotherapy (27.2%); HNC-related surgery was infrequent (12.7%) during the study period. The 6-month incremental adjusted total costs were $60,414 per patient for mHNC and $21,141 per patient for rHNC (p<0.0001). Approximately 46-58% of the incremental cost was attributable to outpatient visits, 27-37% to inpatient costs and 11-13% to pharmacy, depending on the HNC cohort. Limitations: The identification of mHNC/rHNC was based on diagnosis codes and treatment patterns with the limitation of the claims database. Conclusions: Metastatic and recurrent, locally-advanced HNC patients frequently receive cancer-related treatments and incur substantial economic burden.",,,"Marynchenko, M (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",mmarynchenko@analysisgroup.com,,"Frois, Christian/0000-0002-4397-2657",,,,,0,13,14,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Building on the continuum theory of pedestrian flows and the cell transmission model for car traffic, an isotropic framework is developed that can describe the simultaneous and potentially conflicting propagation of multiple pedestrian groups. The model is formulated at the aggregate level and thus computationally cheap, which is advantageous for studying large-scale problems. A detailed analysis of several basic flow patterns including counter- and cross flows, as well as two generic scenarios involving a corner-and a bottleneck flow is carried out. Various behavioral patterns ranging from disciplined queueing to impatient jostling can be realistically reproduced. Following a systematic model calibration, two case studies involving a Swiss railway station and a Dutch bottleneck flow experiment are presented. A comparison with the social force model and pedestrian tracking data shows a good performance of the proposed model with respect to predictions of travel time and density. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper designs a decision support system to determine optimal product architecture modularity in closed loop supply chains. The objective is to investigate if remanufacturing and modular upgrading is appropriate at certain periods and in modules. The optimization model is tested under several production yield scenarios in order to determine manufacturing and remanufacturing capacity and production line scheduling under process yield uncertainty. The implications of product architecture modularity for operations economy of green supply chains are discussed in terms of their theoretical and managerial aspects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We have modeled the design problem by a mixed integer-linear program, and we developed an exact Branch and Price approach to solve it to optimality. The proposed approach includes a labeling algorithm in which we introduced appropriate dominance rules, which do not compromise optimality. We have compared the efficiency of our approach with that of related algorithms from the literature. Furthermore, we have used the proposed approach to study key aspects of the system design problem, such as the effect of various constraints on the service level, and the tuning of the system's parameters to address different transport environments.

Recently, a mathematical transformation of this approach has been proposed to account for the potential omission of latent spatial variables that may overestimate the impact of accessibility to mass transit systems on values. The development of a Difference-in-Differences (DID) estimator, based on the repeat-sales approach, is a move in the right direction. However, such an estimator neglects the possibility that specification of the price equation may follow a spatial autoregressive process with respect to the dependent variable. The objective of this paper is to propose a spatial Difference-in-Differences (SDID) estimator accounting for possible spatial spillover effects. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of a suitable weights matrix accounting for spatial links between observations. Finally, an empirical application of the SDID estimator based on the development of a new commuter rail transit system for the suburban agglomeration of Montreal (Canada) is presented and compared to the usual DID estimator.

Though the assumption has allowed travel demand analysts to use these models to forecast changes in observable behavior in response to changes in the decision-making environment, the assumption has overlooked the influence of these changes on the preferences underlying observable behavior. As a consequence, the use of these models has been limited to forecasting horizons over which preferences can reasonably be assumed to be stable. We build on Latent Class Choice Models (LCCMs) to allow for preference endogeneity. Conventional LCCMs formulate class membership as some function of the decision-maker's characteristics, but they ignore the impact of alternative attributes, which usually enter the class-specific choice models, on class membership. In this paper we introduce LCCMs with feedback from the class-specific choice models to the class membership model through the construct of consumer surplus. Class membership is hypothesized to be a function not only of the characteristics of the decision-maker but also of the consumer surplus offered by each class, which in turn is a function of alternative attributes, taste parameters and choice sets. The framework is applied to a case study on travel mode choice behavior. A comparison between LCCMs with feedback and traditional models that do not allow for preference endogeneity finds that the former performs better in terms of fit and offers greater behavioral insights, and that the latter can lead to biased forecasts.

The approach proportion is defined as the proportion of passengers leaving a node through its outgoing link. To solve the VI problem, an extragradient method with adaptive stepsizes is developed. Unlike the existing methods for solving the frequency-based transit assignment problem, the convergence of our method requires only the pseudomonotone and Lipschitz continuous properties of the mapping function in VI, and it is not necessary for the Lipschitz constant to be known in advance. A Braess-like paradox in transit assignment is also discussed, where providing new lines to a transit network or increasing the frequency of an existing line may not improve the system performance in terms of expected total system travel cost. Various numerical examples are given to illustrate some paradox phenomena and to test the performance of our proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Szeto, W.

The CDA problem is modeled as a hierarchical travel choice problem based on random utility theory, which forms the basis for constructing as a general unconstrained optimization formulation. It has the flexibility to handle general probabilistic distributions (not just the Gumbel distribution) in a hierarchical travel choice structure. Qualitative properties of the general unconstrained CDA formulation are rigorously proved to ensure the equivalence and uniqueness of the solution. Particularly, the model is analyzed for two logit CDA models where the choice probability can be expressed in a closed form. The first logit CDA model with the independently and identically distributed (IID) Gumbel distribution is shown to be equivalent to several well-known existing CDA models. The second logit CDA model handles the independence assumption by accounting for the unobserved similarities among destinations in the destination choice level using a spatially correlated logit model and the route overlapping in the route choice level using the path size logit model. A descent direction algorithm with the self-regulated averaging (SRA) scheme is also developed for solving the unconstrained optimization formulation of two logit CDA models. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the features of the proposed general unconstrained CDA formulations and the computational performance of the descent SRA algorithm. The results reveal that route overlapping, destination similarity, congestion, and distribution errors can have a significant influence on the network equilibrium flow allocations.

De Palma and Kilani (De Palma, A., Kilani, K., 2011. Transition choice probabilities and welfare analysis in additive random utility models. Economic Theory 46(3), 427-454) have developed a framework for conditional welfare analysis which provides analytic expressions of transition choice probabilities and associated welfare measures. The contribution is of practical relevance in transportation because it allows to compute shares of shifters and non-shifters and attribute benefits to them in a rigorous way. In De Palma and Kilani (2011) the usual assumption of unchanged random terms before and after is made. The paper generalises the framework for conditional welfare analysis to cases of imperfect before-after association of the random terms. The joint before-after distribution of the random terms is introduced with postulated properties in terms of marginal distributions and covariance matrix. Analytic expressions, based on the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function of the joint before-after distribution, and simulation procedures for computation of the transition choice probabilities and the conditional expectations of the compensating variation are provided. Results are specialised for multinomial logit and probit. In the case without income effects, it is proved that the unconditional expectation of the compensating variation depends only on the marginal distributions. The theory is illustrated by a numerical example which refers to a multinomial logit applied to the choice of the transport mode with two specifications, one without and one with income effects. Results show that transition probabilities and conditional welfare measures are affected significantly by the assumption on the before-after correlation. The variability in the transition probabilities across transitions tends to decrease as the before-after correlation decreases. In the extreme case of independent random terms, the conditional expectations of the compensating variation tend to be close to the unconditional expectation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates the morning commute problem with both bottleneck congestion and parking space constraints. In particular, it considers the situation when some commuters have reserved parking spots while others have to compete for public ones on a first-come-first-served basis. Unlike the traditional pure bottleneck model, the rush-hour dynamic traffic pattern with a binding parking capacity constraint varies with the relative proportions of the two classes of commuters. It is found that an appropriate combination of reserved and unreserved parking spots can temporally relieve traffic congestion at the bottleneck and hence reduce the total system cost, because commuters without a reserved parking spot are compelled to leave home earlier in order to secure a public parking spot.

This value function is interpreted as the position of vehicles, and the optimal trajectories of the optimal control formulation can be identified with the characteristics.

The route-choice model embedded in the dynamic assignment explicitly considers common lines and strategies with alternative routes. As such, the shortest hyperpath problem is extended to a dynamic scenario with capacity constraints where the diversion probabilities depend on the time at which the stop is reached and on the expected congestion level at that time. In order to reproduce congestion for all the lines sharing a stop, the Bottleneck Queue Model with time-varying exit capacity, introduced in Meschini et al. (2007), is extended. The above is applied to separate queues for each line in order to satisfy the First-In-First-Out principle within every attractive set, while allowing overtaking among passengers with different attractive sets but queuing single file. The application of the proposed model to a small example network clearly reproduces the formation and dispersion of passenger queues due to capacity constraints and thus motivates the implementation of the methodology on a real-size network case as the next step for future research.

The network model separates trip travel times into link travel times and intersection delays and allows correlation between travel times on different network links based on a spatial moving average (SMA) structure. The observation model presents a way to estimate the parameters of the network model, including the correlation structure, through low frequency sampling of vehicle traces. Link-specific effects are combined with link attributes (speed limit, functional class, etc.) and trip conditions (day of week, season, weather, etc.) as explanatory variables. The approach captures the underlying factors behind spatial and temporal variations in speeds, which is useful for traffic management, planning and forecasting. The model is estimated using maximum likelihood. The model is applied in a case study for the network of Stockholm, Sweden. Link attributes and trip conditions (including recent snowfall) have significant effects on travel times and there is significant positive correlation between segments. The case study highlights the potential of using sparse probe vehicle data for monitoring the performance of the urban transport system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The scheme is designed to optimize for the expected objective value as the LIE solution varies within the solution set. We show that such a risk-neutral scheme can be formulated as a stochastic program, which complements the traditional risk-prone SBTP approach and the risk-averse SBTP approach we developed recently. The proposed model can be solved by a simulation-based optimization algorithm that contains three major steps: characterization of the LIE solution set, random sampling over the solution set, and a two-phase simulation optimization step. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed risk-neutral design scheme is less aggressive than the risk-prone scheme and less conservative than the risk-averse scheme, and may thus be more preferable from a toll designer's point of view.

The embedded network loading procedure follows the cell transmission model without the holding-back issues by using detailed representations of flows at merges and diverges. The problem is modeled using a complementarity approach. The existence of the equilibrium solution is discussed using techniques from generalized variational inequalities. Computational results are performed using state of the art solvers. Since these solvers fail to solve any reasonable size networks, a specialized projection algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in various starting with simple networks and extending to reasonable size networks with different traffic parameters. It is shown that the solution procedure produces good dynamic equilibrium solutions for general transportation networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

While airlines are assumed to maximize profit, HSR may maximize a weighted sum of profit and social welfare. We show that both airfare and HSR fare fall as the weight of welfare in the HSR's objective function increases, while airfare decreases, and rail fare increases, in the airport access time. Furthermore, airfare decreases in rail speed if the impact of HSR marginal cost with respect to rail speed is not too large. On the other hand, whether rail fare increases in rail speed depends not only on the HSR marginal cost but also on the weight of welfare. We further compare prices, profits and welfare between with price discrimination in which airlines price discriminate business from leisure passengers, and without price discrimination.

An initial hub-spoke network is optimal if passenger differentiation between one-stop and nonstop services and via-hub time cost are small. If differentiation is substantial, a mixed one-stop and nonstop (point-to-point) network under AinA is optimal when via-hub time cost is small (large). Low-cost rivals on rim routes weaken AinA adoption and enhance welfare from a monopoly mixed network.

Our results show that the price of anarchy depends not only on the class of cost functions but also demand distributions and, to some extent, the network topology.

The bus-route configurations that result consist of (i) a main, possibly city-wide grid with relatively large physical spacings between its parallel routes and the stops along those routes; together with (ii) one or more local grids with more closely-spaced routes and stops that serve neighborhoods of higher demand densities. The so-called power-of-two concept is borrowed from the field of inventory control, and is enforced so that local grids can be inserted seamlessly within the main one. The resulting heterogeneous route configurations can reduce the costs to the bus users and the operating agency combined, as compared against the costs of homogeneous bus-route grids. Differences of as much as 8% are observed for numerical examples that cover wide-ranging patterns in spatially-varying demand. Much of the savings are due to the diminished access costs that users enjoy when high-demand neighborhoods are served by local grids with closely-spaced routes and stops. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is desirable, therefore, to minimize the number of vehicles used and operational cost. This paper proposes a new methodology for the multiple vehicle types vehicle scheduling problem (MVT-VSP). The methodology is based on a minimum-cost network flow model utilizing sets of Pareto-optimal timetables for individual bus lines. Given a fixed fleet size the suggested methodology also allows a selection of the optimal timetable. The method developed enables to stipulate the use of a particular vehicle type for a trip or to allow for a substitution either by a larger vehicle or a combination of smaller vehicles with the same or higher total capacity. Moreover, a variation of the method portrayed makes it possible to construct sub-optimal timetables given a reduction of the vehicle-scheduling cost. It is demonstrated that a substitution of vehicles is beneficial and can lead to significant cost reductions in the range of more than 27%. The suggested methodology is applied to a real-life case study in Auckland, New Zealand, and the results show improvements of greater than 15% in terms of the cost of fleet compared with vehicle schedules that are provided by standard models.

Regular services operate with a fixed schedule; whereas ad hoc services are those subcontracted or outsourced to a third party and have a higher unit cost. Two ad hoc provision schemes are studied. Scheme A considers that the demand information is known in advance by passenger reservation, and the company makes use of this information to plan for ad hoc services. In Scheme B, the demand realization is only known as passengers arrive at the piers and the company calls upon ad hoc services in case of demand overflow. In Scheme A, we utilize the notion of service reliability (SR) to address the issue of demand uncertainty and formulate the problem as a two-phase stochastic program in which the schedule of regular services and ad hoc services are derived sequentially. The user equilibrium (UE) assignment with capacity constraint is formulated via a linear programming (LP) approach considering overflow delays. A SR-based gradient solution approach is developed to solve the model. Scheme B, as expected, requires more resources to operate, for which a SR-based non-linear model is developed. The value of reservation to the company is defined as the operating cost difference between these two schemes. We apply the methods to ferry service network design in Hong Kong, and then compare the UE (Scheme A) and system optimal (SO) solutions, in terms of service deployment and computation time, to contrast the solution quality arising from the inclusion of equilibrium flows. The value of advance reservation information between Scheme A and Scheme B is presented as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A good risk measure typically needs to have a risk preference control mechanism, a complete uncertainty characterization, and a practical implementation strategy. Total travel time reliability (TTTR) and total travel time budget (TTTB) are two risk measures recently proposed for assessing transportation network performance under uncertainty. In this paper, we propose the mean-excess total travel time (METTT) as an alternative network-wide risk measure to more cost-effectively capture the distribution tail, and develop an analytical method to estimate risk measures without knowing the explicit distribution form of TTT uncertainty. Methodologically, the METTT measure characterizes the distribution tail of exceeding the TTTB via the conditional expectation without requiring an extraordinary reliability level. It is able to account for the tradeoff between planners' risk-aversion attitude and the unacceptable risk, which avoids the need of setting a too conservative reliability requirement in the TTTB to reduce the unacceptable risk. The explicit distribution tail consideration in the METTT could lower the construction cost and substantially reduce the unacceptable risk of network capacity enhancement under uncertainty. To enhance the practicality of MEd 1 1, we develop an analytical estimation method to efficiently calculate the METTT by using the first four TTT moments as well as the planners' risk attitude. The TTTR and TTTB measures can also be analytically estimated as a byproduct of the proposed method for assessing the METTT. The analytical feature of the proposed method avoids the burdensome computation of simulation method and also circumvents the need of fitting the explicit TTT distribution form. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method has a desirable and comparable estimation quality in comparison with the theoretical derivation and curve fitting methods.

The objective is to assign containers to routes to minimise container handling costs, container rental and inventory costs. The constraints in the model are extended to include route as well as port capacities. It is shown that the problem remains a linear program.

Pre-specified time windows must be respected, and service levels for passengers as well as operation costs should be optimized. The resulting routing and scheduling problem is NP-hard and can be modeled by a mixed integer linear programming formulation. In this paper, we propose a Granular Tabu Search algorithm for the static Dial-a-Ride Problem with the objective of producing good solutions in a short amount of time (up to 3 min). We evaluate the algorithm on test instances from the literature.

Whereas cost minimization is an operational objective, the goal of the BTO manufacturer is to maximize its profit by using pricing as its competitive decision-making strategy. In this paper, we study a BTO manufacturer who simultaneously determines its product prices and designs its supply chain network to maximize its expected profit under price-dependent stochastic demand. We propose an L-shaped decomposition with complete enumeration to solve for optimality and show that the expanded master problem remains convex programming, although the optimality cuts are quadratic inequalities. The computational results demonstrate that stocking up on differentiated components and allocating modules appropriately to meet realized demand is a resilient policy that sustains variations in demand. Furthermore, the pricing decision balances the expected revenue and expected operating cost with an increase in expected profit. The integration of pricing and operational planning results in a higher expected profit than by individual decisions. We also demonstrate that cost minimization may not provide the same level of profit if the manufacturer overestimates or underestimates its most profitable demand. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This gives rise to a multicriteria problem. The problem is solved by means of a flexible and simple metaheuristic which efficiently integrates the reference point method for multicriteria optimization within a tabu search mechanism. Extensive tests were performed on randomly generated data and on real-life data provided by a major transporter in the Montreal area. Results indicate that the algorithm can yield a rich set of non-dominated solutions. It can also be employed to determine good trade-offs between cost and quality of service. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Road users in the network are assumed to be distributed according to the principle of user equilibrium, with the demand assumed to be fixed and given a priori. The toll design problem is commonly formulated as a non-linear program, which in general is non-convex and non-smooth, and thus difficult to solve for a global optimum. In this paper, the toll design problem is approximated by a mixed integer linear program (MILP), which can be solved to its globally optimal solution. The MILP also gives a lower bound estimation of the original non-linear problem, and the accuracy of the approximation is improved by iteratively updating the MILP. To demonstrate the approach, we apply the algorithm to two networks: a smaller network with 18 links and 4 OD-pairs to illustrate the properties of the approach, and the Sioux Falls network with 87 links and 30 OD-pairs to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.

In this paper, we investigate the stochastic assignment paradox using the multinomial weibit (MNW) model, a new route choice model developed by Castillo et al. (2008), and compare it to the counter-intuitive results of the multinomial logit (MNL) model when an inferior travel alternative is marginally improved. Using a simple two-link network, we derive the conditions for paradoxical phenomenon to occur for both route choice models, and graphically compare and contrast the paradoxical regions. The results show the stochastic assignment paradox depends on how the cost difference is being considered in the route choice model (i.e., absolute cost difference in the MNL model and relative cost difference in the MNW model) to some extent. Hence, the stochastic paradox analysis is extended to a hybrid model that considers both MNW and MNL models (i.e., both relative cost difference and absolute cost difference). The paradox area of the hybrid model is shown to be a combination of the paradox areas of the two models. In addition, the stochastic assignment paradox conditions derived for a simple two-link network are generalized to three cases: (a) one O-D pair with multiple links on a route, (b) multiple O-D pairs, and (c) adding a new link.

Starting with these hypotheses, and following the paradigm of random utility, a recursive equation is obtained, whose iterated application furnishes the sequence of the demand fractions on the various transport modes in the successive epochs of the time period during which the evolution of the transport system is studied and enables forecasting the future modal split evolution.

To capture the various types of infrastructure interdependencies and incorporate them into decision-making processes in various application domains, Zhang and Peeta (2011) propose a generalized modeling framework that combines a multilayer infrastructure network (MIN) concept and a market-based economic approach using computable general equilibrium (CGE) theory and its spatial extension (SCGE) to formulate a static equilibrium infrastructure interdependencies problem. This paper extends the framework to address the dynamic and disequilibrium aspects of the infrastructure interdependencies problems. It briefly reviews the static model, and proposes an alternative formulation for it using the variational inequality (VI) technique. Based on this equivalent VI formulation, a within-period equilibrium-tending dynamic model is proposed to illustrate how these systems evolve towards an equilibrium state within a short duration after a perturbation. To address a longer time scale, a multi-period dynamic model is proposed. This model explicitly considers the evolution of infrastructure interdependencies over time and the temporal interactions among the various systems through dynamic parameters that link the different time periods. Using this model, numerical experiments are conducted for a special case with a single region to analyze the sensitivity of the model to the various parameters, and demonstrate the ability of the modeling framework to formulate and solve practical problems such as cascading failures, disaster recovery, and budget allocation in a dynamic setting.

This paper first identifies a number of emerging transportation applications for which such a shortest path problem might be considered a core subproblem. We propose to first approximate the general nonlinear cost function with a piecewise linear counterpart, and then solve each linear subproblem sequentially. A specialized algorithm is developed to solve the subproblems, which makes use of the efficient path set (or the convex hull) to update upper and lower bounds of the original problem. Conditions under which the solution to a subproblem must belong to the efficient path set are specified. Accordingly, we show that the optimal path must be efficient if the nonlinear cost function is concave. If the optimal path to a subproblem is not efficient, partial path enumeration, implemented using a simple K-shortest path ranking procedure, is conducted to close the gap. The proposed algorithm includes strategies aiming to expedite path enumeration by using upper bounds derived from the efficient path set. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, recent research shows that the MFD shape can be influenced by local traffic heterogeneities. Notably, route choices and heterogeneous local capacities may drive uneven (in space) or inconsistent (in time) distributions of congestion and then affect the shape and the scatter of the MFD. We are far from having a global understanding of the connections between local phenomena and the resulting MFD. This paper first aims to improve existing MFD estimation method for a succession of links with traffic signals. The new method overcomes previous limitations, notably regarding to the topology and signal settings regularities, by fully utilizing the receipts of the variational theory. Then, a single network with several parallel routes is investigated. MFDs on different routes are estimated with the variational method and then aggregated in a unified MFD for stationary and dynamic conditions and different sorts of equilibria (user and system optimum). It appears that the flow distribution among routes smoothly varies with respect to the total flow either in free-flow or congestion situations. Such a distribution is much more rough for system optimum, where it presents some discontinuities and is far from equity. This means that a control strategy able to lead such a network to the perfect system optimum would be hard to tune, especially in the congested regime. However, being able to determine the MFD corresponding to the system optimum provides a valuable reference to estimate the current efficiency of the considered network. Case studies for different simple networks and insights for generalization at the city level are proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a Kalman filtering structure, the proposed measurement and uncertainty quantification models explicitly take into account several important sources of errors in the travel time estimation/prediction process, such as the uncertainty associated with prior travel time estimates, measurement errors and sampling errors. By considering only critical paths and limited time intervals, this paper selects a path travel time uncertainty criterion to construct a joint sensor location and travel time estimation/prediction framework with a unified modeling of both recurring and non-recurring traffic conditions. An analytical determinant maximization model and heuristic beam-search algorithm are used to find an effective lower bound and solve the combinatorial sensor selection problem. A number of illustrative examples and one case study are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of that, airports' operating costs did not mirror the traffic trends and kept increasing during the same period, showing evident signs of lack of flexibility. With this background, this paper aims at identifying the drivers of airport cost flexibility in a context of economic recession. This is done by estimating a short-run stochastic cost frontier over a balanced pool database of 194 airports worldwide between 2007 and 2009. Using the total change in cost efficiency during the sample period as a proxy for cost flexibility, the impact of variables such as ownership, outsourcing, airline dominance, low-cost traffic, and revenue diversification is tested in a second-stage regression. Contrary to the existing literature, a higher level of outsourcing is shown to reduce cost flexibility. Results also indicate that low-cost traffic, diversification, and corporatization increase the airports' ability to control costs. The negative impact of airline dominance suggests the need for more stringent regulations on slot allocation at congested airports in order to ensure optimal infrastructure usage.

Valuable probability distributions and moment generating functions for probe information types are formulated. Fully analytical closed-form expressions are given for the case ignoring the overflow queue and approximation models are presented for the overflow case. Derived models are compared with the results from VISSIM-microscopic simulation. Analytical steady-state and cycle-to-cycle estimation errors are also derived. Numerical examples are shown for the errors of these estimators that change with probe vehicle market penetration levels, arrival rates, and volume-to-capacity ratios. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-state supernetworks have been advanced to represent in an integral fashion the multi-dimensional nature of activity-travel scheduling processes. To date, however, the treatment of time in the supernetworks has been rather limited. This paper attempts to (i) dramatically improve the temporal dimension in multi-state supernetworks by embedding space-time constraints into location selection models, not only operating between consecutive pairs of locations, but also at the overall schedule at large, and (ii) systematically incorporate time in the disutility profiles of activity participation and parking. These two improvements make the multi-state supernetworks fully time-dependent, allowing modeling choice of mode, route, parking and activity locations in a unified and time-dependent manner and more accurately capturing interdependences of the activity-travel trip chaining. To account for this generalized representation, refined behavioral assumptions and dominance relationships are proposed based on an earlier proposed bicriteria label-correcting algorithm to find the optimal activity-travel pattern. Examples are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of this new approach and its potential applicability to large scale agent-based simulation systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We derive the optimums and identify the public and private sector's economic incentives. We find that the optimal length of concession period and the service quality of the infrastructure depend on the two parties' operational costs and negotiation powers. Under mild conditions, we prove that the government will build a larger capacity Lait charge less than the private sector.

The access that shipping companies nowadays have to the capital markets provides them with a broader range of financing instruments. As such, this study investigates the determinants of capital structure decisions using a sample of 115 exchange-listed shipping companies. We test whether listed shipping companies follow a target capital structure, and we analyze their adjustment dynamics after deviations from this target leverage ratio. When compared with industrial firms from the G7 countries, shipping companies exhibit higher leverage ratios and higher financial risk. Standard capital structure variables exert a significant impact on the cross-sectional variation of leverage ratios in the shipping industry. Asset tangibility is positively related to corporate leverage, and its economic impact is more pronounced than in other industries. Profitability, asset risk, and operating leverage are all inversely related to leverage. There is only weak evidence for market-timing behavior of shipping companies. Because demand and supply in the maritime industry are closely related to the macroeconomic environment, leverage behaves counter-cyclically. Using different dynamic panel estimators, we further document that the speed of adjustment after deviations from the target leverage ratio is lower during economic recessions. On average, however, the capital structure adjustment speed in the maritime industry is higher compared with the G7 benchmark sample. These findings indicate that there are substantial costs of deviation from the target leverage ratio due to high expected costs of financial distress. Our results have implications for shipping companies' risk management activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We formulate the problem as a bi-level programming model, where the upper level aims to minimize the total travel time via adding new lanes to candidate links and the lower level is a traditional Wardrop user equilibrium (UE) problem. We propose two global optimization methods by taking advantage of the relationship between UE and system optimal (SO) traffic assignment principles. The first method, termed as SO-relaxation, exploits the property that an optimal network design solution under SO principle can be a good approximate solution under UE principle, and successively sorts the solutions in the order of increasing total travel time under SO principle. Optimality is guaranteed when the lower bound of the total travel time of the unexplored solutions under UE principle is not less than the total travel time of a known solution under UE principle. The second method, termed as UE-reduction, adds the objective function of the Beckmann-McGuire-Winsten transformation of UE traffic assignment to the constraints of the SO-relaxation formulation of the multi-capacity DNDP. This constraint is convex and strengthens the SO-relaxation formulation. We also develop a dynamic outer-approximation scheme to make use of the state-of-the-art mixed-integer linear programming solvers to solve the SO-relaxation formulation. Numerical experiments based on a two-link network and the Sioux-Falls network are conducted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This model can be described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a right-hand side which is discontinuous in the unknown variable. Such a formulation induces difficulties with both theoretical analysis and numerical computation. Moreover it is widely suspected that an explicit solution to this ODE does not exist. In this paper, we advance the knowledge and understanding of the continuous-time Vickrey model by reformulating it as a partial differential equation (PDE) and by applying a variational method to obtain an explicit solution representation. Such an explicit solution is then shown to be the strong solution to the ODE in full mathematical rigor. Our methodology also leads to the notion of generalized Vickrey model (GVM), which allows the flow to be a distribution, instead of an integrable function. As explained by Han et al. (in press), this feature of traffic modeling is desirable in the context of analytical dynamic traffic assignment (DTA). The proposed PDE formulation provides new insights into the physics of The Vickrey model, which leads to a number of modeling extensions as well as connection with first-order traffic models such as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model. The explicit solution representation also leads to a new computational method, which will be discussed in an accompanying paper, Han et al. (in press). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Results from estimating a variety of airline cost models reveal that both delay and schedule buffer are important cost drivers. We also find that flight activity outside schedule windows increases cost, whereas flight inactivity within schedule windows does not. Using the estimated cost models, we predict the cost savings to airlines of perfect operational performance, obtaining an estimate in the range of $7.1-13.5 billion for 2007. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In dynamic system optimum (DSO) models the link flows and travel times or costs are generally modelled using so-called 'whole link' models. Here we instead develop an SO model that more closely reflects traffic flow theory and derive the marginal costs and externalities from that. The most widely accepted traffic flow model appears to be the LWR (Lighthill, Whitham and Richards) model and a tractable discrete implementation or approximation to that is provided by the cell transmission model (CTM) or a finite difference approximation (FDA). These handle spillbacks, traffic controls and moving queues in a way that is consistent with the LWR model and hence with the kinematic wave model and fluid flow model. An SO formulation using the CTM is already available, assuming a single destination and a trapezoidal flow-density function. We extend the formulation to allow more general nonlinear flow density functions and derive and interpret system marginal costs and externalities. We show that if tolls computed from the DSO solution are imposed on users then the DSO solution would also satisfy the criteria for a dynamic user equilibrium (DUE). We extend the analysis to allow for physical or behavioural constraints on the link outflow proportions at merges and inflow proportions at diverges. We also extend the model to elastic demands and establish connections between the present DSO model and earlier DSO models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

First, this study applies a two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate the production efficiency and marketing efficiency of the airlines. Our findings indicate that, in general, there is not as much dispersion in the relative productive efficiencies of the airlines as there is in their marketing efficiencies. The low-cost airlines, on average, are more efficient carriers than the full-service ones, but less efficient marketers. Secondly, truncated regression is used to explore whether the characteristics of corporate governance affect airline performance. The results demonstrate that corporate governance influences firm performance significantly.

This problem consists of finding a set of container shipping routes defining a capacitated network for cargo transport. The objective is to maximize the revenue of cargo transport, while minimizing the cost of operating the network. Liner shipping companies publish a set of routes with a time schedule, and it is an industry standard to have a weekly departure at each port call on a route. A weekly frequency is achieved by deploying several vessels to a single route, respecting the available fleet of container vessels. The matheuristic is composed of four main algorithmic components: a construction heuristic, an improvement heuristic, a reinsertion heuristic, and a perturbation heuristic. The improvement heuristic uses an integer program to select a set of improving port insertions and removals on each service. Computational results are reported for the benchmark suite LINER-LIB 2012 following the industry standard of weekly departures on every schedule. The heuristic shows overall good performance and is able to find high quality solutions within competitive execution times. The matheuristic can also be applied as a decision support tool to improve an existing network by optimizing on a designated subset of the routes. A case study is presented for this approach with very promising results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

At the upper-level, a sequence of optimal preparedness and response decisions is taken over pre-event mitigation and preparedness and post-event response stages of the disaster management life cycle. Assuming semi-adaptive user behavior exists shortly after the disaster and after the implementation of immediate response actions, the lower-level problem is formulated as a Partial User Equilibrium, where only affected users are likely to rethink their routing decisions. An exact Progressive Hedging Algorithm is presented for solution of a single-level equivalent, linear approximation of the SMPEC. A recently proposed technique from the literature that uses Schur's decomposition with SOS1 variables in creating a linear equivalent to complementarity constraints is employed. Similarly, recent advances in piecewise linearization are exploited in addressing nonseparable link travel time functions. The formulation and solution methodology are demonstrated on an illustrative example. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we propose a novel path-based static traffic assignment model for finding a stochastic user equilibrium in general transportation networks. This model includes a first order (steady-state) node model that yields more realistic turn capacities, which are then used to determine consistent capacity constrained traffic flows, residual point (vertical) queues (upstream bottleneck links), and path travel times consistent with queuing theory. The route choice part of the model is specified as a variational inequality problem, while the network loading part is formulated as a fixed point problem. Both problems are solved using existing techniques to find a solution. We illustrate the model using hypothetical examples, and also demonstrate feasibility on large-scale networks.

This paper presents a new methodology for analyzing the daily traffic flow profiles based on the employment of FDA. A daily traffic profile corresponds to a single datum rather than a large set of traffic counts. This insight provides ideal information for strategic decision-making regarding road expansion, control, and other long-term decisions. Using Functional Principal Component Analysis the data are projected into a low dimensional space: the space of the first functional principal components. Each curve is represented by their vector of scores on this basis. The principal component scores are used for clustering and also to identify outliers (meaning that there was a bad performance in the recording of data or special circumstances affected the traffic) and to monitor the traffic profile by multivariate control charts. This paper introduces this new methodology and illustrates good results by using 1-min traffic data from the I-94 Freeway in the Twin Cities, Minnesota (U.S.) metroplex ranging from 2004 to 2011.

Design interactions between multiple networks have largely been analyzed either as non-cooperative games with non-unique Nash equilibria, even if assumptions needed for such games are not satisfied, or using knowledge-based or agent-based methods that cannot explicitly quantify network sensitivities. A new framework is proposed to model network design in the presence of coexisting networks using multiobjective optimization in a novel manner to identify symbiotic relationships. The framework does not require strict assumptions about availability of information or timing of decisions, and it can be used to examine network sensitivities that knowledge-based methods cannot. A bundled discount pricing problem and subsidy problem are derived from the symbiotic relationships. The framework is applied to formulate a symbiotic bike-sharing network design problem in the presence of a coexisting transit system as a departure-time-elastic multicommodity flow problem. A small network example demonstrates the potential dependency between transit systems and bike-sharing systems for the first time, and the existence of an optimal discount value for considering bundled fares. A larger bike-sharing network, BIXI, is examined in the presence of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in downtown Toronto to address the question of subsidy. It is found that BIXI is operating in a relatively transit-friendly state, and subsidy by TTC to maintain a status quo in Toronto may be worth considering if the cost of subsidy is less than a conservative average reduction achieved of 2.43 units of transit-only user cost for every 1 unit increase of bike-sharing cost.

Buses that dwell at one of these so-called near-side stops can impede queued cars upstream from discharging through the intersection during green times. Residual car queues can form at the intersection as a result. The smaller the distance between a stop and its intersection, the greater the problem can be. Models are formulated to address this problem using kinematic wave theory. The models can be used to determine where to place a near-side stop to achieve a target level of residual car queueing. In addition, the models are used herein to develop a scheme for mitigating residual car queues by briefly detaining some buses from reaching the stop. The scheme can be applied selectively, so that the times that detained buses depart from the stop are not postponed. The buses are therefore not delayed over the longer run. Analysis indicates that this bus-holding scheme can significantly reduce car delays and queueing. Our models for placing stops and holding buses are shown to be robust to systematic and random changes in car flow. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A disutility function of travel time is defined to evaluate the paths, and those with the minimum expected disutility are defined as the optimal paths. Bellman's Principle (Bellman, 1958) is shown to be invalid if the optimality or non-dominance of a path and its sub-paths is defined with respect to the complete set of departure times and joint realizations of link travel time. An exact label-correcting algorithm is designed to find optimal paths based on a new property for which Bellman's Principle holds. The algorithm has exponential worst-case computational complexity. Computational tests are conducted on three types of networks. Although the average running time is exponential, the number of the optimal path candidates is polynomial on two networks and grows exponentially in the third one. Computational results in large networks and analytical results in a small network show that stochastic dependencies affect optimal path finding in a stochastic network, and that the impact is closely related to the levels of correlation and risk attitude.

In light of the potential of semi-compensatory discrete choice models to mathematically represent such decisions, research is inching ahead with the aim of alleviating their high computational complexity and their severe restrictive assumptions. To date, still a major barrier for the implementation of semi-compensatory models is their underlying assumption of independently and identically distributed error terms across alternatives at the choice stage. This study relaxes the assumption by introducing nested substitution patterns and alternatively random taste heterogeneity at the choice stage, thus equating the structural flexibility of semi-compensatory models to their compensatory counterparts. The proposed model is applied to off-campus rental apartment choice by students. Results show the feasibility and importance of introducing a flexible error structure into semi-compensatory models.

To study this strategy, we develop a two-stage duopoly model that comprises the pricing and capacity decisions of two heterogeneous players serving an increasing market. We identify the necessary condition for a port to increase its profit through capacity expansion, and characterize the condition when preemptive pricing by the dominant player is neither credible nor effective in preventing the smaller player from gaining market share. We also find the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in the capacity expansion game for two ports that have different price sensitivities, as well as different operation and capacity investment costs. We apply the model results to the container port competition between Hong Kong and Shenzhen after Shenzhen port started its container operation in 1991. Our analysis explains the transition of market power from monopoly to duopoly, the fast development of Shenzhen Port, and the possible market structure changes with the continuing increase in demand.

Battery-exchange stations allow the vehicles to swap batteries during their trip, but if a vehicle arrives at a station without a full battery available it may have to wait an extended period of time to get one. The vehicles can be routed so that they avoid stations without available batteries or to keep batteries available for other vehicles that need them in the future. The batteries can also be reserved during the routing process so that each vehicle is ensured the battery it plans to use is available. This paper provides a method of online routing of electric vehicles and making battery reservations that minimizes the average delay of the all vehicles by occasionally detouring them to the benefit of future ones. The system is modeled as a Markov chance-decision process and the optimal policy is approximated using the approximate dynamic programming technique of temporal differencing with linear models. The solution algorithm provides a quick way for vehicles to be routed using onboard vehicle software connected to a central computer. Computational results for the algorithm are provided using data on the Arizona highway network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this symmetry the model parameters and the boundary data need to be expressed in a form appropriate for each plane. It turns out, however, that when boundary data that are bounded in one plane are transformed for the other, singular points with infinite density sometimes arise. Duality theory indicates that solutions to these problems must exist and be unique. Therefore, these solutions should be characterized. The paper shows that the only added feature of these solutions is a new type of shock that can contain mass and we call a supershock. Nothing else is different. The evolution laws of these shocks are described. Solution methods based on these laws for problems with singularities are also presented. The methods apply to problems with monotone speed-density relations and not necessarily concave fundamental diagrams. In accordance with duality theory they can be used with both, the Euler and Lagrange versions of a problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The system takes the form of a treatment-outcome selection system with multiple treatments and multiple outcome variables. The Maximum Approximate Composite Marginal Likelihood (MACML) approach is proposed in estimation, and a simulation experiment is undertaken to evaluate the ability of the MACML method to recover the model parameters in such integrated systems. These experiments show that our estimation approach recovers the underlying parameters very well and is efficient from an econometric perspective. The parametric model system proposed in the paper is applied to an analysis of household-level decisions on residential location, motorized vehicle ownership, the number of daily motorized tours, the number of daily non-motorized tours, and the average distance for the motorized tours. The empirical analysis uses the NHTS 2009 data from the San Francisco Bay area. Model estimation results show that the choice dimensions considered in this paper are inter-related, both through direct observed structural relationships and through correlations across unobserved factors (error terms) affecting multiple choice dimensions. The significant presence of self-selection effects (endogeneity) suggests that modeling the various choice processes in an independent sequence of models is not reflective of the true relationships that exist across these choice dimensions, as also reinforced through the computation of treatment effects in the paper.

In the United States, it is widely believed that the major culprits for delay throughout the NAS are the three New York commercial airports Newark (EWR), LaGuardia (LGA), and John F. Kennedy (JFK). Various estimates of the extent to which the New York airports impact the delay in the NAS have been reported over the years. Yet there is no thorough investigation into the mutual relationship between delays at New York and non-New York airports. In this paper, we take two different approaches to quantify the impact of the three New York airports on delay throughout the NAS. First, we estimate and apply an econometric model using a large historical data-set. The other model is the FAA SWAC model that simulates flights and tracks the daily performance of the system. The counterfactual scenarios in these two models are adjusted to be comparable to each other. There is disparity between the results of the two different models, suggesting the simulation model might not capture all the factors that cause arrival delay. Still both results conclude that the portion of delay in the system caused by New York airports is much less than publicized estimates. Combining econometric and simulation models to address questions of this nature appears to be a promising approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed coordinated routing mechanism incorporates a discrete choice model to account for drivers' behavior, and is implemented by a simultaneously-updating distributed algorithm. This study shows the existence of an equilibrium coordinated routing decision for the mixed-strategy routing game and the convergence of the distributed algorithm to the equilibrium routing decision, assuming individual smart vehicles are selfish players seeking to minimize their own travel time. Numerical experiments conducted based on Sioux Falls city network indicate that the proposed distributed algorithm converges quickly under different smart vehicle penetrations, thus it possesses a great potential for online applications. Moreover, the proposed coordinated routing mechanism outperforms traditional independent selfish-routing mechanism; it reduces travel time for both overall system and individual vehicles, which represents the core idea of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

Such a strategy increases group airlines' prices at the expenses of rival airlines.

The choice model and demand functions are incorporated into a revenue optimization problem which jointly considers pricing and seat allocation. The framework provides insightful policy implications in term of fare and capacity distribution derived from actual passenger behavior. It shows that accepting short-haul demand provides greater revenue than long-haul demand using the same capacity. Revenue improvement ranges from 16.24% to 24.96% in multinomial logit models and from 13.82% to 21.39% in latent class models respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The credit system consists of a time-varying credit charged at the bottleneck and an initial credit distribution to the commuters, where the credits are universal in terms of time. Credits are tradable between the commuters and the credit price is determined by a competitive market. Under the assumption that late-arrival is not allowed, we prove that an optimal credit charging scheme, which completely eliminates the bottleneck queue, always exists despite how commuters vary in their value-of-time (VOT). The optimal charge rate is strictly increasing and convex with time, which therefore drives the commuters to depart in the increasing order of their VOT. The optimal credit charging scheme is pareto-improving, but may cause undesirable welfare distribution among the commuters. Our study shows that a combination of an initial credit distribution and an optimal credit charging scheme can simultaneously achieve system optimum and certain forms of equality (e.g., numerical or proportional equality), and that the commuters in the middle VOT bracket will receive the most credits under the proportionally equitable credit distribution.

In the literature, link-based multi-commodity flow formulations are widely used for container routing. However, they have two deficiencies: the level of service in terms of the origin-to-destination transit time is not incorporated and maritime cabotage may be violated. To overcome these deficiencies, we first present an operational network representation of a liner shipping network. Based on the network, an integer linear programming model is formulated to obtain container paths with minimum cost. Finally, we add constraints to the integer linear programming model, excluding those paths already obtained, so as to find all the container paths. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To facilitate rail's responsiveness, collaboration among competing rail carriers positioned to handle the newly arising demand is considered. Through such collaboration, carriers can, by agreement, provide transport on existing trains for one-off loads belonging to their competitors. Additionally, carriers can pool shipments with synergistic origins, destinations and desired delivery dates to form new train lines operated by one of the carriers in the collaboration. This problem of serving spot markets through collaboration among competing rail carriers operating within an alliance in co-transporting one-off loads arriving on the spot market is mathematically formulated and an efficient solution methodology employing concepts of collaborative decision-making incorporated within a combinatorial auction (CA)-based framework is proposed for its solution. The proposed technique aids in forming profitable trains that might otherwise have been underutilized and permits rail carriers to capture a greater share of the freight market.

Using passenger booking and airfare data on transpacific routes, we find consistent evidence for the positive association between multimarket contact and airfares. Our results also suggest that multimarket contact between non-aligned airlines is associated with higher airfares, whereas multimarket contact between airlines in the same alliance has no additional upward impact on airfares. Moreover, it is shown that higher airfares tend to exist when airlines have greater multimarket contact on open-skies routes. In restrictive (non-liberal) international markets, however, multimarket contact may not affect airfare. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The computational results show that GVTNS is able to obtain good average solutions in short CPU times, and to improve five best known solutions from the literature.

Airline hubbing is measured with the Hubbing Concentration Index. We estimate the impact of hubbing behavior on delays, using three measures of delay, two based on delay against schedule, and the third based on buffer-corrected excess travel times. A significant (and positive) influence of hubbing concentration can only be found for the latter delay indicator. We conclude that airlines use buffer times to mitigate passenger-perceived delays against schedule that would, without buffers, arise from more complex network operations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Those traffic flow patterns satisfying the above condition constitute a set, named the BRUE solution set. It is important to obtain all the BRUE flow patterns, because it can help predict the variation of the link flow pattern in a traffic network under the boundedly rational behavior assumption. However, the methodology of constructing the BRUE set has been lacking in the established literature. This paper fills the gap by constructing the BRUE solution set on traffic networks with fixed demands. After defining epsilon-BRUE, where a is the indifference band for the perceived travel cost, we formulate the epsilon-BRUE problem as a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP), so that a BRUE solution can be obtained by solving a BRUE-NCP formulation. To obtain the BRUE solution set encompassing all BRUE flow patterns, we propose a methodology of generating acceptable path set which may be utilized under the boundedly rational behavior assumption. We show that with the increase of the indifference band, the acceptable path set that contains boundedly rational equilibrium flows will be augmented, and the critical values of indifference band to augment these path sets can be identified by solving a family of mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) sequentially. The BRUE solution set can then be obtained by assigning all traffic demands to the acceptable path set. Various numerical examples are given to illustrate our findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using simple examples, we show that falsely assuming that household itineraries are not elastic can result in a lack in understanding of certain phenomena; e.g., increasing traffic even without increasing economic activity due to relaxing of space-time prism constraints, or worsening of utility despite infrastructure investments in cases where household objectives may conflict. An activity-based network design problem is proposed using the location routing problem (LRP) as inspiration. The bilevel formulation includes an upper level network design and shortest path problem while the lower level includes a set of household itinerary optimization problems, posed as household activity pattern problem (HAPP) (or in the case with location choice, as generalized HAPP) models. As a bilevel problem with an NP-hard lower level problem, there is no algorithm for solving the model exactly. Simple numerical examples show optimality gaps of as much as 5% for a decomposition heuristic algorithm derived from the LRP. A large numerical case study based on Southern California data and setting suggest that even if infrastructure investments do not result in major changes in link investment decisions compared to a conventional model, the results provide much higher resolution temporal OD information to a decision maker. Whereas a conventional model would output the best set of links to invest given an assumed OD matrix, the proposed model can output the same best set of links, the same daily OD matrix, and a detailed temporal distribution of activity participation and travel from which changes in peak period OD patterns can be observed.

In this study, from a disequilibrium flow evolution perspective, we design toll sequence operations (TS-operations) to guide the network flow to evolve towards the traditional Wardrop user equilibrium (UE) flow pattern. Under homogeneous bounded rationality (BR), iteratively implementing our TS-operations can make the network flow pattern converge to UE, which essentially solves the nonuniqueness problem of BRUE and re-establishes the effectiveness of link tolls in realizing any target link flow pattern. In particular we show that under homogenous BR the best-case untolled link-based BRUE can be realized as the untolled equilibrium. Under heterogeneous BR among different OD pairs, our TS-operations can make the flow converge to reduced BRUE and/or sub-network UE, which give smaller estimate intervals of the equilibrium flow pattern as compared to the original BRUE.

The paper offers an empirical study about the sources of pressure that make ATCs in Taiwan want to leave their jobs. Besides, another contribution of this study is to explore the relationships between turnover tendencies and two important factors, job stress and job satisfaction, among Taiwanese ATCs. We apply a path technique to analyze the proposed relationship model. The empirical results show that job satisfaction has a mediating effect on the relationships between the sources of job stress and turnover tendency. Additionally, the workload of job stressors had the most effect on turnover tendency, followed by family factors and job satisfaction. Work environment and role conflict were found to have indirect rather than direct effects on turnover tendency as mediated by job satisfaction. The results can provide valuable insights into the management of ATCs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Three networks are used to evaluate the impact of different centroid connector configurations on the resulting traffic flow pattern: a synthetic grid network, the California SR-41 corridor network and a large Sacramento area network. From the STA results of these three networks, we observe large fluctuations on resultant link volumes, maximum volume capacity (V/C) ratios, average V/C ratios and total travel time with respect to randomized connector selections. The fluctuations seem to indicate that STA results are unstable with respect to arbitrary connector selections, and this cannot be improved by simply changing the number of connectors. In fact, more connectors often result in serious under-estimation of total travel time and average link load. We infer that, if provided little information of access/egress nodes of trips, randomly generated connectors lead to artificial over- or under-utilization on network links. We therefore propose a connector optimization algorithm in which the connectors and their travel times are chosen in such a way that the maximum V/C ratio of some characteristic links is minimized. As the numerical example on the SR-41 network indicates, this connector optimization algorithm reduces the artificial over- and under-utilization of network links, and obtains a flow pattern more consistent with the one derived from a refined network where trip access/egress nodes are known in details.

At a disaggregate level, choice behaviour is defined in terms of commodities differentiated by qualities or attributes. In contrast, aggregate demand behaviour is defined in terms of broadly defined and generically different commodities. In a DC model, the main focus of analysis is not the total quantity of demand, but rather the relative shares or substitution between the choice alternatives, in contrast to a continuous demand model where the focus is on the aggregate substitution between groups of commodities as well as on the income effects. Seen in this way, there is scope for complementary usage of DC and CD models within the framework of a CGE model where DC models are used to describe the preferences for a narrowly defined set of commodities belonging to a particular sector of an economy, and CD models are used to describe the interactions between these sectors. In this paper, we describe how DC and CD models can be used in such an integrated fashion in a spatial computable general equilibrium model to inquire into the wider economic impacts of a transport investment project in the Sydney Metropolitan Area.

With the increased usage of automatic vehicle location (AVL) and automatic passenger counting (APC) systems, it is possible to construct the statistical distributions of passenger demand and travel time by time of day. This can give rise to improve the accuracy of the frequencies determined. This study presents a new approach of frequency setting by enabling the use of stochastic properties of the collected data and its associated costs within a supply chain optimization model. An optimization framework is constructed based on two main cost elements: (a) empty-seat driven (unproductive cost) and (b) overload and un-served demand (increased user cost). The objective function is to minimize the total cost incurred with decision variables of either frequency or vehicle capacity (vehicle size). That is, from the operator perspective it is desirable to utilize efficiently the fleet of vehicles which is related to the decisions of the vehicle size.

In a recent paper, Hu, Peeta and Chu introduced the interesting problem of determining the smallest subset of links in a traffic network for counting sensor installation, in such a way that it becomes possible to infer the flows on all remaining links. The problem is particularly elegant because of its limited number of assumptions. Unfortunately, path enumeration was required, which - as recognized by the authors - is infeasible for large-scale networks without further simplifying assumptions (that would destroy the assumption-free nature of the problem). In this paper, we present a reformulation of this link observability problem, requiring only node enumeration. Using this node-based approach, we prove a conjecture made by Hu, Peeta and Chu by deriving an explicit relationship between the number of nodes and links in a transportation network, and the minimum number of sensors to install in order to be able to infer all link flows. In addition, we demonstrate how the proposed method can be employed for road networks that already have sensors installed on them. Numerical examples are presented throughout. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the moderating effects of market concentration and firm dominance on the service-satisfaction-performance relationship are examined. Our major finding is that market concentration dampens the relationship between customer satisfaction and airline profitability. Although the same moderating relationship was not found for market power, these results, combined, indicate that airlines can increase profits in concentrated markets without providing for the same, concomitant increases in customer satisfaction as airlines operating in more competitive markets. From a public policy perspective, our results point to the importance of regulators monitoring airline actions, such as mergers and alliances, that serve to increase the concentration of markets, but may result in lower levels of customer satisfaction.

In real-life this operational planning problem is often complicated by several factors. Users may have special requirements (e.g. to be transported in a wheelchair) while service providers operate a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles from multiple depots in their service area. In this paper, a general dial-a-ride problem in which these three real-life aspects may simultaneously be taken into account is introduced: the Multi-Depot Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (MD-H-DARP). Both a three- and two-index formulation are discussed. A branch-and-cut algorithm for the standard dial-a-ride problem is adapted to exactly solve small problem instances of the MD-H-DARP. To be able to solve larger problem instances, a new deterministic annealing meta-heuristic is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments are presented on different sets of benchmark instances for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous single depot dial-a-ride problem. Instances for the MD-H-DARP are introduced as well. The branch-and-cut algorithm provides considerably better results than an existing algorithm which uses a less compact formulation. All seven previously unsolved benchmark instances for the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem could be solved to optimality within a matter of seconds. While computation times of the exact algorithm increase drastically with problem size, the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm provides near-optimal solutions within limited computation time for all instances. Several best known solutions for unsolved instances are improved and the algorithm clearly outperforms current state-of-the-art heuristics for the homogeneous and heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem, both in terms of solution quality and computation time.

Parking pricing and information provision jointly serve as a dynamic stabilized controller to minimize the total travel time (TIT) of the system. Parking prices are adjusted in real time according to the real-time occupancy collected by parking sensors. All the parking information along with parking prices, is then provided for travelers to make real-time parking choices. We model the optimal parking pricing in the preferred (closer) parking cluster as a stochastic control problem. We take into account two types of randomness, demand uncertainties and user heterogeneity in Value of Time (VOT), both of which can be learned by taking real-time measurements. The optimal parking pricing policies are solved using the dynamic programming approach. There exists a critical occupancy for each time period, and the parking prices should be set effective (by diverting travelers to the farther parking lot) when the up-to-date occupancy is above the critical occupancy. From the numerical experiments, we find that the optimal parking policies based on stochastic control models are promising. They can deal with different demand levels (high, low or unstable) and generally outperform the deterministic pricing schemes. It can approach the minimum TIT in most of the cases as if we know the traffic demand in advance of the commuting time. Providing real-time occupancy information alone without setting proper parking prices, seems useful, but marginal, in reducing the parking congestion.

For the cell transmission model (CTM) it has recently been shown that the usual recommended method for preserving FIFO will ensure FIFO for each cell taken separately but does not fully ensure FIFO in the transition between cells and hence does not fully ensure FIFO for sequences of cells or for links or for routes. As a result, deviations from FIFO can easily occur and cumulate along the links or routes. In view of that, we define and analyse three different levels of satisfaction or approximation of FIFO, together with corresponding methods for achieving them. Two of these are existing methods and one is new. We develop, analyse and compare the three methods and the extent to which each of them adheres to FIFO for sequences of cells and links or routes. Also, for two of the methods we present a more detailed algorithm for applying them within the am. The paper is concerned with how to implement FIFO in the CTM and not with testing for FIFO or measuring deviations from FIFO. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While planning facility locations and land use developments, it is important to take into account the routing of freight vehicles, the impact on public traffic, as well as the planning of pavement rehabilitation. This paper presents an integrated facility location model that simultaneously considers traffic routing under congestion and pavement rehabilitation under deterioration. The objective is to minimize the total cost due to facility investment, transportation cost including traffic delay, and pavement life-cycle costs. Building upon analytical results on optimal pavement rehabilitation, the problem is formulated into a bi-level mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP), with facility location, freight shipment routing and pavement rehabilitation decisions in the upper level and traffic equilibrium in the lower level. This problem is then reformulated into an equivalent single-level MINLP based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and approximation by piece-wise linear functions. Numerical experiments on hypothetical and empirical network examples are conducted to show performance of the proposed algorithm and to draw managerial insights. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A multimodal social welfare maximisation model with spatially disaggregated demand is developed, in which users choose between travelling by bus, car or walking in a transport corridor. Optimisation variables are bus fare, congestion toll, bus frequency, bus size, fare collection system, bus boarding policy and the number of seats inside buses. We find that optimal bus frequency results from a trade-off between the level of congestion inside buses, i.e., passengers' crowding, and the level of congestion outside buses, i.e., the effect of frequency on slowing down both buses and cars in mixed-traffic roads. A numerical application shows that optimal frequency is quite sensitive to the assumptions on crowding costs, impact of buses on traffic congestion, and overall congestion level. If crowding matters to users, buses should have as many seats as possible, up to a minimum area that must be left free of seats. If for any other reason planners decide to have buses with fewer seats than optimal (e.g., to increase bus capacity), frequency should be increased to compensate for the discomfort imposed on public transport users. Finally, the consideration of crowding externalities (on both seating and standing) imposes a sizeable increase in the optimal bus fare, and consequently, a reduction of the optimal bus subsidy.

This paper introduces the flight routes addition/deletion problem and compares three different methods to analyze and optimize the algebraic connectivity of the air transportation network. The Modified Greedy Perturbation algorithm (MGP) provides a local optimum in an efficient iterative manner. The Weighted Tabu Search (WTS) is developed for the flight routes addition/deletion problem to offer a better optimal solution with longer computation time. The relaxed semidefinite programming (SDP) is used to set a performance upper bound and then three rounding techniques are applied to obtain feasible solutions. The simulation results show the trade-off among the Modified Greedy Perturbation, Weighted Tabu Search and relaxed SDP, with which we can decide the appropriate algorithm to adopt for maximizing the algebraic connectivity of the air transportation networks of different sizes.

The market is currently regulated by an Open Skies agreement, which eliminated all restrictions on the frequency of flights, the aircraft flown, and the fares charged on transborder routes. Although there is evidence that consumers have benefited from the Open Skies agreement, there is also evidence that many passengers have chosen to avoid transborder services, and instead fly from airports in US border cities and cross the border by surface transportation. This paper uses a passenger demand model to determine the scope of this leakage from transborder routes. In addition, transborder airfares are compared to US domestic airfares to determine whether transborder fares are excessive, a potential cause of the leakage. Results show a substantial amount of leakage estimated at over 4.7 million passengers for 2008. Furthermore, after controlling for the impact of route-specific variables, such as market concentration, average fares are 28.2% higher in the transborder market. Finally, policy implications and the future of the transborder air passenger market are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

X.; Whiteing, Anthony",,,A fault tolerance approach for railway scheduling and train control,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fault tolerance approach; Minimum time gap matrix model; Railway operation and scheduling; Right turn junction; Terminus station,,"This paper makes two contributions. It firstly proposes the use of a fault tolerance approach for railway operations and secondly it develops a minimum time gap matrix model for capacity computation and the study of perturbation effects through the generation of a compressed timetable. A fault tolerance approach is proposed to improve the operational efficiency of the railway network in terms of the network capacity and the robustness of train timetables. The term fault tolerance is used in a broad sense, to represent any abnormalities or unexpected events in operations or equipment. Enhanced fault tolerance capability provides safety assurance so that, in normal operating conditions, trains can adopt much faster speed profiles when approaching a 'to-be-cleared' signal block at stations and junctions than those currently permitted, effectively turning the status of 'be ready to stop' to that of 'proceed with caution'. In the rare event of a 'fault' in the system, e.g. if a conflicting train fails to move out of a signalling block as expected or a switch fails to operate as required, the train would be re-routed to take an alternative path. In this study, the new approach is developed on three scenarios i.e., a standard classic right turn junction, a terminus station, and a small network combining both of these elements to demonstrate the performance gains, but the concept can be readily extended for other types of junctions/stations. Results so far show great potential in the proposed fault tolerance approach to increase the capacity and enhance operational robustness to perturbations at such locations.

Extending the Household Activity Pattern Problem (HAPP), the Location Selection Problem (LSP-HAPP) demonstrates how location choice is made as a simultaneous decision from interactions both with activities having predetermined locations and those with many candidate locations. A dynamic programming algorithm, developed for PDPTW, is adapted to handle a potentially sizable number of candidate locations. It is shown to be efficient for HAPP and LSP-HAPP applications. The algorithm is extended to keep arrival times as functions for mathematical programming formulations of activity-based travel models that often have time variables in the objective.

The paper first develops fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions estimation models that link emission rates to a vehicle's physical and operational properties. Unlike most studies in the literature, the emission model developed in this paper retains as many microscopic characteristics as feasible in the context of route planning. Specifically, it is able to approximate the impacts of major acceleration events associated with link changes and intersection idling, and yet does not require detailed acceleration data as inputs. The proposed eco-routing model also explicitly captures delays at intersections and the emissions associated with them. Using a simple probabilistic model, the impacts of different turning movements on eco-routing are incorporated. The proposed model is formulated as a constrained shortest path problem and solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Numerical experiments confirm that vehicle characteristics, especially weight and engine displacement, may influence eco-routing. The results also suggest that ignoring the effects of turning movements and acceleration may lead to sub-optimal routes for eco-drivers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the waiting time, truck idling emissions are estimated. The proposed methodology is evaluated with a case study, where truck arrival rates vary over time.

This paper investigates the full and partial flexibility of the BOT contract according to the instruments adopted by the government and the private investor. Full flexibility refers to the case in which the government promises an exogenous rate of return on the private investment and in turn can freely ex post adjust the contract in a socially optimal manner according to the observed demand curve. Partial flexibility refers to the case in which the government and the private investor agree on an ex ante demand risk allocation by contract and the ex post contract adjustment can be made contingent on a Pareto-improvement to both parties. A preferred Pareto-improvement can be selected from the Pareto-optimal solution set of a bi-objective programming problem equipped with a rational preference. The optimal BOT contracts with the two types of flexibility are examined by assuming that the government chooses the original contract variables to maximize the expected total social welfare under demand uncertainty while taking account of the ex post optimal contract adjustments.

It is known in control theory that optimality does not imply stability. If the optimal control is applied in a heavily congested system with high demand, traffic conditions might not change or the network might still lead to gridlock. A city partitioned in two regions with a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) for each of the regions is considered. Under the assumption of triangular MFDs, the two-region MFDs system is modeled as a piecewise second-order system. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for stable equilibrium accumulations in the undersaturated regimes for both MFDs. Moreover, the traffic perimeter control problem for the two-region MFDs system is formulated. Phase portraits and stability analysis are conducted, and a new algorithm is proposed to derive the boundaries of the stable and unstable regions. Based on these regions, a state-feedback control strategy is derived. Trapezoidal shape of MFDs are also addressed with numerical solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By analyzing individual drivers' car-following behavior throughout oscillation cycles it is found that this behavior is consistent across drivers and can be captured by a simple model. The statistical analysis of the model's parameters reveals that there is a strong correlation between driver behavior before and during the oscillation, and that this correlation should not be ignored if one is interested in microscopic output. If macroscopic outputs are of interest, simulation results indicate that an existing model with fewer parameters can be used instead. This is shown for traffic oscillations caused by rubbernecking as observed in the US 101 NGSIM dataset. The same experiment is used to establish the relationship between rubbernecking behavior and the period of oscillations.

We study the bus network of Monterrey, Mexico, which is similar to those of other cities in Latin America. It is a large bus network where passenger transfers must be favored, almost evenly spaced departures are sought, and bus bunching of different lines must be avoided. We formulate the timetabling problem of this network with the objective of maximizing the number of synchronizations to facilitate passenger transfers and avoid bus bunching along the network. We define these synchronizations as the arrivals of two trips with a separation time within a time window to make a flexible formulation. This flexibility is a critical aspect for the bus network, since travel times vary because of reasons such as driver speed, traffic congestion, and accidents. By proving that our problem is NP-hard we answer a 10-year-old open question about the NP-hardness of similar problems present in literature. Next, we analyze the structural properties of the feasible solution space of our model. This analysis leads to a preprocessing stage that eliminates numerous decision variables and constraints. Moreover, this preprocessing defines feasible synchronization and arrival time windows that are used in a new metaheuristic algorithm. Empirical experimentation shows that our proposed algorithm obtains high-quality solutions for real-size instances in less than one minute. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in many cases, the values of interest to analysts are in fact functions of these parameters rather than the parameters themselves. It is thus also crucial to have a measure of variance for these derived quantities and it is preferable that this can be guaranteed to have the maximum likelihood properties, such as minimum variance. While the calculation of standard errors using the Delta method has been described for a number of such measures in the literature, including the ratio of two parameters, these results are often seen to be approximate calculations and do not claim maximum likelihood properties. In this paper, we show that many measures commonly used in transport studies and elsewhere are themselves maximum likelihood estimates and that the standard errors are thus exact, a point we illustrate for a substantial number of commonly used functions. We also discuss less appropriate methods, notably highlighting the issues with using simulation for obtaining the variance of a function of estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The increase is among all socioeconomic groups and in urban and rural populations, though the quantum of change varies. A concomitant increase in per capita consumption of sugar from 22 to 55.3 g/day and total fat from 21.2 to 54 g/day was observed, with significant differences between states of high and low human development index (HDI). Per capita consumption of sugar, salt, and fat is consistently and significantly associated with overweight and obesity but variably associated with the occurrence of hypertension and diabetes. Market research shows that approximately 50-60% of total salt, sugar, and fat in Indian markets is procured by bulk purchasers, generally for manufacturing processed food items. This sector of the Indian economy is among the fastest growing, with several policy incentives. It is not clear from most of the data sets whether available information on per capita sugar, salt, and fat consumption has considered the contribution of processed and ready-to-eat food items. The unprecedented changes of rapid urbanization, mechanization, and globalization demand close monitoring of social, developmental, and economic determinants.

Given the magnitude of the challenge and the limitations of existing approaches, enterprise-led approaches to providing public goods are generating growing interest. Emphasizing convergent innovation, enterprises targeting the BoP are presented as potentially sustainable and scalable interventions that generate positive poverty-alleviation effects. Yet our understanding of who is affected, and how, remains limited. To begin to address this gap, we apply a multidimensional framework to an urban-based, sanitation-oriented BoP enterprise, focusing on its poverty-alleviation effects on young children. Our analysis indicates that the enterprise's effects include changes in capability, economic, and relationship well-being and that these changes can be positive or negative. We also find that the impact varies depending on the role of the stakeholder in the business model and the age of the child. Our results contribute to a better understanding of how to assess the effectiveness of a sanitation intervention and how to evaluate the poverty-alleviation implications of an enterprise-led approach.","[London, Ted; Esper, Heather] Univ Michigan, William Davidson Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [London, Ted] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"London, T (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, William Davidson Inst, 724 E Univ Ave,Wyly Hall, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tlondon@umich.edu,"London, Ted/L-2741-2015","London, Ted/0000-0002-0625-5528",,,,,60,11,14,0,33,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2014,1331.0,,,,,,90,105,,10.1111/nyas.12345,0.0,,,16,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Regional & Urban Planning",Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Agriculture; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Public Administration",BC0WI,24697785.0,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349697400007,0

The typology recognizes the importance of regional effect modifiers that are not themselves subject to randomized assignment, and trade-offs in how policies and programs are implemented, evaluated, and scaled.

For a large part, owing to the well-entrenched Western-centric linear and siloed industrialization pattern, this positive transformation has also been associated with complex societal challenges at the nexus of agricultural, industrial, and health sectors. Efforts at cross-sectoral policy coherence have been deployed with limited success. To go beyond what has been possible thus far, the whole-of-society (WoS) paradigm for human and economic development proposes a 21st century convergence where, instead of the rest (of the world) converging with the West, sectoral and cross-sectoral efforts converge in their single and collective policy and action on a common target of human and economic development. In this paper, we first review and discuss contributions and limitations of policy coherence approaches. We then elaborate the institutional foundation of the WoS paradigm, taking as an anchor the well-established model of polycentric governance that views individuals, and state, market, and community, forming society as part of the same complex adaptive system. Actors within such systems self-organize into nested hierarchies that operate at multiple scales and move toward 21st century convergence of human and economic development.","[Dube, Laurette; Addy, Nii A.; Blouin, Chantal; Drager, Nick] MCCHE, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Dube, Laurette; Addy, Nii A.; Blouin, Chantal; Drager, Nick] Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada; [Blouin, Chantal] Inst Natl Sante Publ Quebec, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Drager, Nick] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England",Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (INSPQ); University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Dubé, L (通讯作者)，Desautels Fac Management, 1001 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada.",laurette.dube@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,142,29,32,2,28,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2014,1331.0,,,,,,201,215,,10.1111/nyas.12511,0.0,,,15,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Regional & Urban Planning",Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Agriculture; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Public Administration",BC0WI,25146105.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349697400014,0

Guided by the concert-equality model of G8 governance, this case study of the G8's 2010 Muskoka Initiative on MNCH traces the process through which that initiative was planned within Canada, internationally prepared through negotiations with Canada's G8 partners, produced at Muskoka by the leaders in June, multiplied in its results by the UN summit in September, and reinforced by the new accountability mechanism put in place. It finds that the Muskoka summit succeeded in mobilizing major money and momentum for MNCH. This was due to the initiative and influence of children-focused nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), working with committed individuals and agencies within the host Canadian government, as well as supportive public opinion and the help of those in the UN responsible for realizing its Millennium Development Goals. Also relevant were the democratic like-mindedness of G8 leaders and their African partners, the deference of G8 members to the host's priority, and the need of the G8 to demonstrate its relevance through a division of labor between it and the new Group of Twenty summit. This study shows that G8 summits can succeed in advancing key global health issues without a global shock on the same subject to galvanize agreement and action. It suggests that, when committed, focused NGOs and government officials will lead and the private sector will follow, but that there will be a lag in the implementation needed to obtain the intended results.

The upstream is changing quickly-farmers are undertaking capital-led intensification and participating in burgeoning markets for land rental, fertilizer and pesticides, irrigation water, and seed, and shifting from subsistence to small commercialized farms; in some areas landholdings are concentrating. Midstream, in wholesale and milling, there is a quiet revolution underway, with thousands of entrepreneurs investing inequipment, increasing scale, diversifying intohigher quality, and the segments are undergoing consolidation and vertical coordination and integration. Mills, especially in China, are packaging and branding, and building agent networks in wholesale markets, and large mills are building direct relationships with supermarkets. The downstream retail segment is undergoing a supermarket revolution, again with the lead in change in China. In most cases the government is not playing a direct role in the market, but enabling this transformation through infrastructural investment. The transformation appears to be improving food security for cities by reducing margins, offering lower consumer rice prices, and increasing quality and diversity of rice. This paper discusses findings derived from unique stacked surveys of all value chain segments in seven zones, more and less developed, around Bangladesh, China, India, and Vietnam.","[Reardon, Thomas] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Reardon, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ Dept, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Reardon, Thomas] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Minten, Bart] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Adriano, Lourdes] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines; [The Anh Dao] Vietnam Acad Agr Sci, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Wang, Jianying] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Gupta, Sunipa Das] Int Food Policy Res Inst, New Delhi, India; [Chen, Kevin Z.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Michigan State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Asian Development Bank; Zhejiang University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Reardon, T (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ Dept, Justin S Morrill Hall Agr,446 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",reardon@msu.edu,"Chen, Kevin/GYU-8963-2022; Covey, Kevin/AAE-3599-2020","Covey, Kevin/0000-0001-6914-7797",,,,,21,69,72,4,77,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2014,1331.0,,,,,,106,118,,10.1111/nyas.12391,0.0,,,13,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Regional & Urban Planning",Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Agriculture; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Public Administration",BC0WI,24735399.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349697400008,0

The purpose of this paper is to highlight a case for how polycentric governance underlying the WoS approach is already functioning, while outlining an agenda to enable adaptive learning for improving such governance processes. Drawing upon a case study from Quebec, Canada, we employ empirically developed concepts from extensive, decades-long work of the 2009 Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom in the governance of policy in nonhealth domains to analyze early efforts at polycentric governance in policies around overnutrition, highlighting interactions between international, domestic, state and nonstate actors and processes. Using information from primary and secondary sources, we analyze the emergence of the broader policy context of Quebec's public health system in the 20th century. We present a microsituational analysis of the WoS approach for Quebec's 21st century policies on healthy lifestyles, emphasizing the role of governance at the community level. We argue for rethinking prescriptive policy analysis of the 20th century, proposing an agenda for diagnostic policy analysis, which explicates the multiple sets of actors and interacting variables shaping polycentric governance for operationalizing the WoS approach to policymaking in specific contexts.","[Addy, Nii A.; Drager, Nick; Dube, Laurette] McGill Univ, MCCHE, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada; [Addy, Nii A.; Drager, Nick; Dube, Laurette] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada; [Poirier, Alain] Inst Natl Sante Publ Quebec, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Blouin, Chantal] Agri Food & Hlth, Inst Natl Sante Publ Quebec, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Drager, Nick] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England",McGill University; McGill University; Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (INSPQ); Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (INSPQ); University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Addy, NA (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, 1001 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada.",nii.addy@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,70,23,23,2,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",0077-8923,,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2014,1331.0,,,,,,216,229,,10.1111/nyas.12503,0.0,,,14,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Regional & Urban Planning",Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Agriculture; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Public Administration",BC0WI,25118135.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349697400015,0

One possible countermeasure is to empower consumers to make healthier food choices with useful nutrition labeling. An important part of this endeavor is to determine the usability of existing and proposed labeling schemes. Here, we report an experiment on how four different labeling schemes affect the speed and nutritional value of food choices. We then apply decision field theory, a leading computational model of human decision making, to simulate the experimental results. The psychology experiment shows that quantitative, single-attribute labeling schemes have greater usability than multiattribute and binary ones, and that they remain effective under moderate time pressure. The computational model simulates these psychological results and provides explanatory insights into them.

CI takes a modular approach that convenes around roadmaps for real world change-a portfolio of loosely coupled complementary partners from the business community, civil society, and the public sector. Roadmaps serve as collaborative platforms for focused, achievable, and time-bound projects to provide scalable, sustainable, and resilient solutions to complex challenges, with benefits both to participating partners and to society. In this paper, we first briefly review the literature on technological innovation that sets the foundations of CI and motivates its feasibility. We then describe CI, its building blocks, and enabling conditions for deployment and scaling up, illustrating its operational forms through examples of existing CI-sensitive innovation.","[Dube, Laurette; Faber, Aida; Struben, Jeroen] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada; [Dube, Laurette; Jha, Srivardhini; Faber, Aida; Drager, Nick; Lannon, Chris] McGill Univ, MCCHE, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada; [Jha, Srivardhini] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [London, Ted] Univ Michigan, William Davidson Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [London, Ted] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mohapatra, Archisman] INCLEN Trust Int, New Delhi, India; [Drager, Nick] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada; [Drager, Nick] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Joshi, P.

Information being key to such transformations, this roadmap paper offers a strategy that capitalizes on Big Data and advanced analytics, setting the foundation for an integrative intersectoral knowledge platform to better inform and monitor behavioral change and ecosystem transformation. Building upon the four P's of marketing (product, price, promotion, placement), we examine digital commercial marketing data through the lenses of the four A's of food security (availability, accessibility, affordability, appeal) using advanced consumer choice analytics for archetypal traditional (fresh fruits and vegetables) and modern (soft drinks) product categories. We demonstrate that business practices typically associated with the latter also have an important, if not more important, impact on purchases of the former category. Implications and limitations of the approach are discussed.","[Dube, Laurette; Labban, Alice] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada; [Dube, Laurette; Heslop, Gabriela] McGill Univ, MCCHE, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada; [Moubarac, Jean-Claude] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Nutr, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Ma, Yu] Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Dept Mkt Business Econ & Law, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Paquet, Catherine] Univ S Australia, Sch Populat Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Paquet, Catherine] Douglas Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Douglas Hosp, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; McGill University; Universidade de Sao Paulo; University of Alberta; University of South Australia; McGill University,"Dubé, L (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, 1001 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada.",laurette.dube@mcgill.ca,"PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; Ma, Yu/N-1413-2017; Moubarac, Jean-Claude/J-8235-2014; Moubarac, Jean-Claude/ABE-6439-2020; Paquet, Catherine/C-3894-2009","Paquet, Catherine/0000-0002-6877-7903",,,,,160,25,26,3,60,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2014,1331.0,,,,,,278,295,,10.1111/nyas.12595,0.0,,,18,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Regional & Urban Planning",Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Agriculture; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Public Administration",BC0WI,25514866.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349697400020,0

Given its importance for income generation, improving diets, care practices, and maternal health, the agriculture sector is widely regarded as playing an important role in accelerating the reduction in undernutrition. This paper comprehensively maps existing evidence along agriculture-nutrition pathways in India and assesses both the quality and coverage of the existing literature. We present a conceptual framework delineating six key pathways between agriculture and nutrition. Three pathways pertain to the nutritional impacts of farm production, farm incomes, and food prices. The other three pertain to agriculture-gender linkages. After an extensive search, we found 78 research papers that provided evidence to populate these pathways. The literature suggests that Indian agriculture has a range of important influences on nutrition. Agriculture seems to influence diets even when controlling for income, and relative food prices could partly explain observed dietary changes in recent decades. The evidence on agriculture-gender linkages to nutrition is relatively weak. Sizeable knowledge gaps remain. The root causes of these gaps include an interdisciplinary disconnect between nutrition and economics/agriculture, a related problem of inadequate survey data, and limited policy-driven experimentation. Closing these gaps is essential to strengthening the agriculture sector's contribution to reducing undernutrition.","[Kadiyala, Suneetha] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1H 0PD, England; [Kadiyala, Suneetha; Harris, Jody] Leverhulme Ctr Integrat Res Agr & Hlth, London, England; [Harris, Jody; Headey, Derek; Yosef, Sivan; Gillespie, Stuart] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Kadiyala, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, 36 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PD, England.",Suneetha.Kadiyala@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Kadiyala, Suneetha/0000-0002-9101-1471; Harris, Jody/0000-0002-3369-1253",,,,,109,161,178,2,36,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",0077-8923,,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2014,1331.0,,,,,,43,56,,10.1111/nyas.12477,0.0,,,14,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Regional & Urban Planning",Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Agriculture; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Public Administration",BC0WI,25098622.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349697400004,0

This early adversity induces a series of adaptive physiological responses aimed at improving survival, but imposing increased risk for developing chronic nontransmittable diseases (obesity, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease) in the long term. Recently, mounting evidence has shown that fetal growth impairment is related to altered feeding behavior and preferences through the life course. When living in countries undergoing nutritional transition, in which individuals experience the coexistence of underweight and overweight problems (the double burden of malnutrition), fetal growth-restricted children can be simultaneously growth restricted and overweight-a double burden of malnutrition at the individual level. Considering food preferences as an important aspect of nutrition security, we will summarize the putative neurobiological mechanisms at the core of the relationship between fetal growth and nutrition security over the life course and the evidence linking early life adversity to later food preferences.","[Portella, Andre Krumel] Hosp Crianca Santo Antonio, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Silveira, Patricia Pelufo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Fac Med, Dept Pediat, BR-90046900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Silveira, PP (通讯作者)，Ramiro Barcelos,2350,Largo Eduardo Zaccaro Faraco, BR-90035903 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",00032386@ufrgs.br,"Silveira, Patricia P/F-4897-2014; Silveira, Patricia/K-2364-2019; Portella, Andre Krumel/A-9333-2010; Silveira, Patricia Pelufo/A-7139-2011","Silveira, Patricia P/0000-0001-8626-2519; Silveira, Patricia/0000-0001-8626-2519; Portella, Andre Krumel/0000-0003-3390-0016; Silveira, Patricia Pelufo/0000-0001-8626-2519",,,,,281,22,24,0,9,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2014,1331.0,,,,,,15,33,,10.1111/nyas.12390,0.0,,,19,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Regional & Urban Planning",Book Citation Index– Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index– Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Agriculture; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nutrition & Dietetics; Public Administration",BC0WI,24650246.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349697400002,0
