Prior studies have shown that inflation targeting has reduced inflation in those countries without significantly impacting GDP. This study seeks to improve upon these results by identifying the impact of timing on the policy decision as well as its impact as related to specific regions of the world. The focus is on developing countries across six regions. We find significant regional variation in developing countries in our sample in terms of the direction of changes in inflation following a switch to the inflation targeting policy. Moreover, although the impact of inflation targeting on real GDP is minimal overall, there is a statistically significant increase in real GDP among developing countries in certain regions only, namely, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

We find that output is distorted upward when the manager's taste for running large firms is weak, downward when it is strong, and equals a reference output when it is intermediate (in this case, the participation constraint is binding). We also obtain an endogenous reference output (equal to the expected output, which depends on the reference output), and find that the response of output to cost is null in the short-run (in which the reference output is fixed), whenever the manager's type is in the intermediate range, and negative in the long-run (after the adjustment of the reference output to equal expected output).","[Borges, Ana Pinto] NIDISAG, Oporto, Portugal; [Correia-da-Silva, Joao] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEF UP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Laussel, Didier] Aix Marseille Univ AMSE, CNRS, GREQAM, F-13290 Les Milles, France; [Laussel, Didier] EHESS, F-13290 Les Milles, France",Universidade do Porto; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Correia-da-Silva, J (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEF UP, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",anaborges@isag.pt; joao@fep.up.pt; didier.laussel@univ-amu.fr,"Pinto Borges, Ana/AIF-4271-2022; Pinto Borges, Ana/AAO-9585-2020; Correia-da-Silva, Joao/B-5940-2009; Borges, Ana/HOH-5629-2023","Pinto Borges, Ana/0000-0002-4942-079X; Pinto Borges, Ana/0000-0002-4942-079X; Correia-da-Silva, Joao/0000-0001-6040-2384;",,,,,34,3,4,0,11,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Using a simultaneous, structural model of labour supply and child care demand we predict the effects on the labour supply of partnered women, on demand for child care and on household finances for two-parent households in Australia. Using estimated cost impacts of this new National Quality Framework from government and non-government sources, we find modest effects on household behaviour. For a mid-range cost scenario, we find that partnered women's labour force participation will decrease by just over one-half of one percentage point, a change of less than 1 per cent. Working hours for partnered women decrease by 20minutes or approximately 2 per cent. Household disposable income decreases by $12.50, a 0.6 per cent decrease. Given widespread agreement about the benefits of investing in children, these quantitatively small effects for two-parent households strengthen the case for the National Quality Framework.","[Breunig, Robert V.; Trott, Declan] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Gong, Xiaodong] Univ Canberra, Natl Ctr Social & Econ Modelling, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University; University of Canberra,"Breunig, RV (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Robert.Breunig@anu.edu.au,,"Breunig, Robert/0000-0002-2220-3410; GONG, XIAODONG/0000-0002-5018-2637",,,,,49,3,3,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

We find that sizeable spillovers arise during periods of economic and financial turbulence (after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, the post-Lehman Brothers bankruptcy period, and in the second half of 2011 when there were concerns about sovereign market developments). Households readjusting their portfolios between holdings of risky financial assets and nominal-certain money may have been the dominant factor at play in explaining this. The interaction of the monetary base with the financial assets in recent years is less than that of M2 with them, a perhaps surprising feature given the balance sheet policies pursued by the Federal Reserve during this time.

Empirical results support the existence of this curve for Slovenia and Hungary. In the case of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia the pattern is weaker, but it still prevails, as is the case for an aggregate of the 10 transition countries. We then document this property of business cycles in the dynamic general equilibrium trade model of Backus et al. (1994), calibrated specifically to match the CEEC-10 aggregate economy. Results support the existence of an S-Curve, except when technology shocks are absent and domestic and imported goods are perfect substitutes. Since technological shocks are determinant in explaining the S-Curve pattern and transition countries seem to be experiencing some type of technological shocks, it is not likely that this pattern will fade away in the near future and hence it is important for economic policy to be aware of this phenomenon and its consequences for these countries in terms of real convergence and the timing of euro adoption.","[Ferreira Lopes, Alexandra] Univ Inst Lisbon ISCTE IUL, Sch Business, Lisbon, Portugal; [Ferreira Lopes, Alexandra] Univ Inst Lisbon ISCTE IUL, Business Res Unit, Lisbon, Portugal; [Neves Sequeira, Tiago] Univ Beira Interior UBI, Dept Management & Econ, Covilha, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Universidade da Beira Interior,"Ferreira Lopes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Inst Lisbon ISCTE IUL, Sch Business, Lisbon, Portugal.",alexandra.ferreira.lopes@iscte.pt; sequeira@ubi.pt,"Sequeira, Tiago/B-5900-2009; Ferreira-Lopes, Alexandra/B-5994-2009","Sequeira, Tiago/0000-0002-5501-1562; Ferreira-Lopes, Alexandra/0000-0002-9034-846X",,,,,23,4,4,0,21,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The main sources for comparison are data from the OECD and Eurostat as well as empirical research in Hungary. The research focused on educational attainment and the structure of the educational system, inequalities within the Hungarian educational system, educational attainment and employment, teacher salaries and teacher selection policy issues. The article proved that Hungary's public education system is the most unequal among the OECD countries, the structures of the secondary programs are biased, employment is relatively low, the rate of adult education is among the lowest, and the quality of teachers is below average because of counter-selection processes. Most of these problems can be traced to the lack of resources and the processes generated by demographic and social changes that have not been followed by adequate policy changes. The study deals with the educational disadvantages for Roma children as well.

The comment claims the Eurosystem was more sluggish in responding to the crisis than the Federal Reserve due to restrictions originating from its mandate. Yet today's challenge runs deeper, as the absence of a banking union in the Euro Area has allowed a large fragmentation in financial intermediation. The critical question is: Given that the Euro Area is not an Optimum Currency Area and a banking union will take a long time to materialize, can the Eurosystem find a way to alleviate the fragmentation in lending rates without compromising its independence? The comment offers a solution, which would expand the monetary toolbox.

However, if network sizes cannot be directly regulated, then competitive fees may also be too low from the welfare point of view.

The proposed tests are used to examine time-varying information spillover among global crude oil markets. The results provide empirical evidence of time-varying information spillover. In particular, the instantaneous causal effects of Dubai and Tapis crudes on Brent and WTI become stronger when a major event or events occur in major oil-producing countries. Such events include the Iraq War in March 2003, OPEC's announcement of a record production cut in December 2008, and the Libyan civil war in early 2011. And consistent with previous studies, WTI and Brent play dominant roles in global crude markets. Impulse response analysis shows that market information has a positive influence on the spillover effect in global crude oil markets. Moreover, the DCC-MGARCH Hong test consistently leads the rolling Hong test, which indicates that the former performs better. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Further evidence from a long memory process,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Crude oil prices; OPEC announcements; Volatility; Structural breaks; Long memory,TIME-SERIES; FUTURES PRICES; UNIT-ROOT; ANNOUNCEMENTS; BEHAVIOR; TRANSMISSION; EVENT; SPOT,"Since its formation, OPEC through its conference decisions has been a major player in the world oil markets. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impacts of OPEC's different news announcements on the conditional expectations and volatility of crude oil markets in the presence of long memory and structural changes. To do so, we first discern OPEC's oil production behavior in response to its cut, maintain, and increase decisions. Then by applying the ARMA-GARCH class models to the two global benchmarks WTI and Brent over the period May 1987 through December 2012, we find strong evidence of long memory. The empirical evidence also shows that OPEC's announcements especially the cut and the maintain decisions have a significant effect on both returns and volatility of the crude oil markets, particularly that of the WTI. Moreover, we explore the possibility of structural breaks in the crude oil prices and detect five (six) breakpoints for the WTI (Brent) oil markets. The presence of structural breaks reduces the persistence of volatility. Accounting for OPEC's scheduled news announcements in the presence of structural changes reduces the degree of volatility persistence and enhances the understanding of this volatility in the oil markets. These results have several implications for policy makers, oil traders and other participants in the crude oil markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

But the rules, although later amended, largely neglected the critical implications of macroeconomic imbalances for fiscal and sustainability. As the financial tensions deepened, significant progress has been made in enhancing European economic governance, including the new procedure for macroeconomic imbalance surveillance (EIP). The article argues that preventing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances is now one of the EU's most challenging tasks as major technical and political difficulties still need to be overcome. The EIP represents a major step forward in strengthening the EU's capability for managing the risks to macroeconomic stability, largely contributing to a common understanding among Member States and in the EU institutions of methods and tools for dealing with the fundamental macro drivers. The new procedure comes together with a comprehensive strategy of deep fiscal, financial, economic and political reform of the EMU. Further progress requires the will to change at both the domestic and the EU level in order to effectively implement the new procedures and, where necessary, to reinforce their scopes.","[Franco, Daniele; Zollino, Francesco] Bank Italy, Econ Res & Int Relat Area, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Zollino, F (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Econ Res & Int Relat Area, Rome, Italy.",FRANCESCO.ZOLLINO@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We focus on two fundamental characteristics: the model structure and the data aggregation level. Employing the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) framework, we combine the general equilibrium (GE) and partial equilibrium (PE) versions of the GTAP model, each of which is then run with a highly aggregated and a highly disaggregated version of the GTAP database. Based on this experimental setting, we quantify the biases resulting from the data aggregation, the model structure and the interaction of these two model characteristics.

In a comparison to indigenous city dwellers their earnings and household incomes are not significantly different; however, mobile households report a significantly higher subjective socio-economic status.

We find that the majority (83%) of recipients spend the certificates in the same way as cash. The other respondents (17%) bought an item they would not have bought otherwise but adjustments in their shopping pattern do not seem to result from constraints in redeeming the certificates: 80% of all respondents in this group says they have used the certificate to buy an item they really love to have. While inconsistent with standard microeconomic demand theory, this behavior can be explained by narrow bracketing: in spending gift certificates, these consumers consider a limited choice set of nice, personal items. Our data show that females are more likely to narrow bracket gift certificate income and that positive reciprocity towards the giver induces narrow bracketing in case the giver is a household member who suggests to buy a particular item using the certificate. Previous studies have found that both giving in-kind gifts (Waldfogel, 1993) as giving gift cards (Offenberg, 2007) entail a welfare loss of 10-30% when compared to giving cash. We find that the welfare effects of open loop gift certificates among users are limited: the consumption of broad bracketing consumers is unaffected and narrow bracketing consumers seem to value the possibility to separate gift certificate income from other income sources.

We model a small open economy with two tradable goods, each of which is produced using a sector-specific factor (e.g., land and capital) and another factor that is mobile between these tradable sectors (labor); one nontradable good, which is also produced using a specific factor (skilled labor), and an elected government with the mandate to tax trade flows. The tax revenue is used to provide local public goods that increase the economic agents' utility. We use this general equilibrium model to explicitly derive the ideal policies of the different socioeconomic groups in society (landlords, industrialists, labor, and skilled workers). We then use those ideal policies to model the individual probabilistic voting behavior of the members of each of these socioeconomic groups. We use this model to shed light on how differences in the comparative advantages of countries explain trade policy divergence between countries as well as trade policy instability within countries. We regard trade policy instability to mean that, in equilibrium, political parties diverge in terms of the political platforms they adopt. We show that in natural resource (land)-abundant economies with very little capital, or in economies that specializes in the production of manufactures, parties tend to converge to the same policy platform, and trade policy is likely to be stable and relatively close to free trade. In contrast, in a natural resource-abundant economy with an important domestic industry that competes with the imports, parties tend to diverge, and trade policy is likely to be more protectionist and unstable.","[Galiani, Sebastian; Torrens, Gustavo] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Schofield, Norman] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL),"Galiani, S (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 1208,One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",galiani@wustl.edu; schofield.norman@gmail.com; gftor-rens@go.wustl.edu,,,,,,,33,5,7,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

This new interpretation permits a simpler solution than those considered in the literature; I derive a mechanism that induces truthful revelation where the equilibrium involves a single round of elimination of weakly dominated strategies, and no monetary transfers.

This scheme, introduced in 1991, allows new immigrants with high earnings to be taxed at a preferential flat rate for a duration of three years. We obtain two main results. First, the scheme has doubled the number of highly paid foreigners in Denmark relative to slightly less paid-and therefore ineligible-foreigners. This translates into a very large elasticity of migration with respect to 1 minus the average tax rate on foreigners, between 1.5 and 2. Second, we find compelling evidence of a negative effect of the scheme-induced reduction in the average tax rate on pretax earnings of foreign migrants at the individual level. This finding can be rationalized by a matching frictions model with wage bargaining where there is a gap between pay and marginal productivity.

However, the field is dominated by econometric Price Transmission Analysis (PTA) but surprisingly disconnected from analyses based on simulation models such as Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. The missing reconciliation among these tools could be due to PTA often being concerned with high frequency data and short-term adjustment processes, which does not reconcile well with the annual data of CGE analyses; different research teams in econometric time series analysis and CGE modeling with typically little overlap; and the endogeneity of price transmission in CGE models. Due to this endogeneity, the calibration of CGE models to empirically observed price transmission is not straightforward, as an infinite combination of model parameters and specifications allows for reaching a certain level of price transmission. This paper aims at paving the way for the integrated use of PTA and CGE. models by analyzing how a given degree of price transmission from the international to the domestic market, which may be determined empirically e.g. based on a vector error correction model, can be met in a single country CGE model. We examine and validate seven hypothetical determinants including structural characteristics of the model, the parameterization of behavioral functions and properties of the sectors concerned. The findings of this paper support controlling the pass-through of prices from the international to the domestic market in CGE models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Considered vitally important, not only for humanity's well-being but also for the integrity of the ecosystem, the relationship between water use and economic growth has nevertheless traditionally attracted little attention by analysts. This article studies water use trends from 1900 to 2000 throughout the world and their relationship to the main determinants of economic growth. To do this, we first analyse water use trajectories. Second, to proceed with the determinants of water use, we reformulate the Ehrlich and Holdren's impact, population, affluence, technology (IPAT) equation (1971), decomposing water use trends into changes in economic demands and in water use intensity on the basis of a decomposition analysis. Finally, a simple scenario analysis is conducted, to project future water use trends under different economic, demographic and technological assumptions.The empirical evidence shows that economic and population growth have been crucial in explaining the increase in water use over the past 100 years, with significant regional differences. Nevertheless, the decline in water use intensity has been responsible for a significant reduction in the growth of total water use.","[Duarte, Rosa; Serrano, Ana] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Pinilla, Vicente] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Appl Econ & Econ Hist, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Serrano, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",asergon@unizar.es,"Duarte, Rosa/F-4239-2016; Quinn, Patrick/B-5489-2010; Serrano-Gonzalez, Ana/AAG-5221-2020; Pinilla, Vicente/H-4331-2015","Serrano-Gonzalez, Ana/0000-0001-6991-7915; Pinilla, Vicente/0000-0003-2256-8898",,,,,56,41,49,1,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Gazprom remains the main actor in the Russian gas industry but the company is facing challenges on its main export market and increasing competition at home with the arrival of new gas firms, independents and Russian oil companies.

The United States and to some extent the United Kingdom are held up as examples of the more flexible' labour markets to which other countries should aspire. But even over a period of 20 years, there is strong persistence in relative unemployment rates at local area levels in both countries, and especially the United Kingdom. This result extends to counties and local authority areas within individual states and regions.

Using cross-country and cross-regional regressions, we show that when we focus on historically determined differences in human capital and control for the effect of institutions, the impact of institutions on long-run development is robust, whereas the estimates of the effect of human capital are much diminished and become consistent with micro estimates. Using historical and cross-country regression evidence, we also show that there is no support for the view that differences in the human capital endowments of early European colonists have been a major factor in the subsequent institutional development of former colonies.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Acemoglu, Daron; Robinson, James A.] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON M5G 1Z8, Canada; [Gallego, Francisco A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ & Econ Hist, Santiago, Chile; [Gallego, Francisco A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Cliometr Lab, Santiago, Chile; [Robinson, James A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Harvard University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",daron@mit.edu; fgallego@puc.cl; jrobinson@gov.harvard.edu,"Gallego, Francisco/E-5485-2015; Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023","Gallego, Francisco/0000-0002-2252-891X;",,,,,82,260,279,16,160,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The question is of first-order importance given the emergence of macro-prudential' policy regimes in the wake of the global financial crisis, under which regulatory tools - in particular, minimum capital ratio requirements for banks - will be employed to control the supply of bank credit as part of the effort to improve the resilience of the financial system. Regulatory efforts to influence the aggregate supply of credit may be thwarted to some degree by leakages', as other credit suppliers substitute for the variation induced in the supply of credit by regulated banks. Credit substitution could occur through foreign banks operating domestic branches that are not subject to capital regulation by the domestic supervisor, or through bond and stock markets. The UK experience for the period 1998-2007 is ideally suited to address these questions, given its unique regulatory history (UK bank regulators imposed bank-specific and time-varying capital requirements on regulated banks), the substantial presence of both domestically regulated and foreign regulated banks, and the UK's deep capital markets. In this study we show that foreign-regulated branches are indeed an important source of credit substitution. Leakage by foreign regulated branches can occur either as a result of competition between branches and regulated banks that are parts of separate banking groups, or because a foreign banking group shifts loans from its UK-regulated subsidiary to its affiliated branch, which is not subject to UK capital regulation. Our results suggest the presence of both channels is important, but the responsiveness of affiliated branches is substantially stronger (roughly twice as strong). We do not find any evidence for leakages through capital markets. That result may reflect the possibility that under non-crisis conditions loan substitution through unregulated banks enjoys informational, monitoring and cost advantages over substitution via securities markets. This evidence has important policy implications: (1) because significant leakages result from interbank competition, in addition to loan transfers within affiliated entities of the same banking groups, forcing foreign banks to consolidate their operations in each country into either a foreign branch or a foreign subsidiary will not solve the leakage problem; and (2) international cooperation will be necessary to prevent regulatory arbitrage between domestically regulated banks and foreign branches.

Subsequently, various extensions of the model are considered, such as additional financial risk factors, stochastic human capital, and more elaborate individual preferences. We then turn to the literature on intergenerational risk sharing, which suggests that a long-lived entity such as a pension fund or the government can yield ex ante welfare gains by allowing nonoverlapping generations to trade risk. The scope for this type of intergenerational risk sharing, however, is limited by the ability to commit generations to the contract.

In order to test the endogeneity of the four variables, we used the three-stage least squares method for a simultaneous equations system. According to the results, we identified three arguments for endogeneity in an enlarged Euro Area with other CEE economies. Thus, most of the CEE economies recorded a higher correlation of the business cycles and a higher share of the intra-industry trade with the Euro Area advanced countries as compared to Portugal or Greece. Moreover, the group of the CEE economies is more commercially integrated as compared to the peripheral economies of the Euro Area.

The decompositions are categorised into those that refer to socio-demographic characteristics (place of residence, age, household type) and those belonging to different well-being (sub-) categories (potential and net income, expenditure and wealth categories). The empirical analyses are performed for Germany using the 2008 German Sample Survey of Income and Expenditure.

Post-WWII technologies enabled farmers over the Ogallala aquifer to extract groundwater for large-scale irrigation. Comparing counties over the Ogallala with nearby similar counties, groundwater access increased agricultural land values and initially reduced the impact of droughts. Over time, land use adjusted toward water intensive crops and drought sensitivity increased. Viewed differently, farmers in nearby water-scarce areas maintained lower-value drought-resistant practices that fully mitigate naturally higher drought sensitivity. The evolving impact of the Ogallala illustrates the importance of water for agricultural production, but also the large scope for agricultural adaptation to groundwater and drought.","[Hornbeck, Richard] Harvard Univ, Littauer Ctr 232, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Keskin, Pinar] Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA",Harvard University; Wellesley College,"Hornbeck, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Littauer Ctr 232, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hornbeck@fas.harvard.edu; pke-skin@wellesley.edu,,"Keskin, Pinar/0000-0002-9788-787X",,,,,62,112,151,8,102,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

The patterns of changes in efficiency for the countries are further analyzed using the Malmquist productivity index approach. The result shows that total factor productivity is higher in the first sub-period, 1995-1999, which could be attributed to the increased competition and internationalization of the banking system, which took place in this sub-period due to the accelerated liberalization and deregulation of the financial system.

A reduction in tariffs induces more productive firms to modernize their technology and enter the export market. New technologies involve computerized production processes and lower the need for physically demanding skills. As a result, the relative wage and employment of women improves in blue-collar tasks, but not in white-collar tasks. We test our model using a panel of establishment level data from Mexico exploiting tariff reductions associated with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

PCLR is fundamental information required to gain an understanding of economic losses caused by a disaster. In particular, this paper proposes a method of PCLR estimation that considers the two main causes of capacity losses as observed from past earthquake disasters, namely damage to production facilities and disruption of lifeline systems. To achieve the quantitative estimation of PCLR, functional fragility curves considering the relationship between production capacity and earthquake ground motion and lifeline resilience factors for capturing the impact of lifeline disruptions have been adopted, while actual recovery curves are considered mainly for damaged facilities. Through the application of this method to the case study of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, the PCLR in various industrial sectors is estimated; the estimated PCLR in the manufacturing sectors are then compared to the corresponding index of industrial production. The results demonstrate that the estimated values are close to the actual production indices in the overall manufacturing sector and many of the individual sectors.","[Kajitani, Yoshio] Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Civil Engn Lab, Abiko, Chiba, Japan; [Tatano, Hirokazu] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Kyoto, Japan",Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry - Japan; Kyoto University,"Kajitani, Y (通讯作者)，Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Civil Engn Lab, Abiko, Chiba, Japan.",y-kaji@criepi.denken.or.jp,"KAJITANI, YOSHIO/W-2338-2019","KAJITANI, YOSHIO/0000-0003-3110-7436","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25249070, 24710185] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,19,40,49,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Using play-by-play data from the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 NFL season, I estimate how the detection of offensive holding changes when the positioning of an official changes. I find that there is approximately a 20% increase in the number of offensive holding penalties called after the NFL repositioned the official. Penalties called on defensive linemen fell as a result of the repositioning. Overall, there was no change in the total number of penalties called. Using the estimated change in the probability of a penalty, I estimate the probability of an official calling a penalty. I infer that NFL officials detect approximately 60% of crimes committed on the field.","Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, Oxford, MS 38655 USA",University of Mississippi,"Kitchens, C (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, Oxford, MS 38655 USA.",kitchct@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,5,5,6,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

It also measures the impacts of various determinants on DIA of Singapore. Based on theoretical justification, several potential determinants including aggregate income, interest rate, trade openness and exchange rate are considered in this study. Results obtained reveal that higher aggregate income will contribute to the expansion of abroad investment of Singaporean firms. Meanwhile, the increase (decrease) of DIA of Singapore is significantly related to the appreciation (depreciation) of the Singapore dollar per US dollar exchange rate in the long run. This finding is in tandem with the literature that suggests that appreciation of home currency tends to increase the volume of abroad investment activities. Meanwhile, the current study finds the existence of inverse relationship between interest rate and DIA of Singapore in the long run. This finding is consistent with the argument that lower interest rate reflects the abundance of capital in Singapore and subsequently lowers the opportunity cost in seeking capital for DIA. In other words, these firms have competitive advantage in financing foreign investment due to lower cost of borrowing in home country. Nevertheless, trade openness of Singapore exhibits inverse linkage towards DIA of Singapore in the long run. This may by due to the substitution effect of the trade activities against DIA of Singapore, as explained in the text. It is also discovered that exchange rate and aggregate income have larger influence on DIA of Singapore, compared to other determinants. It is argued that the association of the ownership, location and internationalization advantages gained by Singapore contributed to the economic development path of the country.","[Kueh, Jerome Swee-Hui; Puah, Chin-Hong; Liew, Venus Khim-Sen] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia",University of Malaysia Sarawak,"Kueh, JSH (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia.",kshjerome@feb.unimas.my; chpuah@feb.unimas.my; ksliew@feb.unimas.my,"Puah, Chin-Hong/O-9658-2018; Kueh, Jerome/T-1092-2018; Liew, Venus Khim-Sen/B-4427-2009","Liew, Venus Khim-Sen/0000-0002-2305-1404",,,,,38,1,2,0,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

As males still dominate worldwide in entrepreneurial activity, the authors are interested in the specifics of female entrepreneurship and its antecedents. The central hypothesis was that female students have lower self-efficacy than male students which induces lower intentions towards venture creation. To follow the research aims, the authors conducted a questionnaire among students at one of the Polish universities. It included questions relating to the concept of self-efficacy inspired by the works of Bandura (1977, 1982, 1986, 1989), Noble et al. (1999) and Boyd and Vozikis (1994). By using various statistical methods (including the two means t-test, the coefficient of correlation test, the Chi-squared independence test and the Mann-Whitney U test) the interplay between intentions, gender and self-efficacy was investigated. According to the findings, the level of entrepreneurial intentions is gender-dependent and men present higher intentions towards venture creation than women. However, entrepreneurial self-efficacy proved to be not related to gender and self-efficacy is not a major factor shaping entrepreneurial intentions. The reason for lower intentions among women is not significantly connected with their self-efficacy. The paper discusses the contextual meaning of the results and their implications for entrepreneurship education in Poland.","[Kurczewska, Agnieszka; Bialek, Jacek] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Kurczewska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",,"Białek, Jacek/S-6879-2018; Kurczewska, Agnieszka/HLV-8359-2023; Białek, Jacek/AAX-5756-2020","Białek, Jacek/0000-0002-0952-5327; Białek, Jacek/0000-0002-0952-5327; Kurczewska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-3088-5044",,,,,32,12,13,1,8,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The existence of a common prior from which all agents' beliefs are derived is of the first kind. The non-existence of an agreeable bet, that is, a contingent zero-sum trade which is always favorable to all agents, is of the second kind. It is well established that these two notions of consistency are equivalent for finite type spaces but not for countable ones. We present three equivalences of epistemic consistency and economic consistency conditions for countable type spaces, defining in this way three levels of consistency of type spaces: weak consistency, consistency, and strong consistency. These three levels coincide in the finite case. We fully analyze the level of consistency of type spaces based on the knowledge structure of Rubinstein's email game. The new notion of belief consistency introduced here helps to justify the requirement of boundedness of payoff functions in countable type spaces by showing that in a large class of spaces there exists an agreeable unbounded bet even when a common prior exists.

The authors also proposed the three-factor model due to the poor fitting of the two-factor one on long-term futures prices. At that time the authors had only long-term prices from a private source to calibrate, test and compare these models. No public data on long-term future contracts were available. On the other hand, during the last decade the commodity prices soared as did the liquidity of long-term contracts. This means that the interest of the agents in the management of their risk on long-term positions increased the same way and this is the motivation for this study. In this article, we revisit the comparison between two- and three-factor models using public data for short-and long-term contracts (we use up to the 67-month-ahead contract). We also provide a detailed derivation of the three-factor model differently from that of the original article. Following the original article of Schwartz and Smith, we used oil futures prices traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange to calibrate the model. The results show a better fit of the three-factor model for the term structure of prices and volatilities mainly for long maturities contracts, while the two-factor model in most portions of the curve underestimates the risk premiums. This type of analysis is important not only for daily agents negotiating the physical commodities through long-term contracts but also for investment decisions on development of real projects.","[Lucena Aiube, Fernando Antonio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Petrobras, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Lucena Aiube, Fernando Antonio; Samanez, Carlos Patricio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ind Engn, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Samanez, Carlos Patricio] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Fac Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro,"Samanez, CP (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ind Engn, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",cps@puc-rio.br,"Aiube, Fernando Antonio Lucena/I-2644-2012",,,,,,19,9,9,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Researchers widely discuss problems faced in a cross-cultural setting and how they affect overseas operations. Less effort has been made so far to study the positive aspects of human interactions in MNCs. Generally, cross-cultural interactions are a peculiar type of social interactions that may contribute to building of social capital of MNCs as well as creativity and innovations, among other positives, which all have a beneficial influence on MNCs' functioning. Thus, there is a need for a deeper understanding of mutually oriented human behaviors when the borders are crossed. Since the author wants to present a more balanced approach for analysis of human relationship in multicultural settings, the aim of the paper is to identify negative and positive aspects of cross-cultural interactions. The author 's main research was focused on the barriers to cross-cultural interactions while the pilot study also reflects the evidence of positive aspects of such an interaction. The data were collected via a qualitative study in foreign subsidiaries of MNCs in Poland. The analysis provided in the article may contribute to a better understanding of the genuine nature of cross-cultural interactions. There is also emphasized that creativity and innovation may be enhanced in MNCs due to cultural diversity.","Gdansk Sch Banking, PL-80821 Gdansk, Poland",,"Rozkwitalska, M (通讯作者)，Gdansk Sch Banking, Dolna Brama 8 St, PL-80821 Gdansk, Poland.",mrozkwitalska@wsb.gda.pl,"Rozkwitalska, Malgorzata/AAO-4454-2020","Rozkwitalska, Malgorzata/0000-0003-3184-871X",,,,,61,3,6,2,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

When agents observe previous moves, they tend to condition their cooperation on observed cooperation. This leads to two effects of increased transparency: on the one hand, early movers are more likely to cooperate in order to encourage those who observe them to cooperate. On the other hand, as transparency increases, later movers are less likely to cooperate because they are more likely to observe defections and defect in response. With increasing returns to scale, where the effect of one agent's contribution is larger as more agents contribute, an information chain is as effective in inducing cooperation as full transparency. In a linear public good, where agents lose in monetary terms by contributing to the public good, information chains induce higher cooperation in early movers compared to a no-transparency treatment and in late movers compared to a full-transparency treatment Thus, partial information can be used to balance the positive and negative effects of transparency.

It is shown that the traditional EGARCH estimates of conditional idiosyncratic volatility may bring significant finite sample estimation bias in the presence of non-Gaussianity. We propose a new estimator that has more robust sampling performance than the EGARCH MLE in the presence of heavy-tail or skewed innovations. Our cross-sectional portfolio analysis demonstrates that the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle documented by Ang, Hodrick, Xiang, and Zhang (2006) exists intertemporally. We conduct further analysis to solve the puzzle. We show that two factors idiosyncratic variance and individual conditional skewness play important roles in determining cross-sectional returns. A new concept, the expected windfall, is introduced as an alternate measure of conditional return skewness. After controlling for these two additional factors, we solve the major piece of this puzzle: Our cross-sectional regression tests identify a positive relationship between conditional idiosyncratic volatility and expected returns for over 99% of the total market capitalization of the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX stock exchanges.","[Wan, Chi] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Accounting & Finance, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Xiao, Zhijie] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; Boston College,"Wan, C (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Accounting & Finance, Harbor Campusu, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0731-9053,,978-1-78441-182-4; 978-1-78441-183-1,ADV ECONOMETRICS,,,2014,33,,,,,,713,749,,10.1108/S0731-905320140000033020,0.0,,,37,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360559300021,0

The analysis shows that the saving rate determines the trade commodity structure of a country in the long-run equilibrium. Furthermore, a developing country with a low capitallabor ratio in the initial state will change from exporting labor-intensive goods in the initial state to exporting capital-intensive goods in the long-run equilibrium if it has a higher saving rate, and this upgrade of trade commodity structure has a social welfare effect under an oligopolistic market structure. The effect of trade policy on the upgrade of the trade commodity structure is uncertain in our model; therefore, a high saving rate is the irreplaceable driving force for trade commodity structure upgrades in developing countries.","[Xing, Xiaobing; Xu, Jiexiang] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Xing, Xiaobing; Xu, Jiexiang] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Bengbu, Peoples R China",Australian National University; Anhui University of Finance & Economics,"Xu, JX (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",jiexiangxu@163.com,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

When Japanese firms undertake merger and acquisition (M&A) FDI, they acquire indivisible assets in the United States. To utilize their acquired assets fully, these firms may undertake additional non-M&A FDI. This implies a positive association between the number of M&As and the number of non-M&A FDIs because they may be complements. In contrast, the literature on the choice of modes of FDI examines the tradeoff between M&A and non-M&A FDI. This may suggest a negative association between the number of M&As and non-M&A FDIs because they may be substitutes. The authors examine whether the number of M&As and non-M&A FDIs are positively associated or not by proposing an econometric model that tests the contemporaneous association and the lagged complementary effect between M&A and non-M&A FDI. Using firm-level data, the authors find evidence that M&A and non-M&A FDI of Japanese firms in the United States are positively associated. Particularly, the findings indicate that given all other things equal, a one unit increase in the number of the firm's M&A FDI (non-M&A) projects in a given year will increase the firm's average non-M&A (M&A) FDI by 28.1% (15.8%) the following year.","[Alba, Joseph D.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Song, Peter X.

More than three decades later, the RAND results are still widely held to be the gold standard of evidence for predicting the likely impact of health insurance reforms on medical spending, as well as for designing actual insurance policies. On cost grounds alone, we are unlikely to see something like the RAND experiment again. In this essay, we reexamine the core findings of the RAND health insurance experiment in light of the subsequent three decades of work on the analysis of randomized experiments and the economics of moral hazard. First, we re-present the main findings of the RAND experiment in a manner more similar to the way they would be presented today. Second, we reexamine the validity of the experimental treatment effects. Finally, we reconsider the famous RAND estimate that the elasticity of medical spending with respect to its out-of pocket price is -0.2. We draw a contrast between how this elasticity was originally estimated and how it has been subsequently applied, and more generally we caution against trying to summarize the experimental treatment effects from nonlinear health insurance contracts using a single price elasticity.","[Einav, Liran] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Finkelstein, Amy] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Einav, Liran; Finkelstein, Amy] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,,aviva.arondine@gmail.com; leinav@stanford.edu; afink@mit.edu,,,"NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG032449, R37 AG032449] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,40,138,173,4,108,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Recently, the core-selecting Combinatorial Clock Auction (CCA) has been used as an alternative to the SMRA in a number of countries promising strong incentives for truthful bidding and high efficiency as a result. We analyze the efficiency and auctioneer revenue of the CCA in comparison to SMRA and examine bidding behavior in both formats. The experiments are based on two value models, which resemble single- and multiband spectrum sales in the field. Such applications often allow for thousands of possible bundles. Bidders in the CCA submitted bids for only a fraction of all bundles with a positive valuation. Bundles were selected based on synergies and payoff after the primary bid rounds. As a consequence, we found efficiency of the CCA to be significantly lower than that of SMRA in the multi-band value model and auctioneer revenue of the CCA to be lower in both value models.

Labor's share is an important indicator of the primary distribution of national income, and its fall has drawn significant attention from researchers and policymakers. As China's many regions have different development levels and economic structures, it is very likely that labor's share will differ across regions. Thus, it is important to examine the regional disparity of labor's share. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework based on existing theories to identify the factors that influence labor's share. We, then, use Chinese provincial data from 1997 to 2007 to describe the regional differentials in labor's share and its evolution over the 10-year period and to explain regional disparity in labor's share. We take into consideration spatial correlations across regions and employ spatial cross-sectional and panel models in the empirical analysis. We found that industrial composition and ownership structure were the two key factors that influence labor's share. We also found that the average labor income was lower but labor's share was higher in western areas compared to eastern areas. The higher levels of labor's share in western provinces may be explained by a higher share of agricultural industries and state-owned enterprises, as agriculture and state-owned sectors tend to distribute more income to labor than to capital.

We present a detailed bifurcation analysis for a dynamic model of R&D that captures these observations in one, unifying framework. As we provide a global analysis, we do not limit initial technologies to carry marginal costs that are below the choke price. We show that there always exists a critical value of initial marginal cost above which the firm does not initiate any (R&D) activity; the path to the saddle-point steady state is never globally optimal.

In the benchmark case of a pure LPG, the system displays a similar location pattern to the existing NEG taxation model, although the tax reduces the market size of manufactured goods. However, when we consider the inherent congestion of an LPG, we find a new agglomeration force due to the demand of the LPG and a new dispersion force due to its congestion. As a result of their interaction, the congestability is crucial in determining the spatial location pattern.","[Wang, An-Ming] Commerce Dev Res Inst, Taipei 10665, Taiwan; [Zeng, Dao-Zhi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan",Tohoku University,"Wang, AM (通讯作者)，Commerce Dev Res Inst, Taipei 10665, Taiwan.",wangam@cdri.org.tw; zeng@se.is.tohoku.ac.jp,,"Zeng, Dao-Zhi/0000-0003-3348-3574",,,,,21,1,1,1,11,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

In addition, previous studies have mostly neglected nonlinearities which for example may stem from exogenous oil price shocks. Using monthly data for various oil-exporting and oil-importing countries, this study contributes to the clarification of those issues. We discriminate between long-run and time-varying short-run dynamics, using a Markov-switching vector error correction model. In terms of causality, the results differ between the economies under observation but suggest that the most important causality runs from exchange rates to oil prices, with a depreciation of the dollar triggering an increase in oil prices. On the other hand, changes in nominal oil prices are responsible for ambiguous real exchange rate effects mostly through the price differential and partly also through a direct influence on the nominal exchange rate. Overall, the fact that the adjustment pattern frequently differs between regimes underlines the fact that the relationships are subject to changes over time, suggesting that nonlinearities are an important issue when analyzing oil prices and exchange rates.

However, very little is known about how different financial structures emerge and evolve. In this paper we empirically assess the political origins of financial structure. Using difference-in difference estimation and annual data, we study the effects of democratization on financial structure in a sample of 96 countries covering the period 1970-2005. Democratization here corresponds to the event of becoming a democracy. We find that democratization leads to a more market-based financial system. Democratic change could also be incremental rather than a one off. To identify the effect of incremental democratic change on financial structure we estimate a separate model and find that democracy matters. We also find that countries with substantial democratic capital are more likely to have a market-based financial structure. Our main results are robust to a variety of controls, Arellano-Bond GMM estimation, alternative measures of democracy and financial structure, and across different samples.

Given these potential flaws we estimate a dynamic ordinary least squares model of monthly carbon dioxide emissions, personal income, and energy production in the U.S. from 1981 to 2003.

Higher price of a CFL to an incandescent bulb (IB) and limited knowledge about the life span of CFLs versus IBs are found to lower adoption rates by as much as 20%. While CFL adoption increases the technical efficiency of household lighting, the lower cost for lighting services results in estimated rebound effects that decrease potential energy savings by 23% to 35% due to increased brightness and extended hours of use. These findings have important implications for household welfare and cost-benefit tradeoffs for CFL projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This model features three regions, endogenous technological learning within and across those regions, various government policies to facilitate technological learning and a penalty constraint which is used to mimic the effect market forces play on the capital cost of electricity generation technologies. This constraint has been added as market forces have been a strong factor in technology pricing in recent years. Global, regional and component experience curves have been developed for some technologies. The model, with the inclusion of these features, projects a diverse range of technologies contributing to global electricity generation under a carbon price scenario. The penalty constraint leads to gradual and continual installations of technologies and because the constraint provides a disincentive to install too much of a technology, it reduces the impact of uncertainty in the learning rate. Alternative forms of the penalty constraint were tested for their suitability; it was found that, with a zero and lower-cost version of the constraint, photovoltaics are installed in a boom-and-bust cycle, which is not supported by past experience. When the constraint is set at a high level, there are fewer installations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A formal representation of the decision maker's confidence is proposed and used to formulate a family of decision models conforming to this maxim. A natural member of this family is studied in detail. It is structurally simpler than other recent models of decision under uncertainty, which may make it easier to apply to practical decisions, whilst being axiomatically sound, permitting the separation of beliefs and tastes, and allowing comparative statics analysis of attitudes to choosing in the absence of confidence.

This study assesses the effectiveness of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in this regard using econometric methods and data between 2000 and 2010. Our model accounts for network externalities by using lagged sales as an independent variable. This approach helps to capture the exponential initial growth associated with the diffusion of new technologies and avoids overestimating the effect of the policy incentives. Our results show that the Energy Policy Act of 2005 increased the sales of hybrids from 3% to 20% depending on the vehicle model considered. In addition, we find that this incentive is only effective when the amount provided is sufficiently large. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to analyzing standard labor market outcomes, such as forgone earnings, employment, hours worked and wage penalties, our unique data set allows us to investigate additional non-wage costs of displacement, in particular, fringe benefits, the propensity to have an informal employment relationship or a temporary contract. We find that displaced individuals face large foregone earnings following displacement, which are heterogeneous across education and ownership type of firm from which the worker separated. There is no evidence of wage penalties for re-employed displaced workers. However, we find an increased probability of working in informal or temporary jobs if previously displaced and a reduction in the number of benefits.

We propose direct (Bayesian) mechanisms that are robust to certain forms of bounded rationality while controlling for equilibrium multiplicity. In quasi-linear environments with informational and allocative externalities, we show that any Bayesian mechanism that implements a social choice function can be converted into a supermodular mechanism that also implements the original decision rule. The proposed supermodular mechanism can be chosen in a way that minimizes the size of the equilibrium set, and we provide two sets of sufficient conditions to this effect.

However, a sizable recent empirical literature finds that undervalued real exchange rates help countries to achieve faster economic growth. This paper shows that recent findings are driven by inappropriate homogeneity assumptions on cross-country long-run real exchange rate behavior and/or growth regression misspecification. When these problems are redressed, the empirical results for a sample of 63 developing countries suggest that deviations of the real exchange rate in either direction from the value that is consistent with external and internal equilibriums reduce economic growth. Deviations from Balassa-Samuelson adjusted purchasing power parity on the other hand do not seem to matter for growth performance. The real exchange rate should thus be consistent with external and internal balances irrespective of implied purchasing power parity benchmarks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This distinction allows us to focus on the more interesting productivity effect by incorporating public infrastructure into the AIM cost function through the efficiency index. Moreover, we specify the growth rate of the efficiency index as a Box-Cox function of public infrastructure and a time trend, a proxy for other technology.

Using split-population duration models on longitudinally-transformed individual data from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS), the average impact of cigarette prices in the presence of unobserved country heterogeneity and shifting cultural norms within countries is identified by the variation of cigarette prices within countries over time. Price increases are found to effectively reduce initiation in early youth, and girls are considerably more responsive than boys. The price elasticity of initiation in LMICs is -0.82 for the combined gender analysis, -0.46 for boys only and -1.5 for girls only. There is some indication that youths in developing countries may be slightly less responsive to price changes than in high-income countries. No evidence is found that cigarette prices increase quitting rates in youth, which may be due to the difficulty of defining true quitting among smokers in early life.","Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Kostova, D (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",dkostov@emory.edu,,,,,,,22,13,15,0,104,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Therefore, a higher share of transaction sectors in an economy reveals that the economy actually has a lower level of (latent) transaction costs.

Our sample is unique in that the vast majority of our observations take zero values. Models that include observations with zero-flow values find that recent male immigrants respond to differences in (short-term) GDP fluctuations between origin countries and U.S. states, and perhaps to (long-term) trend GDP differences as well. More specifically, GDP fluctuations pull less-educated male immigrants into certain U.S. states, whereas GDP trends push less-educated male immigrants out of their countries of origin. Effects for less-educated women are less robust, as GDP coefficients tend to be much smaller than for men.","[Simpson, Nicole B.; Sparber, Chad] Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",,"Simpson, NB (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",nsimpson@colgate.edu; csparber@colgate.edu,,,,,,,47,7,7,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

It applies sibling fixed effects models to provide robust evidence that smoking cessation in the first trimester has a negligible effect on infant health, but cessation as late as second trimester or smoking throughout pregnancy is associated with substantially lower birth weights and higher risks of delivering low birth weight babies. In particular, about two thirds of the total detrimental smoking impact on birth Outcomes occurs in the second trimester. Therefore, reallocating resources on prenatal smoking cessation towards the first trimester can lead to a significant efficiency gain. This study also shows when the timing information of prenatal smoking cessation is improperly used, it will introduce a new nontrivial downward bias in estimating the causality between the conventionally used group measure prenatal smoker and infant health.","Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Yan, J (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, 416 Howard St, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",yanj@appstate.edu,,"Yan, Ji/0000-0002-4140-1420",,,,,45,5,7,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Our results indicate that the level of a firm's productivity plays an important role in determining its decision on R&D investment and export. In addition, a firm's experiences involved exporting and/or investment in R&D increase the probability of its current decision on export and/or R&D investment. Firms that either export or invest in R&D show significantly high productivity level than other firms that do not involve in any of two activities. Furthermore, firms that export and invest in R&D simultaneously are more likely to have higher productivity than firms that only participate in one of two activities.

Evidence from married couples,REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD,,,English,Article,,,,,,Volunteer labor; Household production; Intra-family resource allocation; Time allocation,TIME,"Volunteer labor is generally modeled as an individualistic pursuit, akin to leisure or to human capital accumulation. Some activities labeled as volunteering, however, may be more usefully thought of as quid pro quo time commitments that are part of securing services for family members. Parents are frequently expected to volunteer, for example, when their children participate in youth sports leagues or school marching bands. In such cases, volunteering is essentially an instance of household production undertaken outside the home. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we divide volunteering into three categories-youth-related, religious, and non-youth-related secular-according to the likelihood that an instance of volunteering in the category represents household production. We find evidence that husbands and wives respond to one another's time pressures such that youth-related volunteering looks like a task for which husbands' and wives' time inputs substitute for one another. Further, we find this pattern for housework, and not for other forms of volunteering. An increase in either spouse's hours of market work will significantly reduce that spouse's likelihood of volunteering for youth-related activities while raising the partner's likelihood of volunteering. A similar pattern holds for hours volunteered to youth-related activities, with the wife's responses achieving statistical significance.","[Brown, Eleanor] Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Zhang, Ye] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Zhang, Ye] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Ctr Philanthropy, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,"Brown, E (通讯作者)，Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, 425 N Coll Ave, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",ebrown@pomona.edu; zhang65@iupui.edu,,,,,,,23,10,10,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

This paper aims to tilt this imbalance towards heterogeneous agents setups by surveying the main positive and normative findings of this line of the literature, and suggesting areas in which these models could be implemented. In particular, we review studies that analyse the heterogeneity of (i) households' income, (ii) households' preferences, (iii) consumers' age, (iv) expectations and (v) firms' productivity and financial position.

Japan and the World Economy, 23(3), 190-201.] examines whether or not the current account deficits of the US can be characterized by a unit root process with regime switching (MS-ADF). In this paper, we find that, if the empirical sample ends in 2008: Q4, the estimates obtained from the Markov switching unit root regression retain a reasonable two-state classification. If the sample is extended to 2009:Q1 or beyond, then the estimates of the Markov switching unit root regression become quite unreasonable and it is difficult to explain the results. We also find that this contradictory phenomenon can be resolved by estimating the Markov switching autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model (MS-ARFIMA) proposed by Tsay and Hardle (2009) [A generalized ARFIMA process with Markov-switching fractional differencing parameter, Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, 79,731-745.]. The estimates of the MS-ADF and MS-ARFIMA models show that there is a red signal that the current account deficits observed during the period were probably not on a sustainable path.

The classic EPQ model considers production planning for a single product with a perfect production process and continuous inventory issuing policy for its finished goods. However, in real vendor-buyer integrated systems, the multi-delivery policy is often used in lieu of the continuous issuing policy, and due to various uncontrollable factors, the generation of defective items is inevitable. Furthermore, in order to maximize machine utilization, management often plans the production of m products in turn on a single machine, rather than a single product on one machine, as assumed by the EPQ model. Therefore, by assuming that all defective items produced are scrap, this study aims to jointly determine the optimal rotation cycle time and number of shipments that minimize the long-run average cost for such an imperfect quality multi-item EPQ model. We employ mathematical modeling with the renewal reward theorem and obtain closed-form optimal operating policies for the proposed model. Further, we demonstrate the practical use of the results by using a numerical example and sensitivity analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While bonus wages reproduce the main traits of piece wages they also generate a higher degree of cohesion on the shop floor due to self-interest and mutual surveillance among workers. It is suggested that bonus wages are better analyzed within a Marxian framework for they are a manifestation of the capitalist need for control both of the labor process and the process of valorization, a double aspect that is not considered either in wage efficiency theories or in radical theories of cost of job loss. It is argued further that bonus wages cannot be understood on the basis of reciprocity or fairness theories for they are the result of conflict rather than the outcome of mutual comprehension and a taste for equity. It concludes that the separate goals of discipline and incentive are collapsed together because the use of bonus wages for incentive in the form of a bonus acts as an instrument of discipline.

Our findings challenge a pervasive view in the economical literatures that early parenting plays a dominant role in explaining child development. In economics, early environmental conditions are important to demonstrate the evolution of adolescent and adult cognitive skills (Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Knudsen et al., 2006), and it establishes causal impacts of early parental inputs and other environmental factors on cognitive and non-cognitive skills (Borghans et al., 2006; Cunha et al., 2010; Heckman et al., 2006b). Early parenting as well as older siblings should explain a diverse array of academic and social outcomes, for example, Mathematics, English, maritage and pregnancy. In fact, older siblings' characteristics are as important, if not more important, than as parenting for child development. Our analysis addresses the problems of measurement error, imperfect proxies, and reverse causality that plague conventional approach in psychology. We find that older brother contributes much more than older sister to child's mathematical achievement, while older sister contributes much more to child's English achievement. Our evidence is consistent with psychology literature, for example, Hetherington (1988), Jenkins (1992), Zukow-Goldring (1995), Marshall et al. (1997), Maynard (2002), and Brody et al.

The power of the test will depend on the extent to which the spatial-weights matrix employed in computing the Moran I test statistic properly specifies existing interaction links between spatial units. Empirical researchers are often unsure about the use of a particular spatial-weights matrix. In light of this Prucha (2011) introduced the I-2(q) test statistic. This test statistic combines quadratic forms based on several, say q, spatial-weights matrices, while at the same time allows for a proper controlling of the size of the test. In this paper, we first introduce a finite-sample standardized version of the I-2(q) test. We then perform a Monte Carlo study to explore the finite-sample performance of the I-2(q) tests.

The existing axioms in the literature are various conditions of robustness to blocking coalitions with respect to agents' ex ante (individual rationality and group rationality) and ex post (Pareto efficiency) endowments. We introduce a stringent axiom that encompasses and strengthens the existing ones. An allocation is reclaim-proof if it is robust to blocking coalitions with respect to any conceivable interim endowments of agents. This is an appealing property in dynamic settings, where the assignments prescribed by an allocation to be implemented need to be made in multiple rounds rather than all in one shot.

It combines genetic algorithms and stochastic simulation, whereby vast modelling flexibility is gained. For example, different market interventions can be integrated and their effects on the firms' investment behaviour and the sectoral welfare can be assessed. The model is validated for its application to competitive markets by numerically replicating the optimality property of myopic planning. According to the results, production ceilings and investment subsidies are preferable to price floors because the welfare is less reduced for a given stimulation of the willingness to invest. Moreover, it is shown that not considering disinvestment options, which in reality often exist, can lead to incorrect valuations of investment strategies at firm level and incorrect policy impact analyses at macroeconomic level.

One of the problems is that the field suffers from an assemblage of fragmented and scattered concepts (Boschma and Martin 2010). We propose a solution to this problem in the form of a model of exponential expansion. The model outlines the overall structure and function of the economy as exponential expansion. The pictographic model describes four axiomatic concepts - interactive, directional, emerging, and expanding - and their exponential nature. Taken as a whole, it provides the rudimentary aspects of an economic system within an analytical perspective. We argue that the main dynamic processes of the evolutionary perspective can be reduced to these four concepts. We evaluate the model in the light of Thomas Kuhn's notion of scientific paradigms and criteria for a good theory (1977, 1996). Thus, we aim at augmenting and assimilating the scattered body of concepts, presently residing within the field of evolutionary economics, by presenting an intuitive framework applicable to the theoretical and analytical corpus of contemporary literature.","[Frederiksen, Peter; Jagtfelt, Tue] Roskilde Univ, Dept Environm Social & Spatial Change, Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Frederiksen, P (通讯作者)，Roskilde Univ, Dept Environm Social & Spatial Change, Roskilde, Denmark.",,,,,,,,38,2,2,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Our first theoretical finding is that a distribution channel that is integrated with an asset management company has an incentive to charge higher distribution fees than an independent channel: a vertically integrated distribution channel tends to raise the costs of rival asset management companies. Our second finding is that the equilibrium is asymmetric in certain circumstances: a channel may want to remain independent, whereas the other wants to be vertically integrated with an asset management company.

In this paper, we have attempted to expand the scope of previous literature by examining Korea's import demand for crude oil in a dynamic framework of cointegration. The empirical focus is on assessing the short- and long-run relationships among volume of crude oil import, economic growth and price of imported crude oil in Korea. For this purpose, an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach is applied to quarterly data for 1986-2010. Results show that income level is a more powerful determinant of the long-run behavior of Korea's crude oil imports than crude oil price. In the short-run, on the other hand, oil price is found to play a more important role in determining crude oil imports than income level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the de facto measure shows a robust positive effect on economic growth.

However, the scale of vacant urban housing will increase in future as a result of the population aging and the rising number of empty nesters. Therefore, demographic transition may not only increase housing demand, but also increase housing supply. Using an overlapping generations model, the present paper investigates the impact of demographic transition on housing consumption. We find that there is a nonlinear relationship between the elderly dependency ratio and housing consumption in China. With the deepening of population aging, housing consumption will increase; when the elderly dependency ratio reaches a turning point, housing consumption will decrease. The turning point of the nonlinear curve also depends on population mobility. A greater degree of population mobility will result in a delayed turning point. Furthermore, the turning point of the nonlinear curve will emerge when China's elderly dependency ratio reaches a value of 32 percent in 2025. This means that over the next decade, China should continue to increase the level of housing supply.","[Li, Meng] Shanghai Adm Inst, Dept Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Shen, Kunrong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Li, M (通讯作者)，Shanghai Adm Inst, Dept Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",njdxlm@gmail.com; shenkr@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,23,13,15,2,70,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP,2013,21,5,,,,,60,77,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12039.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,222QI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324745800004,0

The collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991 provides a unique opportunity to investigate this link. Using data collected from an employee survey conducted in over 340 workplaces in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia, we investigate generational differences in adherence to the Protestant work ethic (PWE). Our results indicate that Marx was 'right' about the link between work values and economic environment. That is, despite economic and cultural differences emerging during the transformation process, in all three countries, participating workers born after 1981 adhere more strongly to PWE than workers born before 1977. Moreover, the estimate magnitudes are very similar across these economically and culturally diverse countries. More generally, PWE adherence is stronger among participating workers with an internal locus of control and among supervisors. PWE adherence also tends to be stronger among participants with high relative earnings, as well as among those working in organizations that reward hard work with the chance to develop new skills or learn new things.

The results are summarized in the following two points. First, in the period before 1997, although main banks were likely to allow firms' employment maintenance until they experienced 2 consecutive years of losses, they tended to press firms to downsize once firms faced financial distress. Second, the reduced function of main banks and the increased influence of foreign owners have changed the timing of downsizing since 1997. Changes in corporate governance have brought about slight but non-negligible changes in Japanese employment practices.","Osaka Prefecture Univ, Osaka, Japan",Osaka Metropolitan University,"Noda, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Prefecture Univ, Osaka, Japan.",,,,,,,,43,8,8,1,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1352-4739,,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

Political mass demonstrations, the decision whether to join a speculative currency attack, investment in a risky venture, and capital flight from a particular country are all characterized by coordination problems. Furthermore, all these events have a dynamic nature which has been largely omitted from previous experimental studies. Here I use a two-stage variant of a dynamic global game to study experimentally how the arrival of information in a dynamic setting affects the relative aggressiveness of speculators. In the first stage, subjects exhibit excess aggressiveness, which appears to be driven by beliefs about others' actions rather than an intrinsic taste for attacking. However, following a failed first-stage attack, subjects learn to be less aggressive in the second stage. On the other hand, the arrival of new, more precise information after a failed attack leads to an increase in subjects' aggressiveness. Beliefs, again, play a crucial role in explaining how the arrival of information affects attacking behavior.","Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA",Wellesley College,"Shurchkov, O (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, 106 Cent St, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA.",oshurchk@wellesley.edu,,,,,,,41,11,13,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

A prominent example is the state of California where electricity intensities in the residential sector have stayed near constant since the 1970s in sharp contrast to nationwide trends in the United States. A structural model of residential energy consumption is used to show that the use of energy intensities alone to evaluate the success of California efficiency programs is misleading and glosses over important policy independent factors. We quantify important effects of price, climate conditions and demographic characteristics on energy consumption in California. We also provide evidence of split incentive considerations in residential energy consumption patterns. We conclude that while state policy may have had some effect on efficiency, caution needs to be exercised in using the California example to inform expectations from similar measures in other regions.

The issue has long been well understood but it has resurfaced as a problem of special concern because the timing of the sharp downturn during the Great Recession appears to have distorted seasonals. In this paper, I find that initially this effect pushed reported seasonally adjusted nonfarm payrolls up in the first half of the year and down in the second half of the year, by slightly more than 100,000 in both cases. But the effect declined in later years and is quite small at the time of writing. Going beyond the special case of the Great Recession, I argue for using filters that constrain the seasonal factors to be more stable than the default filters used by U.S. statistical agencies, and also for using filters that are based on estimation of a state-space model. Finally, I report some evidence of predictability in revisions to seasonal factors.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Wright, JH (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,,,,,,,9,8,10,0,9,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We set out the structure of economic activity in the various dynasties of ancient China and emphasize the differences in monetary structure from those of Europe and later North America. Imperial China was a politically integrated structure with regional segmentation of economic activities and hence with regional money. Monetary policy was conducted at the regional level but overseen politically. In various regions, different forms of money circulated, with gold, silver, copper, and paper money all presented at various times. Monetary policy was guided by monetary thought, as it was also guided later in Europe. Basic concepts, such as monetary functions, the velocity of circulation, inflation, interest rate parity and the quantity theory, were all present. The economics of Imperial China witnessed boom and bust, inflation and deflation and monetary control, similar to what was later seen in Europe. Chinese monetary thought thus seems to have preceded Western monetary thought and the two had remarkable similarities. Whether much of this thought traveled down the Silk Road remains unknown, but the possibility is intriguing. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

And, at the micro level, it demonstrates that changes in national political institutions in Africa strongly relate to changes in total factor productivity in agriculture.","[Bates, Robert H.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Block, Steven A.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA USA; [Fayad, Ghada] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Hoeffler, Anke] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Harvard University; Tufts University; International Monetary Fund; University of Oxford,"Bates, RH (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rbates@latte.harvard.edu,,"Hoeffler, Anke/0000-0002-0684-6096",,,,,35,20,22,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

When the government cannot commit to repay its debt and cannot commit to maintain the exchange rate, consumers' expectations of devaluation make the safe level of government debt very low. We show that, when the debt is in the crises zone-where self-fulfilling crisis can occur-the government finds it optimal to reduce the debt to exit the zone. The lower the probability that consumers assign to devaluation, however, the greater is the number of periods that the government will choose to take to exit the crisis zone.

Results suggest reductions in labor force attachment of approximately 5% and earnings reductions of approximately 15% for individuals with depressive symptoms as an adolescent. These effects are only partially reduced when controlling for channels operating through educational attainment, adult depressive symptoms, or co-occurring illnesses. Further, the unique structure of the data allows for high-school fixed effects as well as suggestive evidence using sibling comparisons, which allows controls for potentially important unobserved heterogeneity. Overall, the results suggest that the links between adolescent depression and labor market outcomes are quite robust and important in magnitude, suggesting the need for further investments in treatment options and opportunities during adolescence, which will likely result in long term returns.","Yale Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Fletcher, J (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, 60 Coll St,303, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",jason.fletcher@yale.edu,,,,,,,38,69,86,0,14,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Using a unique dataset combining outlet-specific information on global retail chains with a panel of Romanian manufacturing firms, this study sheds some light on this question. The results suggest that the expansion of global retail chains leads to a significant increase in the total factor productivity (TFP) in the supplying manufacturing industries: a 10% increase in the number of foreign chains' outlets is associated with a 2.4% to 2.6% boost to the TFP in the supplying industries. The decomposition of the aggregate productivity in the supplying industries suggests that the boost to performance is driven by both within-firm improvements and between-firm reallocation. Both changes are found to be associated with the expansion of foreign chains. These conclusions are robust to a variety of specifications and supported by evidence from a firm-level survey.

Then US Treasury rate pass-through and the corresponding central bank reaction function are analyzed within an asymmetric error-correction framework. Our empirical analysis indicates that changes in policy rate have a significant effect on Treasury rates in all maturity spectra during periods of anticipated policies only, implying asymmetric transmission. Moreover, some evidence is provided in favor of a nonlinear adjustment toward a long-run equilibrium, as the long-term rates adjust faster in such periods. Impulse response analysis indicates that in periods of low monetary policy anticipation, a shock in long term rates may engage central bank to significant reactions reflected in the policy rate with possible destabilizing effects for the economy. Given that smooth interest rate movements are linked to successful management of the economy more transparent policies are suggested. Our findings can be useful for the US monetary authorities in their attempt to monitor the long-term rate pass-through and reinforce monetary policy effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The use of this alternative econometric technique, along with two additional indicators that capture more appropriately the degree of de facto independence, leads to empirical results that are highly supportive of the negative relationship between CBI and inflation, thereby restoring faith in the conventionally held wisdom, that greater CBI is needed to lower inflation.

This paper provides a justification for this pattern based on adverse selection that entrepreneurs face in credit markets. Individuals choose between becoming entrepreneurs or workers and differ in their skill in both of these occupations. I find that endogenous cross-subsidization in the credit market equilibrium results in excessive (insufficient) entry of low-skilled (high-skilled) agents into entrepreneurship. This gives rise to a corrective role for differential taxation of entrepreneurial profits and labor income. In particular, a profit tax that is regressive relative to taxes on labor income restores the efficient occupational choice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that debt level has an inverse relationship with non-debt tax shield and direct relationship with investment in fixed assets, supporting the trade-off theory. However, the positive coefficient of growth opportunities and negative coefficient of debt cost, age and cash flows is consistent with the prediction of the pecking order theory. Results taken from a sample of small Spanish companies in the footwear sector during the period 1998-2006, revealed that in absence of asymmetric information, firms with positive cash flows will prefer debt because (a) they want to maintain their optimal capital structure; (b) they have greater needs to shield this cash flow from corporate tax and (c) they are concerned about the problem of over-investments, which means that they issue debt in order to discipline the firm's managers. The relationship between growth opportunities and debt level was positive. This is not surprising due to the need to finance these investment opportunities with debt, because rapidly growing firms are likely to have insufficient earnings to finance internally all of their growth. Furthermore, the low debt level of companies in the Spanish footwear sector also helps to explain this relationship due to the importance of R&D investments for this industry, which lenders value as strategic investments. Finally, small businesses face high transaction costs derived from typical agency problems and financial restriction on capital markets. Such high transaction costs justify the gap between the target and the current debt level and are responsible for the slow approach of their debt level to the target ratio.","[Acedo-Ramirez, Miguel A.; Ayala-Calvo, Juan C.; Rodriguez-Oses, Jose E.] Univ La Rioja, Dpto Econ & Empresa, Logrono 26004, La Rioja, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja,"Acedo-Ramírez, MA (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Dpto Econ & Empresa, C Ciguena 60, Logrono 26004, La Rioja, Spain.",miguel-angel.acedo@unirioja.es,"Ayala, Juan/AAA-5954-2019","Ayala Calvo, Juan-Carlos/0000-0002-0883-2149; Acedo Ramirez, Miguel Angel/0000-0002-8611-7247",,,,,61,3,5,0,36,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

We examine the importance of past poverty experiences for explaining current poverty as opposed to observed and unobserved individual heterogeneity. Our results are based on the model proposed by Cappellari and Jenkins (J Appl Econometr 19:593-610, 2004a) that estimates poverty transitions while simultaneously controlling for attrition and initial conditions. We find that about 50% of aggregate state dependence is genuine: poverty in a given year increases in itself the chances of experiencing poverty again in the future. The remainder is explained, among other characteristics, by living with a head of household who has no educational qualifications, being an immigrant or cohabiting with teenagers. Our findings call for a comprehensive and coordinated strategy against poverty that should focus equally on income-support policies and on enhancing those characteristics that best protect against economic hardship. From a methodological point of view, we learn that unobservables affecting initial conditions and sample retention are exogenous to those related to poverty transience. However, results prove to be sensitive to the choice of poverty line.","[Ayllon, Sara] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona 17071, Spain; [Ayllon, Sara] Univ Girona, EQUALITAS, Girona 17071, Spain",Universitat de Girona; Universitat de Girona,"Ayllón, S (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Dept Econ, C Univ Girona 10, Girona 17071, Spain.",sara.ayllon@udg.edu,"Ayllon, Sara/N-5350-2015","Ayllon, Sara/0000-0002-3338-1183",,,,,59,22,23,0,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

For this purpose, the response of Basque investment during conflict resolution attempts is used as a natural experiment with which to evaluate the effect of reduced uncertainty on productive investment. Thus, it is found that productive investment in the Basque Country increased considerably when credible peace talks directed towards the end of the conflict were undertaken. Accordingly, when compared with other subsets of comparable Spanish provinces, the truces declared in 1988 and 1998 propelled the growth rate of investment in this region by 21.2 and 25.8 percentage points, respectively. This finding gives an idea on the magnitude of the potential peace dividend to be reaped in the event of an eventual conflict resolution and a complete cessation of political violence in the region.","Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Despacho Dept 183, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Colino, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Despacho Dept 183, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid, Spain.",alberto.colino@urjc.es,"Colino, Alberto/HJZ-2595-2023","Colino, Alberto/0000-0001-8199-0242",,,,,37,6,6,0,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

It documents the huge shifts that have occurred in the composition of trade, in particular the rise of the City of London and knowledge-intensive services (communications, consultancy, R&D, media, other business services, etc.), the rise and fall of North Sea oil, and the transformation of the UK from a leading net exporter of manufactured goods to a major net importer. Domestic oil production is now in decline, net income from overseas investment has fallen, and the City of London is under threat. The UK also has a current account deficit equal to 4 per cent of GDP. These recent developments have led to widespread calls for rebalancing the economy so as to improve the trade performance of the manufacturing sector. This paper supports this objective. It calls for industrial and other policies to improve UK trade performance, above all in manufacturing, but also in knowledge-intensive services. It also points out the need to safeguard Londons role as a global financial centre.","[Coutts, Kenneth; Rowthorn, Robert] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ & Polit, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Coutts, K (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ & Polit, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",kjc1@cam.ac.uk; rer3@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

This view appears to bolster three pillars of neoclassical economics: (1) that economic actors are self-interested; (2) that self-interest leads to public goods (Adam Smith's invisible hand); and (3) that together these lead to market optimization. However, this chain of reasoning leads to a paradox. We show that the application of Darwinian selection to competition among firms (as opposed to among individuals) invokes group selection, which leads to exactly the opposite predictions: notably altruism and the suppression of individual self-interest. We apply an alternative evolutionary model of economic competition, multi-level selection (MLS) theory, which integrates the effects of selection at both individual and group levels. This approach reveals that, while individuals may generally pursue their own self-interest (as in the standard evolutionary account), humans also have evolved traits that-as if led by an invisible hand-steer our self-interest to align with the good of the firm or wider society as well. But it is the hand of Darwin, not Smith. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Johnson, Dominic D.

While rational self-interest dictates that investors should not be trusting and trustees should not be trustworthy in one-shot anonymous interactions, behavioral experiments with the trust game have found that people are both. Here we show how an evolutionary framework can explain this seemingly irrational, altruistic behavior. When individuals' strategies evolve in a context in which (1) investors sometimes have knowledge about trustees before transactions occur and (2) trustees compete with each other for access to investors, natural selection can favor both trust and trustworthiness, even in the subset of interactions in which individuals interact anonymously. We investigate the effects of investors having fuzzy minds and making irrationally large demands, finding that both improve outcomes for investors but are not evolutionarily stable. Furthermore, we often find oscillations in trust and trustworthiness instead of convergence to a socially optimal stable equilibrium, with increasing trustworthiness preceeding trust in these cycles. Finally, we show how partner choice, or competition among trustees in small group settings, can lead to arbitrarily equitable distributions of the game's proceeds. To complement our theoretical analysis, we performed a novel behavioral experiment with a modified version of the trust game. Our evolutionary framework provides an ultimate mechanism-not just a proximate psychological explanation-for the emergence of trusting behavior and can explain why trust and trustworthiness are sometimes stable and other times unstable.

One property requires that an agent who becomes higher ranked by the original partner should not be punished. We show that this property cannot always be met if the matchings are required to be stable. However, if only one agent changes his preferences, the above requirement is compatible with stability, and moreover, envy-minimization in stable matchings can also be attained. The other property is a solidarity property, requiring that all of the irrelevant agents, whose preferences as well as whose original partners' preferences are unchanged, should be affected in the same way; either all weakly better off or all worse off.

The effectiveness of this regulation is being debated by the scientific community regarding carbon emissions from direct and indirect land-use change. A valid alternative may be to design policies that stimulate sustainable land use in biofuel production. This article develops a model that simulates a voluntary program to increase the land use efficiency in production of biofuels. This stochastic dynamic model optimizes the sustainability of biofuels producible by including climate information and participatory decisions on land use. The model is parameterized using the Maximum Entropy econometric technique to present a simulation of the program in the State of Alabama. The results of this simulation show that participatory decisions on land-use may increase the net energy value of produced biofuel up to 215.68% and reduce the carbon emissions by 19.67% towards the state energy goals.

The word is evocative of ideas, products and processes which have somehow made the world a better place. Prior to the global financial crisis, many viewed financial innovation as unequivocally falling into this category. Underpinning this view was a pervasive belief in the self-correcting nature of markets and their consequent optimality as mechanisms for allocating society's resources. This belief exerted a profound influence on how we regulated financial markets and institutions. This paper examines the influence of this market fundamentalist thinking on the regulation of OTC derivatives markets in the US during the pivotal period between the enactment of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act (1974) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010). More specifically, it traces how the conventional 'demand-side' view of financial innovation played an important role in blinding policymakers to a host of pressing regulatory challenges. The objective of this paper is to start us down the path toward a more complete theoretical account of the nature, sources and potential private and social welfare implications of financial innovation. It also aspires to move us incrementally toward a more constructive equilibrium between the important insights of financial theory and how we conceptualize and pursue the objectives of financial regulation.

Literatures in housing economics, negotiations, and auctions offer diverse predictions around this question. On the one hand, housing studies typically treat home prices as an objective function of property and neighborhood characteristics. Yet, the large and robust literature on anchoring effects (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) suggests a positive relationship between listing prices and sale prices. Finally, evidence from the auctions literature suggests the opposite pattern through herding behaviors. We analyzed more than 14,000 transactions, taking into account observable property heterogeneity, geographical location and timing of the sales. We find that higher starting prices are indeed associated with higher selling prices, consistent with anchoring. For the average home in our sample, over-pricing between 10 and 20% leads to an increase in the sale price of $117-$163. This effect is particularly strong in areas with higher rates of mortgage foreclosure or serious delinquency. Additional analyses show that our results are unlikely to be driven by seller motivations or unobserved home qualities. We contrast our findings with recommendations and private beliefs of real estate agents, who provide services and advice for about 90% of home sales in the US. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our estimates indicate that an increase of 100 motor vehicles per thousand residents is associated with about a 6% point increase in obesity in common law countries, whereas it has a much smaller or insignificant impact in civil law countries. These relations hold whether we examine trend data and simple correlations, or conduct cross-section or panel data regression analysis. Our results suggest that obesity rises with motor vehicle ownership in countries following a common law tradition where individual liberty is encouraged, whereas the link is small or statistically non-existent in countries with a civil law background where the rights of the individual tend to be circumscribed by the power of the state.

We exploit the differential introduction of private television throughout the country and the variation in signal reception due to topography to estimate the causal effect of media exposure. Our estimates reveal important long and short run effects. An increase of one standard deviation in the number of private TV channels received in the area of residence as an adolescent reduces future inter-provincial migration by 1.7-2.7 percentage points, and all migration (inter and intra-provincial) by 3.9-6.8 percentage points. Short run effects are similar in magnitude. We also show that respondents less exposed to private television are more likely to consider themselves among the poorest groups in society. As we discuss in a stylized model of migration choice under imperfect information, these findings are consistent with Indonesian citizens over-estimating the net gains from internal migration when access to television is limited.

We here introduce a model which allows to analyze this issue by means of a simple framework in which players endowed with an idiosyncratic identity interact on a social network through strategic complements or substitutes. We classify the possible types of Nash equilibria under complete information, finding two thresholds for switching action that relate to the two-player setup of the games. This structure of equilibria is considerably reduced when turning to incomplete information, in a setup in which players only know the distribution of the number of neighbors of the network. For high degrees of heterogeneity in the population the equilibria is such that every player can choose her preferred action, whereas if one of the identities is in the minority frustration ensues.

The test results indicate evidence of beta-convergence and sigma-convergence in both cost and profit efficiency among all EU member and candidate countries. Hence, the results provide evidence in favor of the process of banking markets integration in the European Union. The results also indicate that the mean cost efficiency levels are higher than those of profit efficiency, verifying the importance of inefficiencies on the revenue side of banking activity in EU banking markets. The results further suggest that there have been significant efficiency gains in the newer member and candidate countries' banking sectors.","[Kasman, Adnan; Kasman, Saadet] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Business, Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Kasman, A (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Business, Izmir, Turkey.",,"Kasman, Adnan/ABF-6942-2020; Kasman, Saadet/ABF-8195-2020","Kasman, Adnan/0000-0001-9361-982X; KASMAN, Saadet/0000-0002-2304-0676",,,,,25,5,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The Saver's Credit is a tax credit designed to encourage retirement savings among low and middle income households; however, the credit's structure creates notches, or discontinuous jumps, within a household's budget constraint. These notches provide an incentive to manipulate adjusted gross income to fall just below the level where the credit decreases. I use Public Use Tax Files from the Internal Revenue Service to test whether taxpayers bunch their income at the notch created by the Saver's Credit. I find strong evidence that bunching occurred in response to the credit, which implies that taxpayers claiming the credit understood the incentives for bunching and indeed manipulated their incomes accordingly. I then exploit the discontinuity in credit rates to analyze the credit's impact on retirement contribution behavior using a regression discontinuity approach, and find that the credit failed to generate a statistically significant effect on the level of retirement contributions. These results imply that the Saver's Credit is more effective at providing transfers to low and middle income taxpayers than at increasing retirement contributions.

These networks have the potential to reduce information barriers and search costs in international trade. This paper quantifies the information effect of diaspora networks, using a panel data set of bilateral migration stocks and bilateral trade data that has been classified into intermediate and final goods. It shows that the migrants' role in exchange of information through business networks does lead to a significant increase in trade among countries. Moreover, the paper finds that this effect is greatest in the case of differentiated goods and that the highly educated migrants are most effective in business networking.

Based on the generalized propensity score (GPS) methodology, we estimate a dose-response function, depicting a non-linear impact of immigration on exports using province data for Spain and Italy. For both countries the response of province exports to more immigrants from a given nationality is always positive, although varies with the level of immigrants. First we find neither minimum threshold nor exhaustion point in the effectiveness of the immigration networks on province exports. Second we find that the value of the potential bilateral exports reaches a maximum in relatively small ethnic networks: between 70 and 100 foreign-born people of the same nationality.

In contrast to alternatives whose probabilities are known, these uncertain alternatives offer the benefits of learning. In repeat-choice situations, such learning brings value. If probabilities appear favorable (unfavorable), a choice can be repeated (avoided). In a series of experiments involving bets on the colors of poker chips drawn from bags, decision makers often prove to be blind to the learning opportunities offered by uncertain probabilities. They forgo significant expected payoffs when they shun uncertain alternatives in favor of known ones. Worse, when information is revealed, many make choices contrary to learning. Priming with optimal strategies offers little improvement. Such decision makers violate identified requirements for making rational decisions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The empirical analyses presented in this study generally confirm earlier research contending that the existence of a prime time or clutch player in the NBA is a myth.

Workers can increase their job offer arrival rate through costly search. Employers take into consideration the search intensity choices of their employees when the two parties jointly set wages. Using a Nash bargaining model with on-the-job search and wage renegotiation, I quantify the search intensity of workers, for both unemployed and employed. I estimate the structural model using the 2001 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) from the US, together with supplementary information from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The empirical results show that search intensity weakly declines as the worker gets a wage rise from her current job. But direct job-to-job transition does not necessarily imply higher wage and lower search intensity on the new job. Indeed, simulation suggests that, there are cases where workers on high-productivity jobs are most inclined to search, but the social returns to job search is highest in workers on low-productivity jobs. In this sense, the labor market equilibrium may not be socially efficient.","Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Yan, P (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",pyan@ccer.edu.cn,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,8,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

It is shown that the traditional interest rate channel is effective in Chile and New Zealand. For Peru and Uruguay, the exchange rate channel is instead more relevant in the transmission of monetary policy. This latter result follows from the limited impact of the policy rate in curbing inflationary pressures in these two countries, in combination with the fact that they have a relatively large and persistent exchange rate pass through.

Most of the gap cannot be explained by the characteristics available in this data set. Quantile regressions show that, in a number of countries, the wage gap is wider at the top ('glass ceilings') and/or at the bottom of the wage distribution ('sticky floors'). We find larger mean/median gender gaps and more evidence of glass ceilings for full-time full-year employees, suggesting more female disadvantage in 'better' jobs. These features may be related to country-specific policies that cannot be evaluated at the individual-country level, at a point in time. We use the cross-country variation in the unexplained wage gaps of this larger-than-usual sample of states to explore the influence of (i) country policies that reconcile work and family life and (ii) their wage-setting institutions.

Individuals are ex ante heterogeneous with respect to their preferences for leisure and face uncertainty about labor productivity, health status and out-of-pocket medical expenses. The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy in 2000 and is able to reproduce. very closely the retirement behavior of the American population. It reproduces the peaks in the distribution of Social Security applications at ages 62 and 65 and the observed facts that low earners and unhealthy individuals retire earlier. It also matches very closely the increase in retirement from 1950 to 2000: Changes in Social Security policy - which became much more generous - and the introduction of Medicare account for most of the expansion of retirement. In contrast, the isolated impact of the increase in longevity was a delaying of retirement. C) (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A NOTE ON GENERIC ADVERTISING,ECONOMIC INQUIRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CONSUMER PRICE SENSITIVITY; GOODS MARKETS; INFORMATION; ECONOMICS; OLIGOPOLY; IMPACT,"We propose a novel approach to estimating the effect of advertising on market performance that relies on the preferences of firms participating in generic advertising programs. Generic advertising campaigns provide a unique window to observe advertising effects on market performance, because rotations in market demand systematically redistribute advertising rents among firms according to observable characteristics on producer size. We examine producer attitudes towards generic advertising in the Beef. It's What's for Dinner! campaign of the U.S. Beef Checkoff program, the subject of the recent and controversial Supreme Court ruling on generic advertising as a form of government speech. We find the likelihood producers favor an expansion of the advertising program increases in their operating scale. This finding is consistent with an advertising campaign that has led to a counterclockwise rotation of market demand and a commensurate increase in market performance in the U.S. beef market.

Aspects of the purchase programs discussed include the scale of the programs, the historical and institutional background behind the programs, their effects on long-term interest rates and the equivalent effect expressed in terms of policy rates, and the reaction of aggregate demand to the programs. An analysis of the early stages of the economic recovery suggests that, by bolstering nominal spending and purchasing power, the asset purchases helped to secure positive real growth in the United Kingdom in 2010 in the face of adverse price-level shocks.","Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Nelson, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",Edward.Nelson@frb.gov,,,,,,,64,1,1,0,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The susceptibility of the results to relatively small changes in the experimental design has cast doubt on the interpretation of the game within the framework of the traditional economic theory of preferences. Another concern attached to the game is that patterns similar to those found in experiments are difficult to find outside experiments. Consequently, the recent discussion has ranged over using the dictator game as a tool for investigating social norms rather than as a setting to test the theory of preferences. Any progress in this discussion presupposes more empirical work using various data and taking various theoretical perspectives. This paper contributes to such research by comparing giving in the dictator game with supporting income redistribution in the field. In particular, the paper provides a simple data-analysis of three developed countries (Spain, Sweden and the USA) to find a data pattern similar to data patterns in dictator game experiments. A symmetrical resemblance is found in the case of Sweden, an asymmetrical one in the case of the USA, and a non-resemblance in the case of Spain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

While some of these mechanisms are the same as those at work in all personal services, others vary according to the activity in question. Care activities, for example, are caught up in a ovicious circle', while those employed in domestic services are caught in a oprecarity trap'.

The paper concludes by looking at the long run and the interaction between long-term growth potential and public debt sustainability. The European economic context and the macroeconomic difficulties currently faced by several European Union (EU) members are discussed. The paper emphasizes that: (1) financial turbulence may trigger permanent reductions in long-term growth potential and unsustainable public debt dynamics; and (2) strong institutional discontinuity such as EU financial assistance to member countries is probably the only way to restore growth and ensure long-run public debt sustainability.","Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept Hist Law Econ & Social Sci, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy",Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria,"Botta, A (通讯作者)，Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept Hist Law Econ & Social Sci, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.",,"Botta, Alberto/ABT-2795-2022","BOTTA, Alberto/0000-0001-9464-8251",,,,,29,7,7,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We show that, in the money-in-the-utility-function framework, endogenous fertility governs the validity of money superneutrality, the transitional dynamics of an anticipated monetary policy, and the optimal monetary policy. Along a balanced growth path, monetary growth increases fertility and reduces the economic growth rate if consumption and real balances are complements or are independent. However, monetary expansion may decrease fertility and increase economic growth if consumption and real balances are substitutes. Generally speaking, the superneutrality of money does not hold in the presence of endogenous fertility. More importantly, with endogenous fertility, the Friedman (1969) rule is no longer a welfare-maximizing monetary policy. We also show that an anticipated inflation induces the transitional dynamics of fertility and the economic growth rate even though the intertemporal elasticity of substitution equals unity. This differs from the conventional notion in the existing literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The demand specification is innovative and takes incompressible consumption into account. Given the costs and demand functions, we find that competition can increase CO2 emissions, as is highlighted by Mansur (2007). In duopoly, the EU ETS seems to be the only efficient policy for reducing CO2 emissions but also to increase the share of production based on renewable energy sources. The retained feed-in tariff policy seems to be the most expensive policy in terms of social welfare. Even if this policy seems to increase social welfare, feed-in tariffs increase the CSPE, which is paid for by consumers in the form of higher electricity prices and only benefits new entrants.

Employing the 2008 RuralUrban Migration in China and Indonesia Survey, we find that intergenerational correlation is lower in rural and migrant than in urban populations. The higher mobility observed in rural and migrant populations stems from the fact that the majority of these children complete only junior high school, with some children in the youngest cohorts moving down the education ladder relative to their parents. In contrast, urban children seem to at least maintain their parents' education level. The persistence of intergenerational transmission of education at high levels in urban areas combined with some mobility, upward or downward, in rural areas is likely to aggravate China's ruralurban disparity. Policies should focus more on the underlying gaps in education opportunities and the improvement in education of the rural and migrant populations.","[Golley, Jane] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Australian Ctr China World, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kong, Sherry Tao] Peking Univ, China Inst Social Sci Survey, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Australian National University; Peking University,"Kong, ST (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Inst Social Sci Survey, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",tao.kong@pku.edu.cn; tao.kong@pku.edu.cn,"Kong, Sherry Tao/L-1702-2013",,,,,,28,41,45,2,106,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2013,21,2,,,SI,,15,37,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12013.x,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,112YA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316630000002,0

Starting from a pre-industrialization state called the Malthusian regime, land and labor are the main production factors. The size of population is limited by the quantity of land available for households and by incomes. Technical progress driven by a Boserupian effect may push the economy towards a take-off regime. In this regime, capital accumulation begins and a learning-by-doing effect in production takes over from the Boserupian effect. If this effect is strong enough, the economy can reach an ultimate growth regime. In the different phases, land plays a crucial role. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Innovativeness as a personality trait is also found to be related to entrepreneurial status and business success. However, not much is known about the specific facets of the entrepreneur's innovative behaviour. This study aims first at better understanding how entrepreneurs differ from managers in the various areas of their innovative behaviour at work. Second, how this behaviour differs for entrepreneurs who have and do not have employees. Representative samples of the working population from Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy and Switzerland (N=3508) were interviewed with the use of the Innovative Behaviour Inventory. Individuals involved in independent entrepreneurial activities create new ideas and attempt to overcome obstacles during implementation more than employed individuals. People who manage other people communicate new ideas and seek to engage other individuals in the implementation of new ideas more than those without subordinates. Finally, what differentiates entrepreneurs from all other groups is their higher involvement in preparatory activities that start the implementation of new ideas. Overall, these differences led to the foremost position of entrepreneurs in achieving the innovation outputs.","Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Lukes, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",lukesm@vse.cz,"Lukes, Martin/G-2677-2019","Lukes, Martin/0000-0001-9063-9251",,,,,36,23,23,3,60,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In this case, the main impact of a ban on advertising is to reduce equilibrium prices and thus increase demand. I argue that this is more likely to happen in mature industries where consumer goods are ex-ante (i.e. without advertising) similar and advertising is of the 'price-increasing' type. The ban is the more likely to increase profits of the firms the weaker the ability of advertising to expand total demand and the less advertising serves to induce product differentiation.","[Motta, Massimo] ICREA Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Motta, Massimo] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Motta, Massimo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University,"Motta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ, C Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",massimo.motta@upf.edu,"Motta, Massimo/A-8866-2013",,ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,37,2,2,0,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Monthly data sets for the US dollar during the period of 1986-2010 and euro during the period of 1999-2010 are used. ANN has been confirmed as an effective tool in forecasting exchange rates through the evaluation of the empirical results. A possibility of extracting hidden information from the exchange rates and using this information to predict the future has been investigated by this technique.

Both are members of the post-Keynesian approach to growth and distribution, but the Cambridge model is a hybrid of Keynesian and classical features whereas the neo-Kaleckian model is Keynesian. The Cambridge approach assumes full capacity utilization, while the neo-Kaleckian approach assumes variable capacity utilization. The two theories rely on fundamentally different theories of income distribution. The Cambridge model has a class structure of saving that generates Pasinetti's (1962) theorem regarding irrelevance of worker saving for steady-state growth and distribution. That class structure can be included in the neo-Kaleckian model, generating a variant of the Pasinetti result whereby steady-state capacity utilization is independent of worker saving. Fiscal policy has similar growth effects in the two models, albeit via very different mechanisms. Both models suffer from lack of attention to the labor market.",,,,,,,,,,,25,17,17,1,11,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In the call-option utility maximization, an increase in the capital requirement results in an increased amount of loans held by a bank at a reduced margin when loan quality is in distress. We also show that the impact on the bank interest margin from an increase in the capital requirement which ignores the dislike, that we call such behavior call-option equity maximization, leads to significant underestimation. Our results cast doubt on the effectiveness of capital regulation to exert a risk-reducing and return-increasing effect on the bank in particular where loan quality becomes worse, thereby adversely affecting the stability of the banking system.

This accounts for puzzling features of the new veiling movement since the 1970s. Veiling also has surprising effects on the intergenerational transmission of values. Compulsory veiling laws can lead to a decline in religiosity.

This paper provides a review of current thinking on the economics of international trade in mining products. Despite mining products importance in early formulations of trade theory, there have been relatively few studies that have specifically examined mining product trade flows. The limited evidence that exists supports the idea that factor endowment differences explain much mining product trade. There is some apparent SouthSouth and intra-industry trade in mining products, but we find no need to resort to the new trade theory to explain this. Given worries of substandard growth and development in mining-based economies, trade policies have been used to try to accelerate the movement towards resource-based manufacturing. In the light of recent evidence that mining product exporters have not suffered in the long-run from mining activity, these policies are likely to have been unwarranted. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that the more closed mining economies have had faster growth than the open mining economies, reflecting correction of a political economy trap that causes open mining economies to under-invest in education.",,,,,,,,,,,118,5,8,4,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

But as the federal funds rate has reached the zero lower bound and the Federal Reserve is in a liquidity trap, the issue is whether there is a useful role of leverage and monetary aggregates in monetary policy and business cycle analysis. We address these issues and argue that there is a need for financial stability policies to manage the leverage cycle and reduce the procyclicality of the financial system. We also argue that in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and Great Contraction there is a need to get away from the New Keynesian thinking and back toward a quantity theory approach to monetary policy, based on properly measured monetary aggregates, such as the new Center for Financial Stability Divisia monetary aggregates.","[Serletis, Apostolos; Istiak, Khandokar] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Gogas, Periklis] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Int Econ Relat & Dev, Komotini, Greece",University of Calgary; Democritus University of Thrace,"Serletis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",Serletis@ucalgary.ca,"Gogas, Periklis/N-8162-2014","Gogas, Periklis/0000-0002-5134-3869",,,,,33,13,13,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Theoretically, search and location differentiation models suggest that price dispersion is a function of search and transportation costs, but is independent of the good's price. Empirical evidence, however, suggests otherwise: price dispersion and price are strongly correlated. This article points out the discrepancy between theory and evidence, which it denotes as 'the price dispersion puzzle'. It then explains why the documented behaviour of relative thinking (people behave as if their search or transportation costs are increasing in the good's price) can solve the puzzle.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Business Adm, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Azar, OH (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Business Adm, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",azar@som.bgu.ac.il,"AZAR, OFER H/F-1666-2012","AZAR, OFER H/0000-0003-0154-327X",,,,,35,5,5,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Shares of stock options have become one of the region's economic indicators illustrating current economic situation. The main subject in researches of investment portfolios forecasting became a discussion about what values are best to measure portfolio risk and expected returns. Also there is a wide range of researches on macroeconomic and social events influence on evolution of stock returns. The main problem of today's professional investment is to achieve the master level of complex investment decision adoption, included macroeconomic and historical data return analysis. The main aim of this work is to overview the portfolio optimization and evaluation models and to apply them to form the different portfolios of securities on the Vilnius Stock Market and compare them in the factor of conservativeness. There are used mean-risk models, such as Markowitz classic model, Mean Absolute Deviation model and MiniMax model, to optimize the investment portfolio in this research. Also there is performed the approbation of the multifactor model to evaluate the formed portfolios and to see the influence of the macroeconomic indexes to stock returns. Studies of this research showed 8 indicators, which have strongest linear dependence on shares return: VILIBOR interbank interest rate, consumer prices index, producer price index, construction expenses price index, trade balance, foreign direct investments, gross domestic product and inflation. Multifactorial analysis results showed that approved model to shares return data is not statistically reliable. Also, after further analysis there were found that Markowitz and Mean Absolute Deviation models create more conservative and optimal portfolio compared to MiniMax model, which is more suitable for aggressive and speculative investor.","[Bartkus, Edverdas Vaclovas; Paleviciene (Bartkute), Aiste] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Bartkus, EV (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",edvardas.bartkus@ktu.lt; aiste.paleviciene@stud.ktu.lt,,,,,,,26,4,4,2,17,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Externalities in professional sports,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Competitive equilibrium; Social Planner's Problem; Efficient allocation,,"In professional sports there are externalities. If one team acquires too much talent then that may impact the quality of the competition negatively. This means that the league can improve social welfare by distorting the competitive equilibrium allocation. This idea has been used to explain that there should be parity among teams to improve social welfare. We develop a theoretical model based on Biner's (2009) empirical results to capture the effect of this externality on the revenue levels and wages when local fans care about winning only. Social Planner's Problem for stadium revenues implies that it is possible to increase the total revenue made in the league compared to competitive equilibrium levels by increasing big market teams' talent level, therefore less parity. In other words due to externalities competitive market allocation is too equal compared to SPP allocation. We show when local audience is mainly interested in seeing their local team dominating the visiting team and national audience only interested in watching a close game on TV, the only way in the model for it ever to be efficient to enforce parity is if we introduce a national TV market into the analysis. For the national TV market, parity is going to lead to a wider TV audience. The greater the weight on this revenue stream, the more likely it is a parity policy can increase league revenues.

Theory and practice of IT project management classifies risks into several criteria such as: users, project requirements, project complexity, project planning and control, team, and organizational environment in which the project takes place. To ensure effective risk management of IT projects, project managers need to formalize the identification and monitoring of the risk factors. Thus, we considered appropriate to develop a tool to provide support for IT managers in project risk management. Through this support tool, IT managers can make decisions in real time regarding the occurrence and manifestation of risk factors so that the risk impact would be minimized by appropriate control measures.

Two impatient players bargain about the division of a shrinking surplus under a standard bargaining protocol in discrete time with constant recognition probabilities. Before bargaining, a player can commit to some part of the surplus. This commitment remains binding until the surplus has shrunk below the amount that the player is committed to. Intuitively, one cannot remain committed to something which has become impossible. The model offers insight on the relative importance of proposal power and commitment for the bargaining outcome. In a version of the game where both players may simultaneously choose their commitments, the equal split emerges from within a range of equilibrium divisions as a focal point which is robust to changes in the model parameters.

Unlike most previous studies, this study uses a 5-year state-level panel data set for the period 2001 to 2005. The Panel Least Squares (PLS) estimation provided in this study implies that per commercial and industrial customer electricity consumption is an increasing function of the annual number of Cooling Degree Days (CDDs), per capita real disposable income (a de facto 'control' variable) and the peak summer electricity-generating capacity. Furthermore, per commercial and industrial customer electricity consumption is a decreasing function of the average real unit price of electricity to commercial and industrial enterprises and the degree of each state's commitment to energy efficiency programmes, as reflected in an 'LEEP' score, where the term 'LEEP' stands for Level of Energy Efficiency Programmes. The latter result provides evidence that public policies to promote energy efficiency have yielded at least some benefits in terms of reducing commercial and industrial electricity consumption.","Jacksonville Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Jacksonville, FL 32211 USA",Jacksonville University,"Cebula, RJ (通讯作者)，Jacksonville Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 2800 Univ Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32211 USA.",dr.richardcebula@gmail.com,"Cebula, Richard J/P-7535-2018",,,,,,24,2,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The model yields a simple test for cooperative decision-making, which I apply to data from China. I find that, when the father migrates without his family, children spend more time in household production, while mothers spend less time in both household production and income-generating activities. This is not consistent with standard cooperative models of the household: simply reallocating time to compensate for the father's absence would cause an increase in household labor for both children and mothers and, if migration occurs in response to a negative shock, we should observe an increase in mothers time in income-generating activities rather than a reduction. The results also do not appear to be driven by an increase in mothers' bargaining power, as children's human capital is not affected by migration, controlling for income. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We deal with the selection bias by estimating a Full-Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) system of equations, where selection into the labour market is modelled in a multinomial setting. We find that some estimated parameters of the earnings equation differ from a binomial selection procedure by Heckman (1979), in particular for those variables with the strongest impact on the selection into the different labour-market statuses. However, the estimated returns to education are unaffected, even when we deal with the endogeneity of educational attainment following Duflo (2001).

Over the medium term, the latter reduces the scope for real exchange rate and terms of trade variability in response to cross-border flows. We embed our transfer analysis in popular models of current account adjustment, where initial imbalances are driven by domestic demand for - or foreign supply of - net saving, possibly associated with over-optimistic expectations.

Local differences can be attributed to differences in socio-economic variables and real estate characteristics. This article argues that one should additionally take into account the geographical location of municipalities. In particular, housing prices are affected by distance and travel-time to important economic centres offering jobs and extensive services. Following the economic geography literature, we develop a model showing the explicit impact of geographical barriers on housing prices. As such, we distinguish ourselves from the existing literature on the dynamics of housing prices since geographical elements are fairly constant over time. We estimate our model on municipality-level housing prices for all 589 Belgian municipalities in 2001. We also differentiate between the two main regions of Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia). Our empirical results confirm expectations. Geographical barriers have significantly negative effects on housing prices. Nevertheless we find important differences between the Belgian regions and the means of transport considered.","[De Bruyne, Karolien; Van Hove, Jan] HUBrussel, CREME GIC, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [De Bruyne, Karolien; Van Hove, Jan] KULeuven, Ctr Econ Studies, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"De Bruyne, K (通讯作者)，HUBrussel, CREME GIC, Warmoesberg 26, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",karolien.debruyne@hubrussel.be,"De Bruyne, Karolien/A-9527-2014","De Bruyne, Karolien/0000-0002-4281-4542",,,,,71,34,35,1,101,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We argue that this is due to the lower level of government services demanded in more religious countries. Religion motivates individuals to engage in charitable giving and this leads them to prefer making their contributions privately and voluntarily rather than through the state. To the extent that citizen preferences are reflected in policy outcomes, religiosity results in lower levels of taxes and hence lower levels of spending on both public goods and redistribution. Since measures of income typically do not fully take into account private transfers received, this increases measured income inequality. We formalize these ideas in a general equilibrium political economy model and also show that the implications of our model are supported by cross-country data. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The main results imply the existence of a Markov perfect equilibrium provided the sets of actions are compact, the set of states is countable, the period payoff functions are upper semi-continuous in action profiles and lower semi-continuous in actions taken by rival firms, and the transition function depends continuously on actions. Moreover, if for each firm a static best-reply set is convex, the equilibrium can be taken in pure strategies. We present and discuss sufficient conditions for the convexity of the best replies. In particular, we introduce new sufficient conditions that ensure the dynamic programming problem each firm faces has a convex solution set, and deduce the existence of a Markov perfect equilibrium for this class of games.

The static analysis, conducted by means of the fixed-effects estimator, suggests that trade openness reduces inequality, whereas FDI is positively linked to inequality. Some control variables, such as unemployment and inflation, also have a positive effect on inequality. When we control for endogeneity, using the system GMM estimator with the Windmeijer correction for small samples, the results also show that trade openness decreases income inequality and that the FDI effect on inequality is not significant. The country's economic growth causes inequality to increase, according to the findings of both our static and dynamic analyses.

This article examines the impact of foreign aid devoted to the health sector on child health promotion in developing countries. Two proxies for child health promotion are used: (a) immunization against measles and (b) immunization against Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus (DPT).

The persistence of these apparently inefficiently high prices can be attributed to institutional factors of the US market where federal taxes are imposed on the total amount wagered, and not on the bookmakers' revenue. By investigating all horse races in New Zealand from August 1993 to April 2009, our article is the first one to consider price setting for wagering in an unregulated market where taxes for a monopolistic betting agency are based on revenues. In such a setting, one would expect elasticities close to one, but in all econometric specifications, we find values well below one. We identify two reasons why higher prices could nevertheless reduce profits: cross price elasticities are negative and, due to the specific features of parimutuel betting, international competitors may only be attracted when take-out rates are above a critical threshold.","[Schumacher, C.

Before the global financial crisis, CIP was mostly satisfied for the first three countries but not for Romania. During and after the crisis, deviations from CIP have been substantial in all cases but with large differences across the countries. Estimations tie the observed pattern to developments in both global and country-specific risks. In the case of the Czech Republic, increased global risks led to a lower risk premium, indicating that Czech assets functioned as a safe haven. In Hungary and Poland, increased global risks led to higher risk premiums, suggesting a flight to quality out of Hungarian and Polish assets. Finally, for Romania the deviations from CIP were unrelated to developments in global or local financial risks, reflecting a repressed financial system.","[Staehr, Karsten] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,,,"Staehr, Karsten/G-4707-2016","Staehr, Karsten/0000-0002-2128-6672",,,,,20,6,6,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

To do so, we develop a simple model in which the impact of health on the marginal utility of consumption can be estimated from data on permanent income, health, and utility proxies. We estimate the model using the Health and Retirement Study's panel data on the elderly and near-elderly, and proxy for utility with measures of subjective well-being. Across a wide range of alternative specifications and assumptions, we find that the marginal utility of consumption declines as health deteriorates, and we are able to clearly reject the null of no state dependence. Our point estimates indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in the number of chronic diseases is associated with a 10%-25% decline in the marginal utility of consumption relative to this marginal utility when the individual has no chronic diseases. We present some simple, illustrative calibration results that suggest that state dependence of the magnitude we estimate can have a substantial effect on important economic problems such as the optimal level of health insurance benefits and the optimal level of life-cycle savings.","[Finkelstein, Amy] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Luttmer, Erzo F.

An application is then provided which examines the nature of the equilibrium relationship between aggregate US exports, world trade and the US real exchange rate.

The labor market search model is better able to replicate the cross-correlation among inflation, real wages, and output in the data. Moreover, in this model, real marginal cost is determined by both hiring cost and unit labor cost that varies with employment fluctuations, which gives rise to a high contemporaneous correlation between inflation and real marginal cost as represented in the New Keynesian Phillips curve.

We use an accounting model with heterogeneous agents and overlapping generations in order to project revenues and expenditures of the Spanish pension system for the next six decades. Specifically, we analyze the impact in pension expenditures of changes in the replacement rate, in the period of calculation and the delay of the retirement age. Moreover, it is the first paper up to now that evaluates the impact of the 2011 reform under four alternative migration scenarios: (i) released by the INE in 2005 assuming an annual net migration flow of 270,000 immigrants, (ii) published by the INE in 2010 where the net migration flow was reduced to 70,000 persons by year, (iii) the latest scenario from INE released in 2012 with negative net migration flows until 2036, and (iv) an alternative scenario proposed in this paper which migration hypothesis is linked to the need of the economy of employees. Finally, we analyze the changes in average pensions by gender, skill, and nationality. The results show that the three changes approved by the reform could imply savings of 3 percentage points of GDP in 2051, it is almost a third part of the expected increase in pension expenditure until that year.","[Ignacio Conde-Ruiz, J.] UCM, Madrid 28001, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Conde-Ruiz, JI (通讯作者)，UCM, C Jorge Juan 46, Madrid 28001, Spain.",nacho.conderuiz@gmail.com; gonzalez.claraisabel@gmail.com,"Conde-Ruiz, Jose Igancio/L-6523-2014; Gonzalez, Clara I./ABA-2323-2021","Gonzalez, Clara I./0000-0003-0091-9765",,,,,33,13,16,0,14,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2013,,204,,,,,9,44,,,,,,36,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,206NO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323528900001,0

In an environment of fiscal pressures, the effectiveness of such public spending in deterring crime emerges as an important issue. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of public order spending on recorded crime in Greece. Results reported herein show that public order outlays do not have any crime reducing impact. The findings may tentatively be interpreted as either reflecting inefficient use of resources and/or that crime is driven by a cohort of other factors and hence it is unaffected by the allocation of resources to policing. Both interpretations have important policy implications both in terms of crime prevention policies as well as in terms of the operational efficiency and effectiveness of the agencies assigned with the task to thwart criminal activity.

In case of economics, the development is so essential that there is a strong need to exclude it from the category of social sciences, where it had been placed in the past, as well as the creation of an independent group of economic sciences beside the natural and technical sciences. The need to strike out the economic sciences can be proved by a wide range of facts Including the timeless validity of several economic principles. As practical illustration the functioning of the capital market has been chosen which can give the evidence that the economic reality provides a limited space to individuals for their subjective decisions unlike as in the case of social sciences thus changing many effects into fatal ones similar to the situation in natural sciences. A great attention has been paid to the creation of an independent group of economic sciences because due to the existing classification of economics as a social science particular subject of the economic life deduce inadequate expectations caused by the improper assumption of possible subjective influences on the economic development. At the same time, it must be emphasized that it is not reasonable to doubt existing relationships between economic and social sciences. On the other hand, links of economic sciences to natural sciences cannot be neglected either. Despite this fact the economic sciences cannot be identified with none of these groups, and this statement refers also to technical sciences. In terms of its subject the economic sciences are so specific for the time being that it is meaningful to separate them from the social sciences, not assign them to any scientific group, and create a new group of economic sciences","[Kraft, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,jiri.kraft@tul.cz,"Kraft, Jiri/P-2722-2017","Kraft, Jiri/0000-0002-4269-0009",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,325,333,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300034,0

The negative effect is likely to pertain in liberal markets, whereas the positive influence arises in more regulated environments, and can be stronger for larger jumps in innovation.

The Max U Approach: Prudence Only, or Not Even Prudence? A Smithian Perspective. Econ Journal Watch 10(1): 2-14. In many works Deirdre McCloskey criticizes professional economics for too readily representing man as a maximizing agent-Mr. Maximum Utility, or Max U. McCloskey says that economic activities are not the machinations of robots or mathematical functions, but rather affairs among human beings. She prefers to approach the human being as a complex of virtues (or lack thereof). In all this, I basically concur. But McCloskey says that the Max U approach represents man in terms of one virtue: prudence. She calls the Max U approach Prudence Only. My concern is that associating Max U with prudence does not do justice to prudence. In treating of prudence, I draw exclusively from Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments. Smith makes many statements about prudence. It is by no means clear that they add up to a well defined notion of prudence, but it is clear that most of Smith's important statements about prudence do not fit the Max U approach. My paper aims to correct and avoid any notion that Smithian prudence may be thought of as maximization or optimization.","Univ Econ, Sch Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Lipka, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Sch Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",lipkadavid@gmail.com,"lipka, david/K-8572-2012",,,,,,32,5,5,0,7,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

For European conventional utilities, the downward price drift is relatively small and transient in nature. Yet, we find positive and lingering effects of the accident on the shares of alternative electric utilities. Japanese utilities were hit the hardest and the shock seems to be long-lasting. An interesting finding of this article is the abrupt increase (decrease) in the systematic risk of conventional (alternative) electric utilities following the event. In Europe, we could only document a decrease in the idiosyncratic risk of conventional utilities, pointing to enhanced return synchronicity in the conventional power industry. In turn, total risk seems to be stationary around the accident. In rebuttal, idiosyncratic and systematic risks (and consequently total risk) have substantially risen in Japan since the event. Finally, intercept values related to European utilities remained stable around the accident while Japanese utilities incurred a substantial decline in their daily average returns as captured by alpha shifts.","[Mama, Houdou Basse; Bassen, Alexander] Univ Hamburg, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Mama, HB (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, Hamburg, Germany.",houdou.basse@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,32,15,16,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The aim of the paper is to measure and assess efficiency potential of old EU countries (EU15) in reference years 2000-2011 by advanced DEA approach - the Malmquist index. The main purpose of used DEA approach is to measure efficiency changes over the reference period and to analyse a level of productivity in individual EU countries based on the Malmquist index, and then to classify the old EU Member States to homogeneous units (clusters) according to efficiency results based on the Cluster analysis. Using of DEA approach for efficiency evaluation is convenient because DEA method Is based on ratio between input- and output-indicators and measures thus efficiency with old EU countries are able to transform their inputs Into outputs. Efficiency can be thus considered as a 'source' of competitiveness. The first part is focused on theoretical background of efficiency in the context of effectiveness and advanced DEA method. Application part is concentrated on evaluation of EU15 countries efficiency In the frame of the Malmquist Index for efficiency measuring and the Cluster analysis for Jurisdiction of evaluated countries.

We build a monetary dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with a banking sector in which an agency problem between households and banks leads to endogenous capital constraints for the latter. In this setup, a countercyclical required reserves ratio (RRR) rule that responds to expected credit growth is found to countervail the negative effects of the financial accelerator mechanism triggered by productivity and bank capital shocks. Furthermore, it reduces the procyclicality of the financial system compared to a fixed RRR policy regime. The credit policy is most effective when the economy is hit by a financial shock. A time-varying RRR policy reduces the intertemporal distortions created by the fluctuations in credit spreads at the expense of generating higher inflation volatility, indicating an interesting trade-off between price stability and financial stability.","[Mimir, Yasin] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Istanbul Sch Cent Banking, Istanbul, Turkey; [Sunel, Enes; Taskin, Temel] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey",Ministry of National Education - Turkey; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Mimir, Y (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Istanbul Sch Cent Banking, Fener Kalamis Cad,Atlihan Sk 30-A, Istanbul, Turkey.",yasin.mimir@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,42,13,15,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This paper discusses the link between the system of organisational management and intellectual capital. The system of organisational management is a set of methods, techniques and approaches, usually divided into subsystems and interlinked to logical complexity. It is used for organisational management. Systems of organisational management are based on the prerequisite that organisation is a social system and that any resource (intellectual capital including) must be used in relation to other resources, e.g., in a systemic way. If the system of management is not complex, the exploitation of the resource may be less productive, even counter-productive. Experience shows that organisations that manage to balance individual elements of their corporate system create a stable environment that can more efficiently answer changes and challenges of the external environment. In such a balanced corporate system individual elements create a positive synergic effect. E.g., if organisations want to be successful in the long run, they should build a proper system of organisational management. Intellectual capital is often perceived as one of many subsystems of the system of organisational management. This paper disagrees with this approach as it leads to underestimating the role of the intellectual capital in an organisation. The paper argues that intellectual capital can serve as an independent system of organisational management. The paper is a theoretical paper. It gives definitions of intellectual capital and explains the term of the system of organisational management and its role in organisations. The analysis of the relationship between intellectual capital and the system of organisational management is made. The theoretical analysis shows that concepts of intellectual capital and some concepts of the system of organisational management are of similar basis, e.g., intellectual capital can serve as an independent system of organisational management. This idea is also demonstrated by practical examples.","Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Mládková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",mladkova@vse.cz,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,290,296,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000033,0

At the same time, the attention is paid to the fact that theories of regional development are constructed on the basis of the same methodological foundations. In recent years, there is noted a significant difference in the development of countries and also strengthening of disparity development within these countries. Moreover, there is an increasing pressure on economic theory, mainly on the growth and development theory to explain the nature of these differences and disparities between countries and regions and to give directions to adequate economic (macroeconomic and regional) policy. Theories of regional development are part of a broad framework of economic theory and prefer spatial and geographic aspects. The methodology can be defined as the study of methods used in scientific research. The method then presents the scientific approach used in examining the phenomena of reality. In this paper, the attention is paid to methodological approaches and methods of classical economics. Keynesian economics, neoclassical economics, neoliberal economics, neo-Marxist economics and institutional or neoinstitutional economics. Within each approach, there are mentioned methods such as historical-inductive method, empiricism, abstraction, axiomatic-deductive method, marginal analysis, methodological individualism, subjectivism, critical realism, dialectics, structuralism, historical approach, praxeology, descriptive analysis and others. The article also includes two schemes. The first presents the basic characteristics of methodological approaches and methods of individual theoretical economic directions.

Moreover, to accommodate the `nonsynchronous trading effect II' in the Granger causality tests, we propose a version of a VAR model with a modified dynamic structure of lags for the CEE and US stock market indexes. We observe a pronounced feedback relationship for almost all of the analyzed models, both in the whole sample period and in the two subsamples.

We provide a learning theoretic motivation for long run risk choices, such as those in expected utility theory with known payoff distributions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We show that the incumbent only expands when scope economies are large enough. Thus expansion is a signal of larger economies of scope and, for certain parameter values, leads to entry deterrence. Although our game is two-period, the expansion strategy creates a long-term advantage. We further investigate the implications of prohibiting an entry-deterrent expansion. A major finding is that, in our model, this prohibition always decreases consumer surplus.

Based on a VAR estimated using long-run restrictions, an expansionary monetary policy shock causes real commodity prices and output both to rise sharply for a short period of time. We find that a simple dynamic equilibrium model of commodity supply and demand can give a realistic response of real commodity prices to monetary policy shocks, for a wide range of parameter values. Furthermore, we find that based on historical simulations, shocks to monetary policy played an important role in commodity price fluctuations during the Great Recession, but they have contributed negligibly to commodity price movements overall since 1970. Even though monetary policy shocks have a robust and large marginal effect on real commodity prices, most monetary policy shocks are small, and most fluctuations in real commodity prices are correspondingly small.","[Reicher, Christopher Phillip] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Utlaut, Johannes Friederich] Kiel Inst World Econ, Adv Studies Program, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Reicher, CP (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",christopher.reicher@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,37,2,2,1,21,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The study is important because traditionally border regions have more difficulties achieving higher levels of sustained economic development, due among other factors to a bigger distance to the political powers of the countries involved. The focus on IC was chosen because in the 21st century intangibles are considered to be the main driver of economic and social prosperity. Using publicly available data to roughly define the current macroeconomic and demographic situation in the two distant European cross-border regions, we attempt to explain how IC formation may be enhanced by influencing the formation of coalitions or cooperation between cross-border counties. The payoff matrices for the games which results in the coalitions are themselves a result of the influence of qualitatively different influence factors, which are discussed in detail. In order to understand the region and country specific differences within these factors historical and contextual explanations are given, which might also point to the probable future evolution. The attractive and repulsive forces in this coalition formation may be interpreted to act similarly on IC formation, namely the (data dependent) formation of many stable coalitions is a potential, which also fosters IC formation. Hence we propose this potential of stable cooperation to be a proxy or an index of IC formation in our context of study. The number and sizes of potential coalitions may give clues on applying IC fostering regional cross-border developmental policies.","[Schebesch, Klaus Bruno] Vasile Goldis Western Univ, Arad, Romania; [Tome, Eduardo] Univ Lusiada Famalicao, Vila Nova De Famalicao, Portugal",Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad,"Schebesch, KB (通讯作者)，Vasile Goldis Western Univ, Arad, Romania.",kbschebesch@uvvg.ro; Eduardo.tome@clix.pt,"Tomé, Eduardo LCS/F-2308-2011",,,,,,20,1,1,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,398,408,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000046,0

We develop a continuous-time model wherein a risk-neutral firm is endowed with a perpetual option to invest in a project at any time by incurring a fixed investment cost at that instant. The project, once undertaken, generates a stream of cash flows that are governed by a mean-reverting stochastic process. The firm is then allowed to liquidate its project at any time to partially recover the fixed investment cost. The recovery rate of the fixed investment cost inversely gauges the degree of irreversibility of investment. Using a real options approach, we derive an analytical solution to the value of the firm that is analogous with an American compound option. We show that greater irreversibility of investment induces the firm to raise its investment trigger, thereby deferring the undertaking of the project. We further show that greater irreversibility of investment has a detrimental effect that makes the firm less valuable. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The distinctive feature of the paper is the significant role played by governance in explaining the long-term pattern of domestic investment in Nigeria. The results from the long-run estimation and the impulse responses revealed that a well-structured and stable socio-economic environment will boost domestic investment over the long run.

First, we outline a theoretical framework for the modelling of individual discrete choice under risk, distinguishing between three specific sources of randomness; in preference orderings, in outcomes, and in attribute tastes. Second, we apply this theoretical modelling framework to the domain of journey time risk (or 'reliability'), a subject which has acquired prominence in the transportation policies of many countries. Third, we apply the modelling framework empirically, based upon a Stated Preference experiment of 2395 rail travellers choosing between alternative journeys embodying different levels of journey time risk. Across the sample of travellers, we estimate a mean value of scheduled journey time of 25.62 pence/min, against a median of 18.55 pence/min. We further estimate a mean 'reliability ratio' (ratio of the value of standard deviation of journey time to the value of scheduled journey time) of 2.07, against a median of 0.85. The properties of the distribution of the reliability ratio suggest a predominant behaviour of aversion to journey time risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, we use instrumental variables based on immigration toward destination countries other than Italy to identify the causal impact of exogenous changes in Italys immigrant population. According to these estimates, immigration increases only the incidence of robberies, while leaving unaffected all other types of crime. Since robberies represent a very minor fraction of all criminal offenses, the effect on the overall crime rate is not significantly different from zero.","[Bianchi, Milo] Univ Paris 09, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Buonanno, Paolo] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy; [Pinotti, Paolo] Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; University of Bergamo; Bocconi University,"Bianchi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",milo.bianchi@dauphine.fr; paolo.buonanno@unibg.it; paolo.pinotti@unibocconi.it,"Buonanno, Paolo/O-1949-2019","Buonanno, Paolo/0000-0001-8838-3904",,,,,57,143,155,1,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

I identify the impacts of the program by taking advantage of a discontinuity in the rule determining the eligibility of census tracts for NMTC-subsidized investment. Using this discontinuity,as a source of quasi-experimental variation in commercial development across tracts, I find that subsidized investment has modest positive effects on neighborhood conditions in low-income communities. Though spillovers appear to be small and crowd-out incomplete, the results suggest that some of the observed impacts on neighborhoods are attributable to changes in the composition of residents as opposed to improvements in the welfare of existing residents.

But also for environmental aspects of CSR intrinsic motives provide stronger stimulus than the extrinsic motive.","[Graafland, Johan] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Schouten, Corrie Mazereeuw-Van der Duijn] Tilburg Univ, Dept Philosophy, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Graafland, J (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",j.j.graafland@uvt.nl; cmvdds@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,78,94,3,145,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2012,160,4,,,,,377,396,,10.1007/s10645-012-9198-5,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,018PC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309672700003,0

These alternative estimation approaches, including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences among immigrants on the U.S. labor market, and longitudinal analysis of changes in cognitive skills and in growth rates, leave the stylized fact of a strong impact of cognitive skills unchanged.

The aim of the low carbon society subgroup is to propose frameworks, modeling methodologies, and workable roadmaps that will transform in-situ socioeconomic development to a sustainable low carbon society. This paper overviews LCS modeling studies and presents the LCS modeling frameworks and approaches used by the country modeling teams from Japan, China, India, Korea, and Nepal. The LCS modeling is soft-linked to global targets through regional emission constraints derived from the global stabilization targets. The disaggregated, yet soft-linked, assessments provide opportunities to articulate scenarios that include context-specific inputs, and thereby explicitly consider benefits and deliver more realistic and implementable roadmaps. We find that LCS modeling exercises are still at a relatively early stage in terms of modeling space, and need methodological enhancements. However, this approach offers considerable promise in a world where major emerging economies are undergoing rapid transformation, national and regional interests everywhere still precede global interests, and implementation of the carbon market remains fragmentary. Significant opportunities therefore exist for co-benefits to be gained, opportunities that could be the key drivers of short-term actions vital to the realization of the low carbon transition.

Among hospital discharges in Massachusetts, we find that the reform decreased uninsurance by 36% relative to its initial level and to other states. Reform affected utilization by decreasing length of stay, and the number of inpatient admissions originating from the emergency room.

In this paper we compare structure, data sources and scenario results of four integrated assessment models that are capable of analyzing different aspects of urbanization. The comparison focuses on residential sector energy use and related CO2 emissions based on a set of urbanization scenarios for China and India. Important insights from this model comparison include that (i) total fossil fuel and industrial CO2 emissions at the regional level are not very sensitive to alternative rates of urbanization and are largely dependent on the linkage between urbanization and economic growth via differentiated labor productivity in urban and rural areas, (ii) alternative urbanization pathways may yield different results for the share of solid fuels in residential energy use, thereby affecting the number of people relying on these fuels and the associated adverse health impacts, and (iii) alternative economic growth scenarios can only be assessed for their welfare implications if urban and rural household are distinguished, even though that distinction does not always strongly affect aggregate outcomes which is often due to two effects that compensate each other in total. It can be concluded that urbanization and heterogeneity of households and consumers are clearly relevant for distributional effects and associated health and social impacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Many writers have focused on various issues concerning sprawl, especially on the unintended consequences that new development has had on (among other issues) municipal finances, neighborhood income and residential segregation, and transportation planning. This last one is important since post-World War II development has mostly centered around the automobile in the United States. Over the last decade, a new area in the literature of sprawl has focused on how the built-environment of residential areas can impact health. For example, authors have chronicled how sprawled regions have higher auto vehicle accidents per capita, greater obesity rates, worse carbon emissions (due to greater travel by automobile), and delays in emergency medical service responses. This article adds to the latest set of papers on sprawl by empirically estimating the impact of sprawl in metropolitan regions on fire incidents per capita, firefighter response times, as well as property losses, and deaths due to fire. The results of our exploratory analysis indicate that urban sprawl is an important factor in influencing firefighting issues and outcomes in the United States. Moreover, urban sprawl frequently becomes a factor in delayed response to fires which, in turn, could lead to additional deaths and property loss.","[Lambert, Thomas E.] No Kentucky Univ, Publ Adm, Highland Hts, KY 41099 USA; [Srinivasan, Arun K.] Indiana Univ SE, New Albany, IN 47150 USA; [Katirai, Matin] W Chester Univ Pennsylvania, Chester, PA USA",Northern Kentucky University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Southeast; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); West Chester University of Pennsylvania,"Lambert, TE (通讯作者)，No Kentucky Univ, Publ Adm, Highland Hts, KY 41099 USA.",,"Lambert, Thomas E./ABH-7187-2020","Lambert, Thomas/0000-0003-2453-1407",,,,,47,9,11,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

However, developing and deploying clean electricity technologies is not a cost-free exercise and it will draw resources from other technologies and production sectors. In this paper four mitigation scenarios with identical emissions pathways but with varying degrees of uptake of clean electricity technologies including CCS and emerging renewable energy technologies, are simulated and their welfare implications are analysed using ABARES' Global Trade and Environment Model (GTEM). To capture the range of costs and speeds of developing and deploying clean electricity technologies, technological profiles within electricity and other production sectors are determined endogenously within GTEM allowing a fast growth in one technology at the expense of other technologies. With this induced technology innovation modelling and the specific scenarios, the results presented in this paper suggest that, among Asia's three biggest economies, China may benefit from devoting resources to further developing and deploying CCS and emerging renewable energy technologies while Japan and India may gain from devoting resources to certain conventional clean energy technologies. The modelling results also suggest that coal and gas imports into Asia under the mitigation scenarios will be influenced by, among other things, the size of the carbon price, the extent of fossil fuel dependencies, and, in the case of coal, the relativities of emissions intensities of mining across economies.

Using unique transaction data, we compare tickets on the same airline and route that are purchased on different days of the week, after controlling for the day of week of travel, the ticket restrictions, the demand characteristics of the flights, and the number of days in advance that the ticket is purchased. We find that fares are 5% lower when purchased on the weekend. We conjecture that this is a form of price discrimination. If airlines believe that weekend purchasers are more likely to be price-elastic leisure travelers, then they may offer lower prices on weekends when the mix of purchasing customers makes demand more price elastic. This conjecture is supported by the finding that the weekend purchase effect is distinctly larger on routes with a mixture of both business and leisure customers than on routes that disproportionately serve leisure customers. We illustrate that this pricing practice can have important impacts on airline profits. These results have implications for other industries that have the ability to change prices daily based upon the types of customers who purchase on a specific day. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis covers the period 2010-2050 and is performed by means of a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model (GEM-E3). Four scenarios are investigated: the three standard AME scenarios, and a fourth scenario with a GHG emission reduction path compatible with the 2 degrees C target, reducing global GHG emissions in 2050 by 50%, relative to 2005. The scenarios are compared with the already adopted and announced policies of the respective countries, in the context of the Copenhagen pledges for 2020 and their long-term objectives in 2050. We further discuss the role of energy efficiency measures and zero-carbon power technologies in order to reach the long-term 2 degrees C target. We find that postponing significant emission reductions may not accrue an economic benefit over time whereas it may increase some risks by possibly overstretching the reliance on zero-carbon technologies.

Commercial banking provides the means for a private economy to break away from its financial constraint. Commercial banks are a blend of private/public institutions at the foundation of an economy's payment system, with the accompanying critical externalities. As the economy has moved historically from the prefinancialization era toward a hyperfinancialized economy, there has been a shift away from its traditional role of financing production. The activity of commercial banking has evolved, especially as a result of securitization. Commercial banks are now found at the center of one large profit-making transactions machine that largely denies their original role in the productive sphere. It is their new activities, together with all the associated perverse incentives that this transformation has created, that brought about the financial crisis.

Using climate change mitigation as a starting point for the analysis, we focus on the interaction of climate and energy with technology choice, energy security, energy access, and air pollution, which often have higher policy priority than climate change. Stringent climate policies drive the future energy supply in Asia from being dominated by coal and oil to a more diversified system based mostly on natural gas, coal with CCS, nuclear and renewable energy. The increase in diversity helps to improve the energy security of individual countries and regions. Combining air pollution control policies and universal energy access policies with climate policy can further help to reduce both outdoor and indoor air pollution related health impacts. Investments into the energy system must double by 2030 to achieve stringent climate goals, but are largely offset by lower costs for O&M and air pollution abatement. Strong focus on end-use efficiency also helps lowering overall total costs and allows for limiting or excluding supply side technologies from the mitigation portfolio. Costs of additional energy access policies and measures are a small fraction of total energy system costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The most recent literature reports that, in the post-1978 period, detrended consumption is significantly more volatile than detrended output in China. This indicates the inability to impose consumption smoothing. However, in those previous studies, consumption of durables, which has some features of capital, as discussed in the real business cycle literature, was not separated from private consumption. This paper is the first to estimate consumer durables for China and their service values following the method introduced in Cooley and Prescott (1995). We adjust the consumption measure to make it consistent with the real business cycle literature, and find that consumption of durables is much more volatile than output, but non-durable consumption is less volatile than, and less correlated with, output that provides evidence that supports consumption smoothing in China.

Typically, sabotage is welfare-reducing, but from an individual's perspective an attractive alternative to exerting positive effort. Yet, given its illegal and often immoral nature, sabotage is typically hidden, making it difficult to assess its extent and its victims. Therefore, we use data from Judo World Championships, where a rule change in 2009 basically constituted a natural experiment that introduced one costless opportunity for sabotage. In Judo, competitors can break an opponent's attack in an unsportsmanlike manner; these are seen as acts of sabotage. Based on a unique dataset of 1,422 fights, we find that the rule change in 2009 has led to a large increase in the use of sabotage. Moreover, sabotage is more likely to be employed by relatively less qualified individuals, and to be targeted at more qualified ones. From a survey among spectators, we show that sabotage is welfare reducing.","[Balafoutas, Loukas; Lindner, Florian; Sutter, Matthias] Univ Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Sutter, Matthias] Univ Gothenburg, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Sutter, M (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",loukas.balafoutas@uibk.ac.at; florian.lindner@uibk.ac.at; matthias.sutter@uibk.ac.at,"Balafoutas, Loukas/Q-6025-2018; Sutter, Matthias/R-2018-2018","Balafoutas, Loukas/0000-0002-3477-5096; Sutter, Matthias/0000-0002-6143-8706",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 22772] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),,,28,38,42,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2012,65,4,,,,,425,441,,10.1111/kykl.12000,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,026AT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310241200001,0

Potential asymmetries, due to financial market conditions and monetary policy, lead to the use of a nonlinear threshold error-correction model, with hypothesis tests based on nonstandard bootstrap procedures that take into account the discrete nature of changes in the official rate. The empirical results indicate the presence of substantial asymmetries in both steps of the process, with these asymmetries depending on past changes in the money market rate and whether these are motivated by official rate changes. Generalized impulse response function analysis shows that adjustments differ with regard to the sign and magnitude of interest rate changes in a way that is consistent with conditions in the interbank and mortgage markets over the recent period.

We show that throughout this period, despite evidence of convergence, the racial gap in attainment between blacks and whites has been persistently determined by the initial gap. We obtain these results with 2SLS estimates where slavery is used as an instrument for the initial gap. We address the question of the excludability of slavery by instrumenting it with the share of disembarked slaves from the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Using the same approach we also find that income growth is negatively affected by the initial racial gap in education and that slavery affects growth indirectly through this channel.

The index of industrial production (IIP) is probably the most important and widely analyzed monthly indicator, given the relevance of the manufacturing activity as a driver of the whole business cycle. This paper presents a series of models conceived to forecast the current French monthly IIP, based on regression models and dynamic factor models. The combination of these two approaches allows selecting economically relevant explanatory variables among a large data set. In addition, a rolling forecast study is carried out to assess the forecasting performance of the estimated models, using predictive ability and model confidence set tests. This latter allows getting several models displaying equivalent forecasting performance and therefore gives robustness to the forecasting exercise rather than to base the forecasting analysis only on one model.

Dutch Disease effects might be responsible for this result. This paper examines the relation between aid and its effectiveness in a multi-sector multi-household Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)-framework. Given that international transfers to African countries increasingly take the form of general financial support to the government, different spending strategies and their macroeconomic, sectoral and distributional effects are evaluated in a two-stage simulation making a distinction between immediate direct effects and possible long-run effects from increased productivity. The presence of sector-specific factors weakens Dutch Disease effects and shifts the burden of adjustment primarily to other exporting sectors. While the model simulates the effects of additional aid in Zambia it can be used as a blueprint for other African countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In line with previous experiments we show in a one-shot setting that the allegedly robust false consensus effect disappears if representative information is readily available. But the effect reappears if a small cognitive effort is required to retrieve the information. Most subjects apparently ignore valuable information if it is not handed to them on a silver platter. We conclude that the relevance of the false consensus effect depends on the difficulty of retrieving the information and that the underlying mechanism is an information processing deficiency rather than egocentricity. Moreover, we discuss the potential relevance of our findings for other well-known effects like the winner's curse and overconfidence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, the effectiveness of similar institutions varies dramatically from country to country or even from region to region or from time to time. The differences in the effectiveness of institutions are attributed to the political process (the exercise of leadership in constructing coalitions that give policy legitimacy). Political processes resulting in elite coalitions with narrow interests are not likely to result in rapid growth, whereas elite coalitions where interests are encompassing in nature are likely to create states that are developmental and innovative. Whether elite coalition interests are encompassing or not depends on the extent to which political processes result in the incorporation of the developmental needs of the agricultural sector into the interests of the ruling coalition. This is most likely to occur when an agricultural technology backlog has accumulated over time.

Taking multiple measurements of such outcomes at relatively short intervals allows one to average out noise, increasing power. When the outcomes have low autocorrelation and budget is limited, it can make sense to do no baseline at all. Moreover, I show how for such outcomes, more power can be achieved with multiple follow-ups than allocating the same total sample size over a single follow-up and baseline.

For this purpose, a smooth time-varying cointegrating parameters model is investigated in order to describe smooth mutations of the Swiss gasoline demand. The methodology, based on Chebyshev polynomials, is rigorously outlined. Our empirical finding states that the time-invariance assumption does not hold for long-run price and income elasticities. Furthermore they highlight that gasoline demand passed through some periods of sensitivity and non sensitivity with respect to the price. Our empirical statements are of great importance to assess the performance of a gasoline tax as an instrument for CO2 reduction policy. Indeed, such an instrument can contribute to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases only if the demand is not fully inelastic with respect to the price. Our results suggest that such a carbon-tax would not be always suitable since the price elasticity is found not stable over time and not always significant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The cost of consumption for each household is affected by the domestic price changes, while wage incomes adjust to these price changes in equilibrium. Three rounds of the Indian Employment and Consumption Surveys are used for the analysis. The price transmission mechanisms are estimated for both rural and urban areas to understand the extent to which the trade reforms are able to affect the domestic prices. In order to assess the distributional effects, a series of nonparametric local linear regressions are estimated. The findings show that households at all per capita expenditure levels had experienced gains as a result of the trade liberalization, while the average effect was generally pro-poor and varied significantly across the per capita expenditure spectrum.

This paper is the first to accommodate the perception of global risk in an investigation of the information transmission mechanism between the relationship import demand and its determinants in China. The empirical results show that real imports are cointegrated with domestic economic activity, real effective exchange rate, and the perception of global risk. Domestic income is found to have a significantly positive effect on imports. Contrary to theory, the real effective exchange rate carries negative coefficients, which suggests that a decrease in external competitiveness (appreciation) will decrease the level of imports in the case of China. One of the reasons for this may be the tied anti-dumping duty on some import items. Since the perception of global risk adversely affects China's aggregated imports, policy-makers should consider the degree to which the perception of global risk affects the implementation of trade policies.

Over an infinite horizon, the players anonymously and randomly meet each other and play a binary trust game. In order to provide the investors with proper incentives to follow the contagious strategy, there is a sufficient condition that requires that there exists an outside option for the investors. Moreover, the investors' payoff from the outside option must converge to the payoff from trust and reciprocity as the group size goes to infinity. We show that this sufficient condition is also a necessary condition to sustain any sequential equilibrium in which the trustees adopt the contagious strategy.

We show that, in the 2000s, Eastern European workers who completed their education under communism earned in the 2000s similar returns to their education as did workers belonging to the same age cohorts who studied in Western Europe. This might suggest that education under communism is still as valuable as education attained in Western Europe. However, individuals educated under communism are more likely than their Western counterparts to be unemployed, retired or disabled, and therefore to earn lower or zero returns to their education. Moreover, when we allow the returns to pre- and post-secondary education to differ, we find that senior males who have attained only primary or secondary education under communism are penalized in the post-transition Eastern European labour markets, and that those who have completed post-secondary education under communism enjoy in these markets higher payoffs to their education than similarly educated Western European individuals who are employed in the West.","[Brunello, Giorgio; Crivellaro, Elena; Rocco, Lorenzo] Univ Padua, Dept Econ, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Brunello, G (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",giorgio.brunello@unipd.it; elena.crivellaro@unipd.it; lorenzo.rocco@unipd.it,"Brunello, Giorgio/AAC-2927-2022","Rocco, Lorenzo/0000-0002-4034-3724",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,40,7,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

If the firms are rather unlikely to receive information directly, the central bank should remain silent about its own private information. If, however, firms are sufficiently likely to be informed, it is socially desirable for the central bank to reveal its own private information. By doing so, the central bank eliminates the distortions stemming from the signalling incentives under opacity. An ex ante transparency requirement can improve welfare even if central banks have the possibility to withhold information discretionarily.

Using sectoral data on Korean manufacturing during the period from 1967 to 1993, this study finds that the effect of trade protection by tariff tends to show up not in terms of total factor productivity but in terms of revealed comparative advantage and export shares of sectors. Such an effect tends to be greater in consumer goods, which are the main targets of promotion by higher tariffs.

This led to a world glut of savings and was responsible for low world interest rates and the cheap credit in, especially, the United States. Although the Asian countries had little exposure to the subprime assets, they did not escape the downturn because their export markets in the advanced countries collapsed. The rebound was rapid, taking a V-shaped path. This paper examines these issues for China and discusses whether it precipitated the 2007 financial crisis through its trade surplus.

A credit crisis would be manifested as a shortage of liquidity, but the real cause would be bank credit risk, which would infect simultaneously the interbank, repo, and certificates of deposits markets. It would then infect the credit default swaps market and money market funds markets. In the past, the risk of a run on the banks was triggered by a purely random event, but nowadays the risk of a run on the entire financial system (whether traditional or shadow) has become systemic. This change in the nature of the risk is due to the excess liquidity in the world financial system. The more excessive the liquidity is, the higher the is probability that the risk will turn out to be systemic. The possibility that a Greek credit event can trigger a Lehman Brothers type of incident in the world financial system is high because the euro zone is not an optimum currency area and because EU policymakers treat it as an illiquidity rather than insolvency problem, which requires capital transfers. Despite this predicament, the losses of financial institutions are likely to be smaller than those triggered by Lehman Brothers because the risk appetite for risky assets is small and the degree of asset leverage is low, around 20 times equity capital, compared with 55 at the time of the Lehman Brothers collapse.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,32,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

However, the fundamental methodological gist of his critique remains as pertinent to mainstream economics as it was when originally formulated.

Unlike standard regression approaches, this approach allows us to identify specific distributional characteristics such as polarisation and stratification. The period between 1965 to 1997 exhibits the formation of two convergence clubs: one at 50% and the other at 125% of the national average income. Income disparities across the states declined over the 1960s and then increased from the 1970s to the 1990s. I use the distribution dynamics method to further investigate a neighbours' effect, i.e., whether states that cluster together are neighbouring states. The evidence obtained suggests that there is none.

We test whether the models are capable of replicating the aggregate distribution of behavior, as well as correctly predicting individuals' round-by-round behavior. Our results are two-fold: while the simulations with impulse-matching and action-sampling learning successfully replicate the experimental data on the aggregate level, individual behavior is best described by self-tuning EWA. Nevertheless, impulse-matching learning has the second-highest score for the individual data. In addition, only self-tuning EWA and impulse-matching learning lead to better round-by-round predictions than the aggregate frequencies, which means they adjust their predictions correctly over time.

It is found that a stricter thin capitalisation rule will reduce the incentive to invest, and is therefore harmful to growth. This effect is ignored in previous static studies on the welfare analysis of tax havens. Accordingly, when taking the growth effect into consideration, reducing the utilisation of tax havens has ambiguous effects on social welfare. We also show that a looser thin capitalisation rule could be favourable for the policymakers if (i) the production technology is high; (ii) the existing income tax rate is high; (iii) the rate of time preference is low; or (iv) the weight factor of public consumption in utility is small.","Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 116, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Chu, H (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, 64,SEC 2,Tz Nan Rd, Taipei 116, Taiwan.",hchu@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,18,1,1,1,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

It is found that the traditional simple Keynesian models such as IS-LM and Mundell-Fleming actually come to very similar conclusions on the effectiveness of fiscal policy as the most complex DSGE models, and are very much in line with stylized empirical facts found in most recent studies. In contrast, the dynamic models used during most of the 1990s and 2000s perform very poorly.

Evidence from a field experiment,EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Altruism; Cues; Reputation; Field Experiment,SOCIAL PREFERENCES; ANONYMITY; CUES; ALTRUISM; BEHAVIOR,"The presence of implicit observation cues, such as picture of eyes, has been shown to increase generosity in dictator games, and cooperative behavior in field settings. I combine these approaches, by testing if a picture of watching eyes affects unconditional giving in a natural environment, where the recipient is a charity organization. Taken together, this study reduces the influence of three potential confounding factors in previous experiments: (i) experimenter demand effects, (ii) that the facial cue reminds subjects of a human counterpart, and (iii) a social multiplier effect. Specifically, the paper reports results from an experiment, conducted in a Swedish supermarket chain, where customers face a naturally occurring decision problem. People who recycle cans and bottles have to choose whether to keep the recycled amount or donate it to a charity organization. By posting a picture of human eyes on recycling machines, I am able to test whether this causes an increase in donations to the charity. Based on a sample covering a 12-day period, 38 stores and 16775 individual choices, I find no general effect. However, when controlling for store and day fixed effects, and using a proxy for store attendance, the picture of eyes increased donated amount by 30 percent during days when relatively few other people visited the store. This result gives further support to the conclusion that subtle social cues can invoke reputation concerns in humans, although the relatively small effect suggests that previous estimates could be biased upward, or at least that the influence of observational cues is context dependent.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Ekström, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",mathias.ekstrom@ne.su.se,,,,,,,29,106,116,3,156,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The potential cross-effects among these variables are also tested. The author concludes that while sector-specific factors, changes in the ownership structure, and the accumulation of human capital explain a large fraction of the observed downward trend in the labor share, labor market characteristics, market structures, and firm demographics are robust correlates of labor share changes at high frequency.","[Growiec, Jakub] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,,,"Growiec, Jakub/AAB-8623-2019","Growiec, Jakub/0000-0003-2222-1691",,,,,20,10,11,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

However, stock price changes in Germany, the UK and the US were found to lead oil price changes. As for the interaction between oil price changes and sector stock price changes, we find short-run negative causal relationships: 4 of 7 sector index returns were impacted by oil price changes in Germany, 2 in the US and 1 in France. In particular, stock returns of information technology and consumer staples sectors were found to be impacted most by oil price shocks, followed by financial, utilities and transportation sectors. In terms of causality from sector stock price changes to oil price changes, we find stock price changes lead oil price changes in 8 of 9 sectors in Germany, most in the G7 countries followed by the UK, Italy, France, Canada and the US. No such a causal relationship, however, is found for Japan. With respect to specific sectors, stock price changes in consumer staples and materials sectors were impacted most significantly by oil price changes followed by transportation, financial, energy, health care, industrials, utilities. information technology and telecommunication sectors with the exception of consumer discretionary sector. In addition, short term stock price changes are found to lead positively oil price changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In order to identify the latent historical jumps for each of these energy futures, we use a Bayesian MCMC approach to estimate a jump-diffusion model for each. We examine the simultaneous jump intensities of pairs of energy futures and the probabilities that jumps in crude oil (and natural gas) cause jumps or usually large returns in other energy futures. In all cases, we find significant evidence that the diffusion-jump process is a better characterization for energy futures prices.

A delicate resulting contracting decision thus is how to allocate control. This paper considers the incumbent's problem to design a research contract that specifies: the allocation of control; the unit's research input, and its monetary compensation. Contracting is complicated by the unit's private information about its technological skills; research outputs also are not verifiable. Control affects the distribution of the private benefits from research and can be shared. From a complete contract perspective, an allocation of control that is contingent on the unit's reported information provides the incumbent an additional instrument for designing the incentives. Control can generate countervailing incentives and mitigate the limitations of contracts in research environments, to the point of extracting the full surplus. The analysis further clarifies when control is centralized by the incumbent, when it is shared between the parties, and when it is delegated to the unit. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicate that unidirectional causality runs from agriculture machinery to carbon emissions but not vice versa. Agricultural technologies are closely associated with economic growth and carbon emissions in Pakistan. Variance decomposition analysis shows that among all the agricultural technologies, granting subsidies to the agriculture sector have exerts the largest contribution to changes in carbon emissions. Conversely, agricultural irrigated land seems relatively the least contributors on changes in carbon emissions due to infertility of total irrigated land available in Pakistan. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The central government has tried to use various policies to promote urbanization. In this paper, we evaluate one of these policies - count-to-city upgrading. Under China's hierarchical governance structure, a city status can only be determined and awarded by the central government. In the 1980s and 1990s, China adopted a formula-based county-to-city upgrading policy. Based on a large panel dataset covering all counties in China, we find that the formula was not strictly enforced in the practice. Moreover, jurisdictions that were upgraded to cities prior to 1998 do not perform better than their counterparts that remained county status in terms of both economic growth and providing public services. Largely because of these problems, this policy was called off in 1997. Given the strong need for urbanization, more indigenous institutional innovations are needed to find a viable way of creating cities, which would also provide compatible incentives to local governments.

The study presents a theory of educational production that emphasizes teachers' occupational choices. A key assumption is that talented agents have a comparative advantage in learning. The model endogenously generates a teachers sector with intermediate abilities between two types of skilled workers with tertiary education: highly skilled workers and vocational workers. This unique feature helps specify which technological changes may lead to quality-quantity trade-offs. In particular, a crucial element is that the ratio of incomes and thus the income inequality rises within the skilled sector. In this case, the most talented teachers depart from the teachers sector to join the highly skilled sector, and as such, teacher quality declines. In other cases, both teacher quality and teacher quantity may increase. The results are consistent with the observed patterns of technology, educational attainment, educational expenditure, and wage inequality in advanced economies. Finally, another potential cause for the quality-quantity trade-off is a reduction in teacher certification requirement unless the reduction is implemented exclusively on high-ability workers.

The setting is one in which network users can benefit from acting strategically, and are better informed than the network operator about demand growth. We find that the regulatory holiday creates an incentive to underinvest relative to optimal levels.

To identify the effects of the program on infant survival rates, the paper exploits exogenous variation in the timing of program implementation across municipalities. Using data for all Danish towns, I find a significant and positive effect on infant survival rates of around 0.5-0.8% or around 5-8 lives saved per 1000 live births at the mean infant survival rate for the period. The program was effective in the great majority of relatively small Danish towns of the time, where the treatment constituted the first large-scale and publicly funded initiative to combat infant mortality. My main finding is robust to the inclusion of town-specific time trends, the control for time-varying socio-economic town characteristics, and the omission of towns with potentially confounding efforts to fight infant mortality. Using complementary data at higher levels of aggregation. I find some indication for the program contributing to the decrease of mortality from acute enteritis, a major cause of infant death at the time. This finding suggests that an important mechanism behind the program's effect was the nurses' promotion of breastfeeding and proper infant nutrition. Finally, a stylized analysis of the costs of the home visiting program shows that they were modest when compared to estimates from similar contexts, namely, home visiting in the U.S. and clean water supply. Future research should use comprehensive Danish register data to examine potential long-run returns to home visiting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the article suggests a methodology to disentangle export structure and sectoral energy efficiency effects, presenting results according to technological categories. The article concludes that Brazil, India and, mostly, China, present a high energy content in manufacturing exports, which has increased from 1995 to 2005. Conversely, many advanced economies, notably in Europe and North America, which showed energy contents below the world average in 1995, reinforced their position as exporters with relatively lower energy usage. The contribution of export structure and energy efficiency effects to explain differences in the energy content of exports draws attention to the situation of China. This country increased its relative energy usage in the exports of all technological categories of goods. This effect was reinforced by the stronger export specialization in high-tech products and hindered by a comparatively lower specialization in medium-high-tech products. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Results show that increases in the primary balances are the main source of debt reduction. Expenditure-based fiscal adjustments are key for reducing the length of debt consolidation spells, including in the aftermath of financial crises. Political fragmentation and the proximity of elections make debt sustainability more difficult to achieve, while structural reforms that help spur growth decrease the duration of debt reduction. In contrast to previous findings, however, we show that when adjustment needs are large as in many advanced economies today fiscal consolidations that rely also on revenue-enhancing measures are more likely to accelerate debt reduction. We label it as the Rebalancing Adjustment Effect. This result is particularly strong when countries experience a financial crisis. ?

We first show in an extended human capital investment model that life expectancy growth acts as a driving force for educational investment. We then build a difference-in-difference-in-differences empirical framework and use cross-province data to examine the effect in China. We use the maternal mortality rate (MMR) to identify the difference in life expectancy between genders, and the illiteracy rate or average years of education by gender for educational investment. The empirical results comply with the theory, in that increases in life expectancy significantly lower illiteracy rates and improve the average schooling years in China.

They need to cooperate in designing the architecture to ensure regional as well as global freer trade and investment and more stable finance, and to play more active roles in future global governance and rulemaking.","[Zhang, Yunling; Shen, Minghui] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Zhang, YL (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ylzhang@cass.org.cn; shenmh@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,27,4,5,3,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2012,20,4,,,,,92,107,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01297.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,981VY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307001700006,0

The use of several invariance notions allows for the exploration of concentration from different angles, which adds robustness to the results, as illustrated by using manufacturing employment data from Spain.","[Alonso-Villar, Olga] Univ Vigo, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac CC Econ, Vigo 36310, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Alonso-Villar, O (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac CC Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Spain.",ovillar@uvigo.es; crio@uvigo.es,"del Rio, Coral/M-5560-2019; Alonso-Villar, Olga/K-4348-2014","del Rio, Coral/0000-0002-3173-3624; Alonso-Villar, Olga/0000-0002-7355-0279",,,,,34,2,2,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1742-1772,,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

How can such labour markets cope with the consequences of the Great Recession? This paper takes a closer look at this question considering the case of Denmark. It is found that employment adjustment is not particularly large in international comparison, but a larger burden of adjustment is along the extensive (number of employees) rather than the intensive (hours) margin. The level of job creation is high, and remains so despite the crisis, although job creation is pro-cyclical and job-separation counter-cyclical. As a consequence most unemployment spells remain short. Comparative evidence does not suggest that flexicurity markets are more prone to persistence. Crucial for this is the design of the social safety net and in particular the active labour market policy. However, it is a challenge to maintain the efficiency of the activation system in a period with high unemployment.","[Andersen, Torben M.] IZA, Aarhus, Denmark; [Andersen, Torben M.] Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, CEPR, CESifo, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Andersen, TM (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, CEPR, CESifo, Aarhus, Denmark.",tandersen@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,34,23,25,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2012,160,2,,,SI,,117,140,,10.1007/s10645-011-9181-6,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,935RB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303536700003,0

Particularly, we explore the differential access to employment and the earning gap faced by this group, considering the interaction between two potential sources of disadvantage for migrant women: gender and migrant condition. Our findings suggest that migrant women do face this double disadvantage. In both cases, we find an economically significant gap, at least for migrants from developing countries. Regarding the former, the larger unemployment rate of female migrants is not explained by observable characteristics. In the case of earnings differential, although human capital endowments play a relevant role, both the unexplained earnings penalty associated with gender and migrant status slightly rise across the distribution of wages.","[Anton, Jose-Ignacio; Munoz de Bustillo, Rafael; Carrera, Miguel] Univ Salamanca, Dept Appl Econ, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Anton, Jose-Ignacio; Munoz de Bustillo, Rafael; Carrera, Miguel] Univ Salamanca, Inst Iberoamer, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain",University of Salamanca; University of Salamanca,"Antón, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Dept Appl Econ, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.",janton@usal.es,"Carrera Troyano, Miguel/L-5989-2014; Antón, José-Ignacio/L-6469-2014","Carrera Troyano, Miguel/0000-0002-5016-5482; Antón, José-Ignacio/0000-0001-9623-3121",,,,,68,7,8,2,45,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

While the first form of interaction involves the stocks of the two capital-goods and takes place within the final output sector through the specification of the aggregate production function (Cobb-Douglas vs. CES), the second one concerns the rates of investment in the two kinds of capital. The share of productive public expenditure devoted to output production can be either exogenous or endogenous. Our results suggest that when this share is exogenous, along the balanced growth path the optimal growth rate of the economy is a positive function of the degree of complementarity between the two forms of investment. When the share of productive public expenditure devoted to output production is endogenous, the public capital share in GDP becomes, along with the model's preference parameters, an important determinant of the economy's long run growth. We also find that the optimal growth rate is an increasing function of the elasticity of substitution between public and private capital inputs in goods production, and is independent of the complementarity/substitutability between the two forms of investment.","[Bucci, Alberto; Del Bo, Chiara] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Business & Stat DEAS, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Bucci, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Business & Stat DEAS, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",alberto.bucci@unimi.it,,,,,,,40,6,7,1,22,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

This literature is still young, and in this paper, we will mostly draw on experimental work (mainly in the laboratory) that has compared individual decision-making to group decision-making, and to individual decision-making in situations with salient group membership. The bottom line emerging from economic research on group decision-making is that groups are more likely to make choices that follow standard game-theoretic predictions, while individuals are more likely to be influenced by biases, cognitive limitations, and social considerations. In this sense, groups are generally less behavioral than individuals. An immediate implication of this result is that individual decisions in isolation cannot necessarily be assumed to be good predictors of the decisions made by groups. More broadly, the evidence casts doubts on traditional approaches that model economic behavior as if individuals were making decisions in isolation.","[Charness, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Sutter, Matthias] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Sutter, Matthias] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Innsbruck; University of Gothenburg,"Charness, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",charness@econ.ucsb.edu; matthias.sutter@uibk.ac.at,"Charness, Gary/JVP-0357-2024; Sutter, Matthias/R-2018-2018","Sutter, Matthias/0000-0002-6143-8706",,,,,42,195,211,6,45,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In our experiments, we create the situation whereby individuals face an uncertain economic payback due to Theoi and we allow participants to sacrifice towards this entity. Aggregate sacrifices amongst participants are over 30 per cent of all takings, increase with the level of humanistic labelling of Theoi and decrease when participants share information or when the level of uncertainty is lower.

The problem has attracted many scholars, and many views. In this article, I describe the problem through the lens of a nutritionist, using a robust conceptual framework, and linking perspectives from the biological and social sciences. Child nutrition is an outcome of immediate factors such as food and nutrient intake and illness, which in turn are influenced by underlying factors such as household food security and poverty, women's status and access to health, nutrition, and social services. These factors, in turn, are a product of basic societal factors such as institutions, governance, politics, and culture. Using data from South Asia, and linking to the literature, this article provides an overview of the nutrition problem in this region of the world and raises questions for further research and policy and program action.

The empirical application shows that India's growth transition in 1980 entailed a shift out of a suboptimal demand regime (1953-78) into an optimal demand regime (1980-2007). A key insight from the causality results is that the fiscal expansion of the 1980s initiated demand growth at the natural rate, while faster export growth in the post-1990 liberalization period relaxed the open economy solvency constraint on demand and played a crucial role in sustaining demand growth at its maximum potential rate.","Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Nell, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,,"Nell, Kevin/0000-0001-9243-476X",,,,,44,3,4,0,9,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Furthermore, given the characteristics of the sample of countries chosen, we highlight not only the importance of a more open, competitive and therefore active financial sector in channelling financial resources to entrepreneurs, but also the relevance of macroeconomic stability (in terms of low inflation rates), and all the institutional framework that it encompasses (central bank independence and fiscal responsibility laws), structural reforms which were implemented in the 1990s. as necessary pre-conditions for financial development, and consequently for sustained growth and prosperity in the region.

Yet, it has subsequently quite closely followed the USD, although having appreciated gradually by 7.7 per cent up to the time of writing. The details of the composition of the basket have not been announced. Despite having appreciated against the USD, the RMB became first significantly weaker against a broad trade-weighted basket, and the EUR and the JPY, and this situation held until September 2011. China has announced at international forums that the RMB exchange rate regime will be reformed further. We discuss here what a transparent basket peg could mean for China. To reduce the overall volatility of the RMB exchange rate, the weight for the EUR should be significantly increased, with the special drawing right basket being one option for practical implementation. This would also have a positive impact on the EU. China's currency reform has possible implications for its USD-dominated asset holdings. Reducing them could trigger a further depreciation of the USD. The potentially costly consequences call for new rules for the global financial architecture. However, China's economic expansion will inevitably lead to a diminishing international role for the USD.","Univ Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Oksanen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,,"Oksanen, Heikki/0000-0001-7242-744X",,,,,34,2,2,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Bad is defined as news touching on the following issues: human rights, Tibet, child labor, democracy, and repression. Using this bad news index, this paper documents a peculiar finding: 34 months after a trade deficit shock to the USChina bilateral trade balance, the frequency of bad news published about China by US media outlets rises sharply, then dies off slowly. Statistical analysis reveals that the likelihood that this finding is just a coincidence is relatively smallabout 1%. In addition, this paper finds a robust association between the annual number of Congressional hearings on China and the USChina bilateral trade deficit.

It turns out that the availability of historical data has a dominant impact on expectations and wipes out the influence of outside-lab information completely.

Elections introduce a dynamic element - the incumbent board's willingness to hire a candidate depends on how the candidate will vote in future hiring rounds. Lack of a commitment mechanism means directors do not always choose board compositions that maximize shareholder value. I use the model to analytically and numerically investigate the effects of stock exchange rules governing board composition and director elections.

This paper provides new evidence on the effects of overseas FDI on the skill-mix of multinational firms home-country operations. The analysis exploits China's WTO accession to identify the impact of outward investment into a low-wage economy and uses plant-level data to investigate changes in industrial structure within firms driven by plant closures. As predicted by models of vertical FDI, the paper demonstrates that overseas investment in low-wage economies is associated with asymmetric effects on workers in low- and high-skill industries in the home economy and, in particular, with firms closing down plants in low-skill industries.

COOPER; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS; DEA; OUTPUTS; ENERGY; MODELS,"Environmental assessment recently becomes a major policy issue all over the world. This study discusses how to use Data Environment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment for planning corporate strategy and international competitiveness. An important feature of DEA environmental assessment is that it classifies outputs into desirable (good) and undesirable (bad) outputs because all private and public entities produce not only desirable outputs but also undesirable outputs as a result of their production activities. This study proposes the two types of output unification for DEA environmental assessment by using a non-radial model. One of the two output unifications is that it considers a decrease in an input vector along with a decrease in the vector of undesirable outputs. This type of unification is referred to as natural disposability. The other unification considers an increase in an input vector but a decrease in the vector of undesirable outputs. This type of strategy is referred to as managerial disposability. Both unifications increase the vector of desirable outputs. After developing the two concepts on disposability, this study theoretically explores how to measure Returns to Scale (RTS) under natural disposability and Damages to Scale (DTS) under managerial disposability. To document the practicality of the proposed approach, this study applies it to compare the performance of national oil firms with that of international oil companies. This study identifies four important findings on the petroleum industry. First, national oil companies outperform international oil companies in the unified efficiency under natural disposability. Second, international oil companies outperform national oil companies in the unified efficiency under managerial disposability. Third, national oil firms exhibit a mixed result on RTS, while international oil firms exhibit decreasing RTS. Finally, both national and international oil companies exhibit increasing DTS, implying that all oil firms need to decrease their operational sizes for improving their environmental performance on CO2 emission. As an alternative strategy, the result suggests that they need to introduce technology innovation (e.g. clean air technology) into their business operations. The technology based strategy has more practicality than the size reduction in their operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the extent to which inflation in Vietnam is due to its conduct of monetary policy. It is argued that, had the central bank implemented policy on a more timely basis, inflation would not have been as high as it was, but the more fundamental problem is that the central bank does not have the tools it needs to conduct monetary policy effectively. Monetary policy is further complicated by Vietnam's exchange rate policy. By choosing to peg the currency and maintain fairly free capital mobility, the country has all but given up the ability to pursue an independent monetary policy. As a consequence, the central bank is forced to attempt to sterilise its foreign exchange interventions, which it is ill-equipped to do. The paper argues that financial sector liberalisation is needed not only to promote growth but also to maintain macroeconomic stability.","[Thi Thu Tra Pham] Vietnam Natl Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Riedel, James] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC USA",Vietnam National University Hanoi; Johns Hopkins University,,,,"Pham, Thi Thu Tra/0000-0001-7052-3323",,,,,0,11,12,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Two-stage least squares estimates are derived using a lagged measure of health-insurer concentration as an instrument. Results suggest that health insurers exercise market power on the seller side of the health insurance marketplace, but the restriction of output is limited to the individually purchased insurance market segment.","[Santerre, Rexford E.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Bates, Laurie J.] Bryant Univ, Dept Econ, Smithfield, RI 02917 USA; [Hilliard, James I.] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University of Connecticut; Bryant University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Santerre, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Dept Finance, 2100 Hillside Rd,Unit 1041, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",lbates@bryant.edu; jih@terry.uga.edu; rsanterre@business.uconn.edu,"Hilliard, James I/A-9226-2013",,,,,,34,11,15,0,7,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We argue that the fact that prices can score worse or better than consensus opinion in predicting the fundamentals is a product of endogenous short-term speculation. For a given positive level of residual pay-off uncertainty, if liquidity trades display low persistence, rational investors act like market makers and accommodate the order flow and prices are farther away from fundamentals compared to consensus. This defines a Keynesian region; the complementary region is Hayekian in that rational investors chase the trend and prices are systematically closer to fundamentals than average expectations. The standard case of no residual uncertainty and liquidity trading following a random walk is on the frontier of the two regions and identifies the set of deep parameters for which rational investors abide by Keynes' dictum of concentrating on an asset long-term prospects and those only. The analysis also explains momentum and reversal in stock returns and how accommodation and trend-chasing strategies differ from these phenomena.","[Cespa, Giovanni] Cass Business Sch, London, England",City University London,"Cespa, G (通讯作者)，Cass Business Sch, London, England.",,"Vives, Xavier/B-1597-2013","Vives, Xavier/0000-0001-9110-9850; Cespa, Giovanni/0000-0003-2466-6168",ESRC [ES/J00250X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J00250X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,37,49,49,3,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In this paper, an enforcement-proof incentive contract is developed in which a buyer demands a guaranteed delivery of a good or service given a productive upfront payment, moral hazard in precaution, and the potential for opportunistic contract breach. Investing in a contract upfront is found to be restricted by moral hazard and opportunistic contract breach. This limits the size of investment up to a specific level even if an infinite scale-up of production were beneficial. A more severe moral hazard problem results in a smaller distortion. The framework is applied and extended to international carbon sequestration contracts.

Vulnerability is measured by the availability of wealth to smooth consumption in a multidimensional approach to poverty, which allows us to identify three groups of households: the twice-poor group, which includes income-poor households who lack an adequate stock of wealth; the group of protected-poor households, which are all those income-poor families with a buffer stock of wealth they can rely on; and the vulnerable-non-poor group, including households above the income-poverty line that do not hold any stock of wealth. Interestingly, the risk of belonging to these groups changes over the life-cycle in both countries while the size of the groups differs significantly between Spain and the U.S., although this result is quite sensitive to whether the housing wealth component is included in the wealth measure or not.","[Azpitarte, Francisco] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Azpitarte, Francisco] Brotherhood St Laurence, Fitzroy, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Azpitarte, F (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",fraz@unimelb.edu.au,"Azpitarte, Francisco/F-2170-2016","Azpitarte, Francisco/0000-0002-2688-6933",,,,,41,31,34,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In this paper we introduce uncertainty in a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model and characterize the equilibrium of a small open economy in such an environment. We show that, when trade is balanced period-by-period, the per capita output and consumption of a small open economy converge to an invariant distribution that is independent of the initial wealth. Further, at the invariant distribution, there are periods in which the small economy diversifies. Numerical simulations show that the speed of convergence increases with the size of the shocks. In the limit, when there is no uncertainty, there is no convergence and countries may specialize permanently. The paper highlights the role of market incompleteness, as a result of the period-by-period trade balance, in this setup. Through an analytical example we also illustrate the importance of country specific risk in delivering our results.

By the 1990s, geopolitical changes turned central Asia and the Caucasus into new destinations that, for Turkish migrants, associate economic ambitions, the rediscovery of Turkic communities and political strategies. Nowadays, the Turkish presence in central Asia is closely related to the activities both of the construction industry, which has carved out a place in the Arab-Muslim world, and of small investors in, for example, trade, the restaurant business and education. This immigration with its varied forms is a factor in the development and diversification of the relations between central Asia and Turkey.

For that purpose, we employ the recently developed panel stationarity test of Carrion-i-Silvestre, Del Barrio-Castro and Lopez-Bazo (2005), which assumes a highly flexible trend function by incorporating an unknown number of structural breaks. In addition, the issues of cross-sectional dependence as well as control for finite-sample bias are accommodated through bootstrap methods. Overall, for the US case, our analysis provides strong evidence in support of the hypothesis of inter-state inequality convergence. Moreover, the results are robust to alternative inequality measures applied, different notions of stochastic convergence defined, and alternative panel stationary test employed.

When the matrix Gamma that relates bidders' payoffs to their payments is nonsingular, the payment-related component in the design objective must equal a unique linear combination of its counterparts in bidder's payoffs. If all multipliers of the linear combination are nonnegative, a modified Myerson procedure is discovered for deriving the optimal design. If any multiplier is negative, an arbitrarily high value can be achieved for design objective by setting proper fixed transfers to bidders. When the matrix Gamma is singular, the unbounded optimum result typically prevails. We applied our method to auctions with cross shareholdings and charity auctions for revenue-maximizing and efficient designs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Firms face uncertain demands that are only realized after the firm enters the destination. The model retools the timing, of the resolution of uncertainty found in models with heterogeneity of firm productivity. This retooling addresses several shortcomings. First, the imperfect correlation of demands reconciles the sales variation observed in and across destinations. Second, since demands for the firm's output are correlated across destinations, a firm can use previously realized demands to forecast unknown demands in untested destinations. The option to forecast demands causes firms to delay exporting in order to gather more information about foreign demand. Third, since uncertainty is resolved after entry, many firms enter a destination and then exit after learning that they cannot profit. This prediction reconciles the high rate of exit seen in the first years of exporting. Finally, when faced with multiple destinations to which they can export, many firms will choose to sequentially export in, order to slowly learn more about its chances for success in untested markets.

J,"Radlo, MJ",,,,"Radlo, Mariusz-Jan",,,Emerging Multinationals and Outward FDI Development The Case of Poland,EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INVESTMENT; INTERNATIONALIZATION; CYCLE,"The aim of this paper is to shed light on the Polish outward foreign direct investments (OFDIs) with special attention on the growing interest of many Polish companies to expand abroad utilizing equity-based modes of entry. The paper shows that the increase of Polish OFDI in recent years reflects the growing ability and willingness of Polish companies to expand mainly to European markets. It is also observed that the emerging Polish multinationals primarily expand to regional markets of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe as well as Germany. The major motivation for the expansion was to increase market power and access to the market. The current economic crisis resulted in a deceleration of OFDI flows. However, in the case of Polish companies, the deceleration is not as high as one might expect and in 2008 and 2009, Polish companies made a relatively high number of cross-border deals. The paper also analyzes three cases of companies built from scratch in the transition period that now belong to the group of emerging Polish multinationals. When analyzing these cases, it can be seen that there were two stages in their development: during the first stage (approximately one decade), these companies focused on the development of their position in their home market; after they acquired a relatively strong position in the home market, they decided to expand abroad. Their first choice when expanding abroad was to build a strong position in regional markets of the Central and East European countries.","[Radlo, Mariusz-Jan] Warsaw Sch Econ, World Econ Res Inst, Warsaw, Poland; [Radlo, Mariusz-Jan] SEENDICO, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Radlo, MJ (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, World Econ Res Inst, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Radlo, Mariusz-Jan/K-5930-2012","Radlo, Mariusz-Jan/0000-0001-7756-1613",,,,,19,10,11,0,24,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The non-parametric estimates using parental education as a measure of circumstances reveal that the opportunity share of earnings inequality in 200405 was 1119 percent for urban India and 58 percent for rural India. The same figures for consumption expenditure inequality are 1019 percent for urban India and 59 percent for rural India. The overall opportunity share estimates (parametric) of earnings inequality due to circumstances, including caste, religion, region, parental education, and parental occupation, vary from 18 to 26 percent for urban India, and from 16 to 21 percent for rural India. The overall opportunity share estimates for consumption expenditure inequality are close to the earnings inequality figures for both urban and rural areas. The analysis further finds evidence that the parental education specific opportunity share of overall earnings (and consumption expenditure) inequality is largest in urban India, but caste and geographical region also play an equally important role when rural India is considered.","Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India",,"Singh, A (通讯作者)，Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",aashish.igidr@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,42,47,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Policies for hydropower dams maintain multiple services beyond electric generation, including environmental protection, flood control and recreation. We model the decision of a hydroelectric generator to shift some of its power production capacity away from the day-ahead energy market into a wind-following service to smooth the intermittent production of wind turbines. Offering such a service imposes both private and social opportunity costs. Since fluctuations in wind energy output are not perfectly correlated with day-ahead energy prices, a wind-following service will necessarily affect generator revenues. Seasonal wind patterns produce conflicts with the goal of managing rivers for ecosystem servicesaEurothe maintenance or enhancement of downstream ecosystems. We illustrate our decision model using the Kerr Dam in PJM's territory in North Carolina. We simulate the operation of Kerr Dam over a three-year period that features hydrologic variability from normal water years to extreme drought conditions. We use an optimization framework to estimate reservation prices for Kerr Dam offering wind-following services in the PJM market. Wind-following may be profitable for Kerr Dam at low capacity levels during some time periods if ecosystems services are neglected and if side payments, or reserves-type payments, are provided. Wind-following with ecosystem services yields revenue losses that typically cannot be recovered with reserves market payments. Water release patterns are inconsistent with ecosystem-services goals when Kerr Dam dedicates significant capacity to wind-following, particularly in drought years.","[Fernandez, Alisha; Blumsack, Seth] Penn State Univ, Leone Family Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Reed, Patrick] Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Blumsack, S (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Leone Family Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, 124 Hosler Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",pennahops@gmail.com; blumsack@psu.edu,"Reed, Patrick/E-4435-2014","Reed, Patrick/0000-0002-7963-6102; Blumsack, Seth/0000-0002-1979-3659",,,,,31,6,10,1,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Contrary to popular belief, it is established that agency issues are not a serious problem with securitisation. Instead, managerial behavioural biases are shown to be most problematic.

We investigate the role that incomplete information with respect to the intrinsic moral cost of one's potential corruption partner plays out in his or her propensity to engage in bribery, and, consequently, the equilibrium level of corruption in the society. We assume that the cost of engaging in corruption is subject to strategic complementarities, which may lead to multiple corruption equilibria. We find that corruption is lowest when potential bribers and potential bribees are uncertain regarding each other's corruptibility and have asymmetric bargaining powers. Our uncertainty result provides theoretical support in favor of anti-corruption strategies, such as staff rotation in public offices, aimed at decreasing the social closeness of bribers and bribees. Our bargaining power result suggests that, under uncertainty, monopolistic public good provision has the same corruption-reducing effect as competitive public good provision. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The Constitution and acts of the First Congress of the United States in August 1790 gave Congress authority to raise enough revenues to service a big government debt. In 1790, the Congress carried out a comprehensive bailout of state governments' debts, part of a grand bargain that made creditors of the states become advocates of ample federal taxes.

The worker can be hired as an internal agent, or an external agent under a contract. These two organizational modes correspond to in-house production and outsourcing, respectively. In each case, the agent earns experience benefits: future monetary returns from managing production, reputation, and enjoyment. The principal would like to extract experience benefits, and can do so when production is outsourced. However, the external agent earns information rent from private information about production costs. The principal cannot fully extract experience benefits when production is in-house because the internal agent must be provided with a minimum income, although the principal has full information on production costs. Our theory proposes a new trade-off, one between information rent under outsourcing and experience rent under in-house production. The principal chooses outsourcing when experience benefits are high, but her organizational choice may be socially inefficient.","[Alger, Ingela] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Alger, Ingela] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Ma, Ching-to Albert] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Renault, Regis] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Cergy Pontoise, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Carleton University; Boston University; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Alger, I (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",ingela.alger@tse-fr.eu; ma@bu.edu; regis.renault@u-cergy.fr,,"Alger, Ingela/0000-0003-2436-512X",,,,,33,0,0,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The model emphasizes a few labor-market frictions and shocks to monetary policy and technology. The model, estimated from U.S. quarterly postwar data, accounts well for important differences in the serial correlation of the growth rates of aggregate quantities, the size of aggregate fluctuations and key comovements, including the correlation between hours and labor productivity. Despite its simplicity, the model offers an answer to the persistence problem (Chari et al., 2000) that does not rely on multiple frictions and adjustment lags or ad hoc backward-looking components. We conclude modern DSGE models need not embed large batteries of frictions and shocks to account for the salient features of postwar business cycles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The first fallacy derives from the false diagnosis that the present crisis is the outcome of lax public spending policy, when it is actually the outcome of a private credit-led speculative boom. The second fallacy assumes the possibility or even the generality of the so-called 'expansionary fiscal contractions': this neglects the short-term negative effects on domestic demand and overestimates the generality of Ricardian equivalence, the importance of 'crowd in' effects related to lower interest rates and the positive impact on trade balances. The third fallacy 'one size fits all' is problematic since Greece and Portugal cannot replicate the hard-won German success. Their productive, institutional and political configurations differ drastically and, thus, they require different policies. The fourth fallacy states that the spill over from one country to another may resuscitate the inefficient and politically risky 'beggar my neighbour' policies from the interwar period.","CEPREMAP, F-75013 Paris, France; [Boyer, Robert] GREDEG, Sophia Antipolis, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Boyer, R (通讯作者)，CEPREMAP, 140 Rue Chevaleret, F-75013 Paris, France.",robert.boyer@ens.fr,,,,,,,34,78,83,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Simple heterogeneity has one individual in a group having either greater endowment of resources or a greater preference for the public good than the others. Complex heterogeneity has one individual in a group having both higher endowment and greater preference for the public good. Without communication, members of heterogeneous groups tend to coordinate more on equal contribution shares than predicted by the conventional public goods model but consistent with a model incorporating a preference for equity. The distribution of relative contributions and total payoffs within groups exhibit strong interactions between communication and heterogeneity, leading to less equitable distributions of payoffs as heterogeneity becomes more complex. A model of equity theory helps to organize the results. Results suggest that communication may refocus the objective of group members. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Based on trust-games studies in experimental economics and neuroeconomics, our main goal is to assess the conceptual, behavioral and neurobiological connections between betrayal and ambiguity aversions. From a social and individual psychological point of view the bottom line of our trusting behavior could be our general aversion to ambiguous signals. We approach social trust in the terms of a phenomenon based on uncertainty aversion. Specifically, a reduction of the perceived uncertainty of a social interaction tends to build up a trusting climate conducive to trade by decreasing betrayal aversion. We hypothesize that betrayal aversion and ambiguity aversion bear such a negative correlation. Focusing on this potential negative correlation our approach clearly differs from more positive accounts of trust centred on altruism.","[Corcos, Anne] Univ Picardie, F-80025 Amiens, France; [Corcos, Anne; Bourgeois-Gironde, Sacha] Univ Paris 02, LEM, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Pannequin, Francois] Ecole Normale Super, Cachan, France; [Pannequin, Francois] Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France",Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV); Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay,"Corcos, A (通讯作者)，Univ Picardie, F-80025 Amiens, France.",,,,,,,,31,1,1,1,18,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

We develop a two-sector neoclassical growth model to quantitatively assess the driving forces of China's recent structural transformation. In addition to the forces currently emphasized in the literature-sectoral productivity growth we show that China's transformation was accelerated significantly by the gradual reduction in the relative size of the Chinese government. We find that the reduction in the size of the Chinese government accounted - by itself - for 15% of the reduction in the agricultural share of employment. Two mechanisms explain this: (i) in our model the lower tax rate associated with reduced intervention encouraged the accumulation of physical capital, which is produced in the nonagricultural sector; (ii) lower inefficiencies induced incomes to rise and, given our preferences, resulted in a disproportionate increase in the demand for the nonagricultural good.

Health-impaired employees are found to be less satisfied according to all job satisfaction measures even when a large number of productivity features and job characteristics are controlled for. The outcomes also suggest that women are more satisfied with their jobs than men are, regardless of health status. Moreover, the estimations show that health-impaired employees' job satisfaction is affected more than healthy employees' job satisfaction by adverse mental health symptoms (life dissatisfaction). Finally, health-impaired employees are found to become more satisfied with their jobs with time after disability onset. This study concludes that health-impaired employees may have higher expectations about what they will obtain from their work, as well as they may have job satisfaction adjustments.","[Drydakis, Nick] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Drydakis, Nick] Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Rion 26504, Greece; [Drydakis, Nick] Sci Ctr Study Discriminat, Athens, Greece",IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Patras,"Drydakis, N (通讯作者)，Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany.",ndrydakis@econ.soc.uoc.gr,"Drydakis, Nick/AAI-1102-2021","Drydakis, Nick/0000-0001-9827-6678",,,,,24,7,10,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In addition, we perform stationarity tests with respect to the real deficit inclusive of interest payments in order to gain additional insight.

Because of the market portfolio cannot be observed directly, proxy portfolios must be used to conduct empirical studies. Unfortunately, many studies found these proxies to be inefficient and even removed from the efficient frontier. According to two-fund separation theorem, we take two steps to discover the efficient market portfolio. Our thinking is straightforward and proves that our market portfolio is not only an efficient portfolio but also is situated on the capital market line. Many researches have shown. that the market portfolio is extremely sensitive to performance measurements.

Waiting time for inpatient care have been a persistent policy concern since the creation of the NHS. After developing a simple theoretical framework of the dynamic interaction between key indicators of health system performance, we investigate empirically the relationship between hospital activity, waiting time and population characteristics using aggregate time-series data for the NHS over the period 1952 to 2003. Structural Vector Autoregression (S-VAR) suggests that in the long run: higher activity is associated with lower waiting times (elasticity = -0.9); an increase in the elderly population is associated with higher waiting time (elasticity = 1.3). In the short run, higher lagged waiting time leads to higher activity (elasticity = 0.12). We also find that shocks in waiting times are countered by higher activity, so the effect is only temporary.","[Iacone, Fabrizio; Martin, Steve; Siciliani, Luigi] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Siciliani, Luigi] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Siciliani, Luigi] CEPR, London EC1V 7DB, England; [Smith, Peter C.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Imperial College London,"Siciliani, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ls24@york.ac.uk,"siciliani, luigi/AAE-8686-2020; Iacone, Fabrizio/P-5855-2017","Iacone, Fabrizio/0000-0002-2681-9036; Smith, Peter/0000-0003-0058-7588",,,,,32,2,2,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Second, the average consumer's willingness to pay corresponds to JPY 100-200 (US $1-2) per song for securing music download platforms.

Given the list of the trains arriving, departing, or travelling through the station, the timetable, and the detailed layout of a station, the routing problem consists in assigning a route through the station to each of the involved trains. If the arrival and departure times given by the timetable cannot be kept for safety or capacity reasons, then the times must be adjusted and the scheduling problem arises. Routing and scheduling are serious problems especially at large, busy stations with multiple platforms and multiple in-lines and out-lines. In this paper, the problem of routing and scheduling trains is formulated as a multiple criteria optimisation problem. The proposed model is validated by using the real data of Prague main station and the timetable valid for the years 2004/2005.","[Janosikova, Ludmila] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Transportat Networks, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Krempl, Michal] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Mech Engn, Inst Transport, CS-70833 Ostrava, Czech Republic",University of Zilina; Technical University of Ostrava,"Janosikova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Transportat Networks, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",Ludmila.Janosikova@fri.uniza.sk; michal.krempl.st@vsb.cz,"Jánošíková, Ľudmila/C-9712-2010","Jánošíková, Ľudmila/0000-0003-3983-6713",Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic; Academy of Sciences [VEGA 1/0296/12],Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic; Academy of Sciences(Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research & Technology (ASRT)),This research was supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic and the Academy of Sciences under project VEGA 1/0296/12 Public service systems with fair access to service.,,10,0,0,0,4,IURA EDITION SPOL SRO,BRATISLAVA,"ORAAVSKA 17, BRATISLAVA, 821 09, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3426-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,108,114,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBN51,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307520000019,0

This article investigates whether the equity premium puzzle laid out in Mehra and Prescott (1985) can be accounted for when this relation is imposed on the representative agent model of asset pricing. Three primary features of our analysis allow us to investigate the relationship. First, we derive an equation satisfied by the rate of time preference. Second, our model can yield an equity premium that is consistent with the observed data even in the standard power utility setting. Third, to fit the observed equity premium, we show that it is required to assume a negative rate of time preference, which is consistent with Kocherlakota (1996) and Brennan and Xia (2001).","[Kim, Hwa-Sung] Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Jangkoo] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Finance & Accounting, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, HS (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, 1 Hoegi Dong, Seoul, South Korea.",fstar@khu.ac.kr,"Kang, Jangkoo/AAI-9765-2020; Kang, Jangkoo/C-1591-2011",,,,,,12,1,1,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

It is to transcend positivism thesis of a foundational-absolute stance and postmodernist antithesis of chaotic relativism. Knowledge is more than what can be measured or observed through human senses. Therefore, central to pragmatic-critical realist position is the existence of transcendental reality beyond our discursive efforts as humans lack necessary cognitive and linguistic means of apprehending truth. Pragmatic-critical realism attempts to establish that for a scientific investigation to take place, the object of that investigation must have real, controllable, internal mechanisms that can be actualized to produce particular outcomes. The implication of this is that science should be understood as an ongoing process which necessitates the persistent improvement of its concepts, methods and mechanisms to provide the best way to solve problems.","[Khin, Edward Wong Sek] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Accounting, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Khin, EWS (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Accounting, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",,"WONG, SEK KHIN/C-1052-2010",,,,,,17,0,1,2,15,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

In particular, the attributes commonly used in order to describe a freight transport service in a stated choice framework are cost, time, punctuality and risk of damages, respectively. This paper investigates the role of origin-destination distance and weight of freight transport services introducing a conditioning effect, where the standard utility function is conditioned on the freight transport distance. We refer to this model form as a heteroskedastic panel multinomial logit (panel H-MNL) model. This model form outperforms the underlying unconditioned model and suggests that an appropriate conditioning effect leads to an improved understanding of the derived measures, such as measures for marginal rates of substitution.","[Masiero, Lorenzo] Univ Lugano, Fac Econ, IRE, Lugano, Switzerland; [Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, ITLS, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Sydney,"Masiero, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lugano, Fac Econ, IRE, Lugano, Switzerland.",lorenzo.masiero@usi.ch; david.hensher@sydney.edu.au,"; Masiero, Lorenzo/O-8734-2014","Collins, Andrew/0000-0002-2500-250X; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242; Masiero, Lorenzo/0000-0002-6933-1700",,,,,16,41,42,3,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

The suitability originates from the perspective of quality/cost ratio of volatility forecasts, allowing for a trade-off between quality and costs when computational efforts are significant. PC-GARCH not only provides a method that allows for simpler volatility modeling, reducing significantly the computational time and getting rid of any problem that may arise from complex data manipulations, but also improves the modeling process quality by ensuring a stricter control of noise due to more stable correlation estimates.","[Matei, Marius] Ramon Llull Univ, ESADE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain; [Matei, Marius] Acad Romana, Natl Inst Econ Res, Bucharest, Romania",Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE); Romanian Academy of Sciences; National Institute for Economic Research Costin C.

We constructed the municipal corruption index based on the objective data delivered by the reports from Controladoria-Geral da Uniao (CGU). We performed a nonparametric analysis, that is, we applied the Generalized Additive Model (GAM). We found statistically significant effects of the economic growth rate on the level of deforestation. However, the corruption seems to have no significant impact. Given the first results, we divided our data and analysed just the data from 25 municipalities from the states Para and Matogrosso.

This approach, however, has tended to protect inefficient industries and to some extent hindered economic development. A disaggregated import demand model is estimated using monthly observations on 91 of the most frequently imported product items in Barbados. The results are then employed to evaluate the feasibility of harmonising tariff rates to some single rate across product categories. The results suggest that the estimation of aggregate import demand equations is not accepted by the data and therefore could result in misleading inferences. The policy simulation exercise indicates that a single applied tariff at the 30% level would essentially be revenue neutral, while rates above this level would lead to reductions in tax receipts.","[Moore, Winston; Morris, Diego] Univ W Indies, Dept Econ, Bridgetown, Barbados",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University of the West Indies Open Campus,"Moore, W (通讯作者)，Univ W Indies, Dept Econ, Cave Hill Campus, Bridgetown, Barbados.",winston.moore@cavehill.uwi.edu,"Moore, Winston R/C-3189-2012; Moore, Winston/L-1124-2019","Morris, Diego/0000-0001-9268-1293; Moore, Winston/0000-0001-8247-2340",,,,,15,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Studying capital markets, that represent the situation of the countries' economies, can help policy-makers to take right decisions at the level of national economy by identifying the variables that affect capital markets or are affected by it. One of these variables that are discussed in this article is inflation. In this paper, firstly, with the cointegration method, by using the quarterly data for 2000-2009, the effect of changes in stock traded on the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) was evaluated, hi both cases, there was an indirect long-term relationship between the two variables. Then we study the relationship between CPI and PPI with changing the value of traded shares at Tehran Stock Exchange by using Granger causality. The results show a one-way causality from changing the value of traded shares to CPI while the relationship is contrast for PPI and there is a one-way causality from PPI to changing the value of traded shares.","[Moradi, Mahdi; Salehi, Mahdi; Keivanfar, Mohammad] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran",Ferdowsi University Mashhad,"Moradi, M (通讯作者)，Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran.",,Salehi/G-2496-2013; Salehi/H-4894-2019,Salehi/0000-0003-2698-9817; Salehi/0000-0003-2698-9817,,,,,12,1,1,1,11,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

As is well known, optimal policy under commitment calls for letting debt follow a stationary process, with values that depend on the initial conditions. In contrast, when the fiscal authority lacks the ability to commit, it manipulates its policy tools, i.e. the tax rate and government spending, in order to reduce the intertemporal price of current consumption goods, i.e. the real interest rate, and the intertemporal value of its current outstanding liabilities. If the economy converges, in any steady state the government has either no incentive or no ability to reduce the real interest rate any longer.","Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland,"Occhino, F (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA.",filippo.occhino@clev.frb.org,,"Occhino, Filippo/0000-0003-0892-2723",,,,,16,1,1,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This means that the more tickets one buys, the higher probability to win he gains.

In axiomatic decision theory, these models motivated a large literature on modeling ambiguity aversion. Some findings of this literature are reported in a way that should be directly accessible to statisticians and econometricians. In statistical decision theory, the models inform a rich theory of estimation and treatment choice, which was recently extended to account for partial identification and thereby ambiguity that does not vanish with sample size. This literature is illustrated by discussing global, finite-sample admissible, and minimax decision rules for a number of stylized decision problems with point and partial identification.","Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Stoye, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",stoye@cornell.edu,,,,,,,77,11,14,0,14,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4604-1,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

For this purpose, panel data models are derived to test the validity of the four hypotheses in EMU countries. A notable characteristic of this article is that the four hypotheses are tested by dividing EMU countries into various subgroups and using disaggregated data for government expenditures and revenues. Seeking for the robustness of the empirical evidence, the panel data methods of Generalized Two-Stage Least Squares (GTSLS) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) are accordingly applied to identify the relationship between public outlays and taxation receipts. GTSLS and GMM results strongly support the fiscal synchronization hypothesis implying that budget decision-making is significantly influenced by both government expenditures and revenues components.","Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Vamvoukas, GA (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, 76 Patiss St, Athens 10434, Greece.",gvamv@aueb.gr,"VAMVOUKAS, GEORGE/JFN-2248-2023",,,,,,45,11,11,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Though a few studies do discuss evidence of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of telehealth programs, the literature might limit to financial evaluation. This research investigates the welfare implications of conventional in-person and telecommunications health care as improving health levels or preventing health from deterioration for efficient resource allocation by incorporating government intervention for equal accessibility of health care in the economic progress perspective. Analytical findings indicate that the inverse U shape relationship between telehealth expenditure share and social welfare status exists as the nonlinear nexus between telehealth expenditure share and economic growth presents. The health dividend in terms of an enhanced economic growth rate can be achieved only when the initial share of telehealth expenditure is smaller than the growth-maximizing share. For economic sustainable development, telehealth initiatives strengthen rather than compete with conventional in-person health care.

This paper analyzes the equivalence possibilities under the much extended circumstances of strictly decreasing marginal (industrial) revenue, a twice differentiable demand function, and convex costs. It proves that in the extended context, the outcomes in the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the KS game are those of Cournot equilibrium (CE) and that a CE is on the path of the SPNE of the KS game if the marginal cost of each firm in some special (borderline) cases is not too high. It further proves that for decreasing continuous demand and strictly increasing costs, the outcome in the SPNE of the KS game (if the SPNE exists) is that of CE. Based on these results, we argue that the KS game can serve as the basic form for studying quantity competition and for developing a T-stage game-theoretical framework to make competition form and timing endogenous.

This study's results indicate substantial differentials in approved loan amount gaps between racial and gender classes, favouring white and female borrowers, respectively. Further scrutiny of the borrowers' comparative financial conditions presented to FSA to support their loan applications, however, indicate that these borrower groups significantly dominate their peers in a number of measures that indicate their financial strengths and relatively greater capability to repay their future lending obligations.

Specifically, the results of this work show how price competition between firms can lead to an equilibrium solution with a lower competitive intensity than initially expected. The author illustrates this process using a concrete example.

While employing CBT may produce gains in knowledge acquisition and lower costs for repetitive, low-skill work, there is a lack of empirical evidence whether these benefits exist for more highly skilled Navy operations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that CBT failed to sufficiently prepare new sailors for sophisticated systems' maintenance and operation. To determine the validity of this evidence, we examine how CBT has affected the AN/SQQ-89(v) sonar. We empirically analyse whether the Navy's introduction of CBT significantly altered fleet maintenance costs, actions and training requirements, by assembling a unique data set of ships, locations, personnel, maintenance costs and maintenance actions. Controlling for the Navy's plan to man the system, the number of authorized billets and the number of personnel on board, we find that CBT adversely impacts costs, actions and maintenance hours for the sonar system.","[McNab, Robert M.; Angelis, Diana I.] Naval Postgrad Sch, Def Resources Management Inst, Monterey, CA 93933 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,"McNab, RM (通讯作者)，Naval Postgrad Sch, Def Resources Management Inst, Monterey, CA 93933 USA.",rmmcnab@nps.edu,"McNab, Robert/K-7212-2019","McNab, Robert/0000-0002-0093-3973",,,,,40,1,2,1,450,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Next we examine productivity more closely and the evidence that the global rate of agricultural productivity growth is declining-with potentially serious prospects for the price and availability of food for the poorest people in the world.

The effectiveness of these conversations is difficult to ascertain if parents are more likely to broach discussions related to sexual activity with adolescents who have greater propensities to engage in these risky behaviors. Our baseline empirical results indicate that female adolescents whose mothers communicate more about sex are more likely to have sexual intercourse, practice unsafe sex, and engage in casual sex. However, once we control for the adolescent's environment and peers through the use of school fixed effects and for the daughter's own propensity to engage in such behaviors through a rich set of adolescent-specific covariates, the effect of a mother's talk on her daughter's behavior is reduced dramatically indicating that mother's talk is endogenous to the daughter's sexual behavior. Models employing sister fixed effects to control for family-level unobservables, although imprecisely estimated, confirm this finding.","[Averett, Susan L.] Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Estelle, Sarah M.] Hope Coll, Dept Econ Management & Accounting, Holland, MI 49423 USA",Lafayette College; Hope College,"Averett, SL (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, 100 Quad Dr, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",averetts@lafayette.edu,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We make use of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. Our results show that country-specific factors seem to be much more relevant than individual effects in explaining country differences in material deprivation. We estimate that the introduction of country-specific factors reduces the proportion of total variance due to between-country differences in deprivation by 72.7 percent, while individual-level variables reduce this proportion by only 9.4 percent. We also show, through interaction variables, that the effect of sociodemographic characteristics can be shaped by institutional and structural factors, especially by the level of GDP.","[Barcena-Martin, E.; Lacomba, B.; Perez-Moreno, S.] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Moro-Egido, A.

We consider the monetary policy rule proposed by Taylor (1993) and the fiscal policy rule suggested by Davig and Leeper (2007) in accounting for monetary and fiscal policy interactions. Empirical results suggest that monetary and fiscal policy rules exhibit switching properties between active and passive regimes and all countries followed both active and passive monetary policies. As for fiscal policy, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and Slovenia seem to have alternated between active and passive fiscal regimes while fiscal policies of Poland and the Slovak Republic can be characterized by a single fiscal regime. Although the policy mix and the interactions between monetary and fiscal policy point a diverse picture in our sample countries, the monetary policy seems to be passive in all countries after 2000.

With this regulation, KCC intended to provide program networks incentives to deliver high quality programs and develop the cable TV industry. However, this regulation was introduced without a formal analysis of the optimality of market equilibrium or the effects of the regulation on the industry or social welfare. This paper sets up a simple model focusing on the two-sided market nature of CATV industry. It is shown that the market equilibrium is generally suboptimal and program quality is below the socially optimal level. When the market equilibrium is suboptimal, the regulation of the licensing fee can improve program quality and social welfare, but cannot achieve the socially optimal equilibrium.","Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Int Finance, Yongin 449791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Choi, YJ (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Int Finance, 81 Oedae Ro, Yongin 449791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",yjchoi@hufs.ac.uk,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,10,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

We estimate that the regulations reduced the number of methamphetamine laboratories operating in a state by 36%. We find no evidence of changes in methamphetamine consumption or arrests for drug possession, suggesting people were able to find methamphetamine produced elsewhere. Though we find evidence suggesting methamphetamine producers responded to regulation by obtaining precursors from neighboring states that lacked laws, they do not appear to have systematically moved production to neighboring states. This suggests that production shifted over national borders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Within a linear public good game, we experimentally investigate two possible factors that impact the decision to cooperate in a smaller, local or a larger, global group: diverging marginal per capita returns, resulting in different social returns, and social feedback information. If social returns are equal across groups, subjects prefer to contribute to the local group that offers social information on individual contributions. An increase of the social return in the global group initially attracts more contributions, but this tendency quickly unravels in favor of cooperation in the local group. Cooperation in the global public good can only be sustained if contributions of global group members can be observed. We thus identify social feedback information as a key factor for institutional design to foster cooperation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Because of worse access to financial markets, wages in domestic firms carry higher default risk than wages in foreign ones. This alters the domestic wage composition and the subsequent wealth distribution. When credit markets are imperfect, the wealth distribution typically determines an economy's growth potential in autarky; hence, high exposure to FDI may significantly impede the capability to recover from sudden withdrawals of foreign capital. This appears consistent with a first glance at empirical evidence on durations of output recovery after systemic sudden stops.","[Gall, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Schiffbauer, Marc] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",University of Bonn; The World Bank,"Gall, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Econ Div, Sch Social Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",t.gall@soton.ac.uk,,"Gall, Thomas/0000-0003-2257-1405",,,,,44,2,2,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

However, given the heterogeneity of financial education programmes in the literature, focusing on 'generic' financial education can be inappropriate and even misleading. Lusardi (2009) and others argue that pedagogy and delivery matter significantly. In this paper, we design and field a low-cost, easily-replicable financial education programme called 'Five Steps', covering five basic financial planning concepts that relate to retirement. We conduct a field experiment to evaluate the overall impact of Five Steps on a probability sample of the American population. In different treatment arms, we quantify the relative impact of delivering the programme through video and narrative formats. Our results show that short videos and narratives (each takes about 3 minutes) have sizeable short-run effects on objective measures of respondent knowledge. Moreover, keeping informational content relatively constant, format has significant effects on other psychological levers of behavioural change: effects on self-efficacy are significantly higher when videos are used, which ultimately influences knowledge acquisition. Follow-up tests of respondents' knowledge approximately 8 months after the interventions suggest that between one-quarter and one-third of the knowledge gain and about one-fifth of the self-efficacy gain persist. Thus, this simple programme has effects both in the short run and medium run.","[Hung, Angela; Yoong, Joanne] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA; [Kapteyn, Arie] USC Dornsife Ctr Econ & Social Res, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Lusardi, Annamaria] George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Samek, Anya Savikhin] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Yoong, Joanne] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore",RAND Corporation; George Washington University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National University of Singapore,,aheinberg@gmail.com; ahung@rand.org; kapteyn@dornsife.usc.edu; alusardi@gwu.edu; anyasamek@gmail.com; jyoong@rand.org,"Lusardi, Annamaria/AEB-6291-2022","Yoong, Joanne/0000-0002-0162-9885",US Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Financial Literacy Research Consortium,US Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Financial Literacy Research Consortium,"The research reported herein was performed pursuant to a grant from the US Social Security Administration (SSA) funded as part of the Financial Literacy Research Consortium.

Central bank actions constitute monetary policy if they alter the quantity of the bank's monetary liabilities, but constitute credit policy if they alter the composition of the bank's portfolio without affecting the outstanding amount of monetary liabilities. In the 19th century, Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot advocated Lender of Last Resort policies as a means of expanding the money supply when the demand for money surged in a crisis. In contrast, the Fed's recent crisis lending for the most part left its outstanding monetary liabilities unaffected, and thus represented credit policy, not Lender of Last Resort activity. Credit allocation in a crisis is potentially costly because it affects market participants' beliefs about the likelihood of future central bank rescues, which in turn reduces their incentive to protect themselves against financial distress and thus exacerbates financial instability. Credible limits on credit policy thus are critical to central banks' core policy mission. One path to establishing such limits is to create living wills that detail how to resolve large, complex financial firms without government support. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In terms of their macroeconomic impacts, I find that deflation was uniquely depressing in the 1930s because of cartel policies that prevented nominal prices and wages from adjusting to clear markets, and not because deflation is generically depressing. I find that the biggest impact of monetary policy during World War II was in debasing debt through inflation. I find that the main drivers of the 1970s economy were long-run changes in productivity and the labor market, and that there may have been little that the Fed could have done at this time to expand employment and output. More broadly, I find that macroeconomic performance would have been better over the Fed's first century had the Fed followed a monetary policy to deliver stable prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using several estimation techniques and other sensitivity checks, this paper offers a new explanation for success and failure in export diversification patterns in oil countries, an explanation which has an institutional and political background. In measuring the number of years between the beginning of oil production and the attainment of political independence in oil developing countries, we found that the greater the number of years, the higher the degree of export diversification ceteris paribus. Our interpretation of this result is grounded in an analysis of political constraints to diversification in resource-based countries. Institutions, unfavorable to diversification, which arose from the pre-independence period, were blocked in their positive evolution by national political elites in the post-independence period.

In this regard, the domestic rate of profit determines the direction of foreign capital, while foreign capital, in turn, influences the rate of profit. The dynamic model between the level of GDP, derived from the extended Thirlwall's law (Thirlwall and Hussain 1982), and the rate of profit is thus created. The theoretical result obtained from the model is compatible with the stylized facts of many small and open economies that experienced rapid economic growth and balance of payments crises from the mobility of foreign capital.","Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",Thammasat University,"Phumma, N (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,9,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We experiment with funding contracts that differ in the structure of investor repayment and, thus, in their incentives for the provision of entrepreneurial effort. Theoretically the replacement of a standard debt contract by a repayment-equivalent non-monotonic contract reduces effort distortions and increases efficiency. Likewise, distortions can be mitigated by replacing outside equity by a repayment-equivalent standard-debt contract. We test both hypotheses in the laboratory. Our results reveal that the incentive effects of funding contracts must be experienced before they are reflected in observed behavior. With sufficient experience, observed behavior is either consistent with or close to theoretical predictions and supports both hypotheses. If we allow for entrepreneur-sided manipulations of project outcomes, we find that non-monotonic contracts lose much of their appeal.","[Reiss, J.

Eventually, the reduction in quality can outweigh the marginal welfare benefits of greater product variety. Thus, the continuous increase in the number of brands requires a parallel improvement in consumer information mechanisms.

This paper employs the unexpected 1999 Brazilian exchange rate devaluation to identify the effects of exporting on Brazilian manufacturing firm-level wages using employer-employee linked data. We find that this export shock increased the average wage gap between the high and low productivity firms. Most of this wage increase took the form of a larger wage premium, but increased sorting of workers also played a significant role. Further scrutiny at the occupation-firm level indicates that the wage increases of managerial white-collar occupations came solely from wage premium variations. Skilled blue-collar workers also exhibited wage gains, but these gains came in equal shares from increased wage premium and worker sorting; the remaining occupational categories saw no wage increase.

J,"Champarnaud, L",,,,"Champarnaud, Luc",,,Prices for superstars can flatten out,JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Superstar economics; Cultural economics; Talent; Quality,ECONOMICS,"We reconsider Rosen's economics of superstars model establishing, in the case of single-type consumers, a constant price-to-quality ratio. Rosen also conjectured that, in the case of multiple-type consumers, the normal course of consumer behavior forces the price-to-quality relationship to be convex and prevents it from being concave. We show that this conjecture is false and explain why there is no a priori reason to rule out concavity in the price-to-quality relationship. In this model, the market matches consumers to artists on the basis of quality: consumers of each type select only one level of quality, supplied by artists endowed with a specific level of talent. The concavity or convexity of the price-to-quality relationship is non-trivially related to the way both populations are matched. Consumers with poor knowledge have greater fixed costs above and beyond the price they have to pay on the market. They are therefore less reluctant when prices rise sharply and they specialize in levels of quality that entail a high marginal appreciation of quality: this can mean either a high or a low level of quality, depending on price curvature. With convexity, as Rosen pointed out, they turn toward superstars. Symmetrically, convexity encourages connoisseurs to turn toward low quality. But concavity too is fully possible: consumer-artist matching, for the same reasons, simply has the reverse effect. Connoisseurs go for great talents, whose price of quality flattens out. The global shape of the price-to-quality relationship (concave or convex) is determined by market clearing conditions and, more crucially, by the distribution of agents on both sides.","[Champarnaud, Luc] Univ Artois, Arras, France; [Champarnaud, Luc] Univ Lille 3, EQUIPPE, F-59653 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite d'Artois; Universite de Lille,"Champarnaud, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 3, EQUIPPE, BP 60149, F-59653 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",luc.champarnaud@univ-lille3.fr,,,,,,,17,5,6,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We find that stabilizing GHG emissions will require additional investment in the electricity generation sector over and above investments that would be needed in the absence of climate policy, in the range of 15 to 29 trillion US$ (48-94%) depending on the stringency of climate policy during the period 2015 to 2095 under default technology assumptions. This increase reflects the higher capital intensity of power systems that control emissions as well as increased electrification of the global economy. Limits on the penetration of nuclear and carbon capture and storage technology could increase costs substantially. Energy efficiency improvements can reduce the investment requirement by 18 to 24 trillion US$ (compared to default technology climate policy assumptions), depending on climate policy scenario. We also highlight the implications of different technology evolution scenarios for different regions. Under default technology set, the heaviest investments across scenarios in power generation were observed in China, India, SE Asia and Africa regions with the latter three regions dominating in the second half of the 21st century.

Agents are endowed with balance sheets comprising the risky asset as well as cash on the asset side and equity capital as well as debt on the liabilities side. A number of findings emerge when simulating the model: we find that the empirically observable log-normal distribution of bank balance sheet size naturally emerges and that higher levels of leverage lead to a greater inequality among agents. Furthermore, greater leverage increases the frequency of bankruptcies and systemic events. Credit frictions, which we define as the stickiness of debt adjustments, are able to explain a key difference in the relation between leverage and assets observed for different bank types. Lowering credit frictions leads to an increasingly procyclical behavior of leverage, which is typical for investment banks. Nevertheless, the impact of credit frictions on the fragility of the model financial system is complex. Lower frictions do increase the stability of the system most of the time, while systemic events become more probable. In particular, we observe an increasing frequency of severe liquidity crises that can lead to the collapse of the entire model financial system. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We use a dynamic hierarchical factor model that is able to decompose Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in a panel of countries into (i) a factor common to all inflation series and all countries, (ii) a factor specific to a given sub-section of the CPI, (iii) a country group-factor and (iv) a country-specific component. With its pyramidal structure, the model allows for the possibility that the global factor affects the country-group factor and other subordinated factors but not vice versa. Using quarterly data for industrialized and emerging economies from 1996 to 2011 we find that about two thirds of overall inflation volatility is due to country-specific determinants. For CPI inflation net of food and energy, the global factor and the CPI basket-specific factor account for less than 20 % of inflation variation. Only energy price inflation in industrial economies is dominated by common factors.","[Foerster, Marcel; Tillmann, Peter] Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Förster, M (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, Licher Str 66, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.",marcel.foerster@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de; peter.tillmann@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,25,16,16,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This paper characterizes the equilibrium pricing and recommendation strategies of an expert under the assumptions that i) the type of treatment is verifiable by the client, ii) the client has the option of rejecting any treatment recommendation, and iii) the expert is not liable for the outcome of the treatment. It is found, for any parameter configuration, that there exist equilibria in which the expert makes fraudulent recommendations resulting in inefficient treatment The market outcome is compared with that under an alternative market environment in which the expert is liable for treatment outcome but the type of treatment performed is non-verifiable. It is shown that for some parameter configurations the equilibrium is more efficient when liability is in place than when the treatment is verifiable. These findings stand in sharp contrast to the received wisdom that the market outcome under verifiability of treatment is efficient while the market outcome under liability for outcome is not.

In this paper, we assume that the policyholder is ambiguity averse in the sense of Klibanoff et al. (Econometrica 73(6):1849-1892, 2005). The optimal contract depends upon the structure of the ambiguity. For example, if the set of possible priors can be ranked according to the monotone likelihood ratio order, the optimal contract contains a disappearing deductible.

The neoclassical myth that a free-market economy inevitably moves to an equilibrium position determined solely by supply-side factors must be rejected and replaced by the insight that the position of an economy in the longer term is path dependent. Fiscal policy in recessions should be biased towards increasing physical and human capital, which will improve the productivity of an economy and raise living standards and hence taxable capacity, thus enabling future public debt to be reduced if this is desirable. Monetary policy should play a very minor role in aggregate demand policy, with interest rate settings largely used to help achieve long-term income distribution goals. All this is fundamental to Geoff Harcourt's vision of macroeconomic policy, and this paper spells out how this vision can be implemented in 2012 in Western countries not hamstrung by eurozone rules and regulations.","[Nevile, J.

We conducted a joy-of-destruction game with pastoralists from both areas and provide evidence for a positive relationship between antisocial behavior and long-term exposure to scarcity. Antisocial behavior among villagers occurs twice as often in an area where resources are scarcer and competitive pressure is higher. Our results remain robust to the inclusion of various controls, including beliefs, socio-demographics, absolute and relative income, and within-group inequality.

Previous growth accounting research at the macro-level suggests that this was mainly driven by multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth. In this paper we analyze for the first time the drivers of Russian growth at the level of industries. We derive a proper measure of capital services, instead of using stock measures as in previous research. Using this, we find that aggregate GDP growth is driven as much by capital input as MFP growth. Mining and Retailing industries are growing fast, but have poor MFP performance. In contrast, MFP growth was high in goods-producing industries but their share in GDP declined. MFP growth was highest in those industries that were particularly underdeveloped in the Russian economy in the 1990s.","[Timmer, Marcel P.; Voskoboynikov, Ilya B.] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Timmer, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, GEM, POB 800, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",m.p.timmer@rug.nl,"timmer, marcel p/A-7716-2008; Voskoboynikov, Ilya Borisovich/G-9668-2015","Voskoboynikov, Ilya Borisovich/0000-0002-9769-5894",,,,,67,17,21,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

After having examined the market, competition authorities concluded that tacit collusion existed but could not easily be prosecuted under given competition law. In several other countries, various types of regulatory schemes are implemented to tackle tacit collusive behavior, e. g., there are price ceilings established in Luxembourg or per day limits of price increases given in Austria. However, research has found that none of them has led to satisfactory results. Hence, the following paper proposes a different regulatory approach, i.e., the implementation of corrective taxes. Results show that a specially tailored tax on price successfully manages to render collusion an unprofitable business by collecting marginal profits and that the inherent vice of the gasoline retail market, i.e., the transparency that enables tacit-and therefore non-prosecutable-collusion, could be turned into a regulatory virtue as it becomes a powerful means to help successfully tackle imperfect competition and to bring about a more efficient market outcome.","TU Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Wittmann, N (通讯作者)，TU Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",nadine.wittmann@tu-berlin.de,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,9,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 9,2014,8,,,,,,,,201433.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-33,0.0,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AR7YI,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343792500001,0

The unit root test which accounts for nonlinearity, smooth structural shifts, and cross-section dependency supports that PPP hypothesis holds for Eurozone and European countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom), while it does not hold for non-European trading partners (Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and USA). From the empirical results, we can conclude that PPP, hypothesis holds in the countries which have the free trade agreement, while it is violated in the countries in which there are trade barriers and greater distance.

An experimental design which allows manipulations of the complexity of these strategies by making either the cooperate action or the defect action state-dependent is used. Subjects are found to be less likely to use a cooperative strategy and more likely to use a simpler selfish strategy when the complexity of cooperative strategies is increased. The robustness of this effect is supported by the finding that cooperation falls even when the defect action is made state-dependent, which increases the complexity of punishment-enforced cooperative strategies. A link between subjects' standardized test scores and the likelihood of cooperating is found, indicating that greater cognitive ability makes subjects more likely to use complex strategies.

I generalize the standard model to accommodate this preference for a mixed objective, proposing a method by which to make disparate criteria commensurable while respecting Pareto efficiency. Then, I show that optimal policy in this generalized model, calibrated to the survey evidence and U.S. microdata, is capable of quantitatively matching several features of existing tax policy that are incompatible in the conventional model but widely endorsed in the survey and reality, including the coexistence of substantial redistribution and limited tagging. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a positive theory of optimal taxation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The measure contains two components: a price markup and a wage markup. It seems that the latter mainly drives the fluctuations in Turkey.

However, these beneficial bilateral relations also bring about global environmental consequences including greenhouse gas emissions. We develop a footloose capital model of international trade between the North (United States) and the South (China) in the presence of a global pollution externality. Each country's share of global pollution depends on its share of world capital. We show that, if the disutility of pollution in the United States is high, there will be pressure on the US to raise environmental regulations on industry. Capital will move to China. Because the increased pollution in China has global effects, the US may not benefit from the environmental restrictions and a joint regulation of pollution by both parties may be a preferred outcome.

Following a brief review of the evidence on these issues, a gender-based overlapping generations (OLG) model of endogenous growth that captures these interactions is presented and its properties characterized. The endogeneity of mothers' rearing time and rearing costs implies that improved access to infrastructure has in general an ambiguous effect on growth. Numerical experiments, based on a calibrated version of the model for low-income countries, show that it is possible for higher investment in infrastructure to actually reduce the steady-state growth rate. The possibility of multiple equilibria induced by an endogenous survival rate is also discussed, and so is the role of public policy in that context. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The value of statistical life terminology was introduced by Thomas Schelling (1968) in his essay, The Life You Save May Be Your Own. Schelling made the crucial move to think in terms of risk rather than individual lives, with the hope to dodge the moral thicket of valuing life. But as recent policy debates have illustrated, his move only thickened it. Tellingly, interest in the subject can be traced back another twenty years before Schelling's essay to a controversy at RAND Corporation following its earliest application of operations research to defense planning. RAND wanted to avoid valuing pilot's lives but the Air Force insisted they confront the issue. Thus, the VSL is not only well acquainted with political controversy; it was born from it.","[Banzhaf, H. Spencer] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Banzhaf, H.

Most previous studies use a lottery prize rule and linear cost, and find both overbidding relative to the Nash equilibrium prediction and significant variation of efforts, which we term 'overspreading.' We investigate the effects of allocating the prize by a lottery versus sharing it proportionally, and of convex versus linear costs of effort, while holding fixed the Nash equilibrium prediction for effort. We find the share rule results in average effort closer to the Nash prediction, and lower variation of effort. Combining the share rule with a convex cost function further enhances these results. We can explain a significant amount of non-equilibrium behavior by features of the experimental design. These results contribute towards design guidelines for contests based on behavioral principles that take into account implementation features of a contest. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Nunn and Qian (2011) show the introduction of the potato from the New World has a significant explanatory role for within country population and urbanization growth over this period. I expand on this by considering the role of milk consumption, which is hypothesized to be a complement in diet to potatoes due to a differential composition of essential nutrients. Using a country-level measure for the suitability of milk consumption, the frequency of lactase persistence, I show that the marginal effect of potatoes on post-1700 population and urbanization growth is positively related to milk consumption. As the frequency of milk consumption approaches unity, the marginal effect of potatoes more than doubles in magnitude compared to the baseline estimate of Nunn and Qian. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We axiomatize these spaces using conditional belief operators, examining three additional axioms of increasing strength. First, introspection, which requires the agent to be unconditionally certain of her beliefs. Second, echo, according to which the unconditional beliefs implied by the condition must be held given the condition. Third, determination, which says that the conditional beliefs are the unconditional beliefs that are conditionally certain. Echo implies that conditioning on an event is the same as conditioning on the event being certain, which formalizes the standard informal interpretation of conditional probability. The game-theoretic application of our model, discussed within an example, sheds light on a number of issues in the analysis of extensive form games.

Our results show that saving and investment rates are highly dependent across countries of East Asia. This finding underlines the importance of taking into account cross-sectional dependence when analyzing saving-investment relationship. The results also indicate that the adverse financial shock of 1997 has negatively affected the short run correlation between saving and investment, but has not influenced their long run relationship. Our finding, hence, verifies the prediction of new open economy macroeconomic theories regarding the divergence of short run saving-investment from its long run trend for East Asia. Moreover, we find that the global financial crisis of 2008 has not affected the saving-investment dynamics in this region. It means that the consequences of the Asian and global financial crises for saving-investment dynamics are not the same in East Asia. One might attribute these differences to the origins of these two shocks, i.e., internal versus external to the region. These findings may have some policy implications for those countries that rely heavily on foreign investment and are subject to various internal and external financial shocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The empirical results indicate that a moderate carbon tax would significantly reduce carbon emissions and fossil fuel energy consumption and slightly reduce the pace of economic growth. However, a large carbon tax has a significantly negative impact on China's economy and social welfare. Moreover, a large carbon tax would entail marked price changes in China. Of the fossil fuels in use, reducing coal consumption would have the greatest impact on reducing carbon emissions, and the ad valorem duty rate for coal would be the highest after levying a carbon tax because it has the highest carbon emission coefficient. Therefore, China should strive to promote clean coal technology, which may be crucial to reducing carbon emissions. Moreover, levying a carbon tax would improve the use of clean energy, which would be an effective means of reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, the Chinese government should formulate the regulations for and pass a carbon tax as early as possible to achieve its carbon emission abatement target and further contribute to mitigating climate change.

Using Yaari's (1969) [50] definition of more risk averse than, we show that it is sufficient to compare the revealed preference relations of two investors. This makes the approach operational; the central rationalisability theorem provides strong support for this approach. We also provide a measure of economic significance to quantify the differences in risk aversion, which can also help to interpret differences in risk aversion in parametric models. The approach is an alternative or complement to parametric approaches and a robustness check. As a necessary first step towards this comparative approach we show how to test data for consistency with stochastic dominance relations, which can also be used to recover larger parts of preferences. We include an application to experimental data by Choi et al. (2007) [10.11] which demonstrates the potential of the comparative approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We combine a new survey of village elders with historical census data for 1975-2006 and geocoded maps of treatment under the regional Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP). The OCP ran from 1975 to 2002, first spraying rivers to stop transmission and then distributing medicine to help those already infected. Controlling for time and village fixed effects, we find that villages in treated areas acquired larger populations and also had more cropland transactions, fewer permits required for cropland transactions, and more regulation of common property pasture and forest These effects are robust to numerous controls and tests for heterogeneity across the sample, including time-varying region fixed effects. Descriptive statistics suggest that treated villages also acquired closer access to electricity and telephone service, markets, wells and primary schools, with no difference in several other variables. These results are consistent with both changes in productivity and effects of population size on public institutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

I focus on the individual health insurance market, which includes plans purchased through exchanges as well as plans purchased directly from insurers. In this market, at least 13.2 million people were covered in the second quarter of 2014, representing an increase of at least 4 2 million beyond pre-ACA state-level trends. I use data on coverage, premiums, and costs and a model developed by Martin Hackmann, Jonathan Kolstad, and myself (forthcoming) to calculate changes in selection and markups, which allow me to estimate the welfare impact of the ACA on participants in the individual health insurance market in each state. I then focus on comparisons across groups of states. The estimates from my model imply that market participants in the five direct enforcement states those that ceded all enforcement of the ACA to the federal government are experiencing welfare losses of approximately $245 per participant on an annualized basis, relative to participants in all other states. The estimates also imply that the impact of setting up a state exchange depends meaningfully on how well the exchange functions. Market participants in the six states that had severe exchange glitches are experiencing welfare losses of approximately $750 per participant on an annualized basis, relative to participants in other states with their own exchanges. Although the national impact of the ACA is likely to change over the course of 2014 as coverage, costs, and premiums evolve, I expect that the differential impacts that are observed across states will persist through the rest of 2014.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Kowalski, AE (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; National Science Foundation [1350132]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1350132] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","I have committed to revisit this analysis using updated data in the fall 2015 issue of Brookings Papers.

Firms and their managers acquire knowledge via a variety of different channels which are often difficult to track down and quantify. By matching employer-employee data with trade data at the firm level we show that the export experience acquired by managers in previous firms leads their current firm toward higher export performance, and commands a sizeable wage premium for the manager. Moreover, export knowledge is decisive when it is market-specific: managers with experience related to markets served by their current firm receive an even higher wage premium; firms are more likely to enter markets where their managers have experience; exporters are more likely to stay in those markets, and their sales are on average higher. Our findings are robust to controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and, more broadly, endogeneity and indicate that managers' export experience is a first-order feature in the data with an impact on a firm's export performance that is, for example, at least as strong as that of firm productivity.

The Self-Sufficiency Project ('SSP') was a demonstration project where long-term welfare recipients randomly assigned to the treatment group were offered a generous earnings supplement if they exited welfare for full-time employment. We find that treatment group members were less likely to upgrade their education along all dimensions: high-school completion, enrolling in a community college or trade school, and enrolling in university. Thus, 'work-first' policies that encourage full-time employment may reduce educational activity and may have adverse consequences on the long-run earnings capacity of welfare recipients. We also find that there was a substantial amount of educational upgrading in this population. For instance, among high-school dropouts at the baseline, 19% completed their diploma by the end of the demonstration. Finally, we simulate the consequences of the earnings supplement in the absence of adverse effects on educational upgrading. Doing so alters the interpretation of the lessons from the SSP demonstration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Riddell, Chris] Cornell Univ, ILR Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Riddell, W.

From a statistical perspective, rounding implies that the measured variable is a coarsened version of the underlying continuous target variable. Since the coarsening process is non-random, inference from rounded data is generally biased. Despite the potentially severe consequences of rounding, little is known about its causes. In this paper, we focus on subjects' uncertainty about the target variable as one potential cause for rounding behavior. We present a novel experimental method that induces uncertainty in a controlled way, thus providing causal evidence for the effect of subjects' uncertainty on the extent of rounding. Then, we specify and estimate a mixture model that relates uncertainty and rounding. The results suggest that an increase in the exogenous level of uncertainty translates into higher variance of the subjects' beliefs, which in turn results in more rounding.","[Ruud, Paul A.] Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA; [Schunk, Daniel] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Econ, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Schunk, Daniel] Univ Zurich, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Winter, Joachim K.] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Vassar College; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Munich,"Schunk, D (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Econ, Jakob Welder Weg 4, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",paruud@vassar.edu; mail@daniel-schunk.de; winter@lmu.de,,"Winter, Joachim/0000-0003-2460-619X",,,,,23,10,10,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Yet they are the most insecure in relation to funding retirement. Even when Mexican-American workers are eligible to participate in retirement savings plans at work, they have low participation rates. We analyze data from a Chicago area survey in light of broader anthropological and economic scholarship to argue that Mexican-Americans' collectivist values influence the choices they make about how to build assets and resources differently from other Latino groups. Latinos are a diverse group by national origin, citizenship and immigration status, characteristics that strongly influence their employment prospects, asset building and retirement savings and security. Financial policy makers need to understand the heterogeneity of financial behavior within the Hispanic community. The collectivist informal economy of Mexican immigrants and their children is at odds with the formal defined contribution retirement savings system, which is geared toward both autonomous individuals and higher-income workers who benefit from the program's tax deductions. Since these plans penalize participants who withdraw funds before retirement age, they can be deleterious to those who expect both to loan funds to and to borrow money from members of their collectivist social networks.","[Saad-Lessler, Joelle] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Richman, Karen] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",The New School; University of Notre Dame,"Richman, K (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",krichman@nd.edu,,,,,,,28,1,6,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

After presenting the methodological and theoretical characteristics of the question he identified in 1943, I consider the embryonic causal analysis of expectations he tried to develop in 1945 by borrowing from Oskar Lange's concept of the practical range. I then expose the methodological and theoretical flaws that may explain why he did not develop this analysis further in his subsequent works.

The answer to this question appears all but trivial. A dynamic macroeconomic model is set up of a small open economy with capital mobility, migration and increasing returns to scale. The model features multiple equilibria as well as (local and global) indeterminacy. Despite its simplicity, the model creates a rich set of plausible implications. This paper clarifies the mechanics that may lead an integrating economy to the good or to the bad equilibrium by showing how fundamentals and expectations interact in the process of equilibrium selection. The model is applied to replicate two striking empirical characteristics of macroeconomic development in East Germany since 1990.","[Schaefer, Andreas; Steger, Thomas] Univ Leipzig, Inst Theoret Econ, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Steger, Thomas] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Leipzig University; Ifo Institut,"Schäfer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Theoret Econ, Grimma Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",steger@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,"Steger, Thomas/0000-0002-2489-6716; Schaefer, Andreas/0000-0002-4703-7914",,,,,35,7,7,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Our focus is on understanding the wage formation process as well as welfare costs of disinflations in the presence of such labor market frictions. The presence of imperfect information in labor markets imposes a lower bound on worker surplus that varies endogenously. Consequently equilibrium can take two forms depending on whether the no shirking condition is binding or not. We also evaluate both regimes from a welfare perspective when the economy is subject to a perfectly credible disinflationary shock. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The empirical analysis is conducted on a regional level using regional office-level monthly data obtained from the Croatian Employment Service for 2000-2011. The results suggest that the efficiency of the matching process is rising over time, although with significant regional variations. In order to explore these variations, structural characteristics of the labour market together with some policy variables are included in the second-stage estimation. Various structural variables have different impact on the matching efficiency, while policy variables are mostly positively correlated with it. For instance, both active labour market programs and the number of high-skilled employees in regional employment offices positively affect matching efficiency. Additionally, when regional income per capita is included in the model, it shows positive impact on the matching efficiency, indicating that demand fluctuations predominantly affect the matching process. Finally, in order to get consistent estimates, panel stochastic frontier model transformation is applied. The obtained results show that there is no major difference in estimated mean technical efficiency coefficients in comparison to the original estimation.","Inst Econ, Dept Labour Market Human Resources & Social Issue, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Tomic, I (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Dept Labour Market Human Resources & Social Issue, Zagreb, Croatia.",itomic@eizg.hr,"Tomic, Iva/N-3334-2019","Tomic, Iva/0000-0002-4706-7881",,,,,36,6,6,0,17,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Overall, the results of these studies indicate a positive impact of ACFTA on the region's exports to China. These results differ from firm-level surveys that indicate a low utilization rate of most regional trade agreement tariff concessions, including those provided by ACFTA. Moreover, trade in manufactured goods in the region has been characterized as market-led, and governed by multinationals (MNCs) and their regional production networks. Thus, MNC decisions are the driving force influencing changes in manufactured parts and components trade in the region. This trade is also fostered by duty-free imports in the export enclaves provided by the host economies for these MNCs. In view of the conflicting empirical evidence on the trade effects of regional trade agreements, the objective of this study is to re-assess the impact of ACFTA on ASEAN's manufactured exports to China. In performing this analysis, we separately evaluate the effects of trade in parts and components (P&C) and non parts and components (non P&C) or final manufactured goods. When we apply gravity estimation methods to individual regressions for these two forms of trade, we find that the determinants of trade are indeed different for the two sectors, and that the implementation of ACFTA had different effects on P&C versus final goods ASEAN exports to China.","[Yean, Tham Siew; Yi, Andrew Kam Jia] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Yean, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",tham.siewyean@gmail.com; andrew@ukm.edu.my,"Kam Jia Yi, Andrew/R-4041-2017","Kam Jia Yi, Andrew/0000-0002-7608-2423",,,,,47,6,6,0,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Specifically, in this study, globalization is characterized not only by trade and financial integration but also by other important aspects, such as social globalization, political globalization and cultural globalization. The empirical results support the impacts of globalization on financial structure, which are, however, diverse and strongly depend on the way to measure globalization and financial structure. Our finding also reveals a significant change in financial structure after the globalization process, except the case of low-income countries, in which financial structure seems to be not correlated with either globalization process or other macroeconomic variables.","Univ Nantes, Inst Econ & Management, LEMNA, Nantes, France",Nantes Universite,"Pham, THH (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, Inst Econ & Management, LEMNA, Chemin Cens Tertre,BP 52231, Nantes, France.",thi-hong-hanh.pham@univ-nantes.fr,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article evaluates the potential implications of climate change for overall growth and development prospects in Malawi. We combine climate, biophysical and economic models to develop a structural analysis focused on three primary impact channels: agriculture, road infrastructure and hydropower generation. We account explicitly for the uncertainty in climate forecasts by exploiting the best available information on the likely distribution of climate outcomes. We find that climate change is unlikely to substantially slow overall economic growth over the next couple of decades. However, assuming that global emissions remain effectively unconstrained, climate change implications become more pronounced over time. Reduced agricultural yields and increased damage to road infrastructure due to increased frequency and intensity of extreme events are the principal impact channels. Owing to the potential for positive impacts in the near term, the net present value of climate impacts from 2007 to 2050 (using a 5% discount rate) can be positive or negative with an average loss of about USD 610 million. The main implication of our findings is that Malawian policy makers should look to exploit the coming decade or two as these represent a window of opportunity to develop smart and forward looking adaptation policies.

Our empirical analysis shows that, although democracies are significantly less likely to fight each other, democracies with leaders who face binding term limits are as conflict prone as autocracies. The study of electoral calendars confirms the importance of re-election incentives: in democracies with two-term limits, conflicts are less likely to occur during the executive's first mandate than in the last one.

The characteristics of the final FTA network naturally depend on how the proposer of an FTA is chosen in each period. The paper finds that if the country that has the largest incentive to form an FTA is chosen as a proposer in each period, the network evolution always leads to a unique final FTA network, which may or may not be the complete network of FTAs.

Despite widely expected additional welfare gains, the signing of the AA/DCFTA at the Third Eastern Partnership summit in November 2013 in Vilnius was suspended by the Ukrainian government due to geopolitical concerns and a severe economic and financial crisis in Ukraine coming along with high external debt and a substantial public budget deficit. This puts the fiscal consequences of Ukraine's continued liberalization into focus, as transition and developing countries face higher fiscal costs associated with trade integration. Accordingly, this paper contributes to the literature by analyzing the part of the potential EU-Ukraine DCFTA which leads to a loss of tariff revenues, namely the tariff elimination. In particular, we apply a static Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for the single small open economy of Ukraine and focus on the effects of Ukraine's unilateral tariff elimination by simulating three scenarios reflecting different means to compensate for the loss of tariff revenues. It turns out to be important to take these costs into consideration while modeling trade liberalization, as the results vary significantly across the scenarios.","[Frey, Miriam] Univ Regensburg, Inst East & Southeast European Studies, D-93047 Regensburg, Germany; [Olekseyuk, Zoryana] Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Int Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung; University of Regensburg; University of Duisburg Essen,"Frey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Inst East & Southeast European Studies, Landshuter Str 4, D-93047 Regensburg, Germany.",frey@ios-regensburg.de; Zoryana.Olekseyuk@ibes.uni-due.de,,"Olekseyuk, Zoryana/0000-0001-9403-8234",,,,,31,6,6,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2014,41,3,,,SI,,505,540,,10.1007/s10663-014-9249-z,0.0,,,36,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AL4OW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339113300008,0

The solution of the model reveals that the stricter the redistributive rule, the higher are steady-state fiscal efficiency and welfare. While the effectiveness of the redistributive parameters increases with centralization of the revenue pool, it decreases with the tax rate.

Solving a fully nonlinear micro-founded (FNL) model using a global method, I find that the central bank in a more distorted economy would cut the interest rate less aggressively under a particularly adverse demand shock. This occurs because inflation and nominal interest rates are higher on average, making the ZLB less likely to bind and causing the economy to escape from the ZLB sooner. However, the social planner would choose the optimal inflation rate of approximately zero. The result emerges because the unconditional benefit of avoiding the ZLB is not big enough to offset the cost of higher relative price dispersion when inflation is significantly positive. In addition, I show that the conventional linear-quadratic (LQ) method is inaccurate in the case of a sufficiently distorted steady state. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, those risks associated with international trade payments, including credit risk, can directly impact an exporter's survival, indicating a crucial need for the effective management of such risks. However, most exporters prefer the letter of credit, which involves some serious problems, and thus requires effective and innovative international trade payment methods. This study provides a review of the literature on international factoring, which is selected mainly by exporters in developed countries, and investigates the relationship between international factoring and risk management. Based on a survey of 221 small and medium-sized exporters, the study employs risk awareness and expertise in int'l trade as determinants of the use of international factoring and provides an empirical analysis of the relationships between these determinants, adoption of international factoring, and export performance. According to the results, risk awareness and expertise in int'l trade had significant effects, not only on export performance, but also on the use of international factoring, indicating their pivotal roles in the adoption of international factoring. In addition, the adoption of international factoring fully mediated the relationships of risk awareness and expertise in int'l trade to export performance, implying that international factoring facilitated the effective credit risk management of international trade payments.

Our results for imported inputs are comparable in magnitude with that for exports.","[Amin, Mohammad; Islam, Asif] World Bank, Enterprise Anal Unit, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Islam, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Enterprise Anal Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",asif.m.islam@gmail.com,"Islam, Asif/AAQ-2113-2020; Islam, Asif/IQR-5824-2023",,,,,,7,4,5,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

If the countries in each scaling region are regarded as a group, the world is divided into two groups, each with a roughly stable number of members. The power exponents of the two groups are different and hence lead to different inequalities. Therefore, the basis for classification is the macro-consistent inequality within each group. The wealth grows in a synchronous nonlinear manner within groups that have a stable wealth distribution and rank structure.

Unfortunately, the optimal floor system requires either transfers from the fiscal authority to the central bank or a reduction in seigniorage payments from the central bank to the government. This is the unpleasant fiscal arithmetic of a floor system. When the central bank faces financing constraints on its interest expense, we show that it is strictly optimal to operate a channel system.

First, recessions are deeper, steeper and costlier among EMEs (especially in East Asia and Latin America). Second, recoveries are swifter and stronger among EMEs, partly due to stronger rebound effects. Third, recessions became less costly during the globalization period (1985-2007) for industrial countries and EMEs, thus reflecting institutional changes made during the Great Moderation. Fourth, the dynamic behavior of macroeconomic indicators around peaks in real GDP is more volatile in downturns associated with crisis compared to other downturns. Fifth, peaks in financial cycles (credit and asset prices) tend to precede peaks in real output cycles. Finally, although both industrial and emerging markets have experienced deep recessions during the recent global financial crisis, the emerging markets have recovered faster. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is well known that no rule is individually rational, efficient, and strategy-proof. In order to quantify the extent of this impossibility, we parametrize axioms on allocation rules. Given an axiom A, a parametrization of A is a continuum of axioms {delta-A}(delta is an element of[0,1]) such that (i) delta-A is equivalent to A if and only if delta = 1; (ii) delta-A is vacuous if and only if delta = 0; and (iii) for each pair delta,delta' is an element of [0, 1] with delta < delta'-A implies delta-A. Thus, as delta decreases from 1 to 0, delta-A weakens monotonically, eventually to a vacuous requirement. We consider two parametrizations {delta-efficiency}(delta is an element of [0,1]) and {delta-strategy-proofness}(delta is an element of [0, 1]), and investigate their compatibility with individual rationality for the class of two-agent economies defined on the linear preference domain. We show that (i) for each delta is an element of (0, 1], no rule is individually rational, delta-efficient, and strategy-proof; and (ii) for each delta is an element of (0, 1], no rule is individually rational, efficient, and delta-strategy-proof.

We provide a unification using a model of directed innovations with identical but non-homothetic preferences. For the South, a major benefit of protecting IPRs is incentivizing innovations that better address its needs (the directed-innovation benefit), and a major cost is yielding monopoly rents to innovators (the monopoly-rent cost). When preferences are non-homothetic, the directed-innovation benefit decreases in South's income, because consumption baskets of the South become more similar to those of the North; while the monopoly-rent cost increases in the South's income, because higher income admits greater monopoly markups. The combined effect implies that the costs of IPRs protection tend to outweigh the benefits for mid-income countries, while the opposite is true for low-income ones. We discuss the policy implications of this observation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Secondly, instead of maximizing an economic utility, the stopping time is used to maximize the market value of future cash-flows. Thirdly, a solution is proposed in terms of Expected Present Value operators: this shows that the non-annuitization (or continuation) region is either delimited by a lower or upper boundary, in the domain time-assets return. The necessary conditions are given under which these mutually exclusive boundaries exist. Further, a method is proposed to compute the probability of annuitization.

The paper reveals significant differences in market outcomes, in both elasticity and response to entry, across submarkets.","[Haynes, Michelle; Thompson, Steve] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Wright, Peter W.] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Nottingham; University of Sheffield,"Haynes, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,,,,,,,28,2,3,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Empirically, little has been done to examine (i) how pervasive this tendency is across the Engel curves of different goods and services, (ii) whether the rate at which Engel curves flatten out may significantly change over time and (iii) how robust Engel curves are in the face of changes in the income distribution of households. Using data from the UK Family Expenditure Survey, we find evidence that the tendency for Engel curves to flatten out, which we dub 'saturation', is indeed widespread across a wide range of goods and services. However, a tendency for their shape to shift over time, and for these shifts to co-move with changes in the income distribution of households, casts some doubt on whether the declining slope of Engel curves can be used to predict slowdowns in the growth rate of demand for particular goods and services.","[Moneta, Alessio] Max Planck Inst Econ, Jena, Germany; [Chai, Andreas] Griffith Univ, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia",Max Planck Society; Griffith University,"Chai, A (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast Campus, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia.",a.chai@griffith.edu.au,,"MONETA, Alessio/0000-0003-4786-9507; Chai, Andreas/0000-0003-0838-9324",,,,,104,25,26,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

To remedy this deficiency, we construct a measure of parents' sociability skills based on their occupational characteristics extracted from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT). Even after controlling for a variety of background characteristics, including cognitive skills, we find that the sociability relationships between fathers and sons and between mothers and daughters remain statistically significant. We find that the dollar value to the sons of a given increase in their fathers' sociability is one-sixth of the value to the sons of the same standard-deviation increase in their fathers' education.","[Usui, Emiko] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Usui, Emiko] IZA, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Okumura, Tsunao] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Social Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan",Nagoya University; Yokohama National University,"Usui, E (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",okumura@ynu.ac.jp; usui@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Okumura, Tsunao/E-5440-2016; Usui, Emiko/G-8936-2012","Okumura, Tsunao/0000-0002-9605-9052; Usui, Emiko/0000-0001-7686-4655","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22000001, 23730233] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,25,3,5,2,18,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We employ the ARDL Bounds test to cointegration and CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests to ensure cointegration and parameter stability. The estimated results show that the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis holds in Japan and South Korea. In the other six countries, the long-run relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions follows an N-shaped trajectory and the estimated turning points are much higher than the sample mean. In addition, the results indicate that energy consumption Granger-causes both CO2 emissions and economic growth in all the countries. Our results are consistent with previous studies that show that there is no unique relationship between energy consumption, population density, economic growth, trade openness, and the environment across countries.

Return correlations, price return distributions, cointegration and Granger-causalities are tested in subsamples on monthly FAO Food Price Index and MSCI World Stock Market Index. Empirical results suggest that while there is only weak indication of greater comovements concurrent with structural changes such as changed agricultural policies, new demand due to growth in emerging markets and energy mandates and the financialization of food markets since the early 2000s, they did start to increase substantially in particular during the financial stress of the Lehman crisis and the Great Recession. While structural changes may have amplified price linkages across markets, results do not suggest that they are the key factors for greater price comovements. Instead, the effects of the late-2000s recession as a time of great economic weakness and uncertainty may have changed concurrently the behaviour of both food and financial market participants, such that different market prices exhibit large comovements.","Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Lehecka, GV (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",georg.lehecka@boku.ac.at,,,,,,,47,8,8,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Econometric modelling confirms the presence of economies of scale and scope in wireless spectrum valuations. That is, higher prices are recorded for areas with large populations, whilst lower prices are realized for geographically large areas. Also, smaller geographic license areas appear to meet bidders' demand more effectively, and licenses in areas with high incomes are sold at higher prices. Not surprisingly, more strict deployment requirements and the presence of harmful technical interference reduce prices. Also, paired spectrum receives higher prices than unpaired spectrum. Interestingly, high minimum opening bids and upfront deposits are associated with higher prices. Finally, competitive bidding places upward pressure on prices.","[Madden, Gary] Curtin Univ, Dept Econometr & Quantitat Modeling, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Bohlin, Erik] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Technol Management & Econ, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kraipornsak, Paitoon] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Tran, Thien] Curtin Univ, Ctr Res Appl Econ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University; Chalmers University of Technology; Chulalongkorn University; Curtin University,"Madden, G (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Dept Econometr & Quantitat Modeling, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",g.madden@curtin.edu.au,,"Bohlin, Erik/0000-0001-5771-6438",,,,,19,3,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A simple model, built upon one developed by Newhouse (1977), suggests that health care is a necessity in the short run but it cannot be rejected to be a luxury good in the long run. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that a year's health expenditure is conditioned by the previous one. Interestingly, our results reveal increasing income inelasticity over time along with huge heterogeneity across countries. Finally, this article supports the hypothesis of conditional convergence in health-care spending among countries. In designing policies which facilitate the sustainability of national health systems, we emphasize that ceteris paribus the greater the participation of public health, the lower the growth rate of health spending. High share of children and elderly over working age population opposite influences. We also provide evidence that technological progress could reduce the long-run income elasticity for health care, which in turn threaten the sustainability of health-care systems.","[Blazquez-Fernandez, Carla; Cantarero, David; Perez, Patricio] Univ Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Cantarero, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",david.cantarero@unican.es,,"Blazquez-Fernandez, Carla/0000-0002-0204-7174",,,,,52,9,10,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We study the effects of a page limit policy introduced by the American Economic Review (AER) in mid-2008 and subsequently adopted by the Journal of the European Economic Association (JEEA) in 2009. We find that the imposition of a 40-page limit on submissions led to no change in the flow of new papers to the AER. Instead, authors responded by shortening and reformatting their papers. For JEEA, in contrast, we conclude that the page-limit policy led authors of longer papers to submit to other journals. These results imply that the AER has substantial monopoly power over submissions, while JEEA faces a very competitive market. Evidence from both journals, and from citations to published papers in the top journals, suggests that longer papers are of higher quality than shorter papers, so the loss of longer submissions at JEEA may have led to a drop in quality.

After the global financial crisis (GFC), Asian economies with more open and developed capital markets experienced greater swings in capital inflows. In particular, large capital flows manifest more in portfolio investment and other investment such as bank loans than in foreign direct investment. Empirical analysis shows QE, QE1 in particular, significantly contributed to the rebounding of capital inflows to the region after the onset of the crisis by lowering domestic yield rates as well as CDS premiums. Although the currency value responses differed across countries, it appears that economies with stable exchange rates roughly coincide with those in which house prices have been rising, suggesting that monetary easing of advanced countries have affected Asian countries through either appreciation of currency values or increases in the prices of housing.","[Cho, Dongchul] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Rhee, Changyong] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Philippines",KDI School of Public Policy & Management; Asian Development Bank,"Rhee, C (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Philippines.",dccho@kdischool.ac.kr; crhee@adb.org,,,,,,,16,12,14,3,37,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The results suggest that spillovers in exchange rate returns have increased steadily over time, in moderate reaction to economic events. In contrast, spillovers in total observed volatility (measured by squared returns) react more strongly to economic events, and this transmission has remained at a relatively high level since the global financial crisis. Furthermore, over the course of time, global shocks would appear to account for a larger proportion of aggregate exchange rate volatility (and the relative importance of domestic shocks has declined). The paper also considers whether the increase in volatility spillover is due to sudden shocks, or whether it is due to changes in the stochastic trend of the underlying volatility process. The results suggests that in most cases, this increase is due to sudden shocks, however, in certain instances country-specific events may perpetuate changes to the trend of the underlying volatility spillover.","[Kavli, Haakon] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Kotze, Kevin] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Cape Town,"Kavli, H (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",kavli.haakon@gmail.com,,"Kotze, Kevin/0000-0002-7968-266X",,,,,64,9,11,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

To deal with the potential endogeneity in the sense that inherently more capable entrepreneurs may self-select into MNEs before launching their own businesses, we use a nonparametric way, i.e., the propensity score matching (PSM) method, to identify the MNE treatment effect. The PSM estimates remain consistent with the OLS evidence, and the estimates are robust to different sensitivity analyses. We further find that private firms run by MNE-trained entrepreneurs do operate differently from their counterparts in both their global involvement and internal management, which are the underlying channels of the spillovers.

Due to a special fact in Vietnam that there exist a great deal of people who are under the compulsory scheme but get no insurances, we are able to estimate the effects of moral hazard and adverse selection using a matching estimator technique. Our results show that with outpatient services, moral hazard and adverse selection are very severe in Vietnam for old people, and not for young people; and that for inpatient service, the effects are insignificant.

In this paper we evaluate the performance of nonparametric density smoothing techniques, in particular kernel density estimation, in estimating poverty from grouped data. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that kernel density estimation gives rise to nontrivial biases in estimated poverty levels that depend on the bandwidth, kernel, poverty indicator, size of the dataset, and data generating process. Furthermore, the empirical bias in the poverty headcount ratio critically depends on the poverty line. We also undertake a sensitivity analysis of global poverty estimates to changes in the bandwidth and show that they vary widely with it. A comparison of kernel density estimation with parametric estimation of the Lorenz curve, also applied to grouped data, suggests that the latter fares better and should be the preferred approach.","[Minoiu, Camelia] Int Monetary Fund, IMF Inst, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Reddy, Sanjay G.] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",International Monetary Fund; The New School,"Minoiu, C (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, IMF Inst, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",CMinoiu@imf.org; reddys1@newschool.edu,,"Minoiu, Camelia/0000-0003-4819-0934",,,,,44,17,19,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

In institutional economics, there is extensive support for entrepreneurship as having a positive impact on economic development and personal wellbeing. This paper challenges the accepted understanding of social entrepreneurs as being heroic, and their process of starting a new venture as beginning with passion or with the recognition of a social problem. Through examining the case of Clean the World, a social enterprise, we demonstrate that not all social ventures start with the intention of creating social value, but with the question: How can I make a profit? We discuss a recently proposed paradigm called effectual entrepreneurship, and then we illustrate how this paradigm fits the path of Clean the World. Effectual entrepreneurs have questioned the status quo and have focused on the existing or available resources, rather than on identifying opportunities first. We then explore how Clean the World fell into social entrepreneurship by accident, while considering waste a resource. We conclude by making some suggestions about how to facilitate more of these accidents by fostering a culture that questions the status quo.","[Parris, Denise L.; McInnis-Bowers, Cecilia V.] Rollins Coll, Dept Business & Social Entrepreneurship, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA",Rollins College,"Parris, DL (通讯作者)，Rollins Coll, Dept Business & Social Entrepreneurship, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA.",,"PENG, Xiao-bao/J-4466-2012",,,,,,23,15,18,1,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

By a comprehensive literature survey, this paper shows that the hukou system plays in two major roles in current China. First, workers with different hukou face different costs of living in cities and have different access to government-provided public services and welfare programs in the urban areas. Migrants with rural and non-local hukou working in the Chinese big cities have no or little access to welfare programs provided by local city governments. Second, there exists labor market discrimination against rural hukou holders in cities, especially in the urban high-wage sector such as state-owned enterprises. The current hukou system has a negative impact on rural-to-urban migration in China as well as on economic efficiency and equality by reducing the expected benefits associated with migration.

The aim of this article is to estimate expenditure and own-price elasticities for 10 aggregated food product groups using the Spanish Household Budget Survey for the year 2010. These products are the ones for which the survey provides information regarding prices and quantities, thus allowing the application of an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model with censored data. The estimation procedure allows not only comparisons to be made among households with different levels of income, but also the contribution of residence characteristics to variations in demand. The results confirm that the size of the city in which the household resides has a similar significant and relevant effect on consumption patterns as family income level. This is especially clear with own-price elasticities. In Spain, large central cities show a greater response to price changes than smaller cities or rural peripheral areas.","[Lasarte Navamuel, Elena; Rubiera Morollon, Fernando] Univ Oviedo, REGIOlab Reg Econ Lab, Oviedo, Spain; [Paredes, Dusan] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile; [Paredes, Dusan] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL USA",University of Oviedo; Universidad Catolica del Norte; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Morollón, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, REGIOlab Reg Econ Lab, Oviedo, Spain.",frubiera@uniovi.es,"Paredes, Dusan/G-9432-2012; Lasarte, Elena/AEJ-6324-2022","Paredes, Dusan/0000-0002-7090-5919; Lasarte, Elena/0000-0002-5667-3832; Rubiera Morollon, Fernando/0000-0002-4854-0802",,,,,40,7,7,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Theoretically, trade reforms will affect this share by reducing firm-level price-cost markups as well as the bargaining power of workers. A simple model suggests that these changes can have ambiguous effects on firm-level labor share and that the net effect of trade reforms will depend on the labor intensity of production. Using firm-level data from India, our empirical results suggest that trade liberalization led to an increase in labor's share in revenue for small, labor-intensive firms but a reduction in this share in the case of larger, less labor-intensive firms. These results are robust to controlling for alternative sources of heterogeneity and to the use of long-lagged tariffs as instruments. We also find that trade liberalization, on average, led to a decline in the bargaining power of workers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show the high probability of exit of exporters at the start of the period.

Three allocation mechanisms are investigated: allocator, tremble. and egalitarian. The allocator mechanism, based on institutions observed in the field, is the primary mechanism of interest. In this treatment condition, one person in a group is exogenously chosen to allocate shares of the CPR to other group members. After observing group members' provision decisions, the allocator chooses shares of the CPR to allocate to each group member. The other two mechanisms serve as controls for examining the extent to which the allocator mechanism affects provision of the CPR. The tremble mechanism randomly divides the CPR between group members using the same division rules as the allocator mechanism. The egalitarian mechanism divides the CPR equally between group members. Provision of the CPR does not decay over time and is significantly closer to the group's socially optimal level under the allocator mechanism than under the tremble and egalitarian mechanisms. From a policy perspective, these results suggest that utilizing institutions such as the allocator mechanism in the field can facilitate greater levels of cooperation in promoting the provision of shared resources.

Its key contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a family of dynamic conditional correlation models based on hierarchical Archimedean copulae (HAC-DCC), which are flexible but parsimonious instruments that capture a wide range of dynamic dependencies. Second, we apply these models in the context of commodity forward curves as part of the framework An extensive Value-at-Risk analysis shows that certain HAC-DCC models consistently outperform other introduced benchmarks in terms of the preciseness of their out-of-sample distribution forecasts of the returns of various commodity futures portfolios. This shows that the proposed modelling framework, as one of its possible applications, can be a useful and convenient risk management tool. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show that if market structure is uncompetitive, much of casino taxation falls on tourists whose demand is inelastic relative to supply. The tax is likely to be efficient under strong external demand if imposed on oligopoly casinos with a monopoly location in a cross-border market. The likelihood of economically good' taxation is greater under oligopoly than under competition but lower than under monopoly. Casino taxes should be lowered in a more competitive market with weaker external demand.

With adjustment for the quality of inputs TFP growth rates declined from a rate of 1.5% per annum in the early 1960s to less than 0.5% per annum by the late 1970s. Since then the growth rate has risen steadily so by the early 2000s it was close to the levels achieved at the beginning of the period. These results follow from using a novel semi-parametric econometric approach to estimating TFP. Recent advances in panel econometrics are used to show the heterogeneity of TFP growth rates across countries. Expenditures on agricultural R&D, along with the reform of macroeconomic and sectoral policies have played a substantial role in explaining this pattern of TFP growth.","Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Block, SA (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",steven.block@tufts.edu,,,,,,,42,13,14,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Individuals who translate their potential earning into actual earnings enjoy a fully efficient position. In contrast, individuals who earn less than their potential earnings suffer from some kind of earnings inefficiency. The paper estimates an earnings frontier using the Corrected Ordinary Least Square (COLS) method and classifies households in terms of efficiency scores. Splitting the sample into an efficient and an inefficient part based on the estimated frontier and a bench mark efficiency score, the status of poverty in the two parts (groups) is studied. The poverty gap between the groups is then decomposed into a characteristics effect and a coefficients effect using the familiar Oaxaca decomposition methodology. The paper also tries to establish a link between the notion of efficiency and the coefficients effect in the Oaxaca decomposition methodology. The results obtained are interpreted in light of the poor but efficient hypothesis.","[Chattopadhyay, Somnath] Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata 700108, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata,"Chattopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India.",pikluchatterjee@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

We answer this question in the context of U.S. cities, where women's participation in mayoral elections increased from negligible numbers in 1970 to about one-third of the elections in the 2000's. A novel data set of U.S. mayoral elections from 1950 to 2005 was used, and a regression discontinuity design was employed to deal with the endogeneity of female candidacy to city characteristics. In contrast to most research on the influence of female leadership, we find no effect of gender of the mayor on policy outcomes related to the size of local government, the composition of municipal spending and employment, or crime rates. These results hold both in the short and the long run. While female mayors do not implement different policies, they do appear to have higher unobserved political skills, as they have at least a 5 percentage point higher incumbent effect than a comparable male. But we find no evidence of political spillovers: exogenously electing a female mayor does not change the long run political success of other female mayoral candidates in the same city or of female candidates in local congressional elections.

In a limited commitment economy, there are externalities associated with capital and labour because individuals do not take into account that their labour and saving decisions affect aggregate labour and capital supply and wages, and thus the value of autarky. Therefore, a Ramsey government has an additional goal, which is to internalize these externalities of labour and capital to improve risk sharing, in addition to its usual goal-minimizing distortions in financing government expenditures. These two goals drive capital and labour taxes in opposite directions. It is shown that the steady-state optimal capital income taxes are levied only to remove the negative externality of the capital, whereas optimal labour income taxes are set to meet the budgetary needs of the government in the long run, despite the presence of positive externalities of labour.","Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Park, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,29,10,13,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We also show, however, that the effects of microfinance on reducing income inequality are relatively small. The results of this study add to the discussion on the impact of microfinance on poverty by showing that, although access to microfinance does seem to improve the relative income position of the poor, this improvement is modest, which is probably because the use of microfinance is generally small as compared to the size of the economy of the countries in our sample.

In this essay, I address four questions about uncertainty. First, what are some facts and patterns about economic uncertainty? Both macro and micro uncertainty appear to rise sharply in recessions and fall in booms. Uncertainty also varies heavily across countries-developing countries appear to have about one-third more macro uncertainty than developed countries. Second, why does uncertainty vary during business cycles? Third, do fluctuations in uncertainty affect behavior? Fourth, has higher uncertainty worsened the Great Recession and slowed the recovery?

That relationship results from the interrelationship between factors contributing to relative participation in higher education and the size of youth populations. The development patterns of the relative and absolute participation in undergraduate higher education in Slovenia are presented. In order to empirically test the authors' hypotheses, two separate multiple regression analyses were conducted. The first analyzes factors of the demographic base, and the second analyzes factors of the relative participation in undergraduate higher education. The results reveal the factors contributing to both the demographic base and relative participation in undergraduate higher education and identifies the significant factor linking them to each other. This factor works in one direction in the case of the demographic base and in the opposite direction in the case of the relative participation in undergraduate higher education, causing the relationship between changes in relative and absolute participation in higher education.

We find that inter-platform competition has no significant effects over prices, while intra-platform competition is a key driver of the prices charged in the broadband market.

Several authors have argued that economic inequality was important to the growth of this market. This paper attempts to strengthen this argument by concentrating attention on global wealth concentration. After summarising recent evidence on the negative impact of investor demand on US bond yields in the pre-crisis period, new evidence regarding the specific contribution of high-net-worth individuals to this negative impact is presented. The paper then goes on to show how, after having helped to cause a yield problem in the major US debt markets, high-net-worth individuals (via hedge funds) continued to be a major source of the pressure on US banks to resolve this yield problem through the mass production of CDOs.","[Goda, Thomas] Univ EAFIT, Medellin, Colombia; [Lysandrou, Photis] City Univ CITYPERC, London, England; [Lysandrou, Photis] Sch Oriental & African Studies, London, England",Universidad EAFIT; City University London; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Goda, T (通讯作者)，Univ EAFIT, Sch Econ & Finance, Carrera 49 7 Sur 50, Medellin, Colombia.",tgoda@eafit.edu.co,,"Goda, Thomas/0000-0002-4209-9657",,,,,66,35,37,1,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The inflated payoffs keep the best reply structure unchanged and do not influence players' security levels. Our design allows control for the explanatory force of risk dominance. We find that equilibrium selection theory is unable to account for coordination failure while observed behavior is consistent with non-rational learning.

The analysis of this problem is a main subject of the article. Authors develop microeconomic model of commercial bank behaviour, which is used for the definition of conditions when the interest rate policy of central bank based alternatively on repo rates for repo and reverse repo operations is efficient. Statistical data (time series of 1998 2011, monthly data frequency) are analysed and econometric verification of alternative forms of econometric models is performed. The authors arrived at a conclusion that the Czech National Bank's monetary policy operating in conditions of excess liquidity withdrawal through repo operations is efficient. In case of the Czech Republic an increase in repo rate on withdrawal repo should lead to an increase in interest rates of commercial banks and to a reduction in the credit activity of commercial banks and hence to the successful implementation of Czech National Bank's restrictive monetary policy.","[Mandel, Martin; Tomsik, Vladimir] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Tomsik, Vladimir] Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech National Bank,"Mandel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,35,7,7,2,12,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

We introduce time-nonseparable preferences into a standard model of a small open economy, where imported oil is used both as an intermediate input in production and as a consumption good. Using a plausible calibration of the model, we show that the changes in output and employment are quite small, and that the current account exhibits the J-curve property, both being in line with recent empirical evidence. After an oil price increase, employment falls and the current account first deteriorates. Over time, with gradually falling expenditures, the trade balance improves sufficiently to turn the current account into a surplus. The model thus provides a plausible explanation of recent empirical findings.","[Schubert, Stefan F.] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Schubert, SF (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Piazza Univ 1, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy.",StefanFranz.Schubert@unibz.it,,,,,,,51,12,12,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Within a country, household wealth has been shown to improve individual well-being by providing a safety net of protection against negative income shocks, by allowing current and expected consumption flows, and by its potential use as a collateral. At the aggregate level, direct evidence about the relationship between national wealth and happiness is almost non-existent, owing to data limitations and statistical identification problems. However, aggregate wealth impacts well-being indirectly, via positive channels, such as institutional quality and improvement in health, life expectancy, and education. Wealth also brings about negative environmental degradations and other damages. The stock of accumulated wealth is also likely to affect happiness indirectly, via its influence on the rate of GDP growth, because both the level of income flows and the rate of income growth have been shown to be factors of higher well-being.","Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Senik, C (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",senik@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,69,30,35,2,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Our modelling results are clear in their implications: hardship policy for energy customers requires re-engineering. The structure of electricity tariffs requires an overhaul-shifting to interval meters, time-of-use pricing and monthly billing to redress the investment megacycle and the incidence of hardship.","[Simshauser, Paul; Nelson, Tim] AGL Energy, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Simshauser, Paul] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Nelson, Tim] Univ New England, Sch Econ, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",Griffith University; University of New England,"Simshauser, P (通讯作者)，AGL Energy, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",psimshauser@agl.com.au,"Simshauser, Paul/H-1244-2015; Nelson, Tim/H-4450-2018","Simshauser, Paul/0000-0003-1857-550X; Nelson, Tim/0000-0003-4846-3787",,,,,35,25,26,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

A novel feature of this work is that in both models investment costs are time dependent which adds an extra dimension to the decision problem. Our deterministic model allows for quite general dependence on carbon price and consideration of time to build and simple calculus techniques determine the optimal time to invest. We then analyse the effect of carbon price volatility on the optimal investment decision by solving a Bellman equation with an infinite planning horizon. We find that increasing the carbon price volatility increases the critical investment threshold and that adoption of this technology is not optimal at current prices, in agreement with other works. However reducing carbon price volatility by switching from carbon permits to taxes or by introducing a carbon floor as in Great Britain would accelerate the adoption of carbon abatement technologies such as CCS.

In the past decades, researches and development in the field have accelerated and seem to continue growing exponentially. Despite the intensive development worldwide, few attempts have been made to systematically present the theoretical bases and developments of multi-criteria decision-making methods. However, the methodological choices and framework for assessment of decisions are still under discussion. The article describes the situation with reviews of MCDM/MADM methods.

Financial leverage refers to the ratio of long-term debt to total capital. The endogeneity of the firm-specific marginal after-financing corporate income tax rate is controlled for by an instrumental variable approach. The instrument for the observed marginal tax rate is the counterfactual tax rate that a corporation would have faced in a particular period had there been no endogenous change, triggered by the tax reform, of its financial leverage and tax base. This counterfactual tax rate is derived from a detailed microsimulation model of the corporate sector, based on tax return microdata. The marginal tax rate has a statistically significant and relatively large positive effect on corporate leverage; for firms reporting positive profits, an increase of the marginal tax rate of 1 % would increase the financial leverage by approximately 0.7 %, on average. The debt ratio is less responsive to tax incentives for small corporations and firms facing high economic risks.","[Dwenger, Nadja] Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Steiner, Viktor] Free Univ Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Max Planck Society; Free University of Berlin,"Dwenger, N (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, Marstallpl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",nadja.dwenger@tax.mpg.de; viktor.steiner@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,55,18,19,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The company with which we worked sent 7,250 letters asking customers to complete a survey. Some letters promised to pay amounts ranging from $1 to $30 upon compliance (contingent incentives), whereas others already contained the money in the request envelopes (noncontingent incentives). Compared to no payment, very small contingent payments lower the response rate while small noncontingent payments raise the response rate. As expected, response rates rise with the size of the incentive offered. The response rate in the noncontingent incentives rises more rapidly for low amounts of incentive, but then flattens out and reaches lower levels than under contingent payments.

Government expenditure, which may be subject to different degrees of congestion, is financed by distortionary income taxation. The standard result on the equality between the growth-maximizing, welfare-maximizing and first-best income tax rates holds if and only if production is Cobb-Douglas or there is proportional congestion. With non-proportional (or in the absence of) congestion, the first-best income tax is lower than the (second-best) welfare-maximizing income tax which, in turn, is lower than the growth-maximizing income tax if the elasticity of substitution is below unity. Under mild conditions these relations are reversed if the elasticity of substitution is above unity.

In fact, the volatility structure of these models depends on a first exogenous Markov chain whereas the drift structure depends on a conditional Markov chain with respect to the first one. The structure is also assumed to be Markovian and both structure and regime are unobserved. Regarding this construction, we extend the classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to be applied to our regime switching model. We apply it to economic data (Euro/Dollar (USD) foreign exchange rate and Brent oil price) to show that such modelling clearly identifies both mean reverting and volatility regime switches. Moreover, it allows us to make economic interpretations of this regime classification as in some financial crises or some economic policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The determinants of terrorism include various socio-economic variables like GDP per capita, unemployment, political rights, inflation, poverty, inequality and literacy level. A long-run relationship between the variables is analyzed by applying Johansen co-integration technique. The Error Correction Model (ECM) is applied to determine the stability of the long run relationship between terrorism and various variables and also to streamline the short-run and long run impacts of the variables on terrorism. In general, the results revealed that there exists a long run relationship between various social and economic variables and terrorism while the results of ECM revealed that about 89% convergence towards equilibrium takes place every year. Similarly, important results are obtained by short run and long run elasticities estimated under the Error Correction Model. Impulse response analysis reveals that the impacts of one standard deviation shock given to random disturbances on the systems of variables have mixed results.

The first condition (unrequited transfers between governments) requires that transfers are designed in such a way that the marginal valuations of the global public goods are equalized, whereas the second (conditional revenue changes) requires that the change in global tax revenues, as a consequence of tax harmonization, is consistent with the under/over-provision of global public goods relative to the (modified) Samuelson rule. Under these conditions, tax harmonization results in redistributing the gains from a reduction in global deadweight loss and any changes in global tax revenues according to the Pareto principle.

An employee with private information about the value of his idea can create a spin-out, work in a division of the parent firm, or work for a spinoff of the parent firm. Developing an idea in a spinoff allows the parent firm to offer a performance-based contract, which mitigates the adverse selection problem but also decreases the firm's incentives to invest in the project. Therefore, inefficient spin-outs are driven by the informational asymmetry and the endogenous investment of the parent firm. The characteristics of the innovation, the employee's managerial talent, and the firm's performance in its core activity affect the likelihood a spin-out is created. The implementation of employees' ideas in turn affects the innovation process. Ideas with a lower probability of being good are more likely to be explored by an employee within the firm than by an outsider. (c) 2014 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper integrates these two frictions into a two-country overlapping-generations framework to facilitate a direct comparison of their respective effects. In our model, limited commitment distorts the investment made by agents with different productivity, which creates a wedge between the interest rates on equity capital vs. credit capital; while incomplete markets distort the investment among projects with different riskiness, which creates a wedge between the risk-free rate and the mean rate of return to risky capital. We show that the two approaches are observationally equivalent with respect to their implications for international capital flows, production efficiency, and aggregate output.","[von Hagen, Jurgen] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [von Hagen, Jurgen] CEPR, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Zhang, Haiping] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore; Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University of Bonn; Singapore Management University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Zhang, HP (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",vonhagen@uni-bonn.de; hpzhang@smu.edu.sg,"Zhang, Haiping/R-1035-2019; ZHANG, Haiping/D-1457-2009","Zhang, Haiping/0000-0003-3074-3772;",,,,,35,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The equilibrium stock price, which is affected by pessimistic sentiment at time 0, may be lower than the one at time 1.

We find low marginal cost of effort; consequently, wage disparity is negatively related to team performance.

These calculations are implemented using two different models comprising one with labour and capital as the classical production factors and one where we introduce patent stock as an additional factor of production. In the former, we further differentiate between a scenario where all production factors are mobile and one with sector-specific capital. In the latter analysis, we measure the impact of innovation-targeting policy action for sectoral output. Positive Rybczynski effects of patents and high-skilled workers are strongest in knowledge-intensive sectors, while other sectors contract.

Time series models have successfully solved prediction problems in many domains, including the stock market. Unfortunately, there are two major drawbacks in stock market by time-series model: (1) some models cannot be applied to the datasets that do not follow the statistical assumptions; and (2) most time-series models which use stock data with many noises involutedly (caused by changes in market conditions and environments) would reduce the forecasting performance. For solving the above problems and promoting the forecasting performance of time-series models, this paper proposes a hybrid time-series support vector regression (SVR) model based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to forecast stock price for Taiwan stock exchange capitalization weighted stock index (TAIEX). In order to evaluate the forecasting performances, the proposed model is compared with autoregressive (AR) model and SVR model.

The extreme return co-movement analysis is based on analysis of coincidences of extreme return shocks (co-exceedances; extreme returns are defined as lower 5% daily returns in the empirical return distributions) across investigated countries. I found that the first instances of co-exceedances between the Croatian and the observed European stock markets occurred in the 2007, during the subprime mortgage crisis as the predecessor of the global financial crisis. With the start of the global financial crisis, the count of co-exceedances across all observed pairs of stock markets markedly increased. In order to separate contagion from interdependence, I further applied a multinomial logistic function, that enabled me to control for common world and regional factors that affected all investigated stock markets simultaneously. In controlling for these factors I found that the increase in the count of negative return co-exceedances between the Croatian and major European stock markets during the global financial crisis and the eurozone debt crisis cannot be attributed to contagion.","Univ Maribor, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,22,6,6,2,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Our data show that employers pay significant wage premia for both traits. Firms make highest profits with trustworthy workers, in particular with highly productive and trustworthy workers.

The term 'pluralism' is extremely interesting since, as I will show, it has different dimensions to it. These offer insights into interpreting the tangled universe of the economics.

Therefore, understanding the functioning of money demand is extremely important for monetary policy decisions. In this paper we study money demand in the euroarea, investigating if its estimated stability is influenced by the monetary aggregate employed. This aspect is particularly relevant in the context of the European Monetary Union (EMU), as the European Central Bank (ECB) conducts monetary policy on the basis of the broad money aggregate M3 and one of the most relevant problems for monetary policy decisions in this area is the instability of money demand. By employing panel data techniques, we are able to show that the stability of the relation between money demand and its determinants changes depending on the monetary aggregate (M1, M2 or M3) employed as a proxy for money demand. Moreover, money demand is substantially more stable when M2 is considered. Then, by switching from M3 to M2 as the reference monetary aggregate can increase the estimated money demand stability and improve the performance of the ECB's monetary policy. This result is also confirmed by splitting the sample in two separate groups of countries. Nevertheless, in less stable economies the impact of inflation on money demand is significantly higher, while in more stable economies the role of income is more relevant.","[Foresti, Pasquale] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London WC2 2AE, England; [Napolitano, Oreste] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Business & Econ Studies, Naples, Italy",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Parthenope University Naples,"Foresti, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2 2AE, England.",p.foresti@lse.ac.uk; napolitano@uniparthenope.it,,"Napolitano, Oreste/0000-0001-6758-9823",,,,,35,3,4,0,7,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Yet we know very little about the motivation of the working poor in acquiring education. From a field study conducted in Bangladesh, we gain invaluable insights for the first time, to our best understanding, into the factors that shape the decision of a poor household to care about and respond to educational decisions of others in one's community. Based on the 'choice-theoretic framework of rational emulation and deviance', we empirically explain why some households choose to copy others, while some choose deviance even though social deviance in acquiring education can throw subjects into abject poverty.","[Gangopadhyay, Partha] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, South Penrith, Australia; [Rahman, Mustafa A.] North South Univ, Dept Econ, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Nath Bhattacharya, Biswa] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines",Western Sydney University; North South University (NSU); Asian Development Bank,"Gangopadhyay, P (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, South Penrith, Australia.",p.gangopadhyay@uws.edu.au,"Rahman, Mustafa/JMC-2036-2023","Gangopadhyay, Partha/0000-0001-6841-7791",,,,,64,0,1,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Complementing previous research, we show that consumer loss aversion can also have the opposite effect: it can lead a firm to optimally introduce risk into an otherwise deterministic environment. We consider a profit-maximizing monopolist selling to a loss-averse consumer, where (following Koszegi and Rabin 2006) we assume that the consumer's reference point is her recent rational expectations about the purchase. We establish that for any degree of consumer loss aversion, the monopolist's optimal price distribution consists of low and variable sale prices and a high and atomic regular price. Realizing that she will buy at the sales prices and hence that she will purchase with positive probability, the consumer chooses to avoid the painful uncertainty in whether she will get the product by buying also at the regular price. This pricing pattern is consistent with several recently documented facts regarding retailer pricing. We show that market power is crucial for this result: when firms compete ex ante for consumers, they choose deterministic prices.","[Heidhues, Paul] European Sch Management & Technol, Berlin, Germany; [Koszegi, Botond] Cent European Univ, Dept Econ, Budapest, Hungary",European School of Management & Technology; Central European University,"Heidhues, P (通讯作者)，European Sch Management & Technol, Berlin, Germany.",paul.heidhues@esmt.org; botond@econ.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,64,77,90,3,37,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

One firm has monopoly power in a first market but competes with another firm la Cournot in a second market. We compare treatments where the multi-product firm (i) always bundles, (ii) never bundles, and (iii) chooses whether to bundle or not. We also contrast the simultaneous and the sequential order of moves in the duopoly market. Our data indicate support for the theory of product bundling: with bundling and simultaneous moves, the multi-product firm offers the predicted number of units. When the multi-product firm is the Stackelberg leader, the predicted equilibrium is better attained with bundling, especially when it chooses to bundle, even though in theory bundling should not make a difference here. In sum, bundling works as a commitment device that enables the transfer of market power from one market to another. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the same year Darwin published The Descent of Man, which emphasized sympathy and cooperation as well as self-interest, and contained a powerful argument that morality has evolved in humans by natural selection. Essentially this stance is supported by modern research. This paper considers the nature of morality and how it has evolved. It reconciles Darwin's notion that a developed morality requires language and deliberation (and is thus unique to humans), with his other view that moral feelings have a long-evolved and biologically-inherited basis. The social role of morality and its difference with altruism is illustrated by an agent-based simulation. The fact that humans combine both moral and selfish dispositions has major implications for the social sciences and obliges us to abandon the pre-eminent notion of selfish economic man. Economic policy must take account of our moral nature.","Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Hodgson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Havilland Campus, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",g.m.hodgson@herts.ac.uk,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021",,,,,,113,24,25,0,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

It refers to the appropriate material and results from the research of different theories. It proposes the constitutive position of the power in the international situation. In contrast to some current theories, we emphasize the importance of the politico-economical approach, denoting that only the methodology based on the logics of political-economy can explain the dynamics of power in the international context. The main thread of this essay is that the international constellation is not a neutral environment, but a framework that is deeply determined by the power-relations. The central idea is that these relations should be explicated by the complex relationships between freedom and order. We analyze the interaction between the politics and economy as the constitutive feature of the structure of international context. This essay is divided into three sections. First, we are treating the meaning of order in an international context, in respect to the political-economic aspects of late capitalism. The notion of this order has a great importance in the economic reflections. The dynamic of the interconnectedness of global capitalism is examined considering the systematic aspects of power. After that we are analyzing different, and selected, aspects of the international sphere including: the spatiality of the world order, that is, the spatial aspects of the international dynamics in the context of globalization, the convergence or divergence between the capitalist and territorial logic, the legal-economic nexus in international chain, the processes of the modification of the forms of competition within recent globalization, and the political-economic conflicts in relation to the regime of economic measurement. Starting with these considerations we explain the current debates on demondialization, or the combination between neomercantilist and neoliberal policies.","[Josifidis, Kosta] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Dept European Econ & Business, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Losonc, Alpar] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Dept Social Sci, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad,"Josifidis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Dept European Econ & Business, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",josifidis@gmail.com; corna@eunet.rs,,,,,,,97,6,6,0,10,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2014,61,5,,,SI,,597,615,,10.2298/PAN1405597J,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AR8UI,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343849300006,0

First, we show that a uniform reduction of all tariffs improves welfare if a country's imports consist only of clean goods. If a clean good is a net substitute for all other goods in excess demand, then reducing the highest tariff on the clean good improves welfare. Second, we show that a proportional tariff reduction leading to a welfare improvement also increases the value of imports if all tariffs are set at the same ad valorem rates. If the clean good is a net substitute for all other goods in excess demand, then reducing the lowest tariff on the clean good increases the value of imports. Finally, we explore the link between the change in welfare and the change in the value of imports in response to the tariff reforms, and we show that unlike a proportional tariff reduction, a tariff reduction on the clean good does not necessarily lead to improvements in both welfare and market access.","Rissho Univ, Fac Econ, Shinagawa Ku, Tokyo 1418602, Japan",,"Kawahara, S (通讯作者)，Rissho Univ, Fac Econ, Shinagawa Ku, 4-2-16 Osaki, Tokyo 1418602, Japan.",kawahara@ris.ac.jp,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We find that downward nominal wage rigidity was present in Japan until the late 1990s, but disappeared after 1998 as annual wages became downwardly flexible. Moreover, nominal wage flexibility may have contributed to Japan's relatively low unemployment rates. Although macro-level movements in nominal wages and prices seemed to be synchronized, such synchronicity is not observed at the industry level. Therefore, wage deflation does not seem to be a primary factor of Japan's prolonged deflation.","[Kuroda, Sachiko] Waseda Univ, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Yamamoto, Isamu] Keio Univ, Tokyo 108, Japan",Waseda University; Keio University,"Kuroda, S (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Fac Educ & Integrated Arts & Sci, Shinjyuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",s-kuroda@waseda.jp,,"Yamamoto, Isamu/0000-0002-4936-613X; Kuroda, Sachiko/0000-0002-3125-3970",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26380371] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,38,9,10,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

What explains individuals' tendency to respond to the kindness of others? Existing theories posit internal preferences for the welfare of others, inequality aversion, or utility from repaying others' kindness. However, recent evidence on the determinants of (unilateral) sharing decisions suggests that external factors such as social pressure are equally important. So far, this second wave of social preference theories has had little spillover to two-sided reciprocity environments, in which one individual responds to the actions of another. We present a novel laboratory reciprocity experiment (the double-dictator game with sorting) and show that failure to account for external motives leads to a significant over-estimation of internal motives such as fairness and altruism. The experimental data illustrate the importance of combining reduced-form and structural analyses to disentangle internal and external determinants of prosocial behavior.","[Malmendier, Ulrike; te Velde, Vera L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Weber, Roberto A.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Zurich,"Malmendier, U (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ulrike@berkeley.edu,,"Malmendier, Ulrike/0000-0002-2786-4365; te Velde, Vera/0000-0002-4907-2801",,,,,98,29,32,0,58,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The process is a set of interconnected activities with interactions, which are transforming the object (as its input) into a result (as its output), where employees are adding a certain procedural values, using the resources of the organization. There are permanent requirements for the changes in performances, innovations, increasing flexibility and improving the economic performance of the company trough the process orientation. The main objective of this paper was to explore possibilities for improvement of important business processes, such as human resource management, in petroleum industry with the technique of business process reengineering and business process improvement. In this paper the authors presented the improvement process of one of the most important function in each organization - human resources function, by using management tools of BPR supported with the lean tools such as value stream mapping VSM. Methodology used in this paper included step approach in line with the Harvard Business School Business (HBS, 2010) process improvement supported with value stream mapping (VSM) lean tools. In the first part of the paper, the authors presented a theoretical review of the literature of business process reengineering and human resource management (HRM), with a special focus on the function of human resources in large companies where the research was done. After the theoretical review, business process improvement (BPI) of HRM in specific company was presented trough comparison of the state of HR function before restructuring and the state of the performances of the HR function after the BPI implementation with all the characteristics and efficiency indicators. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the combination of HBS methodology and VSM tools can contribute to the improvement in the form of the reductions of hierarchical levels in organization within the company and in the form of advancement of work processes within the company. This was primarily reflected in the increase of the effectiveness and efficiency, in reducing of the time required for the execution of the processes, and saving resources. This paper presents one year case study, where the research was made to point out the significance of BPR of HR function in large companies. The authors tried to explain the main areas of HR process in a large production companies so as the improvements could be achieved by using BPR techniques supported by VSM lean tools.","[Milan, Radosevic; Marko, Caric; Jovanovic, Vladimir; Avramovic, Nenad] Univ Business Acad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Milan, Baosic; Bojic, Zarko] DeltaPlan, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Dalibor, Beric] IG Baurehin GmbH, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",,"Milan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Business Acad, Cvecarska 2, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",r.milan13@gmail.com; baosicmilan@yahoo.com; macaric@yahoo.com; jovanovicvld@gmail.com; dalibor.beric@yahoo.com; zarko_bojic@yahoo.com; avramovic@pravni-fakultet.info,,"Caric, Marko/0009-0008-7675-9976; Radosevic, Milan/0000-0002-4273-8973",,,,,53,7,9,2,83,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this paper, we utilize the Fama-French-Carhart's (1997) four-factor asset pricing model augmented with oil price risk factor. The results of our study suggest that oil price sensitivities vary significantly across six subsectors: airlines, gambling, hotels, recreational services, restaurants and bars, and travel & tourism. The extent of the exposure is generally negative, but it is particularly significant for a number of subsectors including airlines, recreational services and restaurants and bars. We also document that oil price risk exposures vary considerably over time. In particular, the 20072009 recession triggered by the U.S. subprime lending crisis has significantly contributed to the oil price risk exposure of airline industry.

However, as grants may also affect other research funding, the effects of financial resources on knowledge production remain unclear. To uncover how financial resources affect knowledge production, we study the effects of research spending itself. Utilizing the legal constraints on university spending from an endowment we develop an instrumental variables approach. Our approach instruments for university research spending with time-series variation in stock prices interacted with cross-sectional variation in initial endowment market values for research universities in the United States. Our analysis reveals that research spending has a substantial positive effect on the number of papers produced, but not their impact.

A sample of 400 companies (KIBS SMEs) located in the Pomeranian District in Poland was selected. The questionnaire was designed to measure knowledge creation and knowledge sharing, team working, professional development and innovation performance. The findings indicate that companies with stronger leadership and support by the management and which employ motivational practices are more innovative than their competitors. This paper provides evidence of the significance of the critical success factors selected for KM in innovation processes. The research opens up the discussion on the relationship between KM critical success factors and company innovativeness. On the basis of the findings, managers in KIBS companies would do well to pay attention to managerial practices which foster the knowledge and professional development of employees, as these practices influence a company's innovativeness. For academics, this paper sketches out fields for further research in this area to be conducted in other countries and sectors.","[Zieba, Malgorzata; Zieba, Krzysztof] Gdansk Univ Technol, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Zieba, M (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Ul Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",mz@zie.pg.gda.pl; kzieba@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Zieba, Malgorzata/B-2788-2014","Zieba, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5138-9330; Zieba, Krzysztof/0000-0003-4307-9022",,,,,57,29,33,0,59,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

(2004). In particular, expectations behave differently when food and energy prices rise sharply relative to other prices. Using the recently proposed test of Homm and Breitung (2012), we analyze the 1982-2010 period and identify seven periods where the headline price index of personal consumption expenditures (PCEs) move explosively relative to the core PCE. During explosive periods, consumers rely more on past inflation in forming inflation expectations as compared to non-explosive periods. The importance of considering explosive periods in forming inflation expectations is also observed when CPI measures are considered. Finally, we find that during volatile periods inflation expectations are formed similarly as in normal periods. Our results indicate that the explosive behavior of food and energy prices should be taken into consideration when designing policies that aim to anchor inflation expectations.

Particularly damaged by the economic reforms implemented from 1975 to the end of the 1990s, the efficiency of township hospitals has been questioned, mainly because of the implementation since 2003 of the reform of health insurance in rural areas (New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme). From a database of 24 randomly selected township hospitals observed over the period 2000-2008 in Weifang Prefecture (Shandong), this study examines the efficiency of township hospitals through a two-stage approach. As curative and preventive medical services delivered at township hospital level use different production processes, two data envelopment analysis models are estimated with different orientations to compute scores. The results show that technical efficiency has declined over time. The factors explaining technical efficiency are mainly environmental characteristics rather than internal ones. Among these environmental factors, NRCMS have in average a negative effect on the evolution of THs efficiency, although efficiency have improved for some of them. Our results suggest also that, in the context of China, the efficiency of township hospitals is influenced by unobservable factors. From our findings, we suggest five main orientations to improve THs efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Our empirical analysis is based on a panel of Italian regions from 2003 to 2007. Various proxies for time preferences are considered: the consumer credit share out of the total amount of loans to households, the share of obese individuals out of the total population, the rate of marriages out of the total population, and the teenage pregnancy rate. Controlling for a great number of factors suggested by the scientific literature on the determinants of crime, adding to the model also time and regional fixed effects, and clustering standard errors to account for both serial and panel correlations, our results basically provide support to the 'Davis' hypothesis' for property crimes, while for violent crimes there seems to be less evidence that these are higher where people discount the future more heavily. Moreover, there is no evidence of a reverse effect from crime to time preferences at this aggregate level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To tackle this question, we use a regime-switching error-correction framework, where nonlinearities are only modeled in the short-run and have no impact on the long-run equilibrium. Regime specific shocks to government revenue and government purchases are identified using sign restrictions. Linear combinations of the impulse responses of these basic shocks are used to construct a deficit-spending shock and a deficit-financed tax-cut shock. We find that active spending policies have a stronger impact in recession, with multipliers exceeding unity, and should be preferred to deficit-financed tax-cuts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We model each program by assuming electricity sales are through bilateral contracts, and analyze the solutions properties and economic and emissions implications. We have three central findings in this paper. First, when electricity sales in both directions (i.e., in-state to out-of-state and vice verse) are subject to an emissions cap, three programs will produce identical siting distribution. Second, the emissions leakage in the long-run could be lower than in the short-run case in which capacity expansion is not allowed. This is so because in the long-run power producers may opt for clean technologies in fear of the emission costs under a cap-and-trade program. Third, if compared to pure source-based program in which the import sales are not subject to an emissions cap, more pollution-intensive facilities are expected to build in uncapped states, where the regulation is less stringent. Our findings are therefore consistent with some empirical evidence of pollution haven hypothesis.","[Chen, Yihsu] Univ Calif, Sch Engn, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Chen, Yihsu] Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Chen, Yihsu] Univ Calif, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Liu, Andrew L.] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced; University of California System; University of California Merced; University of California System; University of California Merced; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Chen, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif, Sch Engn, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",yihsu.chen@ucmerced.edu; andrewliu@purdue.edu,,"Chen, Yihsu/0000-0002-9990-8232","Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1234057] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",,,51,2,3,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

However, evidence suggests people may not view zero as just another price when it comes to pro-social behavior. Thus, while markets might be expected to increase the supply of assets available to those in need, some worry such financial incentives will crowd out altruistic giving. This paper reports laboratory experiments directly investigating the degree to which market incentives crowd out large, discrete charitable donations in a setting related to deceased organ donation. The results suggest markets increase the supply of assets available to those in need. However, as some critics fear, market incentives disproportionately influence the relatively poor.

During World War II, Keynes had similar misgivings about the effect of postwar free trade on Britain's economy. Yet for Keynes, economic forces are never inevitable, and capital rather than labor was the cause of trouble. His 1941 proposal for an International Clearing Union suggested capital controls, forced creditor adjustment, and an international fiat reserve as remedies for deindustrialization. This framework channeled financing toward production rather than speculation, leading to a rising standard of living for workers. A counterfactual with balance of payments data for the United States and China since 1982 suggests his ICU would have prevented U.S. deindustrialization, while yet permitting export-led growth in China.","Keene State Coll, Keene, NH 03435 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; Keene State College,"Duggan, MC (通讯作者)，Keene State Coll, 229 Main St, Keene, NH 03435 USA.",mduggan@keene.edu,,"Duggan, Marie Christine/0000-0002-9244-4658",,,,,8,2,2,0,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

We will examine the evidence on the litigation and the treatment by the Patent Office of patents that include software elements. We present specific empirical evidence regarding the examination by the Patent Office of software patents, their validity, and their role in the smart phone wars. More broadly, this article discusses the competing values at work in the patent system and how the system has dealt with disputes that, like the smart phone wars, routinely erupt over time, in fact dating back to the very founding of the United States. The article concludes with an outlook for systematic policymaking within the patent system in the wake of major recent legislative and administrative reforms. Principally, the article highlights how the US Patent Office acts responsibly when it engages constructively with principled criticisms and calls for reform, as it has during the passage and now implementation of the landmark Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011.","[Graham, Stuart; Vishnubhakat, Saurabh] US Patent & Trademark Off, Alexandria, VA 22314 USA; [Graham, Stuart] Georgia Inst Technol, Scheller Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Vishnubhakat, Saurabh] No Virginia Community Coll, Alexandria, VA USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Graham, S (通讯作者)，US Patent & Trademark Off, Alexandria, VA 22314 USA.",,,,,,,,18,27,34,1,84,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The state space is discrete, time is continuous and the planing horizon is allowed to be finite or infinite. A dynamic version of the Dorfman-Steiner identity will be derived. Explicit expressions of the optimal advertising and pricing policies, of the value function and of the optimal advertising expenditures will be given. The general results will be used to analyze the case of impatient customers. Furthermore, particular time inhomogeneous models and homogeneous ones with and without discounting will be examined. We will study the social efficiency of a monopolist's optimal policies and the consequences of specific subsidies. From a buyer's perspective, our analysis reveals that waiting - when looking at (immediate) expected prices - is never profitable should two or more units be available. But we will also prove that the sequence of average sales prices is monotone decreasing. Moreover, the techniques applied to solve the discrete stochastic advertising and pricing problem will be used to solve a related deterministic control problem with continuous state space.

Two general sources of errors were investigated: behavioural and macroeconomic factors. The first objective was to examine how these factors affect the size of the forecast error and the second concentrated on the direction of the error due to these effects. Our findings suggest that the largest increase in the size of USDA forecast errors was associated with structural changes in commodity markets that took place in the mid-2000s. Corn, soya bean and wheat forecast errors also grew during the periods of economic growth and with changes in exchange rates, while inflation and changes in oil price had a much smaller impact. With respect to behavioural sources, we identified patterns consistent with leniency and pessimism across different categories. Predictability of forecast errors based on the information available at the time the forecasts are made provides evidence of inefficiency and suggests that these forecasts may be improved using the findings of this study.","[Isengildina-Massa, Olga] Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Isengildina-Massa, Olga] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Karali, Berna] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Irwin, Scott H.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Clemson University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Isengildina-Massa, O (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",isengild@uta.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022; Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Karali, Berna/0000-0001-7969-7506; Isengildina Massa, Olga/0000-0002-2024-5385",,,,,30,9,15,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By exploiting the natural experiment, we examine how government ideology influenced tuition fee policy. The results show that right-wing governments were active in introducing tuition fees. By contrast, left-wing governments strictly denied tuition fees. This pattern shows clear political alternatives in education policy across the German states: the political left classifies tuition fees as socially unjust; the political right believes that tuition fees are incentive compatible. By the end of 2014, however, there will be no tuition fees anymore: the political left won four state elections and abolished tuition fees. In Bavaria, the right-wing government also decided to abolish tuition fees because it feared to become elected out of office by adhering to tuition fees. Electoral motives thus explain convergence in tuition fee policy.","[Kauder, Bjoern; Potrafke, Niklas] Ifo Inst, Dept Publ Finance, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Potrafke, Niklas] Univ Munich, Ctr Econ Studies, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Kauder, B (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, Dept Publ Finance, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",kauder@ifo.de; potrafke@ifo.de,,,,,,,54,23,24,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

This is done by looking into the relationship between house prices and rental prices, known as the price-rent ratio, which is an important measure of a potential deviation between house prices and its fundamental value. Additionally, the interest rate is taken into account since it is an important factor in determining demand for housing mortgages and thereby influencing house prices, and explosive behavior of house prices is considered. These relationships are investigated through a theoretical and econometrical framework. The empirical evidence suggests that there was a bubble in the housing market prior to the financial crisis, even when controlling for the decreasing interest rate and the fundamental information given by the rental price in the period. Explosiveness was the main source of the price increase, such that a bubble was present in the housing market after correcting for other fundamental factors. The econometric procedures used in the analysis may therefore be relevant for monitoring the housing market. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This comparison highlights the range of trade-offs: the growth-maximizing tax rate can lie above, below, or on the welfare-maximizing equivalent.

If the level of offshoring facilitators is low, a rise in the skill level can attract offshoring to the low-technology sector but not to the high-technology sector. A rise in the level of offshoring facilitators can attract offshoring to the high-technology sector.

The methodology we adopt in this study is logistic regression. Contracts analysis showed good results in reducing opportunism through fuel adulteration (-68.6 percent), and enforcement by distributors proved effective in curbing opportunism through noncompliance with agreements. We also found that time in the market is a factor conducive to opportunistic behavior, while the application of higher prices is a factor that discourages opportunism.","[Paulillo, Luiz Fernando] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Prod Engn, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Candolo, Cecilia] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Ctr Appl Stat, Sao Carlos, Brazil; [Candolo, Cecilia] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Stat, Sao Carlos, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos,,,,,,,,,24,3,5,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

J,"Stafford, SL",,,,"Stafford, Sarah L.",,,How predictable are environmental compliance inspections?,JOURNAL OF REGULATORY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hazardous waste; Duration model; Inspection timing,ENFORCEMENT LEVERAGE; PUNISHMENT; PENALTIES,"The goal of this paper is to examine the timing of environmental compliance inspections and determine the extent to which such inspections can be predicted. The paper focuses on modeling the inspections at hazardous waste facilities in the U.S. using detailed data on individual inspections and facilities. The paper uses a number of parametric and semi-parametric duration models to predict the timing of inspections and finds that the exponential model provides the best balance in terms of the explanatory power and simplicity of the model. However, even with this model it is difficult to accurately predict the timing of most compliance inspections. The paper also examines the extent to which using data on individual inspections can improve empirical predictions about aggregate inspections. If the goal is to estimate the annual number of inspections at hazardous waste facilities, neither the exponential model or a Poisson model is clearly superior. Which model is more appropriate depends on the question the researcher wants to answer. Similarly, if the focus is on whether any inspection occurred in a given time period, the benefits of using the exponential model depend on the nature of the questions to be answered. While the exponential model performs better than a probit model in predicting which entities will be inspected, it also results in a higher number of false positives, that is predicting an inspection when no inspection actually occurs.","Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Stafford, SL (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",slstaf@wm.edu,,"Stafford, Sarah/0000-0003-2233-5728",,,,,23,1,1,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The study reveals the step-by-step transformation of the degree of global competitiveness across 97 Chinese industries during the last decade. A new metric is applied to map the competitiveness of this sample of industries in 1996 and 2008. Comparison of the two metrics reveals the evolution of industries in terms of their degree of global competitiveness. Additionally, a number of representative industries are, by way of case studies, analysed in greater detail. From these cases we learn how the degree of global competitiveness of these industries changed over a 13-year period.","[Zhang, Jianhong; Ebbers, Haico] Nyenrode Business Univ, Breukelen, Netherlands; [Zhang, Jianhong] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Kunming, Peoples R China; [van Witteloostuijn, Arjen] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Witteloostuijn, Arjen] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium",Nyenrode Business University; Yunnan University of Finance & Economics; Tilburg University; University of Antwerp,"Zhang, JH (通讯作者)，Nyenrode Business Univ, Breukelen, Netherlands.",j.zhang@nyenrode.nl,,"Zhang, Jianhong/0000-0003-1209-7746; van Witteloostuijn, A./0000-0002-0287-5965",,,,,42,1,1,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,DEC 1,2013,25,4,,,,,492,511,,10.1080/14631377.2013.844930,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,267OT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328107900004,0
