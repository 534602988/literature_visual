During the divided years, East German institutions encouraged female employment, while the West German system deterred women, in particular mothers, from full-time employment. Our results show that East Germans are significantly more likely to hold egalitarian sex-role attitudes than West Germans. Despite a scenario of partial policy convergence after reunification, we find no evidence for a convergence process in gender attitudes. Indeed, if anything, the gap in attitudes rather increased.","[Bauernschuster, Stefan; Rainer, Helmut] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Bauernschuster, Stefan; Rainer, Helmut] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; Ifo Institut,"Rainer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",rainer@ifo.de,,"Rainer, Helmut/0000-0003-1181-2568; Bauernschuster, Stefan/0000-0002-5969-9288",,,,,17,92,93,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Market forces minimize differentiation while the optimal degree is at an intermediate level. As preferences over program content get somewhat stronger, the difference between optimal and market outcomes is initially reduced. However, when preferences over program content get more pronounced, minimal differentiation suddenly becomes optimal while market forces lead to excessive differentiation.

In addition, there appear to be remarkable degrees of consensus as to what actions are perceived as corrupt even if there is evidence of mismatches between students' beliefs and likely actions. At least some of this dissonance may be explained by the finding that respondents' corruption perceptions are biased by gender and ethnicity.

The dynamics between discontinuous innovation and incumbents inspires the interest of researchers and managers. The main concern of this paper is to find a method for overcoming innovator's dilemma from the viewpoint of incumbents. That is to say, this paper aims to improve C. M. Christensen's disruption strategy. This paper employs catastrophe theory as a theoretical basis to explain the driving force of new discontinuous change. We undertook a case study based on catastrophe theory to interpret the dynamics between discontinuous innovation and incumbents. First, we classified the dynamics between discontinuous innovation and incumbents from the collected innovation examples. Second, we identified the driving force of new discontinuous change, and, finally, observed the discontinuous market dynamics from catastrophe theory. We discovered the catastrophe matrix of self-disruption as a new approach for overcoming innovator's dilemma. The catastrophe matrix proposed in this study may contribute to a useful methodological framework for future empirical applications.","[Shin, Min Soo] Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 133791, South Korea; [Kim, Sung Cheol] Hanyang Univ, Dept Informat Technol Management, Grad Sch, Seoul 133791, South Korea",Hanyang University; Hanyang University,"Shin, MS (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 133791, South Korea.",minsooshin@hanyang.ac.kr,,,,,,,54,1,2,5,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

For those institutions, that are active at financial markets, the market risk plays a significant role. The market risk arises from unexpected changes of market prices of equities, interest rates, foreign currencies, and commodities. In this paper we apply a popular example of subordinated Levy models - the variance gamma model - in order to estimate the risk of internationally diversified portfolio. The variance gamma model is applied in order to estimate the marginal distribution of particular risk factors (stock indices and currencies). Then, two examples of ordinary elliptical copula functions are used in order to create the portfolio, ie. dependent returns for particular assets. We assume Gaussian copula function and Student copula functions. While both copula functions are strictly symmetric, the latter one allows us to stress the tails of the portfolio distribution. For comparison purposes, also standard Brownian motion is assumed. In order to assess the quality of both models, basic descriptive statistics of portfolio returns distribution are evaluated and next, the risk measures Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk for several distinct significance levels are provided. The calculation is done for one day and two-weeks horizons. We show, that symmetrical copula functions can decrease the advantage of variance gamma model (it provides skewed distribution for the marginals, which cannot be, however, compensated by symmetric copula functions). Moreover, we show that the scaling of one day VaR into 10-days VaR, might be misleading.","[Kresta, Ales; Tichy, Tomas] Tech Univ Ostrava, Vysoka Skola Banska, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Financi, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Kresta, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Vysoka Skola Banska, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Financi, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",ales.kresta@vsb.cz; tomas.tichy@vsb.cz,"Kresta, Aleš/J-8603-2013; Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Kresta, Aleš/L-1251-2019; Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020","Kresta, Aleš/0000-0001-8621-3493; Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330; Kresta, Aleš/0000-0001-8621-3493;",,,,,16,3,3,0,9,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It is clear that the assessment results which higher education institution or study programme will be better or worse is very often detected by the choice of criteria. It is very difficult to find objective criteria which could be used universally for all study programme types and allowed to assess them far and wide. Because of that besides the ranging of higher education institutions there are still made investigations and worked out methodologies to assess study programme quality and improvement. In the democratic society a person has the right to have different opinion; therefore there is not a single correct quality definition. Quality can mean different to everybody. Mostly everybody understands intuitively what the word 'quality' means, but it is hard to ground and explain. Probably the different understandings about the higher education quality create doubt in the interested sides about the higher education quality itself. So, one of the research tasks is to clear out how different are the understandings of two main interested sides (students and higher education administrators) about higher education quality and its major criteria. The aim of the research made is by doing expert survey and using The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to investigate the opportunities of study programme quality assessment to form the methodological basis of study programme assessment, as well as to clear out main higher education experts' (students and higher education administrators) understanding of study programme quality. In the research the experts evaluated 24 criteria which characterise both the quality of study programme offer and study programme implementation. Experts' task was to determine importance coefficients for criteria in study programme quality assessment.","[Ligotne, Agnese] Latvian State Univ, Acad Dept, LV-1586 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,agnese.ligotne@lu.lv,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,377,390,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100035,0

First, in the midst of an underdeveloped venture capital industry, it is necessary to understand if venture capital helps venture firms gain a fast Initial Public Offering (IPO) and increase financial performance. Second, this research examines if government support influences the IPO and financial performance of a firm among venture companies. We used a sample of Korean 727 venture firms to employ regression and survival analyses based on the types of dependent variables. Venture-capital-backed firms exhibited relatively faster performance growth and achieved faster IPO rates, although starting with low profitability as a startup. In addition, government support presented no impact on the financial gains and the IPO speed of a firm. This finding implies that Korean venture firms (despite a less-developed venture capital industry) have enjoyed a similar venture capital impact of a highly advanced venture capital industry. Regarding government support, government-subsidized firms exhibited a non-significant improvement of financial performance and a lowered IPO achievement. Policy implications dealing with a less mature venture capital industry are discussed.","[Sohn, Dong-Won; Kim, Hyun Jeong; Hur, Wonchang] Inha Univ, Coll Business Adm, Inchon 402751, South Korea",Inha University,"Kim, HJ (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Coll Business Adm, 253 Yonghyun Dong, Inchon 402751, South Korea.",kimhj@inha.ac.kr,"Kim, Hyun Jeong/GYU-0026-2022","Kim, Hyun Jeong/0000-0001-6551-5855",,,,,52,5,7,6,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This scheme intends to allocate the revenue raised to fund (amongst other things) two new tram lines. Acceptance by the public and the business community are seen as key barriers to implementing a WPL. The two major criticisms of the Nottingham scheme prior to its implementation were that a VVPL would discourage business investment and thus damage the economy while its intended impact on traffic congestion would be minimal. Therefore a detailed assessment of the Nottingham WPL scheme's performance is essential in order to facilitate transferability of this approach to other UK and European Cities and thus bring WPL into the mainstream for funding transport improvements. This paper outlines the barriers to implementation of the Nottingham WPL scheme, and the rationale behind the chosen use of revenue and how the scheme's performance will be evaluated as a transport demand management measure, as well as some initial performance monitoring data following the first year of operation. The results to date are discussed with a view to identifying any early indications as to whether traffic congestion and business investment has been impacted by the scheme's introduction.

This paper aims to describe safety from a travel-chain perspective and suggests an approach for using accident data as performance indicators. Findings from a recent Swedish case study of bus accidents show that the number of unreported injury cases was very large. Official statistics failed to provide full information and drivers frequently did not report accidents to the bus operators even though they might have resulted in moderate or severe injuries. Because injuries occur travelling to or from the bus stop, during boarding and alighting, and during the ride (braking/accelerating), passengers run the risk of being injured without the bus being involved in a vehicular collision. Non-collision injuries are indicators of poor accessibility, and even near-injuries might affect ridership, especially among older users. Thus, it appears that the pertinent organisational/corporate culture does not prioritize safety as a quality factor even though it is sometimes mentioned as a key performance indicator. We discuss means for improved safety culture for all stakeholders and reduce injuries, increase the use of buses, and increase travel quality and comfort. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While in the naturalistic approach, salience is understood as an objective and natural property of some entities (events, strategies, outcomes), the community-based account claims that salience is a function of community membership. Building on David Lewis's theory of common knowledge and on some of its recent refined accounts, I suggest that salience acts as a correlating device in a correlated equilibrium. What is constitutive of salience is common understanding, the fact that agents have common knowledge that they share the same modes of reasoning with respect to a well-identified set of events. I argue that the basis for common understanding is community membership. The relevance of this account stems from the fact that it answers the objection that salience is either unnecessary or unable to account for coordination between rational agents.","Univ Reims, Reims, France",Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Hédoin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Reims, Reims, France.",cyril.hedoin@univ-reims.fr,"Hédoin, Cyril/AAL-8244-2021","Hédoin, Cyril/0000-0002-5358-7111",,,,,46,4,5,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Commentators have criticized dual review not only as costly and redundant, but also as subject to substantive and procedural abuse. The process of clearing the 2011 Comcast-NBC Universal merger provides a useful case study to examine whether such concerns are justified. A review of the empirical context reveals that the FCC intervened even though the relevant markets were not structured in a way that would ordinarily raise anticompetitive concerns. In addition, the FCC was able to use differences between its review process and that used by the Justice Department to extract concessions from the merging parties that had nothing to do with the merger and which were more properly addressed through general rulemaking. Moreover, the use of voluntary commitments also allowed the FCC to avoid subjecting certain aspects of its decision to public comment and immunized it from having to offer a reasoned explanation or subjecting its decision to judicial review. The aftermath of the merger provides an opportunity to assess whether the FCC's intervention yielded consumer benefits.","Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Yoo, CS (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",csyoo@law.upenn.edu,,,,,,,62,3,4,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

We estimate the effects of exogenous state-level variation in the quantity and type of such mandates on disciplinary disparities across students who commit serious offenses. Estimation results indicate that more severe punishments are imposed in schools with higher proportions of black or Hispanic students, but such disparities are significantly dampened in states that mandate a higher number of guidelines for serious offenses. However, more guidelines for less severe misconduct tend to increase race-based disciplinary disparities and increase the severity of punishments administered for serious offenses. These outcomes extend the existing sentencing guidelines literature and provide empirical implications for considering marginal deterrence effects when crafting future policies.

However, an important recent contribution connects these two and suggests that international trade between developed and developing countries has an asymmetric effect on the demand for human capital. The asymmetry leads to a decline in fertility rates in developed countries and an increase in these rates in developing countries. We provide additional comprehensive empirical evidence in support of this novel hypothesis. Our findings suggest that countries that export skill-intensive manufacturing goods experience a decline in fertility rates, whereas in countries that export primary, low-skill-intensive goods, fertility rates are affected positively. Further, our findings indicate that the negative influence of manufacturing exports on fertility holds primarily and most strongly for middle-income countries where structural modernization and a growing manufacturing-intensive export sector is observed.","[Gries, Thomas; Grundmann, Rainer] Univ Paderborn, Dept Econ, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany",University of Paderborn,"Gries, T (通讯作者)，Univ Paderborn, Dept Econ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",thomas.gries@notes.upb.de,,,,,,,53,8,8,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

S. notion of concerted actions raised the idea to develop an article that parses in depth the EU meaning of concerted practices and that skein of U. S. doctrines that focuses on phenomena from invitations to collude to multilateral facilitating practices. According to Page, the current definition of concerted actions in the U. S. legal system misses the opportunity to use inter-firm communications to differentiate cases of collusive pricing practices and cases of interdependent parallel behavior that results in the same market price. On the contrary, the current EU definition of concerted practices accomplishes this purpose. By characterizing strategic inter-firm contacts as one of its building blocks, the EU definition supplies antitrust enforcers with a theoretical tool that distinguishes unlawful collusive conduct from oligopolistic non-coordinated behavior. Yet the current EU definition of concerted practices does something more. By encompassing a very strong presumption-that firms exchanging strategic information cannot do anything else but accordingly shape their internal pricing decisions-this notion catches cartels that emerge only from these strategic inter-firm contacts, regardless of firms' actual pricing conduct. The current EU notion of concerted practices is thus a powerful prosecuting tool that deserves to be compared with the U. S. case law about interdependence, parallelism, and exchanges of information.","[Ghezzi, Federico; Maggiolino, Mariateresa] Bocconi Univ, Dept Legal Studies, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Ghezzi, F (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Legal Studies, Milan, Italy.",federico.ghezzi@unibocconi.it; mariateresa.maggiolino@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,35,7,7,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

This is particularly true in the transport sector given the current levels of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions, the heavy dependence on fossil fuels, and the uncertainty surrounding transition pathways to ultra-low carbon vehicles. There are policy responses aiming to reduce carbon emissions by changing travel behaviour, but prominent approaches share a common theme of seeking to change behaviour by focusing on the individual and their choices. These are the object of critics who maintain that effective change requires collective action at the social, economic and cultural levels. This paper questions whether decision-makers are relying on these choice-based approaches to change travel behaviour and, if so, how effective they expect them to be. We address this through analysis of over 50 interviews with policy stakeholders in England and Scotland. We find dominant policy approaches do focus on individual choices, but significantly it is not because decision-makers have faith in their effectiveness. These approaches persist in policy on carbon reduction for two reasons. One is appeal to a politically powerful, but incoherent, discourse of individualism. The second is that decision-makers do not want significant behavioural change. There is an imperative of economic growth and a firm belief that a strong economy is linked to higher traffic levels, and that to reduce the demand for travel is to risk economic damage. We argue that these beliefs about the relation between travel demand and prosperity are narrowly defined and contestable for empirical and normative reasons. If there is to be a significant change in the approach to intervening in travel demand there is an urgency to engage in the politics of behaviour change - a meta-level behaviour change challenge.

We develop a simple test of this explanation and use it to explore the role of expectations in the context of the 1990s hospital merger wave. Managed care such as Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) started to become popular in the late 1980s and ultimately became an important player in the health insurance market. Our empirical analysis shows that the expected increase in the popularity of HMOs was partly responsible for the hospital merger wave of the 1990s: hospitals feared that the innovation of managed care in the downstream insurance market would penetrate the upstream hospital market and responded to this belief by merging. Our results show the importance of incorporating expectations and interindustry linkages into the understanding of merger waves.","[Park, Minjung] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Town, Robert] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Pennsylvania,"Park, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",minjungp@gmail.com; rjxtown@gmail.com,"Park, Minjung/R-7774-2017","Park, Minjung/0000-0002-5693-9370",,,,,36,5,8,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We find that the average growth in sample terminals' productivity is 5.4% during that period. By decomposing the Malmquist index, we identify the major source of productivity growth to be technological progress, rather than an improvement in technical efficiency, and the major source of technical efficiency growth to be scale efficiency.

Yet, beyond case studies of a few high-profile cities, there is little empirical evidence on the link between local creative industries concentration and innovation. This paper addresses this gap with an analysis of around 1,300 UK small- and medium-sized enterprises. The results suggest that firms in local economies with high shares of creative industries employment are significantly more likely to introduce entirely new products and processes than firms elsewhere, but not innovations which are simply new to the firm. This effect is not exclusive to creative industries firms and seems to be largely due to firms in medium-sized, rather than large, cities. The results imply that creative cities may have functional specialisations in new content creation and so firms are more innovative in them.","[Lee, Neil; Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.d.lee@lse.ac.uk; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",,,,,55,19,20,1,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

To provide some perspective on Bork's view of cartel enforcement, we compare his views with those of the other major influential antitrust book of the time by Richard Posner. We identify three distinct stages of cartel enforcement. Stage 1 is characterized by a low number of cartels prosecuted along with low fines and jail terms. Consistent with Bork's vision, stage 2 demonstrates a significant increase in cartels prosecuted, although fines and jail terms remain low. Stage 3 (the current stage) exemplifies a decline in the number of cartels prosecuted relative to stage 2 but with dramatic increases in monetary fines and jail terms.","[Ghosal, Vivek] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Sokol, D.

This paper considers whether there are circumstances under which frivolous suits might actually increase deterrence, and thereby possibly improve welfare. The reason this is possible is that in a costly legal system, injurers will generally be underdeterred because they will ignore the litigation costs of plaintiffs. The fact that some uninjured plaintiffs will succeed in obtaining settlements may therefore affect the care and activity choices of injurers in a socially valuable way. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A high-low agreement is a private contract that, if signed by litigants before trial, constrains any plaintiff's recovery to a specified range. In our theoretical model, trial is both costly and risky. When litigants have divergent subjective beliefs and are mutually optimistic about their trial prospects, cases may fail to settle. In these cases, high-low agreements can be in litigants' mutual interest because they limit the risk of outlier awards while still allowing mutually beneficial speculation. Using claims data from a national insurance company, we describe the features of these agreements and empirically investigate the factors that may influence whether litigants discuss or enter into them. Our empirical findings are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model. Other applications include the use of collars in mergers and acquisitions.","[Prescott, J.

To date there has not been any systematic examination of the interactions between this rising global financial diversity and national economic institutional diversity. Here I apply an institutional comparative capitalisms perspective to the analysis of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) SWF investment in German industry since the onset of the global financial crisis. The evidence demonstrates that a growing number of German industrial firms-particularly the major automotive firms at the heart of German industry-have recruited long-term GCC SWF investment as an adaptive response to the stresses of financial restructuring, most importantly the appearance of hostile takeovers as a feature of the German corporate governance landscape. These patterns lend partial support to varieties of capitalism (VOC) arguments that institutional complementarity and comparative institutional advantage are likely to produce path dependent trajectories of national institutional evolution. They also lend partial support to critiques of VOC, emphasizing, on the one hand, the importance of the Polanyian double movement of market expansion and containment and, on the other, the transnational foundations of national institutional diversity. I conclude that to fully explain these patterns, both VOC theories of institutional complementarity and comparative advantage, and Polanyian theories of the double movement, must be grounded in a generalized Darwinian analysis of population-level selection dynamics.","Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Haberly, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Arts C Bldg, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",d.haberly@sussex.ac.uk,"Kim, Soohyun/N-6460-2014",,,,,,64,22,22,0,188,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

We perform our comparisons in terms of out-of-sample volatility forecasting accuracy. We also consider combinations of the models' forecasts. Using intra-daily returns of the BOVESPA index, we calculate volatility measures such as realized variance, realized power variation and realized bipower variation to be used as regressors in both models. Further, we use a nonparametric procedure for separately measuring the continuous sample path variation and the discontinuous jump part of the quadratic variation process. Thus MIDAS and HAR specifications with the continuous sample path and jump variability measures as separate regressors are estimated. Our results in terms of mean squared error suggest that regressors involving volatility measures which are robust to jumps (i.e.realized bipower variation and realized power variation) are better at forecasting future volatility. However, we find that, in general, the forecasts based on these regressors are not statistically different from those based on realized variance (the benchmark regressor). Moreover, we find that, in general, the relative forecasting performances of the three approaches (i.e.MIDAS, HAR and forecast combinations) are statistically equivalent.

The study on this question aids in understanding the link between the rising income instability and household insurance. Existing studies on household insurance either focus on consumption smoothing and take labor supply as a given, or only focus on wife's labor responses to husband's unemployment shocks. This article develops an intra-household insurance model that allows for insurance against permanent and transitory wage shocks from both partners. Estimation using the Survey of Income and Program Participation shows that wife increases labor supply in response to husband's adverse wage shocks when both of them are working, and wife gets more nonlabor income when she is out of work. This intra-household insurance reduces earnings instability by about 2 to 9 %.

Feebates is a unique public policy that is meant to influence vehicle purchases. It presents buyers with a rebate for purchasing low-emission vehicles and a fee for purchasing high-emission vehicles. Because feebates directly impacts the consumer, understanding the dynamics of public perception, support, and opposition is important. This study explores the public perception of a potential feebate policy within California, and evaluates the robustness of an ordinal regression model to predict policy sentiment. The authors conducted a series of 12 focus groups throughout the State, which were followed by a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey of 3072 California residents in Fall 2009. The survey results were used to gain insights into consumer response to the policy, while focus groups gauged participant understanding of the feebate concept and overall response in preparation for the statewide survey. The survey data was weighted to match key demographics of the population and probed respondents on sentiments towards climate change, foreign oil dependence, policy fairness as well as overall perceptions of the policy. The results suggested that roughly three quarters (similar to 76%) of the population would have supported a feebate policy, while one-in-five (similar to 22%) would have opposed it. To evaluate how key factors simultaneously influence policy support/opposition, the authors estimated an ordinal regression model on policy support, which could correctly re-predict 89.4% of the sample's policy support or opposition. To assess the model's robustness, it was validated through re-estimation with 10,000 randomly drawn subsamples. Models estimated using these subsamples were then applied to predict policy perception for the remaining hold-out sample. The model performed very well, as hold-out sample opinions were predicted at an average accuracy of 89.1%, with little variance in performance.

We show analytically that this strategy can (1) be more profitable than a strategy with perfect or imperfect intellectual property rights enforcement for the artist and (2) change the organization and allocation of added value between artists and publishers along the supply chain. This higher profit result is achieved through an increased demand for live performance and positive voluntary contributions of downloaders directly pocketed by the artist. Indeed, a 'pay-what-you-want' strategy allows artists to reduce piracy without using sanctions while benefiting from a strategic negotiation 'weapon' in the relationship with record labels. Moreover, consumers draw procedural utility from the way the product is delivered. Counter-intuitively, rather than advocating for elimination of conventional releases at posted prices, pay-what-you-want strategies may need them to remain successful. A brief case study of Radiohead's experiment and anecdotal evidence are developed to support these theoretical insights.

As investor demand for bonds outpaces their supply from reinsurers, the study asks how the place-based physical vulnerabilities of fixed capital have been rendered into assets deemed increasingly desirable by growing blocks of financial capital. Combining data from extended interviews with industry datasets and market reports, the study demonstrates how this securitization pathway allows mobile capital on a search for yield to reframe spatial liabilities as tradable assets, thus accessing new returns on place. By aggregating and analyzing data on approximately $37 billion in catastrophe bond transactions since 1997, the study reveals both the ongoing concentration of capital in so-called peak perils such as U.S. hurricane and earthquake risks, and the fragmentation and recombination of peak perils to create new risk/return profiles. These purposive, scalable, and selective financial engagements with catastrophic risks depend upon the avoidance of the fixed costs and relational entanglements borne by (re)insurers. This ambivalent relationship with geographical liabilities is reaching its logical apogee in recent proposals to expand the catastrophe bond market to capitalize on growing climate change risks. This movement to underwrite to securitize intentionally emulates the originate to securitize model pioneered in mortgage-backed securities. This study argues that such developments could ultimately yield a built environment that is both more dependent on the state as an insurer of last resort and less adapted to climate extremes.","Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Johnson, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",leigh.johnson@geo.uzh.ch,,,,,,,121,40,46,1,59,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

It aims to unravel the relationship between the increase of middle-class families and the establishing of new family-related consumption spaces, both commercial and public. Based on observations and interviews in Amsterdam, we identify an increase in family and child directed consumption spaces. They reflect parental wishes to continue their former childless lifestyle, the need to combine work and care, and the wish to educate children in a wide range of skills. The more intensive consumption of parks and sidewalks reveals new practices of public parenting in urban contexts. It is argued that the transformation from childless yuppie to young urban professional parent (yupp) not only goes along with new consumption cultures but also with the production of a new city. This re-invented city has potentials for age and gender equality, however unequal class relations appear to continue.","AISSR Urban Geog, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Karsten, L (通讯作者)，AISSR Urban Geog, Plantage Muidergracht 14, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.j.m.karsten@uva.nl,,,,,,,55,50,57,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This paper addresses this issue through a litigation model within a Salop (1979) framework. We assume that victims of accidents differ both in terms of compensatory damages expected and in terms of distance from court. Due to distance costs, it might be too expensive to file cases for some victims with low expected awards. We show that the link between the number of courts and the demand for trials is not clear cut when the probability of an accident occurring is determined by the defendant through his level of care. Reducing the number of courts can, under certain conditions, increases the amount of care taken by the defendant. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Because law cannot be objectively measured, it is commonly believed that judicial decisions cannot be empirically evaluated on grounds internal to the practice of law. This article demonstrates that empirical analysis of judicial decisions can nevertheless provide objective, albeit limited, conclusions about subjective criteria for evaluating a system of adjudication. It operationalizes three criteria-interjudge inconsistency, legal indeterminacy, and judicial error-and clarifies what can be inferred about them from observational data on single-judge adjudication. The precise level of inconsistency cannot be identified, but it is possible to estimate a range of feasible values. Similarly, rates of indeterminacy and error cannot be estimated in isolation, but it is possible to estimate a set of feasible combinations of these rates. The methodologies developed in this article are illustrated using data on immigration adjudication.","Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Fischman, JB (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",joshua.fischman@law.northwestern.edu,,"Fischman, Joshua/0000-0001-8912-7662",,,,,76,11,16,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

This can be achieved by writing a contract that specifies a sufficiently high quality level. In contrast, the result by Che and Chung (1999) that 'reliance damages' induce the first best in a setting of purely cooperative investments, does not generalize to the hybrid case. We also show that if the quality specified in the contract is too low, 'expectation damages' do not necessarily induce the ex-post efficient trade decision in the presence of cooperative investments.

We also analyze whether leniency-invoked cases have higher fines before deduction, and whether those cases account for shorter durations of investigation, using the simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching. Our main findings show that cases with a small number of cartelists during the years 2008 and 2009 indicate a higher probability of leniency applications.

Considered in the analysis are market shares of both incumbents and new entrants, as well as consumer surplus and environmental costs. The link, which is the second largest intra-European connection, has been characterized by a low degree of competition in both rail and air transport services. The entry of new rail and air operators in 2012, however, will likely reshape market characteristics. The current paper argues the following: (i) most of the benefit in consumer surplus will stem from the introduction of competition in high speed rail; (ii) increased connections will result in increased environmental costs, which will partially offset the larger consumer surplus; and (iii) a reduction in the difference between airline and rail companies involving the costs of infrastructure access and security could lead to more fair forms of competition between airline and rail companies, but it generates a worst environment state.

The intellectual capital of an organization is the sum total of its human capital, structural capital and relational capital. These assets form a source of competitive advantage and distinguish the performance of one organization from the other. Having control on intellectual capital enables effective knowledge sharing, on the one hand and improvement of customer relationship on the other. The increase of knowledge and its relationship with the learning process is a very important for organization. It is widely accepted that organization which invest in the creation of new knowledge and increasing the intellectual capital through research and development activities or tend to do better than those that ride on the coat of knowledge created by others. The results of our research extend the understanding of the role of organizational learning in creating intellectual capital and building sustainable advantages for organization, where different concept of the customer confidence management in various stages of the customer capital life cycle may bring different implications for valuation of intellectual capital. This paper presents and describes customer capital of an organization as an element of market capital in the structure of the intellectual capital of modern organizations. For businesses it is very important to build confidence and customer loyalty. To be able to build on it, they have to gain the confidence of customer By applying the principles of a learning organization tend businesses to continuous learning, acquisition and sharing of new knowledge that can be used for building confidence in individual stages of the life cycle of the customer.","[Adamska, Malgorzata] Opole Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ & Reg Res, Opole, Poland; [Minarova, Martina] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Economis & Management, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Opole University of Technology; Matej Bel University,"Adamska, M (通讯作者)，Opole Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ & Reg Res, Opole, Poland.",m.adamska@po.opole.pl; martina.minarova@umb.sk,"Minárová, Martina/GZG-3836-2022; Adamska, Małgorzata Patrycja/IWD-9183-2023; Adamska, Małgorzata/U-4307-2019","Minárová, Martina/0000-0001-5795-8496; Adamska, Małgorzata/0000-0001-5227-3519",,,,,24,12,14,1,27,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The primary goal of the paper is to show a wide range of interactions between these two fields from a new perspective with an example of the integrated approach in supplier clustering and ranking. The integrated approach includes cluster analysis as a data mining tool and Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and VIseKriterijumskao ptimizacija i KOmpromisno Resenje (VIKOR) as the two MADM tools. More precisely, the features for clustering were selected and weighted by SWARA method and suppliers are clustered using two-stage cluster analysis. In addition, VIKOR technique is used to rank the clusters from the best to the worst one. The proposed integrated approach is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology.

Our method employs recent developments in the estimation and analysis of models with high-dimensional fixed effects. Using wage regressions with controls for multiple sources of observed and unobserved heterogeneity, we find little evidence that the quality of matching increases with firm clustering within the same industry. This result supports Freedman (2008) analysis of the software industry in one U.S. state. Since our final regressions still uncover evidence for a large wage premium from industrial clustering, the results suggest that agglomeration advantages may stem from sources beyond labor matching. The wage premium also improves with urbanization economies, in line with previous work.","[Figueiredo, Octavio; Guimaraes, Paulo] Univ Porto, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Guimaraes, Paulo; Woodward, Douglas] Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",Universidade do Porto; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Guimaraes, P (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Div Res, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",guimaraes@moore.sc.edu,"Guimaraes, Paulo D/A-7085-2008; Figueiredo, Octávio/B-6025-2009","Guimaraes, Paulo D/0000-0002-2992-1028; Figueiredo, Octavio/0000-0002-2930-1793",,,,,41,13,14,3,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Of criteria targeted by WEF, cultural resources place Romania best, on position 41, respectively. International acknowledgement of Romania's natural and cultural heritage is also sustained by many natural and cultural sites in Romania, that are protected by UNESCO, these being most often looked for by foreign tourists visiting Romania. Concerning this aspect, according to the World Bank statistics in 2003 - 2011, international arrivals in Romania has an upward trend but international tourism - receipts weight in total exports has a downward trend (from 5.5 in 2005 to 3.07 in 2011). In the past years, innovative products have been developed in tourism, with a fast growth, for instance dark tourism. In this paper we would like to carry-out an analysis and especially, to reason scientifically the need of sustaining this type of tourism within the Romanian consumers and especially the foreign ones, by the government, one of the reasons being that, dark tourism is an effective way for both promoting the Romanian heritage internationally (having the economic capability to produce competitive advantage on the tourist market) and particularly being a way of sustainable development..","[Gabor, Manuela Rozalia; Oltean, Flavia Dana] Petru Maior Univ Targu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures","Gabor, MR (通讯作者)，Petru Maior Univ Targu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania.",,"Gabor, Manuela Rozalia/AAK-9004-2020","Gabor, Manuela Rozalia/0000-0003-1025-869X",,,,,25,1,1,0,7,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,913,926,,,,,,14,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100117,0

Using data on the six US presidential elections from 1992 to 2012, we report the reductions in error obtained by averaging forecasts within and across four election forecasting methods: poll projections, expert judgment, quantitative models, and the Iowa Electronic Markets. Across the six elections, the resulting combined forecasts were more accurate than any individual component method, on average. The gains in accuracy from combining increased with the numbers of forecasts used, especially when these forecasts were based on different methods and different data, and in situations involving high levels of uncertainty. Such combining yielded error reductions of between 16% and 59%, compared to the average errors of the individual forecasts. This improvement is substantially greater than the 12% reduction in error that had been reported previously for combining forecasts. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters.

The long tail is a concept defined by Chris Anderson to describe a business model used by the majority of Internet firms and ecommerce stores. Is the long tail model crucial to the news media's competitive market capacity today? The study integrates relevant economic concepts of production costs, distribution costs, search costs, and market performance to construct a long tail economy for online news. Using survey, third-party traffic metrics, and content analysis, this study found that the traffic performance of online news sites was significantly impacted by long tail forces, but the impact had not transferred to the news sites' financial performance. The synthesis provides rich explanations of how the long tail economy can be applied to online news to reveal the forces that both drive and constrain its performance.","[Huang, J.

Traditional economic literature offers multiple models and theories concerning the behavior of investors, but the classical analysis starts from the premise of strict rationality and optimization of financial-monetary decisions. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that in reality, individuals deviate from the rational model, don't always take the best decisions, they repeat the same mistakes over and over again, don't know how to calculate risks and they make business emotionally motivated. On this basis, it appears that the simple and intangible rules of the classical economics cannot always explain economic behavior, apparently non-rational of investors, which has led to the emergence of a new trend of economic thinking: behavioral economics. The aim of this work is focused precisely on highlighting the contributions that the economical branch has in explaining the investment process. Thus, in addition to the classical approach, the behavioral economics takes into account the human factor influence, through elements of perception, emotion and self-evaluation, elements that are involved in making and assuming the investment decision. By treating the present subject we are trying to demonstrate that a modern, comprehensive approach of the investor behavior that takes into account psychological factors specific to behavioral economics, can assist and improve the investment decision.","[Ignat, Ion; Gradinaru, Andreea] Al Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Ignat, I (通讯作者)，Al Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,7,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,206,214,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100028,0

This is due to the higher heterogeneity of the data. The accuracy of the prediction model may be improved by reducing this heterogeneity. An alternative solution to the problem of the limited transferability (e.g. robustness) of a model may be to identify the environmental factors that affect the model's prediction accuracy and incorporate them into it. This paper presents research of the prediction accuracy of a bankruptcy model in four countries and the correlation found between the development of selected macroeconomic indicators in these countries. It proved possible in this way to identify those macroeconomic factors that show similar correlation patterns between given environments as investigated by the accuracy of the bankruptcy model. These factors include, first and foremost, the performance of the economy, inflation and unemployment. The incorporation into the model of such factors is very likely to increase model robustness.

Research in this area, especially in those emerging markets where event marketing is developing rapidly, is limited. In order to address the issues raised, a conceptual model is proposed. This model is based on a multivariate research approach, examining the interrelationships between event image, destination image, participants' perceived satisfaction with the event and intentions to visit, under the context of non-repeat event marketing. Five hypotheses postulating these interrelationships were tested using structural equation modeling. A non-repeat event, the National Games, the biggest traditional sports event in China, was chosen to test this model. Selfadministered questionnaires were used to collect data relating to a period of two months after the event's completion.

Contrary to most analyses in economics and policy literatures that conceive the importance of the central authorities in China's pursuit of external monetary policy objectives, policy making dynamics underlying the evolution of the different tracks of renminbi internationalization, including the development of offshore renminbi bond market and trade settlement regime, suggest a far more complicated picture about the political origins of the internationalizing venture of renminbi. Through extensive review of published materials in Chinese and interviews with financial officials, local authorities of offshore and onshore financial hubs, including prominently Hong Kong and Shanghai, are found to have played important parts in defining the central government's agenda, shaping the choice of financial standards and implementation specifics like scope, pace and timing of the currency outreach. These findings points to the imperatives of going beyond the national level of analysis and looking into the subnational dimension of financial opening often overlooked by researchers.","[Li, Vic] Hong Kong Inst Educ, Dept Social Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),,vicliyw@ied.edu.hk,,,,,,,38,0,0,1,11,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-7-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,153,164,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB2XI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342457200011,0

Many countries had or still have a similar problem. Georgia tried to solve this problem by the combined actions of the legislative and executive bodies. Changes in this direction have posed certain problems to the academic sector, too, and solving them has become quite urgent. This complex of problems has become the subject of the present study. The goal of the study is to consider the role of international accounting standards in Georgian economic system. Global economy has accelerated the need to move toward global accounting standards. Implementation of the international standards helps the countries to save on financial, human or other resources. Engaging in such a process is particularly beneficial for the countries with scarce resources. With their intellectual resources and by considering their past experience, they can make a valuable contribution to the international cooperation. Consequently, the purpose of the study was further specified to orient on the questions of introducing and teaching the international standards, identifying future trends in this direction, particularly for small countries like Georgia is, and demonstrating the positive role of the academic sector in this process. Georgia was successful in harmonizing the technical and professional standards in accounting and audit with the international standards. Several governmental and non-governmental organizations are participants of this process, namely the Parliament of Georgia (drafting the relevant legislative acts), Georgian Federation of Professional Accountants and Auditors (GFPAA), Accounting Standards Commission, Auditorial Activity Council and others. Conclusion is that it is both timely and necessary to converge and harmonize global (world) and local (country) standards into a single set of Global Accounting Standards. This will lead to a more stabilized and prosperous world economy, also it will help to resolve many of the world's financial reporting problems. (C) 2014 The Authors.

As the origin of products might have an influence on consumer buying behaviour, many marketers realise that an improved understanding of consumer attitudes towards both domestic and imported products could be useful in formulating more effective marketing strategies. Previous research in the field of international marketing suggests that the concept of consumer ethnocentrism can be an important factor when consumers decide to purchase locally produced rather than imported products. While the concept of consumer ethnocentrism has been actively researched in a number of contexts and countries, research on this phenomenon has been limited to developed countries. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on consumer ethnocentrism in developing markets by investigating the possible relationships between consumer ethnocentrism and a number of demographic variables in South Africa. A unique contribution of this study is that the investigation focused on two different ethnic samples - 'white' respondents and 'black' respondents - to account for the ethnic diversity in South Africa. An online survey was used to collect data on ethnocentristic tendencies in both sub-samples, as well as on their demographic characteristics. The results of the study revealed that for both groups of respondents there was a positive relationship between age and consumer ethnocentrism, while a negative relationship was found for both groups in the relationship between consumer ethnocentrism and income. In respect of the relationship between consumer ethnocentrism and gender, the results differed between the two groups of respondents.","[Pentz, Chris D.; Terblanche, Nic S.; Boshoff, Christo] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Business Management, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Pentz, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Business Management, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",,"Terblanche, Nic/JXL-7749-2024","Terblanche, Nic/0000-0002-8526-1562; Boshoff, Christo/0000-0002-8340-2034; Pentz, Chris/0000-0002-0194-9619",,,,,42,7,10,2,27,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Then, we have developed two fuzzy number intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral aggregation operators: induced fuzzy number intuitionistic fuzzy choquet ordered averaging (IFNIFCOA) operator and induced fuzzy number intuitionistic fuzzy choquet ordered geometric (IFNIFCOG) operator. The prominent characteristic of the operators is that they can not only consider the importance of the elements or their ordered positions, but also reflect the correlation among the elements or their ordered positions. We have studied some desirable properties of the IFNIFCOA and IFNIFCOG operators, such as commutativity, idempotency and monotonicity, and applied the IFNIFCOA and IFNIFCOGM operators to multiple attribute decision making with fuzzy number intuitionistic fuzzy information.

Secondly, two-phrase F-QFD process is presented to address distribution center location evaluation. The process is designed based on the principle of minimum uncertainty, Lambda-Max Method and Non-Linear Programming Models are incorporated in the two phrases. Finally, a numerical example in the context of the Harbin-Dalian high-speed rail is implemented. Our approach presents a systematic way to address DCLP-CSHR.

We analyze how the effect of differentiation on employee morale may explain this variation. We characterize sufficient conditions for the manager to refrain from differentiation. She refrains from differentiation when employees are of similar ability, especially if absolute levels are high. Avoiding differentiation boosts the self-image of employees. To limit the negative effects of differentiation, the manager's strategy often relies on the coarsest message set possible. The likelihood that the manager differentiates depends on the presence of synergies between employees and on the convexity of the cost of effort function. Finally, we show that in the absence of commitment no differentiation is chosen too often.","[Crutzen, Benoit S.

In contrast, the effects of temporary reforms are never statistically significant. Measures that combine temporary and permanent reforms, the norm in the literature, significantly misestimate the impact of tort reform.

The effect of competitive balance on attendance at sports events has received considerable attention in the literature.

However, this effect is smaller in magnitude than the effect brought about by the other aspects of the fixture with the strength of the home team being the single most important influence on attendances.","[Hogan, Vincent] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Massey, Patrick] Compecon Ltd, Dublin, Ireland; [Massey, Shane] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin,"Hogan, V (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",vincent.hogan@ucd.ie,,,,,,,32,14,15,0,14,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

This paper investigates this proposition, focusing on public bads. Theoretically it is, indeed, possible that shareholders decide that the firm reduces its public bads at the cost of profits, thereby increasing Pareto-efficiency. One of the factors which help determine the size of the reduction is the number of shareholders with a (very) small stake in the firm. The greater this number, the greater the reduction will tend to be. It is shown that the reduction in public bads can be reversed by takeovers, but under special conditions only while takeover defences may also be used. Unfortunately, there are a number of factors which significantly limit the internalization of external effects in practice. The paper also discusses a change in the legal share-voting system whereby the direct owners of the shares (i.e., the shareholders) no longer possess, in their capacity of direct owners, the legal right to vote at the General Meetings of firm owners. Instead, these rights become the property of the beneficial owners of the shares (i.e., the people who ultimately provided the money to buy the shares), but on the condition that they delegate their voting rights to a proxy voting institution. This institutional innovation may significantly increase the internalization of external effects among other things because many beneficial owners have a tiny stake in the firm.","[Prinz, Aloys] Univ Munster, Inst Publ Econ, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [van der Burg, Tsjalle] Univ Twente, Sch Management & Governance, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",University of Munster; University of Twente,"Prinz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Publ Econ, Wilmergasse 6-8, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",A.Prinz@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

These disparities are large, with an 80% difference in the propensity to die within 15 days between extreme regions. They may reflect spatial differences in patient characteristics, treatments, hospital characteristics and local healthcare market structure. To distinguish between these factors, we estimate a flexible duration model. The estimated model is aggregated at the regional level and a spatial variance analysis is conducted. We find that spatial differences in the use of innovative treatments play a major role whereas the local composition of hospitals by ownership does not have any noticeable effect. Moreover, the higher the local concentration of patients in a few large hospitals rather than many small ones, the lower the mortality. Regional unobserved effects account for around 20% of spatial disparities.","[Gobillon, Laurent] Inst Natl Etud Demog, Econ Demog Res Unit, F-75002 Paris, France; [Milcent, Carine] Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Gobillon, L (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Etud Demog, 17 Rue Caire, F-75002 Paris, France.",laurent.gobillon@ined.fr,,"Milcent, Carine/0000-0002-9367-2716",,,,,51,12,12,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We elicited residents' willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical parking permit program in New York City using a payment card approach, and estimate the key determinants through a Double Hurdle model. A little more than half of respondents (52.5%) are willing to pay for an average $408 per year, even though the revenue is not specified to be return back to the neighborhoods. Pricing becomes more acceptable in neighborhoods where the major parking problem is shortage and crowding caused mainly by local residents instead of parking intrusion by non-residents. The WTP value varies by resident car ownership and home parking types. The results suggest that curb parking pricing for local residents might be both economically and politically feasible in certain dense urban neighborhoods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We set up a model combining a simple representation of the economy, based on the neoclassical growth model of Solow, with a comprehensive representation of population dynamics. The model is used to investigate the structure of balanced growth states of the population and the economy in the presence of demographic transitions. The analysis shows that proper inclusion of age structure enriches the spectrum of the long-run equilibria of the neoclassical model, allowing up to five states of balanced growth, and shows the onset of poverty and low-fertility traps as different facets of fertility transitions. The role of different timing of fertility, mortality and savings transitions, and of more realistic demography of capital, is also considered.","[Fanti, Luciano] Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Iannelli, Mimmo] Univ Trent, Dipartimento Matemat, I-38050 Trento, Italy; [Manfredi, Piero] Dipartimento Stat & Matemat Appl AllEcon, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Trento,"Manfredi, P (通讯作者)，Dipartimento Stat & Matemat Appl AllEcon, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",lfanti@ec.unipi.it; iannelli@science.unitn.it; manfredi@ec.unipi.it,,"Iannelli, Mimmo/0000-0002-1637-2234",,,,,44,6,9,1,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Practitioners and academics often prescribe planning one's diet and exercise as a means of achieving weight loss. However, this study challenges such a prescription. The key insight derived from experience-rich qualitative data with a sample of dieters posits that lay theories, implicit beliefs about the mutability of individuals' selves and abilities, hold the key to understanding how planning operates in the weight-loss process, becoming either an obstacle or an aid for dieters. Findings from this study show that dieters who hold an entity lay theory are more inclined to view planning as an effortful enterprise, further aggravated by survival mentality focused on following simple rules and instructions. Dieters who hold an incremental lay theory, in contrast, view planning as a de-stressing aid. They favor principles that are applicable to a greater variety of situations and strive to cultivate autonomous weight-loss skills and competencies through planning. This research points to the need of rethinking how public health advocates can facilitate more effective weight-loss effort and its sustained benefits.","[Beruchashvili, Mariam] Calif State Univ Northridge, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Moisio, Risto] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",California State University System; California State University Northridge; California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Beruchashvili, M (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Northridge, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",mariam.beruchashvili@csun.edu; rmoisio@csulb.edu,,,,,,,62,2,7,1,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The present study employed the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as a frame of reference to address this issue. Vehicle speeds were observed individually on two residential street sections both with a 30 km/h speed limit, then a questionnaire survey was conducted to the corresponding drivers. The results based on the sample of 376 Japanese respondents showed that speeding intention significantly associated with objectively-assessed speeding behavior while a number of variables were found as significant predictors of speeding intention. Apart from the factors that have been reported in literature, this study proposed three new context-based variables including perceived appropriateness of the 30 km/h speed limit, perceived function of residential streets, and perceived right of vulnerable street users. The data showed that all of the three variables significantly associated to speeding intention while perceived appropriateness of the 30 km/h speed limit had a direct impact on observed driving speed after controlling for other TPB variables. On the basis of the aforementioned findings, the implications for speeding interventions and related polices were also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Focusing on a village outside Tiruppur, we trace the gradual transformation and ultimate disappearance of forms of labour bondage in agriculture. In this region bondedness in agriculture changed in a number of significant ways, before giving way by about the 1970s to primarily casual and contract-based labour arrangements. Around the same time, small-scale power-loom workshops, which are highly labour intensive and increasingly dependent on migrant labour, began to mushroom in the village, leading to the reintroduction of bonded labour, but this time in the context of rural industrial employment. We explore how debt bondage was introduced and how it affects the working lives of both migrants and non-migrants. The paper examines the differences and similarities between past agricultural and current industrial labour bondage, and how it is experienced and talked about by both employers and workers.","[Carswell, Grace] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England; [De Neve, Geert] Univ Sussex, Dept Anthropol, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Carswell, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",g.carswell@sussex.ac.uk; g.r.de-neve@sussex.ac.uk,,"Carswell, Grace/0000-0002-8570-1337","ESRC [RES-451-26-0537, ES/F026633/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F026633/1, RES-451-26-0537] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,32,36,42,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We introduce the Toll Index, a new monthly indicator for business cycle forecasting, and demonstrate its relevance using German data. The index measures the monthly transportation activity performed by heavy transport vehicles across the country and has highly desirable availability properties (insignificant revisions, short publication lags) as a result of the innovative technology underlying its data collection. It is coincident with production activity due to the prevalence of just-in-time delivery. The Toll Index is a good early indicator of production as measured, for instance, by the German Production Index, provided by the German Statistical Office, which is a well-known leading indicator of the gross national product. The proposed new index is an excellent example of technological, innovation-driven economic telemetry, which we suggest should beestablished more around the world.

The obtained results permit us to conclude that the sizes of local labour markets and the possibility of extending the job search to other labour markets by commuting are relevant factors in explaining overeducation in the Spanish labour market.

On the one hand, recessions decrease potential business income and wealth, but on the other hand they restrict opportunities in the wage/salary sector leaving the net effect on entrepreneurship ambiguous. The most up-to-date microdata availablethe 1996 to 2009 Current Population Survey (CPS)are used to conduct a detailed analysis of the determinants of entrepreneurship at the individual level to shed light on this question. Regression estimates indicate that local labor market conditions are a major determinant of entrepreneurship. Higher local unemployment rates are found to increase the probability that individuals start businesses. Home ownership and local home values for home owners are also found to have positive effects on business creation, but these effects are noticeably smaller. Additional regression estimates indicate that individuals who are initially not employed respond more to high local unemployment rates by starting businesses than wage/salary workers. The results point to a consistent picture the positive influences of slack labor markets outweigh the negative influences resulting in higher levels of business creation. Using the regression estimates for the local unemployment rate effects, I find that the predicted trend in entrepreneurship rates tracks the actual upward trend in entrepreneurship extremely well in the Great Recession.","[Fairlie, Robert W.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Fairlie, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rfairlie@ucsc.edu,,,,,,,56,98,144,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

In the presence of a third party, negotiators make first offers that are more strongly related to their production, which reduces the number of bargaining rounds.

Quickly growing heavy vehicle volumes over-proportionally contribute to roadway damage. Raising maintenance costs and compromised road safety are also becoming a major concern to managing agencies. Minimizing pavement wear is done by regulating overloaded trucks on major highways at weigh stations. However, due to lengthy inspections and insufficient capacities, weigh stations tend to be inefficient. New practices, using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transponders and weigh-in-motion technologies, called preclearance programs, have been set up in a number of countries. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the current issues with regard to the implementation and operation of the preclearance program. The State of Queensland, Australia, is used as a case study. The investigation focuses on three aspects; the first emphasizes on identifying the need for improvement of the current regulation programs in Queensland. Second, the operators of existing preclearance programs are interviewed for their lessons-learned and the marketing strategies used for promoting their programs. The trucking companies in Queensland are interviewed for their experiences with the current weighing practices and attitudes toward the potential preclearance system. Finally, the estimated benefit of the preclearance program deployment in Queensland is analyzed. The penultimate part brings the former four parts together and provides the study findings and recommendations. The framework and study findings could be valuable inputs for other roadway agencies considering a similar preclearance program or looking to promote their existing ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, different branches also have different energy efficiencies and carbon dioxide emissions from transport. Previous research has highlighted a serious lack of data inhibiting the understanding of these issues. This research presents a new method for analysing the relations between economic activity, transport demand, energy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions with a great level of detail in different economic sectors. This is done for Finland by using the statistics that are available in many countries and are gathered in a harmonised manner in the EU member states. Hence, the method is applicable in other countries and enables in-depth comparison between countries. Understanding these relations is essential when national and also international policy targets for energy efficiency and CO2 emissions are set and evaluated. The CO2 intensity of Finnish road freight transport has decreased significantly and this development is forecasted to continue. The decrease can largely be attributed to the shift of balance from transporting bulk goods to transporting parcelled goods. This shift has been driven by diminishing importance of forest cluster and growing importance of technology cluster and trade. Despite of the reduced CO2 intensity, the energy efficiency has remained at a relatively constant level and the total CO2 emissions of road freight transport have increased. This study updates a previous national forecast for the energy efficiency and CO2 emissions of Finnish road freight transport sector for the year 2016. The new national forecast makes the outlook less positive, as the CO2 emissions are forecasted to be 8% higher than in the previous forecast. This difference is mainly due to higher estimates for average fuel consumption in some sectors. Two new branch-level forecasts are also presented and these give 20% higher CO2 emission levels than the original forecast, because of projected greater economic growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This debate takes place among European legal scholars and is also paralleled by economic scholars, e.g. in the ambit of the 'theory of federalism'. This paper takes an innovative perspective on the discrepancy between 'centralized' and 'decentralized' law-making in the EU by assessing it with the help of the rules versus standards debate. When should the EU legislator grant the national legislator leeway in the formulation of new laws and when should all be fixed ex ante at European level? The literature on the 'optimal shape of legal norms' shall be revisited in the light of law-making in the EU, centrally dealing with the question how much discretion shall be given to the national legislator; and under which circumstances. This paper enhances the established decisive factors for the choice of a rule or a standard in a national setting (complexity, volatility, judges' specialization and frequency of application) by two new crucial factors (switching costs and the benefit of uniformity in terms of information costs) in order to assess law-making policies at EU level.","Rotterdam Inst Law & Econ RILE, European Doctorate Law & Econ EDLE Program, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",,"Weber, F (通讯作者)，Rotterdam Inst Law & Econ RILE, European Doctorate Law & Econ EDLE Program, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",f.weber@law.eur.nl,,,,,,,60,6,7,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

They have also attributed the failure of other countries to achieve these efficient arrangements to their different legal and/or electoral systems. In this paper we compare this view with a different approach based on the hypothesis that politics and corporate governance co-evolve, generating complex interactions of financial and labour market institutions. Countries cluster along different complementary politics-business interaction paths and there is no reason to expect, or to device policies for, their convergence to a single model of corporate governance. We argue that this hypothesis provides a more convincing explanation of the past histories of major capitalist economies and can suggest some useful possible scenarios of their future institutional development. Bayesian model comparison suggests that the co-evolution approach turns out at least as influential as the competing theories in explaining shareholder and worker protection determination.

However, being unobservable, these measures must be estimated. The Fiscal Compact will result in these concepts being used to judge EU Member States adherence to budgetary rules. Therefore, it is vital that the methods applied for their estimation are as accurate as possible. A bivariate Kalman Filter (KF) model using capacity utilisation (CU) as the second series has been proven to produce more reliable estimates of the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) cycle than the Hodrick Prescott (HP) filter methodology formerly used for this task. However, CU data is no longer collected in Ireland. Given the large turning point in the TFP series as a result of the financial crisis, this may no longer be the first-best approach for future TFP cycle estimation. This paper compares the existing method to an approach which uses an aggregated Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) series as the second series in the bivariate KF model. This approach has the advantage that PMI data is collected on an on-going basis. The results show that PMI shares a common cycle with TFP, and that this new approach leads to a reduction in the total estimation error variance and revisions required to TFP cycle estimates.","Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Clancy, D (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",daragh.clancy@centralbank.ie,"Clancy, Daragh/AAX-3173-2020","Clancy, Daragh/0000-0002-6730-2228",,,,,13,3,3,0,7,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

However, relatively little evidence exists on the deterrence effect. Using newly constructed measures of preventable medical complications and state tort reforms in the United States between 1994 and 2007, I find evidence that higher liability pressure deters preventable medical complications associated with four specific obstetric and gynecologic procedures. The results also show that the effects of tort reforms vary according to the specific reform in question. While joint and several liability reform (which increases doctor accountability) appears to decrease preventable medical complications, collateral source rule reform and caps on punitive damages appear to increase these complications. Opponents of tort reform often argue that tort reforms may adversely affect patient safety, and the results of this paper suggest that such a concern is legitimate.","Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Iizuka, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan.",,,"Iizuka, Toshiaki/0000-0002-2991-2922",,,,,33,24,27,0,16,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

However, there is a debate as to whether PPP schemes are a better option than conventional procurement. To this end, an evaluation framework is proposed, to assess which of these two alternative schemes for transport projects financing is preferable for the public. The proposed framework is complimentary to the Value for Money (VIM) approach and is based on a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA). The first step is the estimation of the Public Sector Comparator (PSC) for the case of conventional procurement, dealing with construction, maintenance and operation costs revenues, as well as any costs associated with risks undertaken by the public. As for the PPP case, it includes any payments by the public sector and related risks costs. The MCA is then applied only if the PPP is found preferable for the public sector. The latter considers additional impacts, including among others the social attributes of a particular scheme, job creation, environmental impacts and safety and security aspects. The proposed framework was applied to a pilot Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor infrastructure project in the city of Indore, India, in order to demonstrate its validity. The framework and its application could provide useful guidance when considering PPP for a transport project, since it demonstrates in a transparent way the society's attitude towards this project, something that is critical to its acceptance.

Taking a hybrid perspective of classical bid-rent theory and a world where clustering of economic activity is driven by between-firm spillovers, Berlin, Germany, from 1890 to 1936 serves as a case in point. Our results suggest that the average productivity effect of a doubling of between-firm spillovers over the study period increases from 3.5% to 8.3%. As the city transforms into a service-based economy, several micro-agglomerations emerge. Their locations close to the CBD still make the city look roughly monocentric.

There are two opposing views on the efficiency implications of so many women working part-time. The negative view is that part-time jobs imply wastage of resources and underutilization of investments in human capital since many part-time working women are highly educated. The positive view is that, without the existence of part-time jobs, female labor force participation would be substantially lower since women confronted with the choice between a full-time job and zero working hours would opt for the latter. In the Netherlands, the majority of partnered working women have a part-time job. Our paper investigates, from a supply-side perspective, if the current situation of abundant part-time work in the Netherlands is likely to be a transitional phase that will culminate in many women working full-time. Our main results indicate that partnered women in part-time work have high levels of job satisfaction, a low desire to change their working hours, and live in partnerships in which household production is highly gendered. Taken together, our results suggest that part-time jobs are what most Dutch women want.","[van Ours, Jan C.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Booth, Alison L.] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Booth, Alison L.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Booth, Alison L.; van Ours, Jan C.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Booth, Alison L.; van Ours, Jan C.] CEPR, London, England; [van Ours, Jan C.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [van Ours, Jan C.] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Tilburg University; University of Essex; Australian National University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Melbourne; Ifo Institut,"van Ours, JC (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",alison.booth@anu.edu.au; vanours@uvt.nl,"van Ours, Jan C/O-6197-2015; van Ours, Jan C/N-2579-2016","van Ours, Jan C/0000-0002-0144-9956;",ESRC [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,25,52,58,7,56,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The study utilises a specifically designed instrument to measure internal and external factors impinging on career choice. A purposive non-random sample, consisting of 130 second and third year students in Human Resource Management (HRM) and Management, is used. Findings suggest that, while perceptions of aspects of careers, such as job and career prospects generally dominate the choice of major subjects, students studying HRM majors hold community orientated values that distinguish them from their peers. Many students are found to make choices primarily on the basis of their perceptions of 'external factors', rather than their interests. The findings are discussed in terms of extant theory and potential practical outcomes.","[Coldwell, David A.

This is valid for both types of study program (bachelor and master study program). Through results we find out, that the distance between the student's knowledge and business requirements are smaller. This could be cause for example by advances in the study programs structures and courses that are provided in selected study programs.

In this note, it is found that this conclusion follows from the fact that the authors ignored all release of carbon from decomposition of DOM and wood products after the time of the first harvest. When this is corrected for, the sizes of the initial stocks of DOM and wood products do not influence the optimal rotation period. Moreover, in contrast to the conclusions in the two mentioned papers, our numerical analysis indicates that inclusion of DOM in the model leads to longer, not shorter, rotation periods.

The definition of bank outputs is important: cost efficiency scores are lower when the intermediation approach is used The differences between the cost and profit scores using parametric and non-parametric approaches arise when the Fourier-flexible functional form is employed; generally, the parametric approach yields higher scores than the non-parametric approaches.

The concept of joint production is useful to interpret the relationships between agriculture and environment. Among agriculture functions, we find the maintenance of the landscape as a common public good. Since 1970 the total area of active agricultural holdings decreased conspicuously. Moreover, the so-called soil sealing achieved in 2009 the 7.3% of the total territory, compared to the 4.3% of UE-23 average. Italian Department of Agriculture has proposed to contain soil consumption and to protect the agricultural areas. The aim of this work is to develop a methodology to assess the articulation on the territory of specialized and mixed farming systems and their evolution. The results prove that the process of transformation in the Italian rural landscape mosaic has led to an increase in land use diversification and to a prevalence of mixed farms. A large part of the territory went out from the official management of farms, but the phenomenon is reducing. We must not overlook hidden employment in agriculture where retirement is only nominal. There are also 2 other overestimations about the loss of land due to: a) specialized farms not surveyed by the Census (Arboriculture and Woods); b) non-statistical attribution of different land uses left to set-aside. However, the restraint of sprawl in the construction of buildings and infrastructure would be desirable. Many of the adjustments in land use due to various reasons, including the strategic modification of the CAP, should not be viewed negatively. They have been implemented with regard to structural association of land among different uses typical of traditional Italian landscape mosaic, so anticipating the greening policy.","[Iseppi, Luca; Chang, Ting Fa Margherita; Taverna, Mario] Univ Udine, Dipartimento Ingn Civile & Architettura, I-33100 Udine, Italy",University of Udine,,luca.iseppi@uniud.it,"Iseppi, Luca/AAL-4206-2020; Chang, Ting Fa M/E-6410-2015","Iseppi, Luca/0000-0002-9019-7032;",,,,,23,1,1,0,14,MEDIMOND S R L,40128 BOLOGNA,"VIA MASERATI 5, 40128 BOLOGNA, 00000, ITALY",,,978-88-7587-690-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,129,137,,,,,,9,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BA8IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338155900012,0

In many areas of construction industry does not reach pre-crisis levels before 2008. Its development reflects a range of factors, estimates of future are different. To analyze the current situation and for prediction of the future was used bankruptcy model Z Score. The analysis was based on the confirmation or rejection of the three hypotheses. To verify the hypothesis 1 was analyzed data from the statistics of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which lists the cumulative values of the balance sheet and profit and loss account in the construction industry in the years 2009-2011. Hypothesis 1 was confirmed on the basis of the growing Z Scores trend. It means that the situation in the sector is improving. To verify the hypothesis 2 was used a sample of balance sheets and profit and loss accounts (year 2010) with 473 companies. This data were obtained from the Commercial Register. Based on the calculation of Z Score was found the number of enterprises in the area of bankruptcy. Subsequently was applied Z - test on one sample proportion. It statistically confirmed that 20 % of businesses have symptoms of bankruptcy. To test the hypothesis 3 was used global statistics CR. There have been extracted data for the calculation of Z Score for the total economy (or selected industries in total) in the years 2009-2011. The resulting trend was compared with the values of Z Score for the construction sector in the years 2009 to 2011. The results showed that the construction sector achieves higher levels of indicators Z Score in all years.

Recent years have been witness to the notable increase in the demand for public goods and the progressive physical and functional decay of existing ones. Actions of enhancement of public goods may become the opportunity for a qualitative restructuring of the city and the landscape. The nature of public goods and the concepts of integrated enhancement imply to use complex approaches. The implementation of complex projects is highly problematic; evaluation may assume an important role in resolving existing problems. The number of interest liable to be aroused by a landscape enhancement requires an evaluation process able to involve, with an active role, the civil society in spatial and environmental choices. Nowadays, deliberative and participatory approaches are considered tools to manage and converge all the interest in play in a given area, by combining development and protection of the local community in view of a sustainable choices.

These projected amounts of sequestered carbon on timberlands take into account projected increases in timber removal and forest carbon losses on other timberlands (carbon leakage effects). Net effectiveness of carbon reserve scenarios in terms of overall net gain in timberland carbon stocks from 2010 to 2060 ranged from 0.29 tCO(2)e net carbon increase for a payment of $5/tCO(2)e to the landowner (71% leakage), to 0.15 tCO(2)e net carbon increase for a payment of $15/tCO(2)e to the landowner (85% leakage). A policy or program to buy carbon credits from landowners would need to discount additions to the carbon reserve by the estimated amount of leakage. In the scenarios evaluated, the timber set-asides reduced timberland area available for harvest up to 35% and available timber inventory up to 55%, relative to the baseline scenario over the next 50 years, resulting in projected changes in timber prices, harvest levels, and forest product revenues for the forest products sector.

Furthermore, it investigates the current barriers that hinder the development of these skills in such economies with a reference to Georgian economy that has been experiencing a transition from a centrally planned economy into a free market economy. It also offers some solutions to surmount these obstacles being questioned. Hence, we interviewed some of the entrepreneurs in Georgian Lilo market both, in 2004 and 2010. In addition to the interviews, we have exercised our own observations about the market, the entrepreneurs therein, and the whole Georgian economy to clarify the matters of investigation of this paper. The findings prove that the entrepreneurial abilities of the interviewee businessmen have been in progress. They are able to perform many economic activities they would not have been able to and they even did not know how to under socialist rules. They can build their own businesses, produce, sell and buy, export and import all kinds of goods and services on their behalf: Georgia is on the way to having contemporary entrepreneurs of five market economies in spite of the hindrances that retard the development of their entrepreneurial abilities.","[Ozsoy, Ismail; Gormez, Birol] Fatih Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-34500 Istanbul, Turkey; [Dilanchiev, Azer] Int Black Sea Univ, GE-20131 Tbilisi, Georgia",Fatih University; International Black Sea University,"Özsoy, I (通讯作者)，Fatih Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-34500 Istanbul, Turkey.",iozsoy@fatih.edu.tr; azerdilanchiev@yahoo.com; bgormez@fatih.edu.tr,"Dilanchiev, Azer/AAY-6473-2020; OZSOY, Ismail/JAO-4408-2023","Dilanchiev, Azer/0000-0002-9899-6621;",,,,,22,1,1,0,16,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Itemizations used by previous academics, such as Stogdill's Leadership Behaviour Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) and Bass and Avolio's Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) are presented and analysed. The latter is then decided to be the most promising one for valid leadership research.

Applying the model within Los Angeles County, California, results demonstrate the trade-offs observed in various protection schemes and illustrate how continuously increasing defense resources does not guarantee a safer region. The implication of detection strategy on response capability is also assessed through the case study, illustrating the importance of balance when deriving solutions.

We study the impact of Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., which clarified the law of securities fraud on pleading scienter. Tellabs reversed a lenient reasonableness standard for pleading scienter but replaced it with a standard that is nonetheless relatively generous to plaintiffs. Would the Supreme Court's directive cause the dismissal rates in the lower courts to converge? We find that Tellabs correlates with a significantly lower dismissal rate on scienter grounds in circuits previously applying a higher preponderance standard for scienter. In contrast, we find no significant shift in the courts previously applying the lower reasonableness standard in our basic model. Overall, we conclude that Tellabs led to increased uniformity in how lower courts apply pleading standards, but its effect is muted by the asymmetry of the right to appeal.","[Choi, Stephen J.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Pritchard, A.

With justice added to the foundation in the way that Henry George proposes, the conditions of inequality and conflict that lead to war will no longer prevail. George saw that trade prohibitions furthered elite rule, militarization, and a worldview of them versus us. George's great contribution was to see how these big issues of War and Peace bore directly upon the constellation of rules governing the relationship of people to planet, humans to humus, earthlings to earth. Social arrangements not based on the fundamental and equal human right to the earth lead inevitably to a gross imbalance of political power and thus to government corruption, odious public debt, war, and preparations for further war. Although he warned us of what might befall the United States if it took the imperialist path, George seemed hopeful that the highest and best moral purpose of our nation would prevail. The paper concludes with an assessment of contemporary devices that protect the interests of the few over the manysubsidies, the ballooning national debt, the ever-widening wealth gap, megacities, and the full-spectrum-dominance objective of U.S. imperialism.","Earth Rights Inst, Scotland, PA USA",,"Hartzok, A (通讯作者)，Earth Rights Inst, Scotland, PA USA.",,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In contrast, a combination of positive and negative vote buying is optimal under the secret ballot: Lukewarm supporters are paid to show up at the polls, whereas lukewarm opponents are paid to stay home. Paradoxically, the imposition of the secret ballot increases the amount of vote buying-a greater fraction of the electorate vote against their intrinsic preferences than under the open ballot. Moreover, the secret ballot may reduce the costs of buying an election.","[Morgan, John; Vardy, Felix] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Vardy, Felix] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; International Monetary Fund,"Morgan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fvardy@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,29,15,15,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Technology-driven change initiatives are often difficult to implement and failure rates are high. Lack of success is often linked to failures in understanding the change environment or failure to account for human factors in the implementation of a new technology. This study explores stakeholder perceptions in the implementation of a variable speed limit (VSL) system in St. Louis, Missouri. Survey data from the driving public and law enforcement officials were analyzed during the first 2 years the VSL system was operational. High levels of dissatisfaction were present in survey results and indicated significant levels of resistance to innovation. Change management theory was used to link sources of dissatisfaction to common resistance factors. This provides an opportunity to develop strategies for the successful implementation of innovative traffic management systems. Decision makers involved with active traffic management will benefit from an understanding of the pervasive nature of resistance to innovation and an awareness of strategies for designing change management processes in innovative traffic systems.

We introduce a stochastic process that captures these features of random market evolution, and we provide key mathematical results related to first passage times which make the characterization of entry and exit behavior quite simple and straightforward (even when the process is subject to an endogenously determined upper or lower barrier). We characterize entry and exit patterns in a dynamic competitive equilibrium, and we show why our results differ from those obtained if demand follows a diffusion process (e.g., a Geometric Brownian Motion). Despite the stochastic process of the underlying variable has a continuous sample path in both cases, we demonstrate in our setting that positive rates of entry and exit discontinuously fall to zero owing to informational overshooting. Another advantage of our framework is that it can explain discontinuities in firm values even if sample paths are continuous. Our framework is also amenable to empirical implementations (as we show using Corts 2008 offshore oil drilling application), and to an intuitive interpretation of optimal (dis) investment rules based on Bernankes (1983) bad news principle of irreversible investment.","[Ruiz-Aliseda, Francisco] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Palaiseau, France; [Wu, Jianjun] Princeton Econ Grp, Princeton, NJ USA; [Wu, Jianjun] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; University of Arizona,"Ruiz-Aliseda, F (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Palaiseau, France.",francisco.ruiz-aliseda@polytechnique.edu; j.wu@econgroup.com,"Wu, Jian/AAU-5221-2020; Ruiz-Aliseda, Francisco/AAI-3684-2020; Wu, Jian/AAU-5221-2020","Wu, Jian/0000-0001-9933-7364; Ruiz-Aliseda, Francisco/0000-0002-0574-8726; Wu, Jian/0000-0002-3394-1507",,,,,20,4,4,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

This model generalizes the time-varying correlation structure of Tse and Tsui (2002, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 20: 351361) by classifying the correlations among the series into groups. To estimate the proposed model, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are adopted. Two efficient sampling schemes for drawing discrete indicators are also developed. Simulations show that these efficient sampling schemes can lead to substantial savings in computation time in Monte Carlo procedures involving discrete indicators. Empirical examples using stock market and exchange rate data are presented in which two-cluster and three-cluster models are selected using posterior probabilities. This implies that the conditional correlation equation is likely to be governed by more than one set of decaying parameters. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[So, Mike K. P.; Yip, Iris W.

Although the literature to date has emphasized the role of LRs as endogenous switching costs (which distort the efficient allocation of consumers), l analyze instead the ability of alternative designs to foster consumer participation and increase total surplus. First, the efficiency of LRs depends on their specific design. A commitment to the price of repeat purchases can involve substantial efficiency gains by reducing price-cost margins. However, discount policies imply higher future regular prices and are likely to reduce total surplus.

In equilibrium, even when consumers see a reputed name being divested they continue to trust it and so, these names are tradeable.

Some countries lack credibility for investors, who believe that the protection level of creditor rights in the country differs before and after investment. This time inconsistency problem results in credit rationing. Airlines in such countries cannot access the credit market, particularly the international capital market. This paper first examines why developing countries have been suffering from a lack of credibility and from credit rationing, and then explores how the Convention resolves this problem.

However, few researchers have jointly examined the specific impact of each characteristic and whether country characteristics (economic performance and others environmental factors) change the probability of being depressed. In general, this is due to the use of single-country databases. The aim of this article is to extend previous findings by employing a much larger dataset and including the above-mentioned country effects. We estimate probit models with country effects (model I) and we also explore linkages between specific environmental factors and depression (model II includes variables such as per capita Gross Domestic Product and the GINI index). The dataset for this research comes from the 2007 GALLUP Public Opinion Poll that allows us to consider a large and widely heterogeneous set of micro-data. Findings indicate that depression is positively related to being a woman, adulthood, divorce, widowhood, unemployment, and low income. Moreover, we provide evidence of the significant association between economic performance and depression. Inequality raises the probability of being depressed, specially for those living in urban areas. Finally, we find that some population characteristics such as age distribution and religious affiliation facilitate depression.",,,,nmelgar@decon.edu.uy; mito@decon.edu.uy,"Melgar, Natalia/GRE-6046-2022; Rossi, Maximo/H-3692-2019","Rossi, Maximo/0000-0002-4116-922X",,,,,42,7,9,28,466,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In particular, it tests whether increases in trade lead to rising inequalities, whether these inequalities recede in time, and whether increases in global trade affect the developed and developing worlds differently. Using static and dynamic panel data analysis, I found that while increases in trade per se do not lead to greater territorial polarization, in combination with certain country-specific conditions, trade has a positive and significant association with regional inequality. States with higher interregional differences in sectoral endowments, a lower share of governmental expenditures, and a combination of high internal transaction costs with a higher degree of coincidence between the regional income distribution and regional foreign market access positions have experienced the greatest rise in territorial inequality when exposed to greater trade flows. Hence, changes in trade regimes have a more polarizing and enduring effect in low- and middle-income countries whose structural features tend to enhance the trade-inequality effect and whose levels of internal spatial inequality are, on average, significantly higher than in high-income countries.","London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,79,88,4,114,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

This note focuses on the last notion. It examines the concept of globalisation, which is a major characteristic of capitalism, its free-trade aspect. A preliminary definition is required, since globalisation is often used without prior definition and even as a synonym of internationalisation. Thirty years ago it was not to be found in a dictionary. Another concept, the human rights is related to globalisation and is cherished by the globalisation's supporters. It is the subject of a separate section. The hypotheses underlying the free-trade doctrine and the extent to which the facts correspond to them are discussed after that. The next part deals with the globalisation's effects on the economic system, the culture and the social environment. The decline of capitalism since the eighties and still more its collapse in 2008 had heavy consequences for its essence and its outcome. This paper ends with some considerations on the future of globalisation, more particularly the American and European position in this respect. Nothing seems to stop its further triumphal procession.","Univ Ghent, B-9831 Deurle, Belgium",Ghent University,"van Meerhaeghe, MAG (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Kriekenbergdreef 21, B-9831 Deurle, Belgium.",hvm@klaproos.be,,,,,,,186,3,6,1,52,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Our estimation results indicate that one cointegrating relationship exists among these variables. Moreover, there is a bidirectional Granger causality flow between real public capital and labour force, as well as between public capital and TFP; while productivity Granger-causes labour force but not the other. The Forecast Errors Variance Decompositions (FEVD) show that errors in real public capital are mainly due to uncertainty in labour force and in public capital itself, and that labour force errors are due to labour force itself.

This theory considers the influence of subordinates to the leader the same importance as influence of the leaders to subordinates. LMX theory presents the model of creation of leadership where proposes the leaders to search for methods of. creation of mutual trust and respect with all subordinates thus changing the whole wok unit into inside group. LMX theory prompts leaders to create relationship of mature partnership with every subordinate and to avoid any inequity. We are raising the hypothesis the quality of interaction between leader and follower and the process of creation of leadership at the same time are influenced by age and gender of subordinates therefore while creating the leadership these aspects should be taken into account. The research of interface between the leader and followers performed among the higher medical staff of stationary departments of Kaunas county hospital and its branch Kaunas psychiatry hospital showed some differences among sexes in the process of creation of leadership and some influence of age of follower to quality of interchange with leader. Analysis of interaction between leader and followers allowed us to make the final generalization as follows: 1) the more aged, the more often is formed high quality interchange with leader and mostly this tendency clears up among respondents aged 41-60 who already have some work and lift experience; 2) despite the major part of investigated group consist of women, even twice more men in comparison to women group create high quality interchange with leader; 3) men trust their leader more than women and are ready to protect and to explain his/her decision. Possibly because of their proactivity higher that of women in showing persona; 4) women feel less understood by their leaders, considerably less than men trust them and more seldom are ready to protect themselves and to explain their decisions; 5) however, despite the quality of interchange with leader, women which are the major part of members of dyad are not less pleased in their relationship to leader than men. Therefore it could be stated that despite prompt of leaders by LMX theory to create relationship of mature partnership with every subordinate avoiding any inequity, nevertheless it's necessary such aspects should be taken into account as age and gender of followers.","[Bartkus, Edverdas Vaclovas; Kaminskas, Giedrius; Grunda, Rokas] Vilnius Univ, Dept Business Econ & Management, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Bartkus, EV (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Dept Business Econ & Management, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",edverdas.bartkus@khf.vu.lt; giedriuskaminskas@hotmail.com; rokas.grunda@khf.vu.lt,"Grunda, Rokas/C-1301-2011",,,,,,31,0,1,0,33,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

However, these days, computers are capable of charging by the minute (or second if an operator so chooses), so technically there is no need for block pricing and the pricing strategy can be a policy decision. Operators, in one hand, are unaware of the impact of this measure on parking turnover and may believe that daily income will be affected. Businesses, on the other hand, will want to know if the measure has an effect on whether or not trips motivated by non-social activities will be carried out, given that they are spontaneous and are directly related to a client's perception. Finally, practical implications in terms of client response have not been studied, since smaller charging blocks may be considered as a disincentive to make additions to stay duration; this has repercussions on turnover and consequently on wait time at the entrance.

However, we are often in the stunned and even in the helpless dilemma, when the unexpected political risk and heavy disaster happens.

Therefore, the author thinks: it is necessary to put forward question and countermeasure about the Dilemma that four responses should be applied when current domestic and foreign insurance industry faces suddenly serious big events. (The first one is how to deal with the important political risks, such as sudden change in the current international situation, regional national political unrest, wars and military conflict? The second one is how to deal with the deep influence and negative effect produced by the post financial crisis. Reflection and countermeasures of global economic growth face a new turning point, the new pressures and challenges are faced by the domestically and internationally commercial and policy insurance industry. The third one is how to deal with compensation and reconstruction after global extraordinary natural disaster; How to deal with the serious consequences radiated by domino effect caused by these losses. The four one is how to construct the big channel and strategic construction that is to make Yunnan province become a bridgehead facing southwest countries, to build opening frontier window and position of China facing to South Asia, Southeast Asia and of the10 plus 3,9 plus2, Pan-Pearl River Delta  and other domestic and foreign) .

However, due to limitations on existing data, none of the previous studies have accounted for the estimation of the total delay caused by precipitation. The objective of this study is to estimate the non-recurrent traffic congestion on freeways caused by precipitation. To accomplish this objective, archived weather and traffic data for the year 2008 from the Korean Freeway Systems was collected and analyzed. As a result, non-recurrent traffic congestion was about 1.6 million vehicle-hours due to rainfall and 186,000 vehicle-hours due to snowfall in 2008. In addition, simple analyses were performed to describe the average non-recurrent traffic congestion per unit distance as a function of precipitation and a function of the time period of precipitation. Although precipitation events might not be handled by human efforts, these results will assist in making strategic plans such as active speed management and contingency planning for mitigating traffic congestion due to precipitation.

We use the classical concept of the financial architecture proposed by Stewart Myers in 1999, according to whom this term refers to the entire financial design of the business, including ownership, the legal form of organization, incentives, financing and allocation of risk [1]. We examine each element of the financial architecture to expose their features in Russian business groups. All papers written about internal capital markets in Russian business groups date the period of 1990s - the beginning of 2000 year [2]. In our research we study the last ten years to show that despite changes in economic situation the internal capital market still exist in Russian business groups. To prove it we use a sort of external and internal approaches. We call external the approach to examine the sample of business groups in order to understand their financial characteristics and the impact to the activity of internal capital market. The internal method consists in the examination of one business group effecting its payments through the bank under its control that enable to see mechanisms of capital allocation and to evaluate the efficiency of business group's resource planning.","[Gortseva, Natalia V.; Dobroserdova, Irina I.] St Petersburg State Univ Econ & Finances, Chair Finances, St Petersburg, Russia",,,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,231,240,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100022,0

Yet, new insights from the inter-organisational network and cluster literatures underline the role of non-local linkages in enabling firms in networks to enhance learning and to innovate. This paper contributes to this literature by examining the importance of local and non-local knowledge networks for the innovation performance of firms in clusters. Our analysis is based on primary data from a survey of 95 software firms clustered in Montevideo, Uruguay. The results highlight that the most innovative firms in clusters heavily rely on non-local knowledge networks. Moreover, the number of indirect local ties to other firms is a better predictor of innovative performance than the number of direct local ties. Finally, our findings confirm the presence of knowledge gatekeepers in clusters and emphasise their role in enhancing innovation in clusters by absorbing knowledge from extra-cluster sources and diffusing it to other local firms.","[Kesidou, Effie] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Snijders, Chris] Eindhoven Univ Technol TU E, Sch Innovat Sci, Eindhoven, Netherlands",University of Nottingham; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Kesidou, E (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,,"Kesidou, Professor Effie/0000-0002-5729-8624",,,,,66,31,37,0,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The empirical analysis in this paper is based on a database of Swedish academic patents. Our results indicate that academic involvement mainly takes place in inventions highly related to firms' technology bases. The findings moreover show that firms' academic patents, as compared to their non-academic patents, have lower importance in firms' core technological fields but higher importance in their marginal fields. We provide an interpretation of these results, suggesting that firm-owned academic patents largely result from demand pull rather than science push and that firms involve academics mainly for problem-solving activities in their core technological fields.","[Ljungberg, Daniel; McKelvey, Maureen] Univ Gothenburg, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Sch Business Econ & law, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Ljungberg, D (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Sch Business Econ & law, Box 625, Gothenburg, Sweden.",daniel.ljungberg@handels.gu.se,,"Ljungberg, Daniel/0000-0002-3868-516X",,,,,45,8,8,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Using the data from the Central Statistical Bureau, State Employment Agency, and the results of a survey of households, municipality representative and expert survey results, the author shows the influence of the activity on the state and municipality budgets by assessing: Activity's administrative and organisational expenses; Alternative costs - implementation of the Activity means that the municipality does not have to cover expenses that it would have to cover if the Activity would not be implemented. The author shows that the World Bank designed activity had helped numerous inhabitants of Latvia to ensure at least a temporary employment and maintain their desire to stay in the labour force.

First these studies based on questionnaire responses are briefly described. The rest of the paper covers two important areas of investment decision making process. First area concerns investment decision techniques (including profitability measures, payback period, net present value, internal rate of return etc.) used for project appraisal and their implementation rate. The results of own research realized on a sample of 252 companies from the Czech Republic are described. Testing of dependencies using the criteria of investment decisions on selected characteristics of the respondents led to the conclusion that the choice of these criteria affects the size of the undertaking but does not depend on the type of ownership (domestic or foreign). For comparison, the results of other Czech and foreign surveys are described too. Comparison with the results of several foreign researches has demonstrated a significantly higher rate of application of dynamic criteria than in the Czech Republic. Second area compares several ways, in which risk and uncertainty in project appraisal and selection are included. In both of these areas of investment decision making various hypotheses of dependencies of project appraisal and risk analysis techniques on selected parameters of surveyed enterprises are tested. Research has shown a preference for applying verbal risk characteristics, but the frequent use of numerical characteristics was rather surprising. There is no evidence regarding the hypothesis of dependencies of using numerical risk characteristics to company size, strategy formulation, form of ownership etc. Comparison with the results of the foreign research has demonstrated a higher use of sensitivity analysis, scenarios and simulation techniques than in the Czech Republic.",,,,lenka@vse.cz; scholl@vse.cz; fotr@vse.cz,"Švecová, Lenka/AAE-5194-2021","Švecová, Lenka/0000-0002-0329-2921",,,,,24,5,5,0,21,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Thus, the aim of the study is to answer the question: How might QMS support strategic advantages more intensively? A qualitative methodology is employed because of the intention of in-depth penetration of QMS. The research demonstrates that QMS has the potential to bring significant benefits to an organization. However, these benefits do not happen automatically; they require appropriate utilisation of the ISO 9001 standard, as well as the effort and motivation of managers.

AN-related policies can be traced back to the eighth Five-Year Plan period (i.e., 1991-1995). All the work during the last twenty years has cumulatively prompted the transition of AFV development from policy-making to actual implementation and from research and development (R&D) to mass production. The year of 2009 is significant for the AFV industry in China in that the central government announced the Plan on Shaping and Revitalizing the Auto Industry. This Plan launched a demonstration program of electric vehicle (EV) deployment in 13 Chinese cities and set the national goal of manufacturing 0.5 million AFVs in three years.

It did not elaborate on how to achieve integration. The Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Strategy, in preparation, has provided an opportunity to explore this question. This study has underlined the importance of understanding structural economic changes that are influencing a city's economic geography, extending the idea of what should be part of an 'integrated approach'. This structural economic approach has highlighted the importance of land use/transport solutions that differ from what might normally feature in a narrower transport prioritisation process. The Melbourne study has taken both top down and bottom up approaches to strategy integration, which has also widened the emerging strategic transport priorities from those that meet trunk service needs to also include local or neighbourhood level services. These can play important roles in promoting social inclusion and improved wellbeing. The paper reviews the strengths and weaknesses of the Melbourne study and suggests ways in which it can contribute to better practice in integrated land use/transport strategic planning.

To gain insights into how authorities deal with (improving) service reliability, an international survey was performed, showing that very little attention is paid to service reliability during the design of the network and of the timetable. It also illustrates that there is little consistency in approaches. In addition, a second survey was performed, showing how Dutch authorities deal with service reliability in relation to concession requirements and incentive regimes. The main findings are that consistency is lacking on this topic and that minimum attention is paid to passenger impacts of unreliability in concession requirements. This results in services that do not match the (implicitly) required level of service reliability. These surveys also revealed that there is no consistency in the definition of service reliability. For instance, traditional indicators focus on vehicles instead of passengers. By using an alternative reliability indicator, additional travel time, we demonstrated that traditional indicators lead to wrong indications. Based on our findings, we present recommendations to improve concession requirements as well as to improve the design of networks and of timetables, both aiming at enhanced service reliability.

Relying on a knowledge production function, we model country-level innovative performances in the RE sector for 18 OECD countries in the period 1990-2006. Our findings confirm that, once controlling for climate-energy policies, international knowledge spillovers contribute significantly to RE innovation, and their effect is comparable with domestic R&D and human capital.

Prior explanations have focused on the inherent features of Delaware corporate law and on the positive network externalities created by so many other firms domiciling in Delaware. We offer an additional explanation: a firm may choose Delaware simply because its law is nationally known and thus can serve as a lingua franca for in-state and out-of-state investors. Analyzing the incorporation decisions of 1,850 venture-capitalist-backed start-ups, we find evidence consistent with this lingua franca explanation. Indeed, the lingua franca effect appears to be more important than other factors that have been shown to influence corporate domicile, such as corporate law flexibility and the quality of a state's judiciary. Our study contributes to the literature on the market for corporate charters by providing evidence that Delaware's continued dominance is in part due to investors' familiarity with its corporate law.","[Broughman, Brian] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Fried, Jesse M.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ibrahim, Darian] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Harvard University; William & Mary,"Broughman, B (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,"Ibrahim, Darian/0000-0001-7855-495X",,,,,40,14,16,4,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Using this approach we estimate SDR for transportation infrastructure investments based on an analysis of correlations between transportation, split between road and rail, and between passenger travel and freight transport, and GDP in Sweden 1950-2011. We show that this can be estimated from two time-series following a random walk with drift, even if the variables are not co-integrated. Based on current estimates of the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium, we estimate the relevant SDR to be 5-6 per cent, possibly somewhat lower for investment in railroads for passenger travel, and only slowly declining within the investment horizon.

These tasks must start with the science which tells us that this is a problem of risk management on an immense scale. Risks on this scale take us far outside the familiar policy questions and standard, largely marginal, techniques commonly used by economists; this is a subject that requires the full breadth and depth of what economics has to offer and a much more thoughtful view of ethics than economists usually bring to bear.

Using an econometric methodology proposed by Lancaster and Imbens (J Econ 71:145-160, 1996) we compute the probability for each observation in the ACS data to refer to an illegal immigrant, conditional on observed characteristics. These results are novel, since no other work has quantified the characteristics of illegal immigrants from a random sample representative of the population. Using these conditional probability weights on the ACS data, we are able to uncover some interesting facts on illegal immigrants. We find that, while illegal immigrants suffer a large wage penalty compared to legal immigrants at all education levels, the penalty decreases with education. We also find that the total fertility rate among illegal immigrant women is significantly higher than that among legal ones, in particular for middle and higher educated women. Looking at the sector of activity, we document that the sectors attracting most illegal immigrants are constructions and agriculture. We also generate empirical distributions for state of residence, country of origin, age, sex, and number of legal and illegal immigrants.

So far, the dynamic factor model and its variants have been the most successful models for such exercises. In this paper, we investigate a category of LASSO-based approaches and evaluate their predictive abilities for forecasting twenty important macroeconomic variables. These alternative models can handle hundreds of data series simultaneously, and extract useful information for forecasting. We also show, both analytically and empirically, that combing forecasts from LASSO-based models with those from dynamic factor models can reduce the mean square forecast error (MSFE) further. Our three main findings can be summarized as follows. First, for most of the variables under investigation, all of the LASSO-based models outperform dynamic factor models in the out-of-sample forecast evaluations. Second, by extracting information and formulating predictors at economically meaningful block levels, the new methods greatly enhance the interpretability of the models. Third, once forecasts from a LASSO-based approach are combined with those from a dynamic factor model by forecast combination techniques, the combined forecasts are significantly better than either dynamic factor model forecasts or the naive random walk benchmark.

This paper examines a series of explanatory factors, broader than those explained by traditional theory, to see whether they are able to more accurately explain the returns. Should the previous point be confirmed, we must consider that the risk of an asset depends on multiple factors, rather than the few that are usually identified in the literature. Even though more than 300,000 factors are examined in this paper, the results show that in recent years just 87 factors are able to fully explain the returns of 4,500 companies in the 15 European countries examined. Our analysis also shows that business and macroeconomic, rather than financial factors, are those that heavily bear on asset returns; and that factors that affect asset return, either only positively or only negatively, do not exist. However, the same factor can affect some companies positively and others negatively. Thus, since not all firms are always sensitive to the same factors, there is the possibility to further decrease risk in proportion to return, through a factor-based risk optimisation process.","[Teti, Emanuele] Bocconi Univ, CReSV Res Ctr, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Teti, Emanuele] Bocconi Univ, Dept Finance, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Teti, E (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, CReSV Res Ctr, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",mauro.andriotto@unibocconi.it; emanuele.teti@unibocconi.it,,"teti, emanuele/0000-0002-1849-0445",,,,,22,0,1,0,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Using annual data from 1988-2009 for India and selected benchmark OECD countries, we have conducted quantile and robust regression to assess the impact of deviation from the optimal financial structure on the output growth. To our knowledge the present study is one of the pioneer works in calculating the optimal financial structure in Indian context. The empirical evidence suggests that as the economy develops the services provided by banks are comparatively more important than those provided by the stock markets. The financial structure matters for the growth process. The deviation from the optimal structure has harmful effects on the economy and the financial structure gap retards the growth process.","[Sethi, Pradeepta; Kumar, Brajesh] Natl Inst Financial Management, Faridabad 121001, Haryana, India",,"Sethi, P (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Financial Management, Sect 48,Pali Rd, Faridabad 121001, Haryana, India.",pradeeptas07@gmail.com; bkumar@nifm.ac.in,,"Sethi, Pradeepta/0000-0002-4275-9395",,,,,41,1,1,1,27,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Contrary to this dominant finding, a few recent studies conclude that there is no relationship between several measures of welfare spending and crime. This paper contributes to the debate using data from the Unemployed Heads of Household Program (UHHP), the largest poverty alleviation program launched by the Argentinean government to cope with the deleterious effects of the 2002 crisis. Province-level dynamic panel data reveals that UHHP, featuring conditional cash transfers had a negative impact on crime, particularly on property crimes and its main categories, larceny and robbery. UHHP also diminished aggravated assault but had no influence on murder. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

During the recent (and still ongoing) financial crisis, answers to this question using standard approaches, e.g., regulatory capital ratios, were no longer credible, and thus broad-based supervisory stress testing became the new tool. Bank balance sheets are notoriously opaque and susceptible to asset substitution (easy swapping of high risk for low risk assets), so stress tests, tailored to the situation at hand, can provide clarity by openly disclosing details of the results and approaches taken, allowing trust to be regained. With that trust re-established, the cost-benefit of stress testing disclosures may tip away from bank-specific towards more aggregated information. This paper lays out a framework for the stress testing of banks: why it is useful and why it has become such a popular tool for the regulatory community in the course of the recent financial crisis; how stress testing is done (design and execution); and finally, with stress testing results in hand, how one should handle their disclosure, and whether it should be different in crisis vs. normal times.

We use the concepts of public utility, common carrier, special infrastructure, and general purpose technologies to analyze this question, as such concepts typically are invoked as foundations for continued regulation of communications networks. We examine the historical development of the public utility and common carrier concepts and find that the essential features of these constructs largely do not fit communications networks today and for the foreseeable future. More recent frameworks for economic regulation also do not fit. Communications networks are not special infrastructure because they do not exhibit zero marginal costs over an appreciable range of demand and do not exhibit a differentiating amount of social demand.

Together, they produce an informational model of policy knowledge diffusion, which addresses who, how, and when questions. In addition to offering specific propositions, the model shifts the focus from the diffusion of specific policies to diffusion of information in policy areas.

However, housing is not truly affordable if located in an inaccessible area with high transportation costs. Increasing the supply of affordable housing in accessible locations helps achieve multiple planning objectives: it reduces transportation costs, improves economic opportunity for disadvantaged groups, reduces accident risks, conserves energy and reduces pollution emissions. In recent years researchers have developed analysis methods for measuring total housing and transportation costs for different locations within cities, called a Housing and Transportation (H+T) Affordability Index. This study applies this type of analysis in Qom City, Iran. The results indicate that suburban-area households spend more than 57% of their monthly income on housing and transport, significantly more than the 45% spent by households in the central district. This is consistent with research results in other urban areas. This illustrates the feasibility of applying housing and transportation affordability analysis in developing country cities to help identify truly affordable and sustainable development.

In this representation, the rationale for action on climate change is liberated from the premise of an exogenous physical threat, and replaced by incentives endogenous to the market in the form of opportunities in the so-called carbon economy. The relationship between climate science and action upon climate change has in this process become markedly different from common assumptions whereby science is either ignored or obfuscated, or followed faithfully as the evidence base for policy. Strikingly, the abandoning of climate ontology as irrelevant to corporate decision-making has enabled a large-scale investment of capital into the policies nominally designed to tackle climate change.","[Jankovic, Vladimir] Univ Manchester, Ctr Hist Sci Technol & Med, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Bowman, Andrew] Univ Manchester, Ctr Res Sociocultural Change, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Jankovic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Ctr Hist Sci Technol & Med, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",andrew.bowman5@gmail.com,,"Jankovic, Vladimir/0000-0002-7341-8091",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H005471/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H005471/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,116,17,20,1,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Using a panel of Chinese manufacturing firms, we find a positive and statistically significant relationship between firm productivity and city-level human capital. This result is robust to alternative model specifications and estimation methods used and distinguishable from the effect of industry agglomeration and the spillover effect associated with foreign direct investment. We argue that human capital spillovers do not occur automatically and freely. The intensity of spillovers depends on the benefits and costs accrued to individual workers, which in turn depend on the growth, technological and institutional environments in which the firm operates. We find that the intensity of spillovers is greater in industries where human capital matters more, in larger or more densely populated cities and in more economically vibrant coastal cities. We also find that the intensity of spillovers is generally greater for non-state-owned firms than for state-owned ones and displays an upward trend, which is suggestive of an intensifying impact of market-oriented reforms on human capital externalities.","[Liu, Zhiqiang] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Liu, Zhiqiang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, ZQ (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",zqliu@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,29,15,17,3,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Our empirical results show that there are interesting and meaningful differences across sectors, which are linked to the different phases of the technology life cycles.","[Krafft, Jackie; Quatraro, Francesco; Saviotti, Pier Paolo] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS GREDEG, Valbonne, France; [Quatraro, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Moncalieri, TO, Italy; [Saviotti, Pier Paolo] INRA GAEL, Grenoble, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Collegio Carlo Alberto; INRAE,"Quatraro, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS GREDEG, Valbonne, France.",francesco.quatraro@unice.fr,"krafft, jackie/J-6278-2012; Quatraro, Francesco/S-3012-2017","Quatraro, Francesco/0000-0001-5746-2239; KRAFFT, Jackie/0000-0002-8011-9866",,,,,63,25,27,4,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

This case study of the Pashtunwali the customary law followed by the ethnic Pashtun tribes in Afghanistan and Pakistan illustrates that both law and community defense can be effectively produced without the institutions of a state. The incentives created under Pashtunwali have provided the Pashtun with a decentralized system for maintaining order within and between the tribes for several centuries without the authority of a coercive state. In addition, they have generated a system of spontaneous decentralized defense that has allowed the Pashtun to retain/regain their independence from the states that have tried to colonize or subjugate them for centuries.

This is verified by the strands of theoretical and empirical research in economics. However, switching costs arise from a number of different sources. This article shows that the composition of the total switching costs, although acknowledged, has been of secondary importance to economic research when it comes to the use of the concept as a hypernym. This is a challenge to antitrust analysis, in which the origin of switching costs may be decisive with respect to whether observed rigidity in market dynamics needs to be dealt with in the first place. A recognition and evaluation of the different sources of switching costs matter in antitrust analysis, and may reveal the adherence to specific doctrines of economics. This article proposes a typology of switching costs that enables a systematic and eclectic approach to analyzing the role of switching costs as a source of market power or as an impediment to consumer choice. The approach can gain antitrust enforcement, competition advocacy, and the implementation of consumer protection policies.","Finnish Competit & Consumer Author, Helsinki, Finland",,"Björkroth, T (通讯作者)，Finnish Competit & Consumer Author, Helsinki, Finland.",Tom.Bjorkroth@kkv.fi,,"Bjorkroth, Tom/0000-0001-6790-5056",,,,,32,1,1,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The project was one of several that City Hall hurriedly implemented following pressure from bike activists. On the Sunday the project was launched, more than three thousand cyclists are estimated to have used the bicycle lane; of these, 300 cycled alongside the lane, outside it, against it. They made the front pages of newspapers, disrupted the sociotechnical framework of bicycle policy in the city and put bicycles on the political agenda of the municipal elections. This paper discusses why, in a city renowned worldwide for its public transportation system and for having more than a 100 km of bicycle lanes, a bicycle project failed after being sabotaged by cyclists and was definitively abandoned in February 2013. Based on interviews with key actors, including public officials, journalists, and bicycle activists, this paper concludes that the failed bicycle lane unveils the profound and urgent social and political dimensions embedded in what had been presented by municipal authorities as a neutral technical solution.

Group influence on choices, the new ` cultural revolution' and the desire for achievement and modernity have emerged as drivers of the demand for imported wine, the pursuit of luxury, the wish for westernisation and the perception of a foreign product's country of origin (COO).

However, few studies explore and quantify systematically the relationships between innovation factors and the performance of capital projects. This study of 121 capital projects shows that the relationships among project innovation stimulants, innovation capacity, and project performance are indeed significant. Hierarchical robust regression analyses using a maximum R-square improvement procedure show that technology management has the highest effect on the variation in our project performance data. Validating out-of-sample data demonstrates that our optimal model explains 34.42% of the variation in the performance of capital projects. Ultimately, our findings suggest that project human factors are essential stimulants in innovation performance, which in turn affect the performance of capital projects. Our findings also reveal that the stimulant factors do not have a direct impact on capital project performance, but rather have an indirect impact via project innovation capacity.","Natl Univ Tainan, Dept Business & Management, Tainan 700, Taiwan",National University Tainan,"Chen, HL (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Tainan, Dept Business & Management, 33,Sec 2,Shu Lin St, Tainan 700, Taiwan.",along314@mail.nutn.edu.tw,,,,,,,66,15,17,2,41,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

It can be assumed that a company that wants to succeed on the market must use its competitive advantage and develop its competitiveness. This is based on the ability to respond quickly and correctly to the requirements of customers and competing companies. Competitiveness means a company generating competitive advantages faster than its competitors. The authors look at the question of which competitive advantages exist among the companies in ERN, what is important to companies and what relationship there is between competitive advantages and the competitive strategies used. The introduction to the paper presents methodological approaches to the topics of competitive strategies and the competitive environment from the perspective of experts on the matter. The main aim of the paper is to identify and characterise the competitive environment of companies in the Czech part of Euroregion Nisa based on an evaluation of data from primary questioning. The authors of the paper deal with the issue of the main competitive strategies that companies now use and in what lies their competitive advantage. Results and discussion are found in an evaluation of primary research undertaken among 170 companies in the Czech part of Euroregion Nisa. A detailed investigation confirmed that competitive advantage and competitive strategies need to be understood as multi-dimensional and multi-factored. There are several key types of competitive advantage, their number and order of importance depending on many circumstances; for example a company's sphere of activity, the area of business activity, the size of the company, the requirements of owners and customers, the priorities of management and so on. Each industry uses its own competitive advantage differently and the decisive factor is succeeding with customers.

Two different streams of perception of odd prices are developed - a level effect and an image effect. The paper focuses on the latter effect. The authors analyze the perception of odd prices in different categories of products - convenience goods, clothes and domestic appliances. In addition, four different levels of a price were used in order to measure the perception of a price having various price levels. The results showed that Lithuanians have a different attitude about odd prices compared with the research in developed countries. At the same time the survey showed that the respondents' experience related to odd prices fits the results of the research from developed countries. Moreover, the participants of the survey intuitively perceived odd prices as something negative and associated odd prices with cheating in the case of convenience products, or with discounted products in the case of shopping goods. This research demonstrates that companies should not practice nine-ending pricing widely since the respondents associated odd prices were preferred more in the case of cheap products (up to 10 LTL) than expensive products, and odd prices were related with discounted products in the case of shopping goods.","[Dikcius, Vytautas; Katkuviene, Kristina] Vilnius State Univ, Int Business Sch, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Dikcius, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Int Business Sch, Sauletekio Al 22, Vilnius, Lithuania.",v.dikcius@gmail.com; kristina@fesla.lt,,"Dikcius, Vytautas/0000-0001-6403-2704",,,,,43,0,0,1,24,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Nevertheless, whether the strategic mission is not well understood and accepted by all organization's members, then, any change would spring up the opponents that are not sharing the shareholders or management values. Therefore, the culture may be a barrier against change and the organizational culture itself may be more difficult to be changed. Based on the briefly presented framework, this paper is underlying the major cultural problems that the organizations are facing when entering into the host country. Furthermore, it is proposing a change management model to integrate the cultural values of the international organization into the host country's organization. In gathering and selecting the data, the Delphi method has been applied to a group of 12 persons working in corporations, as well as personal judgment. However, the model harmonizes issues of organizational culture with stages to be followed in the process of change management.

As part of the on-going initiatives to improve International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) promotes the development of principle-based IFRS, which aim to address the problems of vagueness, inconsistency and ambiguity. This paper reports on the findings of a design science research (DSR) project that, as artefact, developed a first version ontology-based formal language representing the definitions of asset, liability and equity (the fundamental elements of the statement of financial position as defined in the Conceptual Framework) through the application of knowledge representation (ontology) techniques as used within computing. We suggest that this artefact may assist with addressing vagueness, inconsistencies and ambiguities within the definitions of the Conceptual Framework. Based on our findings, we include suggestions for the further development of a formal language and approach to assist the formulation of the Conceptual Framework.

The common tendencies aiming at an increased use of punishment as primary response to the identification of tax evasion have to be applied in a balanced manner, taking into account the circumstances in which the punishment has a positive, instructive impact and the situations in which its effects are harmful, contributing to the intensification of the voluntary tax noncompliance phenomenon. This paper is an attempt to shift focus from the excessive use of the traditional tax behavior modelling tools, namely control and punishment, to means by which taxpayers are supported and helped in the process of identifying and paying their tax obligations. Such a method, which is more readily and quickly accepted by taxpayers, will result in an increased level of tax education and voluntary compliance on the part of the latter.","Victor Slavescu Ctr Financial & Monetary Res, Bucharest, Romania",,"Ionel, L (通讯作者)，Victor Slavescu Ctr Financial & Monetary Res, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,3,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,635,640,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100085,0

This scrutiny arises mainly from the perspective that one of the principal objectives of capital requirements is to promote and contribute to financial stability. However, the literature on the topic is scarce almost to the point of non-existence regarding capital's validity as tool to level the playing fields between financial institutions. The objective of this article is therefore to investigate financial regulations based on capital requirements from the perspective of its goal of providing equal competitive conditions for financial institutions, the attainment of which is based on the assumption that the cost of capital between institutions (and countries) is the same, which might not necessarily be the case. The cost of capital for 51 financial institutions across 17 countries (three institutions per country) is accordingly calculated in this article using original weighted average cost of capital and capital asset pricing models, as well as modified versions of these to include more country-specific factors. The objective of the article is sought firstly by determining whether the cost of capital is the same among countries and secondly, based on the results, ascertaining whether financial regulations based on capital requirements can therefore realistically achieve this objective of providing equal competitive conditions for financial institutions.","[Jacobs, Johann; van Vuuren, Gary] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Mahikeng, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Jacobs, J (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Mahikeng, South Africa.",,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",,,,,61,1,1,0,8,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In the present case of state-owned commercial forests in Finland, legislation requires specific management practices to enhance recreational benefits free of charge to the public. This choice experiment considers Finnish people's valuation of the recreation-oriented management of state-owned commercial forests to evaluate whether the recreational benefits produced justify the related loss of profits from timber sales. We focus on three management attributes: scenic buffer zones along lakes and rivers, habitats for game birds, and the quality of scenery as reflected by the frequency of clear-cut areas along hiking trails. Marginal willingness-to-pay (WTP) effects for the attributes are estimated with random parameters logit models specified in the WTP space, while preference-space models are used to estimate in physical terms the attribute levels that maximize the benefits to the public. Despite regional differences in preferences, people in all parts of Finland valued the current recreation-oriented management of state-owned commercial forests considerably. Nationwide, the aggregate benefits of recreation-enhancing management clearly exceeded the estimated opportunity costs. The most preferred levels of management attributes were slightly above the current levels, suggesting an increase in the provision of recreational services when not considering the associated costs.

Therefore the paper deals with the factors constraining development plans of small farm holders, the current possibilities for improving small farm market capability, the possible development strategies to choose, and proposals for the improvement of small farm market capability in Latvia. The most significant barriers to implement the development plans for Latvian small farms are the lack of the production assets and also the difficulties to attract funding for long-term investments and current assets, as well as poor market infrastructure. The existing support measures have had a positive impact on the structural changes in Latvian agriculture; however, these measures have not been sufficient to solve the problems of the market capability of small farms and to contribute to their economic growth sufficiently. In order to improve the market capability of small farms of Latvia, programmatic approach is proposed consisting of four components: 1) training, 2) development of a business plan, 3) evaluation of a business plan, and 4) implementation of the business idea.

Companies are fine-slicing their value chains, and moving beyond the offshoring of peripheral and non-core activities to the offshoring of advanced and essential activities that are closer to their core (e.g. research, design and product development). The challenge is to understand the limits of offshoring and the most appropriate modes of offshoring. The purpose of this paper is to analyze what activities are offshorable and how best to govern offshored activities. We argue that companies are redefining their core activities and in this process, some essential activities previously viewed as core activities are being detached from the core, and they become more offshorable. The study uses a sample of 565 offshoring operations conducted by 263 multinational companies from 15 European countries. A logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between the activities offshored (non-core versus essential activities) and the offshoring mode implemented (captive offshoring versus offshore outsourcing). We find that essential activities are typically offshored using the captive mode, while offshore outsourcing is commonly used to offshore non-core activities; and this trend is even more pronounced in knowledge-intensive companies where interfaces between the various activities are less standardized. This paper offers managers and CEOs an integrative tool that can make easier decisions regarding offshoring modes (captive versus offshore outsourcing) and serves as a reference point for further analyses of the implementation of offshoring strategies in multinational enterprises.","[Linares-Navarro, Esmeralda; Pla-Barber, Jose] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Pedersen, Torben] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Strateg Management & Globalizat, DK-2000 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Valencia; Copenhagen Business School,"Linares-Navarro, E (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Av Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",esmeralda.linares@uv.es; tp.smg@cbs.dk; jose.pla@uv.es,"LINARES-NAVARRO, ESMERALDA/ABG-7623-2020; Pedersen, Torben/N-2934-2017; Pla-Barber, Jose/AAL-1397-2021; Pedersen, Torben/IJY-1627-2023","Pedersen, Torben/0000-0001-7541-9365; Pla-Barber, Jose/0000-0001-5826-1762; Linares-Navarro, Esmeralda/0000-0001-7453-1232",,,,,52,23,26,2,32,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

At first the attention is paid to the meaning of regional competitiveness and to the evaluation of proposed methods to quantify it. After that the quantification of regional competitiveness is made according to the chosen method, which is based on a large number of indicators and then these indicators are summarized into three areas: Macroeconomic Performance, Growth Potential and Quality of Life. More than 4,200 figures represent eighteen indicators of fourteen regions during the time period of seventeen years and describe the level of regions from the viewpoint of various aspects. The ranking of individual regions in the three areas mentioned above is compiled on the basis of the selected measurement method of competitiveness. The level and dynamics of regions were in conformity with the expected results: Prague is the best region, followed by Jihomoravsky and Jihocesky Regions and, on the contrary, the Ustecky and especially Moravskoslezsky and Karlovarsky Regions are the worst ones. Therefore, the convergence/divergence analysis was conducted to provide detailed knowledge of this phenomenon. The concept of beta-convergence and a-convergence was applied to our data and the sets of regions which converge or diverge over some period of time were searched for. Although some of these sets exist, it is not possible to say that the convergence or divergence is a strong process typical of the majority of regions. On the contrary, the discrepancies among regions in the Czech Republic are persistent.","[Martincik, David] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Slehoferova, Marta] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Geog, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Martincík, D (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen, Czech Republic.",martinci@kem.zcu.cz; msleh@kge.zcu.cz,"Noskova, Marta/K-4689-2016","Noskova, Marta/0000-0003-2890-555X",,,,,41,7,7,0,13,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The test for defining the relevant product and geographic market follows the conditions required by the European Union Competition Law and so it takes into account both demand- and supply-side substitution. The empirical model using sales data from a set of movie theatres in the North of Spain, incorporating the observed locations of consumers vis-A -vis the stores, shows that empirical tests of market definition may lead to an implausible (too restrictive) definition of the relevant market if supply-side substitution is not accounted for.

Estimates that are based on a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms that are observed during the period 1998-2009 reveal that both magnitudes are positive and significant. Simulations that are carried out with the estimated parameters show that subsidies can generate permanent inducement effects for 9 % of Spanish manufacturing firms. The subsidy shares that are needed to generate permanent inducement effects among small firms (firms with fewer than 200 employees) are larger than those that are needed to generate permanent inducement effects among large firms (firms with 200 or more employees).,"Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Econ Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Arqué-Castells, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Econ Barcelona, Edifici B,Campus Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",pere.arque@uab.cat,"Arque-Castells, Pere/L-2513-2014","Arque-Castells, Pere/0000-0003-0725-1956",,,,,36,40,42,0,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Research is, however, scarce regarding the interaction of formal and informal transfer mechanisms. In this paper, we analyze whether these activities are mutually reinforcing, i.e., complementary. Our analysis is based on a comprehensive data-set of more than 2,000 German manufacturing firms and confirms a complementary relationship between formal and informal KTT modes: using both transfer channels contributes to higher innovation performance. The management of the firm should therefore strive to maintain close informal relationships with universities to realize the full potential of formal KTT.","[Grimpe, Christoph] Copenhagen Business Sch, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Grimpe, Christoph] Lund Univ, Res Policy Inst, Lund, Sweden; [Hussinger, Katrin] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Belgium; [Hussinger, Katrin] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium",Copenhagen Business School; Lund University; KU Leuven,"Grimpe, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",cg.ino@cbs.dk,,,,,,,56,88,94,3,116,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

It is therefore important to ensure that freight carriers comply with weight regulations. This paper provides a comprehensive review of how weigh-in-motion (WIM) technology has been used to improve the truck weight regulation in China. In particular, a toll-by-weight method is introduced for trucks using toll roads. Compared to the conventional vehicle class based toll structure, the toll-by-weight method establishes a fair fee structure that prevents overloaded trucks from taking advantage of non-overloaded trucks. It also allows freight carriers the flexibility of moderate overloading by paying higher toll rates. This paper further proposes a mechanism of integrating toll-by-weight with effective weight enforcement for truck weight regulations. It encourages overloaded trucks to use toll roads instead of vulnerable non-toll roads, and helps to generate additional much needed revenues by local governments for highway construction, maintenance, and truck weight enforcement. In addition, technical and managerial problems affecting the applications of WIM are pointed out in this paper. Finally, perspectives on future WIM development and adaptions of other advanced technologies for truck weight regulations are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this initial situation, rational persons are deprived of information that is 'irrelevant from the standpoint of justice'. It is rational, Rawls argues, for persons choosing principles of justice from this standpoint to be guided by the maximin rule. Critics, however, argue that (i) the maximin rule is not the appropriate decision rule for Rawls's choice position; (ii) the maximin argument relies upon an imprecise account of the satisfactory minimum to be secured under the maximin rule; or that (iii) Rawls relies upon unrealistic assumptions about diminishing marginal value. These critics, I will suggest, argue from a number of assumptions that are confused or false. The satisfactory minimum that choosers in the original position - employing the maximin rule - seek to achieve is not a minimum level of primary goods, nor is the satisfactory minimum sought under the maximin rule supplied by the difference principle. I will argue that the maximin argument is more robust than has generally been recognized and that this argument performs a number of important functions in clarifying the nature and implications of Rawls's argument for justice as fairness.","Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Kaufman, A (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",akaufman@uga.edu,,,,,,,33,4,4,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Respondents acknowledge the positive effects of cooperation with respect to logistics land allocation, but recognize some impediments. Municipalities that already cooperate with others are positive about the results. Hence, municipalities are advised to build partnerships, such that land allocation policies can be better aligned with the stimulation of logistics concentration areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study finds that the Protestant ethic did not so much decline as become transformed. The work ethic remained in force, while frugality weakened. This transformation is traced to three dynamic social forces: degradation in the quality of work due to industrialization, the decline of community with urbanization, and a dramatic increase in inequality. Consequently, social respect and social standing came increasingly to be sought through consumption, which became a proxy for hard work, entailing a weakening of asceticism.","[Wisman, Jon D.; Davis, Matthew E.] Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Wisman, JD (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",jdwisma@american.edu; davis.matthew@gmail.com,,"Wisman, Jon D./0000-0001-7563-3150; Davis, Matthew/0000-0003-2219-1138",,,,,87,4,8,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Furthermore there is little evidence on the demand for or value of walking infrastructure in either urban or rural areas. The value of and the propensity to walk or cycle in rural areas is likely to be different from that in urban areas, partly due to the distances involved, but also the different levels of traffic. Using evidence from Ireland this paper presents new evidence on the value of pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure in a rural environment. The models are sensitive to the household's location as well as other demographic factors. Average willingness to pay estimates for users of the facilities are 41.0 cents/trip for walking and 19.3 cents/trip for cycling. These results when applied ex ante to a number of proposed rural road upgrades demonstrate that such infrastructure offers value for money. There remain significant barriers to increased participation in walking and cycling, which makes it difficult to estimate demand and willingness to pay models based on data, which do not reveal peoples' attitudes to walking and cycling (e.g. census data).

However, Linate continued operating to the major European destinations, overlapping with the Malpensa network and limiting its performance. That, among other factors, led Alitalia to withdraw its hubbing activities from the airport in 2008. Limitations in Linate and high access times to Malpensa induced low-cost carriers to develop elsewhere.

Legislators and courts, however, cannot wait to make decisions until scholarship is conclusive; hence the question arises which policy conclusions are the 'least irrational' under those circumstances. I argue that, when scholarship is inconclusive, one principle that should guide legislators and courts is that the number of instruments should equal the number of problems. Using a single instrument for two or more problems leads to ineffectiveness (especially if the relative social importance of the problems is unequal) and indeterminacy (because setting the compromise optimally requires empirical information on the relative social importance of the problems, which is hard to acquire). I therefore argue that legislators and courts should only deviate from this principle when they have serious indications that the underlying problems are nearly completely nonverifiable and in addition roughly equal in terms of social importance. I show that when these guidelines are applied, the theoretical indeterminacy surrounding optimal remedies for contract breach - the poster child of indeterminacy - largely disappears.

Researchers, by identifying country characteristics (e.g., ethnic fractionalization) that may influence government quality, have provided one potential explanation: Neighboring countries tend to be similar with respect to those characteristics. In this paper, we draw on Hirschman's notion of exit as a disciplining device in order to provide a different, though complementary, explanation: The ability of a ruler to implement policy that displeases the country's populace is constrained by opportunities for residents to relocate to other countries nearby. To generate testable predictions about the effects of potential exit on government quality, we develop a simple theoretical model. We test the model's predictions using cross-sectional and panel data, controlling for other determinants of government quality. The evidence we present - which includes discussion of historical examples such as ancient Greece and the Soviet Bloc - supports the model's predictions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, there is still a lack of econometric cross-country analyses allowing recognizing common cross-country determinants, but also country-specific characteristics of eco-innovations. Based on data from the fourth Community Innovation Survey for France and Germany, the present paper contributes to fill this gap. Using a fully harmonized econometric model for the two countries, we are able to detect remarkable similarities concerning the different determinants of eco-innovations despite differences in the national innovation systems. The results confirm the central role of regulation and cost savings as motivations for eco-innovations compared to other innovations. Furthermore, eco-innovative activities seem to require more external sources of knowledge and information. Due to the respective regulation, in France, universities as cooperation partners seem to be more important compared to Germany.","[Horbach, Jens] Augsburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Econ, D-86161 Augsburg, Germany; [Oltra, Vanessa; Belin, Jean] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, Bordeaux, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Horbach, J (通讯作者)，Augsburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Econ, Friedberger Str 4, D-86161 Augsburg, Germany.",jens.horbach@hs-augsburg.de,,,,,,,42,244,249,9,111,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

We find substantial differences in the redressing task. Detached observers propose significantly fairer redistributions than veiled stakeholders or involved spectators. Risk preferences partly explain why veiled stakeholders propose less egalitarian redistributions.

Under a noncooperative household model, the laissez-faire prevention levels are shown to be lower than the first-best levels, to an extent that is increasing in self-oriented coexistence concerns and decreasing in spousal altruism. The decentralization of the social optimum thus requires a subsidy on prevention depending on the precise type of coexistence concerns. Our results are shown to be globally robust to the introduction of imperfect observability of preferences, life insurance, imperfect marriage matching, and myopia.

Entrepreneurs are more optimistic and enjoy the nonpecuniary benefits of work more than wage earners. They embrace risk, but perhaps less so than commonly believed, as their risk-bearing is tempered by longer planning horizons. Family business owners share optimism and nonpecuniary benefits with other entrepreneurs; their tolerance for risk is not different than wage earners. In contrast, those who inherit businesses are significantly less risk tolerant than nonentrepreneurs, are no more optimistic than nonentrepreneurs, but seem to derive more nonpecuniary benefits from work than others.

The use of stepwise multiple regression showed that SMEs are able to exhibit superior innovation performance if they implement innovative ideas (or exploit market opportunities) and obtain external support with technically qualified entrepreneurs. Therefore, policy support to enhance the firm-level technical competence of SMEs and strengthen the external support infrastructure for SMEs would be beneficial.","Indian Inst Sci, Dept Management Studies, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Subrahmanya, MHB (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Sci, Dept Management Studies, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",bala@mgmt.iisc.ernet.in,"Mungila Hillemane, Bala Subrahmanya/A-2088-2009","Mungila Hillemane, Bala Subrahmanya/0000-0001-8745-6147",,,,,24,3,3,1,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This paper examines the use of contagion' as a model for assessing the dynamics of both episodes: the spread of infection and the diffusion of shock through an intrafinancial system. The argument is put that a discourse of globally emerging' and re-emerging' infection helped to shape a theory of financial contagion, which developed, particularly from 1997, in relation to financial crises in emerging markets' in Southeast Asia. Conversely, concerns about the economic impact of a global pandemic have been influential in shaping public health responses to communicable diseases from the early 1990s. The paper argues that tracing the conceptual entanglement of financial and biological contagions' is important for understanding the interconnected global environment within which risk is increasingly being evaluated. The paper also considers the consequences of this analogizing for how financial crises are understood and, ultimately, how responses to them are formulated.","[Peckham, Robert] Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Humanities & Med, Dept Hist, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Peckham, R (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",rpeckham@hku.hk,"Peckham, Robert/A-8355-2010","Peckham, Robert/0000-0001-8370-609X",,,,,80,68,70,0,91,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

There is some rebalancing of prices between urban and rural regions, with business prices decreasing by a larger amount in urban regions.

Through a two-stage, Nash best-response game, equilibria in the air transportation industry are searched to evaluate individual airline's profit. First, airlines choose whether or not to enter a market and second, they attempt to optimize profits through choice of service frequencies, aircraft sizes and airfreight rate, given the decisions of others. Taipei-Hong Kong and Taipei-Los Angeles route markets are selected as the empirical cases of model application. The examples indicate that combination airlines have competitive advantages in the markets and the equilibria in the markets may change due to the changes of air cargo demand in the market, air passenger travel demand, the operation scale of all-cargo carriers and the availability of time slots at the airports for all-cargo operators.

While these sectors constitute a high percentage of the population of Latin America, little research has been done regarding their business initiatives and models; therefore, the paper is focused on this subject. The research is qualitative and exploratory, using an ethnographic procedure within-depth interviews and following a multiple case study approach as a research strategy. The business models of ten new entrepreneurial initiatives located in the capital region and the city of Valencia are analyzed, based on the framework of six components and three decision levels proposed by Morris et al. (2005) for entrepreneurs. Results show that these initiatives have at least two components or decision areas poorly defined or consolidated, specifically: capabilities and internal processes, and positioning and strategy. This information is consistent with the fact that, since their founding, these business models have not evolved to a more advanced level at which companies develop sustainable competitive advantages. Also, there is a lack of congruence between the evolution of the business models and the aspirations of the entrepreneurs regarding the scope and growth of their firms.","[Antonia Cervilla, Maria] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Ciencias Econ & Adm, Caracas, Venezuela; [Puente, Raquel] ICESI, Dept Mercadeo & Negocios Int, Cali, Colombia",Simon Bolivar University; Universidad ICESI,"Cervilla, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Ciencias Econ & Adm, Caracas, Venezuela.",mcervilla@usb.ve; rpuente@icesi.edu.co,"Castro, Raquel/HZL-1168-2023; Castro, Raquel Puente/U-5976-2017","Castro, Raquel Puente/0000-0002-8902-1136",,,,,36,5,5,0,23,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

At the adoption level, analysis shows that FSS are mostly seen as a means of communicating the forecasts effectively, and their outputs can be used as springboard for organizational actions.

An empirical study in Davao City, Philippines",TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public transport dependency; Habit; Modes; Informal transport,BEHAVIOR,"The presence of unique kinds of public transportation often described as informal characterizes many cities in developing countries. As often noted, people in the lower income categories are usually the ones who rely on informal public transport services. In the Philippines, one can observed that an average Filipino uses door-to-door transport services regularly. This starts from stepping out of the house, walking several paces (if at all), hailing a pedicab (bicycle with a side-cab) or tricycle (motorcycle with side-cab), to riding a public utility jeepney (PUJs) or bus, getting-off, hopping on to another pedicab or tricycle, and getting transported right to the door of final destination. Using Davao City, Philippines as the case study area, the paper tries to explore the concept of habit and dependency on the different road-based public transport modes based on both theories of rational behavior and planned behavior. Empirical results using structural analysis show the strong public transport dependency to PUJs and tricycles where half of the household population have vehicles. It confirms the role of rational behavior where socio-economic factors affect modal decision. Likewise, the study also shows interesting findings wherein the quality of service evaluation played a direct role in the perceived dependency to formal modes (buses, taxis) and informal mode (such as motorcycle taxis or MC taxis) but an indirect role in the actual use of the mode. The study shows the relationship of perceived reliance vis-a-vis trip recall using indigenous modes (PUJs, tricycles) and supports the theory that suggests the role of habits and mere exposure effect. As noted in many related studies, it is not easy to alter habits. This indicator is validated by the actual use of public transport modes especially tricycles and MC taxis for short-distance trips as well as how one views own dependency vis-a-vis how the same individual sees his/her household and community dependency to a certain public transport mode. These findings suggest the need to understand Filipino commuter's psychology and a careful review and understanding of the concept of sustainability, infrastructure needs, seamless multi-modal connections and over-all quality of service given limited economic support in a context of an emerging city in a developing country.

It depends on the fraction of unskilled labor and the relative TFP differential between skilled and unskilled sector. First, for a larger proportion of unskilled labor force, there is widespread corruption and for smaller share of unskilled labor force, there is no corruption. For the intermediate level, equilibrium depends on the number of corrupt bureaucrats and there are multiple equilibria. Second, corruption decreases with the relative TFP differential between skilled and unskilled sector. For the intermediate level of TFP differential, there are multiple equilibria. On its consequences, corruption causes rise in the wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. It distorts the allocation of resources, which results in the output and the welfare losses, and it is associated with the higher tax rate.","GREQAM, F-13236 Marseille 2, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Wadho, WA (通讯作者)，GREQAM, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille 2, France.",waqar.wadho@univmed.fr,"Wadho, Waqar/R-6487-2019","Wadho, Waqar/0000-0002-6972-5697",,,,,24,4,4,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The following article proposes the evaluation of the environmental tax reform (ETR) as an economic tool for all of the E3 sectors. ETR is an important tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and, simultaneously, it can positively impact the economic growth and employment rate. Three fundamental studies and their differing ETR scenarios have been selected and examined taking into consideration various oil-prices, carbon-prices, greenhouse gas emission targets, revenue recycling methods and scales of ETR. This article deals with the possible ETR impacts on CO2 emissions, the GDP and the employment situation in the Czech Republic and substantiates the conclusions of some selected scenarios as well as outlines some prerequisites for the ETR implementation in the Czech Republic. The reference groups were put together to check the impact on selected EU countries and thus confirm or disprove the resulting conditions with a positive impact at the macro-economic level. The results depend on a combination of the following factors; the domestic market energy price, the economy's energy demand, and the proportion of fossil fuels in the energy mix. Based on these findings, the Czech Republic has, assuming the commitments from the Europe 2020 Strategy are adhered to, good prerequisites for the ETR implementation. Some positive effects would be more visible should the Czech environmental tax reform not be accepted in such a narrow sense. Foreign studies indicate that as long as a part of the revenues is designed for eco-innovations and the support of clean technology branches, an additional advantage should result in the form of employment growth, as well as GDP growth.","JE Purkyne Univ Usti nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Fuchsová, E (通讯作者)，JE Purkyne Univ Usti nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",eva.fuchsova@seznam.cz,"Fuchsová, Eva/JCF-2229-2023","Fuchsová, Eva/0000-0002-3501-6630",,,,,16,2,2,1,17,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This was rarely necessary in the previous non-integrated system and users reacted with unexpected displeasure when it started even though fare integration in the new system means that transferring involved no extra costs. This study investigates users' subjective valuations of the transfer experience and its associated elements (walking and waiting times), analysing how these vary for different types of transfer combinations. In particular, we determine the relative preferences the following transfer combinations: metro-metro, metro-bus, bus-metro and bus-bus, with emphasis on the importance of various physical characteristics such as information availability, the existence of station escalators and the ability to board the first available bus or train. We also estimate the relative valuation of the different time component values (walking, waiting and in-vehicle) of trips including a transfer, and also derived the penalties users assign to trips that require transferring at intermodal stations during the morning peak hour. The trip time components most heavily penalised were the walking time involved in transferring and the final walking time to the user's destination. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the following article there is analyzed the significance of institutional factors for the implementation of gender equality in the labour market in Lithuania. The aim is to analyze the residents' approach towards the significance of institutional factors for the implementation of gender equality in the labour market in Lithuania after having reviewed implementation regulations of gender equality policy. Objectives are to review the institutional machinery for the implementation of gender equality policy, find out the residents' approach towards the ability of authorities to form and implement the underlying fields of activities and analyze women's and men's approach towards the significance of institutional factors in the implementation of gender equality in the labour market. The analysis of literature presents that implementation success of gender equality policy has to be secured by relevantly operating institutions, their clear structure, distribution of competences and functions, and close cooperation between different structures. The outcomes of the questionnaire survey enable to argue that women's and men's state in the labour market a lot depends on the decisions taken by the authorities, their executed policy and ability to distinguish underlying activity fields. It is also necessary to highlight that there are more women than men stating that decisions of administrative institutions do not secure equal rights for men and women in the labour market in Lithuania, and they say that institutional factors are significant or very significant.","[Kiausiene, I.; Streimikiene, D.] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Kiausiene, I (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ilona.kiausiene@khf.vu.lt; dalia@mail.lei.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912;",,,,,13,7,7,0,14,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

These concerns ended up in the research's main focus and got materialized throughout the following purposes: (i) to explore the relationship between senior managers' characteristics within SME, and firms' propensity to develop quality improvement programs' implementation; (ii) to compare leadership related initiatives in small firms to those from medium-sized ones. Attending to these purposes and other arguments and concerns highlighted throughout research focusing on both SME and quality management literature, the following hypotheses were formulated: (i) Senior managers with specific training in quality management themes play a role more preponderant in planning and performing quality improvement programs; (ii) Among SME, firms' dimension influences leadership related initiatives. For this purpose, a questionnaire based, on previous case studies and a deep literature review focused on quality management and SME management was mailed to 600 Portuguese SME randomly selected from the pan-European AMADEUS database. From the sample, around 16 % of questionnaires were completed and returned. Results suggest that if some specific characteristics, like senior manager's nature, time running the business, or his participation or not in SME creation, doesn't seem to influence firms' propensity to quality improvement; some other characteristics may play a significant role. For example, factors like age or specific training on quality management may determine, or at least influence, somehow, senior manager's attitude and commitment towards quality improvement. Furthermore, attending to SME hierarchical structure characteristics, leadership issues assume high importance in quality improvement practices in such organizations. Moreover, results suggest that current leadership initiatives assume a higher preponderance in smaller firms.","Beira Interior Univ, Fac Social & Human Sci, Business & Econ Dept, Covilha, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior,"Mendes, LAF (通讯作者)，Beira Interior Univ, Fac Social & Human Sci, Business & Econ Dept, Covilha, Portugal.",lmendes@ubi.pt,"Mendes, Luis/J-1722-2012","Mendes, Luis/0000-0002-0921-4078",,,,,21,5,6,0,20,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However, the elements of market driving, its antecedents and outcomes, have so far not been empirically measured. The primary objectives of this study are to identify factors that describe market driving, develop a conceptual model, and then consider influencing factors and performance indicators drawn from the entrepreneurship and marketing literature. The model has been empirically tested using a sample of managers in the South African healthcare industry. A fully structured questionnaire was used to address the objective of this study. The realised sample of n=328 was used to analyse the conceptual model applying a partial least squares path modelling approach (PLS-PM). The results revealed that market driving is a firm behaviour and is distinguished by three distinct concepts: market sensing, influencing customer preferences and alliance formation. Three out of four antecedents: strategic orientation, entrepreneurial capital and entrepreneurial behaviour, influenced market driving ability positively. The study also demonstrated that market driving behaviour positively influences firm performance and relative competitive strength.","[van Vuuren, Jurie; Woergoetter, Nadin] Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"van Vuuren, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"Van Vuuren, Juri/0000-0001-7338-1068",,,,,117,14,15,2,40,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The applied approach develops the concept of the quality of life including the identification of system links to regional competitiveness and sustainability of development. In this context, the assessment of the business component of the regional environment that has been already carried out was supplemented with the assessment of the social component, when the regions were divided into progressive, standard and regressive. In both cases, it has been proved (in correspondence with core-periphery theories) that there is a tendency towards a decrease in the environment quality in the direction to regional borders. Subsequently, we evaluated the balance of the classification of regions (districts) within the individual components and based on this, the districts of municipalities with extended powers were divided into three types: business-oriented (type A), complex (B) and socially oriented (C). The proportion of the balanced type B is slightly lower than that of the two remaining unbalanced types. Naturally, the results of NUTS 3 evaluation correspond with this. A similar result was obtained in the case of the evaluation of regional harmony, which is understood as a qualitatively higher level of balance meeting socially desirable development standards. In correspondence, its level is defined by the proportion of type B regions (excluding the regions with business as well as social environment quality below average and also regions that are environmentally devastated) and type A regions (excluding the regions with social environment quality below average). The results show that from the perspective of the distribution of inhabitants, relatively harmonic relationship prevails, while from the purely territorial perspective, the prevailing relationship is disharmonic. The obtained knowledge corresponds with the hypothesis about a positive effect of the regional harmony of the business and social environments on the long-term sustainability of development (a bad quality of social environment significantly reduces not only residential but also investment attractiveness of regions).","[Viturka, Milan; Tonev, Petr; Zitek, Vladimir] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic; [Wokoun, Rene; Krejcova, Nikola] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Reg & Local Dev, Labem, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Viturka, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",viturka@econ.muni.cz; rene.wokoun@ujep.cz; nikola.krejcova@ujep.cz; tonev@econ.muni.cz; zitek@econ.muni.cz,"TONEV, Petr/D-2613-2013; Zitek, Vladimir/I-5431-2015","TONEV, Petr/0000-0002-9327-5593; Zitek, Vladimir/0000-0003-4724-2210",,,,,28,18,18,0,34,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However, if the window choice between post-break or full sample is based on mean square forecast error ratios, it is difficult to understand why such a problem arises since break detectability and these ratios seem to have the same determinants. This paper analyses this issue first for the expected values in conditional models and then by Monte Carlo simulations for more general cases. Results show similar behaviour between rejection frequencies and the ratios but only for break tests that do not take into account forecasting error covariances, as is the case with mean square forecast error measures. Moreover, the asymmetric shape of the frequency distribution of the ratios could help us to better grasp empirical problems. An illustration using actual data is given.

India refused to join, which enabled its own firms to become significant international players in several fields, especially generic drugs. The contrast with the foreign-owned Irish pharmaceutical industry, facing decline as its patents expire, is stark. The government's adoption of a simplistic linear model of innovation, in which public money put into university research was supposed to result in valuable patents, high-tech firms and jobs, has also been a grave disappointment. Ground could be made up by adopting direct protection of innovation (DPI). The theory for this was developed in EU-commissioned research, now proved by empirical results. This paper discusses practical arrangements for DPI in Ireland, as well as a proposal for enabling Irish firms engage in effective litigation to protect their patents in the United States.","Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Kingston, W (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",wkingston@tcd.ie,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,19,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

There are two opposing effects. In line with popular expectations, the change to equal sharing discourages some wealthy individuals from marrying since they risk losing half of their assets in the event of divorce. Offsetting this, equal sharing property division induces efficient investment in marriage, increasing the value of marriage relative to cohabitation for some couples. Overall, the impact on the number of marriages relative to cohabitations is ambiguous, although there will be more marriages where it is more difficult to invest, and where couples are more similar to each other.","Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Fisher, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England.",hcf26@cam.ac.uk,,"Fisher, Hayley/0000-0002-0420-4209",,,,,44,2,2,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The shortcoming of these approaches is that they only provide a global score of efficiency without providing information about the efficiency of specific inputs. To overcome this limitation, this paper analyses the efficiency of Spanish ports using a non-radial DEA model. In this way, a global efficiency score is obtained, as well as an index for each type of port traffic (liquid bulk, solid bulk, general commodities, and containers). Globally, it is shown that Spanish ports are highly efficient and that most ports are specialized in container traffic. This paper has enabled the identification of inefficient ports, as well as the identification of those inputs most likely to increase port turnover.","[Medal-Bartual, Amparo] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Business Finance, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Molinos-Senante, Maria] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Econ 2, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Sala-Garrido, Ramon] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Math Econ & Business, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Medal-Bartual, A (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Business Finance, Campus Dels Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain.",Amparo.Medal@uv.es; Maria.Molinos@uv.es; Ramon.Sala@uv.es,"Molinos-Senante, Maria/IVH-9831-2023; Sala-Garrido, Ramon/K-3164-2014; Molinos-Senante, Maria/A-8523-2016; Medal-Bartual, Amparo/M-2969-2018","Sala-Garrido, Ramon/0000-0002-4693-3944; Molinos-Senante, Maria/0000-0002-6689-6861; Medal-Bartual, Amparo/0000-0002-3466-2753",,,,,35,8,8,1,27,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Extensive discussion around the theme of 'dynamic capabilities' highlights the fact that organization-level learning processes are central to this. The ability to deliver a continuing stream of innovations to the market place, or to introduce a regular flow of process improvements depends on sustained search and experiment but also on the ability to extract and embed key behavioural routines which support innovation. This highlights a central issue for 'policy agents' of various kinds-regional and national government, trade and sector associations, large supply chain 'owners', etc.-who share a concern with enabling higher levels of innovation performance across their constituencies. What might be done to help firms generate and launch new products and services which drive growth and bring in new or improved processes which enhance productivity? The nature of the challenge is not (simply) the promotion of entrepreneurial behaviour to exploit a particular new market opportunity or the adoption of a single key new technology. Rather it is to facilitate the development of capabilities within target organizations to manage the process of innovation for themselves. This article focuses on one policy option-the mobilization of shared learning among formally configured groups of organizations in peer-to-peer learning networks. These form an increasingly important channel within innovation support policy and in the article, we explore the underlying rationale for such modes of intervention and try to identify some of the dynamics of successful and less successful learning networks.","[Bessant, John; Alexander, Allen] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England; [Tsekouras, George; Rush, Howard] Univ Brighton, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England; [Lamming, Richard] Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Exeter; University of Brighton; University of Manchester,"Bessant, J (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England.",j.bessant@exeter.ac.uk,,,,,,,99,43,48,2,149,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Recent research has quantified the relative contribution from underlying factors like value density of products, transport intensity and carbon intensity of fuel. In this work we rely on the theory of economic growth cycles in order to explain the dynamic behavior of some of these indicators. Focusing on the current growth cycle, we analyze Swedish data in a Shapley decomposition model, and the behaviors of the underlying factors are confronted against the growth cycle theory and recent findings in micro logistics. Our results suggests that the different and changing relations between growth and emission over the growth cycle indicate that the observed development in emissions is far from linear and cannot be explained straightforwardly by economic growth. The impact of the respective factor, and the relation between them, changes over time and results in different degrees of decoupling. The general trend is that micro-oriented factors tend to be more important in the rationalization period while macro-oriented factors have a stronger impact during the transformation period. We suggest that our approach might be useful not only for analyzing historical data, but also for medium-term and long-term scenarios for freight transport development and CO2- emissions.

In this article, we develop such a measure, focusing specifically on financial knowledge. Using item response theory (IRT), we analyze items from three national surveys, resulting in a psychometrically sound 20-item financial knowledge scale. By using IRT, the current analysis uses individuals' answers to inform which questions to include in the scale in the first place, rather than simply confirming relationships between these answers and other financially relevant outcomes post hoc. Widespread use of this index and the continued use of modern psychometric techniques would allow for the comparison of financial knowledge, measured consistently and reliably, across studies, populations, and programs.",,,,melissa.knoll@ssa.gov; crhouts.vpgcontractor@vpgcentral.com,,"Houts, Carrie/0000-0003-1233-9389",,,,,40,101,144,4,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

It focuses primarily but not exclusively on what can be learnt from the early adopters of policies inspired by BE, notably America and Britain. BE is defined by its inductive scientific approach to economics, which can produce empirical demonstrations that are persuasive to policymakers facing practical problems. The analysis identifies three routes via which BE has influenced policy: (1) the theory of libertarian paternalism (nudges), (2) the provision of toolkits for policymakers seeking behavioural change, and (3) the expansion of the skill-set of applied economists (and scientists in related disciplines). The effectiveness of each route is assessed, in terms of the likelihood of successfully integrating scientific advances with policy development. The analysis concludes that (3) is the only route that can adapt to the ongoing and rapid evolution of what is a young science. Successful policy development is more likely where there is expert input and the capacity to engage in applied experimentation, piloting and evaluation. The implication is that countries, including Ireland, are more likely to reap the benefits of BE if they create an active and effective interface between applied economists and policymakers.","[Lunn, Peter D.] ESRI, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Lunn, Peter D.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Lunn, PD (通讯作者)，ESRI, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland.",pete.lunn@esri.ie,,"Lunn, Peter/0000-0002-7174-5320",,,,,63,18,18,0,32,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

In this paper we try to answer this question in the context of a two-country model developed for the Canadian and US economies. We compare the forecasting performance of the exactly identified cointegrated VECMs to the performance of the over-identified VECMs with the long-run theory restrictions imposed. We allow for model uncertainty and conduct this comparison for every possible combination of the cointegration ranks of the Canadian and US models. We show that the over-identified structural cointegrated models generally outperform the exactly identified models in forecasting Canadian macroeconomic variables. We also show that the pooled forecasts generated from the over-identified models beat most of the individual exactly identified and over-identified models as well as the VARs in levels and in differences.

This article shows that Islamic courts of the Ottoman Empire exhibited biases that would have limited the expansion of trade in the eastern Mediterranean, particularly that between Muslims and non-Muslims. It thus explains why economic modernization in the Middle East involved the establishment of secular courts. In quantifying Ottoman judicial biases, the article discredits both the claim that these courts treated Christians and Jews fairly and the counterclaim that non-Muslims lost cases disproportionately. Biases against non-Muslims were in fact institutionalized. By the same token, non-Muslims did relatively well in adjudicated interfaith disputes, because they settled most conflicts out of court in anticipation of judicial biases. Islamic courts also appear to have favored state officials. The article undermines the Islamist claim that reinstituting Islamic law (sharia) would be economically beneficial.","[Kuran, Timur; Lustig, Scott] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Kuran, T (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,,59,24,27,1,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The theoretical basis of the analysis is EMMNE decisions to operate in advanced nations to exploit and augment ownership-specific advantages. Two Indian pharmaceuticals, Ranbaxy and Dr Reddy's, are used as evidence to support arguments in the literature. Indian pharmaceutical companies originated as generic manufacturers but succeed in European markets by simultaneously pursuing multiple foreign operations motivated by asset augmenting and asset exploiting goals. Dr Reddy's and Ranbaxy use a repetitious cycle of earning (e.g. asset exploitation through generic sales) and learning (e.g. asset augmentation through acquisition of product pipelines, technology) to achieve market growth. That is, past European operations support present entries into new markets, which facilitate future entry strategies across the value-chain (e.g. upstream into R&D). This article contributes to our understanding of interdependencies among firms, markets and institutions and our knowledge of EMMNEs and FDI.","[Kedron, Peter; Bagchi-Sen, Sharmistha] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geog, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Kedron, P (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geog, 105 Wilkeson Quad, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",pjkedron@gmail.com,,"Kedron, Peter/0000-0002-1093-3416",,,,,91,18,19,1,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

These include strategic decisions (vehicle selection and maintenance), tactical decisions (route selection and vehicle load), and operational decisions (driver behavior). The results indicate that vehicle selection has by far the most dominant effect: The best vehicle currently available for sale in the U.S. is nine times more fuel efficient than the worst vehicle. Nevertheless, the remaining factors that a driver has control over can contribute, in total, to about a 45% reduction in the on-road fuel economy per driver-a magnitude well worth emphasizing. Furthermore, increased efforts should also be directed at increasing vehicle occupancy, which has dropped by 30% from 1960. That drop, by itself, increased the energy intensity of driving per occupant by about 30%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, this pressure can be as great as that in contestable elections. We test these arguments by comparing decisions across systems with retention, partisan, and nonpartisan contestable elections. Employing models that account for judge- and state-specific effects, we analyze new data regarding abortion cases decided by state supreme courts between 1980 and 2006.

In particular, the paper focuses on how the organizational system influences process maturity profile of the Romanian companies. Data were collected in face-to-face structured-questionnaire interviews from 1302 public and private organizations from Romania. The dearth of empirical research examining organization process maturity in emerging countries constitutes a critical gap in the business process management literature that needs much more attention from scholars. For the purpose of this paper, a factor analysis was employed to explain the pattern of correlations within a set of observed variables that determine the process maturity profile of the Romanian companies. The research results show that there are strong positive correlations between the variables examined that account for a higher level of maturity and performance of organization's processes.","[Paunescu, Carmen; Acatrinei (Pantea), Carmen] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest 010701, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paunescu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 2-2A Calea Grivitei St, Bucharest 010701, Romania.",carmen.paunescu@fabiz.ase.ro; acatrinei.carmen@gmail.com,"ACATRINEI, Carmen/C-5578-2012; Paunescu, Carmen/ABD-1883-2020","ACATRINEI, Carmen/0000-0001-7611-7836;",,,,,60,10,11,0,40,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Meanwhile, the satisfactory resolution of customer complaints has been a challenging task for many service organizations. Empowering customers in service recovery provides a solution for this challenge. However, the studies on customer empowerment (CE) have taken very narrow perspectives of CE and therefore, none of them individually can explain the nature of CE in service recovery situations among various services that represent the services industry. Based upon the review of the previous research, this article proposes a more integrative theoretical framework in an attempt to better describe and explain the customers' view of CE in the management of service recovery encounters. According to the proposed model, the degree of complainant-perceived empowerment during service recovery determines both the level of complainant's affective/cognitive responses and the level of subsequent complaint satisfaction. Implications are provided and discussed from both practical and theoretical perspectives.","[Pranic, Ljudevit] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split 21000, Croatia; [Roehl, Wesley S.] Temple Univ, Sch Tourism & Hosp Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University of Split; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Pranic, L (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Matice Hrvatske 31, Split 21000, Croatia.",ljudevit.pranic@efst.hr; wroehl@temple.edu,"Pranić, Ljudevit/D-4776-2017","Pranić, Ljudevit/0000-0001-7173-0076",,,,,91,16,21,4,39,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The effectiveness and acceptability of different charging regimes, as well as behavioural responses such as changes in departure time, car use, mode, residential, and work location, are synthesised, and used to provide insights to enrich our understanding of the potential role that specific congestion pricing schemes might play in influencing behavioural change. Reviewed evidence from the monitoring of the behavioural responses associated with actual congestion charging schemes, such as reduction in car trips, shift in departure times and switch to public transport, shows that the evidence from stated preference studies aligns well with the real market evidence. We also provide recommendations on the design of future stated preference studies, emphasising the need to include a systematic treatment of all key themes identified in this paper.

A FT product is essentially a bundle of a base product and a donation to the supplier (e.g., a coffee farmer). An altruistic rational consumer will only choose this bundle if doing so is less expensive than buying the base product and making a direct donation. For FT to be sustainable either in a competitive equilibrium or in a monopolistic environment this bundling must yield an efficiency. This efficiency is generated in the following context. A suppliers investment reduces the retailers cost or boosts the final products quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the suppliers incentive compatibility constraint. We assess our model in the context of the coffee industry.","[Reinstein, David] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Song, Joon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",University of Essex; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Reinstein, D (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",drein@essex.ac.uk; joonsong.econ@gmail.com,"Reinstein, David/AAD-2454-2020","Reinstein, David/0000-0002-0470-4991",,,,,42,18,22,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Despite the progressive participation of women in informal investment, little is known about the characteristics of female informal investors, especially in developing countries. This study examines the gender differences of a sample of 613 informal investors in Chile. To this end we used the database from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Chile 2007-2008 and applied tests of differences in proportions and means for independent samples. The results show that there are significant gender differences in some socio-demographic variables, like education and work status, and also in the perception of good opportunities and the fear to failure. Additionally, women invest smaller amounts and expect lower returns than men do. Finally, women invest more than men in close family.

Therefore the purpose of this paper is to analyse selected assessment model of intellectual capital from the perspective of time orientation, system dynamics, and causal direction.","[Glova, Jozef; Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosiciach, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Glova, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Kosice, Slovakia.",jozef.glova@tuke.sk; beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Glova, Jozef/Z-2482-2019","Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Glova, Jozef/0000-0001-5972-7771",,,,,5,2,2,0,3,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-171-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,73,78,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393447700011,0

After each scandal there was the question: Where were the Auditors? So the legislator has to react. The United States of America responded to this discussion with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act [2], while the European Union decreed the directive 2006/43/EC. The mentioned directive updated the statutory provisions for the professional guild of auditors to increase the quality of audits. In detail it demanded an external quality-control-system combined with public supervision for the profession of auditors to ensure a better quality. Due to this fact the audit companies now have to fulfil a large range of requirements to provide evidence of their auditing-quality and furthermore of the quality standards within their company. Since many small and medium-sized companies aren't able to fulfil these new requirements, the number of small and medium-sized audit companies decreases noticeably. In my paper I will present the results of my research concerning the effects of external quality control - given by law - on the auditor market in Latvia, Germany and Austria focussing on small and medium-sized audit companies. Additionally I will examine, if the external quality control, which was one of the justifications of the conversions of the EU-directive 2006/43/EC, is able to increase the quality in audit companies at all or whether it is an overregulation for the profession, with disproportionate burden for small and medium-sized audit companies.","[Hahne, Gabriele] Hahne Revis & Treuhandgesell mbH, D-48249 Dulmen, Germany",,,ghahne@wp-hahne.de,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,251,258,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100024,0

By now scholars agree that effective organizations do not have the luxury to choose between intuitive and rational decision making. Instead, they try to understand how different factors like personality and problem characteristics influence the decision making process. Reviewing the literature reveals that, the personality predetermination and the structure of problems (e.g. well-structured problems versus ill-structured problems) seems to have a significant impact on the decision making efficiency. Further, the review reveals that there is a lack of application oriented empirical studies in this area of research. Therefore the aim of this research paper is, to propose a framework for an empirical study on how personality and problem characteristics influence the decision making process. First, hypotheses are derived from the literature on how personality predetermination and behavioral approaches in the decision making process lead to higher social-economical efficiency within certain problem categories.

First, governmental intervention is indispensable to support industrial development and technological capability upgrading, even though the extent and manner of the intervention may differ depending on the context that any individual developing country faces. Second, design principles of policy cases should be identified in order to extract replicable lessons from the successful cases within the Korean experience. Third, the identified design principles are (i) a coherent policy framework, (ii) the co-evolution of policy structure, (iii) strong public-private partnership, and (iv) adequate implementation capability. Fourth, industrial and technology policy cases based on the Korean experience illustrate the appropriateness of the above design principles. Fifth, in order for other developing countries to adopt the design principles revealed by the Korean cases, it asserts success on a small scale, such as in one specific sector, before such practices are diffused into other sectors to support the formation of higher level policy.","[Baek, Chulwoo] Sunmoon Univ, Div Int Econ & Trade, Chungnam, South Korea; [Lee, Jeong-Dong] Seoul Natl Univ, Technoecon Management & Policy Programme, Seoul, South Korea",Sun Moon University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Baek, C (通讯作者)，Sunmoon Univ, Div Int Econ & Trade, Chungnam, South Korea.",yorke@sunmoon.ac.kr,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

In this paper we address the question of non-linearity in the distribution of a scorecard's inferred log-odds to score relationship. Linear scorecards are excellent and robust ranking tools, but the inferred default probabilities are increasingly used in day-to-day business operations - within account-level strategies, for cutoff setting, and for capital allocation. All of these uses are dependent upon the accurate estimation of the probability of default, which is a quality independent of a model's ranking performance. In this paper we illustrate this phenomenon of a misaligned log-odds relationship within a model built using a method which is standard in retail banking. The sequential elimination of correlated variable bins results in an improved estimation, at the cost of the model's ranking performance. A post-hoc quadratic transformation of the scores improves the model fit without affecting the ranking performance, but may prove difficult to apply in current operational systems.

In contrast to theoretical preoccupations that underlie the study of knowledge accumulation, a focus on the importance of strategic unknowns resists the tendency to value knowledge over ignorance or to assume that the procurement of more knowledge is linked in an automatic or a linear fashion to the attainment of more social or political power. Refining and challenging the assumption that modern liberal societies inevitably thrive on the accumulation of information about the public personas, private psyches, consumer habits or political proclivities of citizens, the papers in the special issue explore how the cultivation of strategic unknowns remains a resource - perhaps the greatest resource - for those in a position of power and those subject to it.","Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"McGoey, L (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",lmcgoey@essex.ac.uk,,"McGoey, Linsey/0000-0002-4404-2574",,,,,47,264,291,1,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We then seek to empirically verify the soundness of the proposed integral typology by surveying a large sample of Slovenian manufacturing companies. Maximum likelihood probit estimation, exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis and binary logistic modeling are used in the empirical analysis. Our main conclusions are twofold: (1) The integral approach to corporate environmentalism works: in the framework of a small open transitional economy, the model differentiates well among different groups of companies. (2) There are no radical innovators among Slovenian companies, and less than one third of the companies are actively thinking and acting in line of environment-friendly processes and products.

The main reason leading to this statement is the fact that satisfaction has a significant impact on the financial results of a company. Satisfied customers realize repeated purchase, they are more loyal, less sensitive to price increase and furthermore they spread the positive experience through word-of-mouth. This paper presents findings of the research focused on customer satisfaction in tourism, particularly satisfaction with the services provided by travel agencies. Customer satisfaction was measured both as a uni-dimensional (i.e. total satisfaction) and multidimensional concept (i.e. satisfaction with individual satisfaction attributes). Focus-groups were used in an exploratory research to generate variables of customer satisfaction. In total, 39 variables were generated and were grouped into following dimensions: travel agencies' offer, knowledge and information of travel agencies, transportation, personnel, communication and marketing activities. The data was collected by the method of personnel interview with a standardized questionnaire. The analysis of customer satisfaction indicated relatively good total satisfaction and showed that all given dimensions contributed to customer satisfaction with approximately same power. Therefore it was essential to apply the factor analysis to identify the main factors of customer satisfaction because these are as well the indicators of what a customer expects. Five main factors - personnel, transportation, price, information and communication were identified as the main factors influencing customer satisfaction in tourism. At the same time the analysis discovered somewhat different content and meaning of some factors than they are traditionally considered to have.","[Pulpanova, Lenka; Simova, Jozefina] Tech Univ Liberci, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Mkt, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Pulpánová, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Mkt, Liberec, Czech Republic.",lenka.pulpanova@tul.cz; jozefina.simova@tul.cz,,,,,,,10,14,14,3,41,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Also public and non-governmental organizations and scientific research institutes have paid great attention to the studies of this form of democracy. Less applied in studying the participation process is the self-assessment procedure. The purpose of the paper is to introduce a participation self-assessment tool that has been developed through international collaboration, the CLEAR tool, by adapting and modifying it to study the particular situations in local governments. Applying this methodology allows us to diagnose participation in the particular municipality. It reveals and describes the overall picture of participation, identifies problems in several research directions and enables the municipality to develop solutions to improve local democracy.","[Seimuskane, Lilita] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Publ Adm, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,lilitase@inbox.lv,,"Seimuskane, Lilita/0000-0001-9377-3245",,,,,9,0,0,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,624,632,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100056,0

However, real life credit client data or other client data sets contain very large numbers of cases (clients) and they can be really huge after data fusion from different sources. Besides posing severe computational barriers for SVM and other related methods, especially if all pairwise data point similarities explicitly requested. Therefore procedures which compress extensive training data are in demand for practical applications but they may also be of interest in order to gain more insight into the nature of these high dimensional data. A candidate solution to a suitable compression of training data is to combine clustering as a preprocessing step with classification model building. We report on using some computationally very efficient clustering methods, leading to different cluster encodings which in conjunction with suitable data encodings lead also to competitive and robust and sometimes slightly superior final classification model performance when compared to models which are trained on the full data sets.","[Stecking, Ralf] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany; [Schebesch, Klaus Bruno] Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Arad, Romania",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad,,ralf.w.stecking@uni-oldenburg.de; kbschebesch@uvvg.ro,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,6,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",,,978-606-19-0104-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,202,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEN34,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317437100040,0

In contrast to the prevalent view that involvement in organizational practices almost automatically makes models performative, this paper argues that institutional design might obstruct potential model performativity. This crucial issue determines whether models are strongly or only 'generically' or 'effectively' performative. The empirical study of the usage of the discounted cash flow (DCF) model presented in this paper offers an example of an application practice that significantly limits the model's performative power.","Karlshsch Int Univ, Chair Int Business & Finance, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany",,"Svetlova, E (通讯作者)，Karlshsch Int Univ, Chair Int Business & Finance, Karlstr 36-38, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany.",esvetlova@karlshochschule.de,"Svetlova, Ekaterina/KCY-5126-2024","Svetlova, Ekaterina/0000-0002-8400-3465",,,,,26,58,62,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

In addition, these firms developed commercial products and services, are aware of intellectual property protection, are motivated to create spin-offs in order to apply knowledge to practical applications and utilize market opportunities. However, the firms also face challenges, such as difficulties in accurately estimating the market demand for their products, and technical problems in the development and production of their products.

A number of sources of systematic variation are identified which have a statistically significant impact on BRT patronage in terms of daily passenger numbers such as fare, frequency, connectivity, pre-board fare collection, and location of with-flow bus lanes and doorways of a bus. In addition to the patronage model, a bus frequency model is estimated to identify the context within which higher levels of service frequency are delivered, notably where there exists higher population density, more trunk lines, the corridor provides bus priority facilities such as priority lanes for many bus routes, and where there is the presence of overtaking lanes at more than half of all stations along the heaviest section of the corridor. The findings offer important insights into features of BRT systems that are positive contributors to growing patronage which should be taken into account in designing and planning BRT systems.

We explore the inefficiencies that arise and how they depend on the ability to refine rules, the principal's time horizon and patience, and other factors. Our model exhibits path dependence in that the efficacy of rule development depends on the sequence of realizations of the state.

Lessons from the Evolution of Mortgage Law,JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FORECLOSURE; ENFORCEMENT; RESTRICTIONS; REDEMPTION; FINANCE; DEBT,"This paper traces the history of mortgage law in the United States. I explore the history of foreclosure procedures, redemption periods, restrictions on deficiency judgments, and foreclosure moratoria. The historical record shows that the most enduring aspects of mortgage law stem from case law rather than statute. In particular, the ability of creditors to foreclose nonjudicially is determined very early in states' histories, usually before the Civil War, and usually in case law. In contrast, the aspects of mortgage law developed through statute change more frequently. This finding calls into question whether common law is inherently more flexible than the civil-law system used in some other countries. However, case law tends to be less responsive to populist pressures than statutes. My findings suggest that the reason common law favors financial development is unlikely to be its greater flexibility relative to law made by statute.","Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ghent, A (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,,,Research Institute for Housing America (RIHA),Research Institute for Housing America (RIHA),"I am grateful to the Research Institute for Housing America (RIHA) for funding.

Broome claims that rationality amounts to satisfying rational requirements as opposed to responding correctly to reasons. My critique focuses on two issues. First, I try to show that Broome's account of rational requirements, in particular his answer to the so-called 'symmetry-problem', presupposes that responding correctly to reasons is part of rationality. Secondly, in discussing Broome's account of reasoning I criticize his claim that first-order reasoning involves no appeal to reasons and, hence, no normative thoughts on behalf of the reasoner.","Univ Vienna, Dept Philosophy, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Pauer-Studer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Philosophy, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",,,,,,,,19,3,3,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

The case of Lyon,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Road pricing; Urban transport policy; Willingness to pay; Focus group; Citizens' opinions; Travel behaviour,SOCIAL-DESIRABILITY BIAS; VALIDITY; IMPACTS,"Following Singapore (1975), some metropolitan areas introduced pricing schemes to make car users aware of the real costs of their trip. This research looks at citizens' reactions to the hypothetical introduction of a road pricing scheme in Lyon (France). People's perceptions were investigated through a sample of 61 persons selected according to a stratified sampling plan. A web-questionnaire was administered to the participants, and eight focus groups were then organised, each including about 7-8 persons. The focus groups allowed us to investigate the participants' opinions, emotions, and reactions to the hypothetical introduction of different road pricing schemes in the urban area. This research has largely confirmed what found in previous studies and its key additional contribution is the clustering of citizens according to their reactions. Different groups of people showed dissimilar attitudes and opinions about the effect of road pricing, but the whole sample agreed upon the need for a coherent policy both for transport planning and management in the Lyon metropolitan area, while respecting freedom of mobility. In fact, citizens expect that a reduction of their freedom to move by car should be compensated with a strong and clear policy to improve the alternative modes and want to know clearly how revenues will be spent. A clear communication policy should be defined and this should be tailored according to the different groups defined in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many discussions of intertemporal issues have been marred by serious analytical errors, particularly in applying standard approaches to discounting; the errors arise, in part, from paying insufficient attention to the magnitude of potential damages, and in part from overlooking problems with market information. Some of the philosophical concepts and principles of Paper 1 are applied to the analytics and ethics of pure-time discounting and infinite-horizonmodels, providing helpful insights into orderings of welfare streams and obligations towards future generations. Such principles give little support for the idea of discrimination by date of birth. Intratemporal issues are central to problematic and slow-moving international discussions and are the second focus of this paper. A way forward is to cast the policy issues and analyses in a way that keeps equity issues central and embeds them in the challenge of fostering the dynamic transition to the low-carbon economy in both developed and developing countries. This avoids the trap of seeing issues primarily in terms of burden-sharing and zero-sum games - that leads to inaction and the most inequitable outcome of all.","London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Stern, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",n.stern@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,93,38,39,1,36,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Decisions relating to these products can be improved by the availability of reliable pre-launch forecasts of their adoption time series. However, producing such forecasts is a difficult, complex and challenging task, mainly because of the non-availability of past time series data relating to the product, and the multiple factors that can affect adoptions, such as customer heterogeneity, macroeconomic conditions following the product launch, and technological developments which may lead to the product's premature obsolescence. This paper provides a critical review of the literature to examine what it can tell us about the relative effectiveness of three fundamental approaches to filling the data void : (i) management judgment, (ii) the analysis of judgments by potential customers, and (iii) formal models of the diffusion process. It then shows that the task of producing pre-launch time series forecasts of adoption levels involves a set of sub-tasks, which all involve either quantitative estimation or choice, and argues that the different natures of these tasks mean that the forecasts are unlikely to be accurate if a single method is employed. Nevertheless, formal models should be at the core of the forecasting process, rather than unstructured judgment. Gaps in the literature are identified, and the paper concludes by suggesting a research agenda so as to indicate where future research efforts might be employed most profitably.

We focus on the case of Quantity Forcing contracts, with a theoretical model that accommodates changes to the contracts' clauses or environments in a two period game, since contracts often include clauses that determine obligations for airlines and airports to be accomplished in more than a single period. We find that contracts by which airlines commit to carry to the airport the quantity that maximizes joint profits and airports commit to advertise the airlines and to rebate charges are not sustainable. The relationship holds for both the finite periods and a two period game, a situation similar to a Prisoner's Dilemma. Nevertheless, when there is uncertainty from demand fluctuations the Nash equilibrium of the game depends on the magnitude of the expected fall on demand and on the probability of the state of nature.

This study advances a model for better understanding adherence behaviors by incorporating the positive emotion of hope and consumer perceptions of control. Empirical testing of the model in the context of type 2 diabetes, a lifestyle-changing chronic illness, shows that hope generates more patient adherence. Furthermore, individuals have higher hope when they believe they are capable of performing the actions their treatment requires, and/or that their health outcomes are under their physician's control. The results indicate that health care providers can play an important role in encouraging adherence behaviors by cultivating hope and customizing their interactions with patients. Interventions aimed at increasing patient self-efficacy or promoting patients' beliefs that health outcomes are under their physician's control are two routes to building hope. Health initiatives aimed at increasing diabetes treatment adherence should consider alternatives beyond asking patients to take control of their diabetes.","[Makarem, Suzanne C.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Smith, Michael F.; Mudambi, Susan M.; Hunt, James M.] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Makarem, SC (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",scmakarem@vcu.edu; msmith@temple.edu; susan.mudambi@temple.edu; jmhunt@temple.edu,"Makarem, Suzanne C./AAG-2685-2020","Makarem, Suzanne C./0000-0001-9874-9789",,,,,71,9,14,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The reference class forecasting was introduced to counter this bias. However, the precise workings or cost over-run determinants are however still under-researched. We selected the case of the National Highway Construction Program in Slovenia and projects, completed between 1995 and 2007. The purpose was to determine the precise cost performance through time and analyze the cost estimating mechanism to see whether and how it influences the cost performance. The details of the cost estimating practice have been studied and compared with the existing practice in the USA and elsewhere. A representative sample of 36 projects could be constructed, valued at USD 2.7 billion (2006 prices) with a total length of some 235 km. Almost half of the cost performance variance could be explained by the cost estimation mechanism (cost-based estimation with historic bid database). In different variants, this approach appears to be dominant in the most developed countries of the World due to its relative simplicity. We find, that due to the behavior of bidders in the tendering process, the same mechanism also implies that some systematic cost over-run will likely occur, even if no other causes were present. This adds a new perspective to the suggestions of Flyvbjerg and others, who suggested that the dominant (but not exclusive) cause for the persistence of systematic cost is strategic misinterpretation. The findings suggest that project sponsors should perform a supporting analysis on how price changes on the construction market feed in to the cost performance to further support the reference class forecasting approach. The findings also suggests, that in case of strong cost performance shifts, longer periods need to be included in the analysis, before one can conclude, that the improvement or worsening is not temporary and is not the inherent result of the cost estimating mechanism.

Even when there is no retailer free riding, manufacturers cannot rely entirely on retailer competition to supply desired point-of-sale retailing services because retailer promotion has little or no inter-retailer demand effects. Consequently, manufacturers must compensate retailers for devoting their valuable retail assets to the sale of a manufacturer's products, and resale price maintenance often is an efficient way to accomplish this.

Out-of-sample forecasts for 1, 6 and 12 months are generated from each of a dynamic Nelson-Siegel model, autoregressive models for both yields and the principal components extracted from those yields, a slope regression and a random walk model. At short forecasting horizons, there is little difference in the performance of the models both prior to and after 2008. However, for medium- to longer-term horizons, the slope regression provided the best forecasts prior to 2008, while the recent experience of near-zero short interest rates coincides with a period of forecasting superiority for the autoregressive and dynamic Nelson-Siegel models.

The FECM combines error-correction, cointegration and dynamic factor models, and has several conceptual advantages over the standard ECM and FAVAR models. In particular, it uses a larger dataset than the ECM and incorporates the long-run information which the FAVAR is missing because of its specification in differences. In this paper, we examine the forecasting performance of the FECM by means of an analytical example, Monte Carlo simulations and several empirical applications. We show that FECM generally offers a higher forecasting precision relative to the FAVAR, and marks a useful step forward for forecasting with large datasets.

We address this research void by reporting the findings of two empirical studies-the first, an exploratory study of drivers' perceptions of texting while driving; the second, an experimental examination of the relative effectiveness of mortality salience (MS) primes in public service announcements (PSAs). Employing theory derived from the MS literature, we find that when verbal and/or visual cues to death/dying were used, participants' attitudes and behavioral intentions were altered in a positive direction. As compared to a control group, the primed PSAs produced less favorable attitudes and reduced intentions to text while driving in the future.

To investigate the disproportionate distribution of the HOT lane benefits among demographic groups, previous studies have conducted surveys from a small portion of the travelers. Considering the high cost and time-intensiveness of surveys, this study proposes the application of vehicle value as a proxy for income on the Atlanta I-85 HOT corridor. More than 300,000 license-plate records were collected across all the lanes during peak periods of spring and summer 2012. The State vehicle registration database was employed to obtain vehicle characteristics from license-plate observations, which were then processed to estimate vehicle value. The results show that there is 23% difference between average vehicle value across HOT lane and general purpose lanes. To support the proposed methodology, the research team used targeted market income data which demonstrates notably similar trends of differences across the lanes. This study once again rejects the concept of Lexus Lane by illustrating that significant amount of low-income users are using the HOT lane; however, very high income travelers are using HOT lane twice as frequent as low-income travelers.

We found that agglomeration is an important predictor of R&D productivity in the case of market-oriented (Edison-type) research while interregional scientific networking is an important determinant of R&D productivity in the case of science-driven (Pasteur-type) research. Importantly, the two determinants are never jointly significant. This finding indicates that in a knowledge production context, and contrary to what may happen in other areas of economic activity, agglomeration and scientific networking are neither substitutes nor complements but operate at distinct parts of the knowledge production process. Our findings uncover the principal components of regional knowledge production processes across European regions in a dynamic setting. They therefore allow us to explore counterfactual scenarios and characterize the effects of policy interventions. A simulation of the likely impacts of FP6 funds on regional R&D productivity demonstrates that the dynamic effect is greater in regions with high agglomeration.","[Varga, Attila] Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ & Reg Studies, Pecs, Hungary; [Varga, Attila] Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, MTA PTE Innovat & Growth Res Grp, Pecs, Hungary; [Pontikakis, Dimitrios] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Directorate Sci Technol & Ind, Paris, France; [Chorafakis, George] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",University of Pecs; University of Pecs; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Cambridge,"Varga, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ & Reg Studies, Pecs, Hungary.",vargaa@ktk.pte.hu,,"Chorafakis, George/0000-0002-7024-4006; Varga, Attila/0000-0001-7252-5648",,,,,111,37,39,0,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We investigate whether human capital has a particularly strong impact in relation to lowering barriers among the former group of firms, since a strong skill base is likely to compensate for lack of experience in innovation-related activities or the complementary assets needed for innovation. We draw on four waves of the Spanish Innovation Survey and examine the impact of human capital on three types of obstacles to innovation: cost, knowledge and market barriers.

A descriptive analysis is put forward that addresses the ideal types of the mining cluster and enclave, establishing as criteria of comparison the mechanisms proposed by Marshall as sources of agglomeration economies. Despite strong growth, the Antofagasta Region approximates more a mining enclave than a cluster. This implies the need to revise and adapt the concept of enclave to the current reality.","[Arias, Martin] UCL, Sch Planning, Bartlett, London, England; [Atienza, Miguel; Cademartori, Jan] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Antofagasta, Chile",University of London; University College London; Universidad Catolica del Norte,"Arias, M (通讯作者)，UCL, Sch Planning, Bartlett, London, England.",martin.loyola.11@ucl.ac.uk,"Arias-Loyola, Martin/C-1759-2018; Miguel, Atienza/D-1492-2013; Arias-Loyola, Martín/ABH-6177-2020","Arias-Loyola, Martin/0000-0001-8740-6326; Atienza, Miguel/0000-0003-3202-574X",,,,,80,94,103,1,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Firstly, study of economic systems is traditionally based on analytical and econometric tools, which have been the main arbiters of the veracity or plausibility of assumptions and hypotheses in economics. This approach has been proved to be highly suitable for theory development. Secondly, practical issues and necessity to support decision-making led to development of various modelling and simulation techniques or tools. However; majority of these approaches usually fail when coping with complexity. Furthermore, several main areas of interest can be identified in the business and economics modelling. Nevertheless, these areas are mostly independent due to their problem-based focusing on particular issues and their solutions. Depicted gaps might be bridged with the help of new modelling paradigms that have been established only recently. Application of agent-based modelling in the realm of economic systems is labelled as Agent-based Computational Economics (ACE). In particular sections of this paper results of experiments run on the novel model are described. The model is based on agents, which are described as a vector of several observed parameters, and four types of agents are used, namely consumer agent, factory agent, mining agent, and transportation agent. In addition, a colony is added as the fifth type of meta-agent. Scalability and configuration options of the model enable for various configuration and thus for conducting specific experiments. The presented system is already implemented as a prototype version in the NetLogo environment. The paper depicts two example scenarios, resource production and resource proximity, and offers interpretation of achieved results. Since most of the work done so far was focused on individual agents, group perspective as an important extension of ACE modelling is suggested as the further research and development direction.","[Bures, Vladimir; Tucnik, Petr] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Bures, V (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",vladimir.bures@uhk.cz; petr.tucnik@uhk.cz,"Tučník, Petr/AAF-9744-2019; Bureš, Vladimír/A-4353-2013","Tučník, Petr/0000-0002-6705-8974; Bureš, Vladimír/0000-0001-7788-7445",,,,,39,16,17,0,33,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

After 1991, the volume, direction and destination of India's trade were influenced by ASEAN neighbours. Considering the analysis period from 1971 to 2010 to study Indo-ASEAN trade, the Hausman test favoured the fixed effects and random effects. The core gravity model that we had derived helped us to deduce that distance rather than economic size of the trading partner has dominated India's direction of trade. The augmented gravity model, of Frankel, was used to analyse India's bilateral external relations with contiguous countries and with landlocked countries. The extended analysis included population and per capita income to observe the significance of size and distance. An important research gap regarding analysis of the uniformity pattern of Indo-ASEAN trade exists and we have used both the fluctuation and swing indices to infer that a systematic pattern emerges whereby the expected GDP swings of India matches with her observed GDP swings-the recurrent uniformity is present with a lag period of two years in post liberalisation period.

We use two features of MODWT to explore energy decomposition of stock market returns at different time scales and to apply methodology of [29] to study comovement between investigated stock markets. We show that most of the energy (variability) of stock market return series is captured by scale 1 (which correspond to 2-4 days return dynamics) and scale 2 (which correspond to 4-8 days return dynamics) MODWT coefficients. MODWT details are used to show that comovement between stock markets is scale-dependent and declines from raw (daily) return series to first- and second-scale reconstructed return series. The findings of the survey then have important implications for foreign financial investors who already hold international portfolios that exactly replicate those of non-Czech or non-Hungarian stock markets: international investing in the Czech or Hungarian stock markets with investment horizons corresponding to scale 2 (4 to 8 days) brings greater international diversification benefits than shorter (2 to 4 day horizon) international trading diversification strategies. The Slovenian stock market differs from the Czech and Hungarian markets also in this respect, as when the scale is increased the benefits of diversification are reduced. We also find that the volatility of Slovenian stock index returns is less synchronized with other observed stock return series. Interestingly, the Czech and Slovenian stock markets seem to comove with the Austrian stock market to a greater extent than with other developed stock markets.","[Dajcman, Silvo] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Maribor, Slovenia; [Kavkler, Alenka] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ Anal, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si; alenka.kavkler@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,52,1,1,0,10,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The point of departure is an original database, created by the authors, consisting of 1586 academic articles about clusters or industrial districts that were published from 1989 to 2010 in international scientific journals. The article identifies a group of articles belonging to the main disseminators of the cluster concept. A backward citation analysis discovers further contributions, which are grouped into sub-communities via a clustering algorithm. The procedure enables not only the identification of local research communities based largely around sub-disciplines but also boundary spanners linking different communities of scholars scattered around the world. In so doing, we offer a picture of the origin and development of the cluster concept along with a new interpretation of the features that boosted the rhetorical power of cluster research: multi-disciplinary, cross-disciplinary and global dimension.","[Lazzeretti, Luciana] Univ Florence, Dept Management, I-50100 Florence, Italy; [Sedita, Silvia Rita; Caloffi, Annalisa] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Florence; University of Padua,"Sedita, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",silvia.sedita@unipd.it,"Sedita, Silvia Rita/V-3976-2019","Sedita, Silvia Rita/0000-0002-4589-6934; Lazzeretti, Luciana/0000-0002-9759-2289",,,,,111,73,74,0,69,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The technologies, which are predicting significant future growth in cloud computing. Cloud computing is a set of information and communication technologies in which IT resources are delivered in the form of services to external users via the Internet. The aim of this paper is to describe the use of cloud computing in Czech companies and compare its deployment to other countries. Characteristics of the use of cloud computing in Czech enterprises are based on surveys conducted by local and international agencies and on their own research. Their own research was conducted in the autumn of 2013. There were 200 respondents from small and medium-sized enterprises across all sectors of CZ - NACE. Enterprises were asked about their knowledge of the chosen technologies, the rate of utilisation, the expected benefits of these technologies, or if they are interested in its deployment in the future. As revealed from the results of this survey, many managers and business owners do not know the term cloud computing and do not know which specific services and benefits can be expected. Managers also do not feel the necessity to change the state of the IT department, so currently there IS only a small proportion of companies that plan to implement cloud computing. Implementation of cloud computing is supported ON a national and international level, savings and benefits from the deployment of this technology are also evident. In this context, lack of knowledge of this concept and low deployment of cloud computing in Czech enterprises is a negative phenomenon.","[Maresova, Petra; Halek, Vitezslav] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Maresová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",petra.maresova@uhk.cz; vitezslav.halek@uhk.cz,"N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023; Maresova, Petra/L-1743-2017","Maresova, Petra/0000-0002-1218-501X",,,,,55,19,20,1,26,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Since the adaptation of Mexican GAAP to IFRS was initiated in 2005, using the Form 20-F of Mexican companies listed on NYSE during the period 1997-2008, we investigate whether accounting earnings of firms in the post-adaptation period exhibit more convergence and less management than in the pre-adaptation period. The results of our study suggest that efforts to converge accounting standards have increased comparability of accounting earnings. However, the adaptation to IFRS is not associated with lower levels of discretionary accruals. We also find that the choice of accounting method could be driven by opportunistic behaviour of managers. Based on our findings, we could conclude that managerial opportunism is a determinant of accounting choice decisions in cross-listed Mexican firms.","[Palacios Manzano, Mercedes; Martinez Conesa, Isabel] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Manzano, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",palacios@um.es; isabelm.martinez@um.es,"Martinez-conesa, Isabel M/H-7874-2015",,,,,,60,5,9,0,21,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In order to source sufficient numbers of skilled financial managers, specialised career guidance should be high on the agenda of educational and labour policy makers. While the chartered management accountant (CMA) enjoys international status, not many studies have been conducted to measure South African students' and accounting teachers' awareness of the CMA designation. This article reports on the results of first-year accounting students' perceptions of a career in management accounting as well as on the career guidance they received on how to become a CMA. It also reports on accounting teachers' awareness of the management accounting designation. This study found that first-year accounting students and accounting teachers do not possess sufficient knowledge of the career opportunities in the management accounting field and of the route to follow on how to become a CMA. Recommendations are made for tertiary institutions and professional bodies to alleviate this information gap by distributing brochures and posters to accounting and career guidance teachers and by providing information sessions to them as well as to first-year accounting students on career opportunities in the management accounting field.","Univ S Africa, Sch Accounting Sci, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Shuttleworth, CC (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Sch Accounting Sci, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Shuttleworth, Christina Cornelia/ABA-7907-2021","Shuttleworth, Christina Cornelia/0000-0001-6796-0530",,,,,36,1,4,1,30,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

What is the epistemic significance of agreements among experts? Is there a special kind of expert agreement that is indicative of knowledge? Why do the beliefs experts accept seem to enjoy a higher likelihood of being knowledge than the opinions of non-experts? There are three types of causes of correlations between people and the beliefs they accept: Expertise, in the sense of special knowledge and impartiality; bias; and coincidence. The Neyman-Rubin model is useful for finding which is most likely. The Neyman-Rubin model infers types of causes of correlated types of effects in two stages: First, it proves or disproves that the correlations between the types of effects are likelier given the hypothetical common cause type than given alternative (unspecified) numerous types of causes. The tested common cause type hypothesis specifies the properties of the type of common cause; but the properties of the alternative numerous types of causes are not specified. If both experimental and control populations are affected by the same types of (unknown or unspecified) variables, but only the experimental group is affected by a particular cause type (the treatment), significant differences between the two populations are likely to result from that cause type. At the second stage, the Neyman-Rubin model attempts to find the exact causal relations or nets, which may be complex, requiring the construction of multicollinear, interactive, and so on models.","Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Tucker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",avitucker@yahoo.com,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-08551-7; 978-3-319-08550-0,ETHICAL ECON,,,2014,50.0,,,,,,155,170,,10.1007/978-3-319-08551-7_8,0.0,,,16,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358528600008,0

The essential problem is that in real practice many eco initiatives often turn into environmental troubles, dissemination of false information, green-washing.

The aim of this paper is to analyze these problems and to offer a managerial approach to increase the normative power of ecological standards and successfully realize environmental initiatives, while implementing principles of responsibility into organisational practices with ethics toolkit and resorting to integrity management.

It is shown that the LMACP nicely captures salient features of bid-ask spreads like the strong autocorrelation and discreteness of observations. We discuss theoretical properties of LMACP models and evaluate rolling-window forecasts of quoted bid-ask spreads for stocks traded at NYSE and NASDAQ. We show that Poisson time series models significantly outperform forecasts from AR, ARMA, ARFIMA, ACD and FIACD models.

Public works contracts are often imperfect and renegotiated after the contract award. Given the expectation for ex post adjustments, bidders seem motivated to take advantage of the low-balling strategy. This paper analyzes the endogeneity between the bid strategy and ex post adjustments. Using procurement data on rural road projects in Nepal, it shows that the bid strategy and adjustments are determined endogenously in the system. Anticipating cost and time overruns, firms would likely undercut normal bid prices. Then, ex post contract adjustments actually happen, because of their too aggressive bids.","World Bank, Sustainable Dev Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Iimi, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Sustainable Dev Dept, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",aiimi@worldbank.org,,,,,,,39,11,12,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

We first show that deterioration of relations between the United States and another country, measured by divergence in their United Nations General Assembly voting patterns, reduced U.S. imports from that country during 1962--2000. Though statistically significant, the magnitude of the effect of political distance on trade is small. Indeed, we show that except for petroleum and some chemical products, U.S. imports are not affected by international politics. American firms, however, diversify their oil imports significantly away from political opponents of the United States. Oil trade is often associated with backward vertical foreign direct investment that is subject to the expropriation risk. In contrast to the usual claim that oil is a strategic commodity, we provide suggestive evidence that trade in products when rents are appropriable is more likely to be affected by international politics.","[Mityakov, Sergey; Tsui, Kevin K.] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA; [Tang, Heiwai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Clemson University; Johns Hopkins University,"Mityakov, S (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA.",,,,,,,,58,24,24,1,24,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Compared to other triggers of behavioral change, the impact of fuel prices has received only scant attention in the literature, especially with respect to short-run change in activity-travel behavior. To gain insight into this issue, travel diaries of a representative sample of individuals in the Netherlands who use the car for daily travel were analyzed. Seemingly unrelated regression analysis was used to examine the effects of fuel price on people's travel time expenditures for different kinds of activities, differentiating between weekdays and weekends. The results indicate that fuel price is negatively correlated with travel time expenditures by car, and that this relationship differs between weekdays and weekends. When faced with increasing fuel prices, people seem to prefer reducing travel time expenditure by car for compulsory trips more than for leisure trips. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As a matter of fact, these models do not account for the internal structure relative to measures characterizing port operations performance. In this paper, efficiency in Brazilian ports is measured using a two-stage process. In the first stage, called physical infrastructure efficiency, assets (number of berths, warehousing area, and yard area) are used to accomplish a certain shipment frequency per year. In the second stage, called shipment consolidation efficiency, these movements allow solid bulk and containerized cargoes to be handled. The network-DEA centralized efficiency model is adopted here to optimize both stages simultaneously. Results indicate that a private administration exerts a positive impact on physical infrastructure efficiency levels, while the hinterland size and the operation of both types of cargoes have a positive impact on shipment consolidation efficiency levels. Policy implications for the new regulatory framework on the Brazilian port sector are also derived. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2006, for example, there were over 42,700 fatalities associated with these crashes. Understanding the causes of these crashes and methods to reduce them continues to be of great interest to economists, public health officials, and policy makers. We present in this paper statistical models using a rich set of panel data covering the period 1980 to 2007 by state and the District of Columbia. Our choice of variables is based on an extensive literature highlighting the importance of policy, safety, demographic, and economic determinants of fatality rates. The estimation techniques used in this paper takes cognizance that standard econometric inference focuses on parameter uncertainty. Models are estimated conditional on the assumption that the model to be estimated and reported is the true model. Tests are then made on a multitude of alternative models, each sequentially assumed to be the true model. Model uncertainty is manifested in this procedure, but it is often ignored in practice. Recent Bayesian statistical methods speak directly to the issue of both model choice and variable selection. This paper utilizes three Bayesian techniques: Extreme Bounds Analysis, Bayesian Model Averaging, and Stochastic Search Variable Selection to address model and parameter uncertainty in models estimating the determinants of motor vehicle crash fatalities.

The tertiary system of education does not favor the formation of critical thinkers. No models of intervention or didactic methodologies are generated to empower this capacity in undergraduate students; neither are there initiatives tending toward the systematic use of measuring, intervention and control instruments for critical thought development. The aim is to propose a methodology for teaching critical thinking to undergraduate college students through contextualized learning objects. The methodology corresponds to a descriptive study, because it defines critical thinking, according to several authors, identifies existing methods and different tests to measure it, expounding their development strategies. Finally, as a result of the analysis, an innovative intervention model is proposed that gathers the existing tools for measuring critical thinking in initial undergraduates tertiary-level students that would facilitate a didactic approach to it and permit deepening its coherence with the disciplinary field throughout the curriculum.","[Madariaga, Patricio] Univ Vina del Mar, Escuela Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Madariaga, P (通讯作者)，Univ Vina del Mar, Escuela Educ, Santiago, Chile.",pmadariaga@uvm.cl; martin@utalca.cl,"Schaffernicht, Martin/I-1751-2019","Schaffernicht, Martin/0000-0002-3656-1059",,,,,39,5,5,0,6,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

In addition, this paper considers a more general form of child-rearing cost, which is a mixture of time and money. The first observation is that whether the fertility rate increases or not by the expansion of the pay-as-you-go social security depends on (1) the size of the monetary child-rearing cost relative to the time spent on child-rearing and (2) the current fertility and interest rate in laissez faire. The second observation is that income per worker can increase by an expansion in pay-as-you-go social security when the output elasticity of capital is sufficiently small and the payroll tax rate is high.

The study finds that intermediaries play a crucial role in compensating for the shortfall in social capital that hinders the functionality of innovation systems in developing countries such as Thailand. Organizational set-up and budgetary support are crucial for the effectiveness of sector-specific intermediaries. The study identifies a number of tensions with regard to the funding and governance structure of such organizations. To strengthen the role of intermediaries in developing countries, governments should pay attention to the issue of the division of labour and collaboration between public and private intermediaries. Public intermediaries should play an active role in producing public goods necessary for the technological upgrading of firms in the sector while private intermediaries should play active roles in industry and/or firm specific issues. Public and private intermediaries should collaborate and have a mutual understanding of which type of organizations should be leaders on what issues. This has serious implications on government policies that initiate and strengthen the roles and capabilities of intermediaries in the innovation processes.","[Intarakumnerd, P.] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Chaoroenporn, P.] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; Thammasat University,"Intarakumnerd, P (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan.",prpu6@hotmail.com,,"Intarakumnerd, Patarapong/0000-0001-6190-1388",,,,,23,23,27,2,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The present study has two main objectives. The first objective is to determine the effects of uncertainty, in out-of-vehicle times during transfers, on transit users' willingness to use transfer routes. The second objective is to determine the influence of out-of-vehicle facilities, offered by public-transport (PT) operators, on transit users' perception of trip attributes related to transfers. A user preference survey was conducted at two major PT terminals in Auckland, New Zealand. The survey data was modelled using cumulative prospect theory and fuzzy logic. The results showed that for all trip attributes, except for comfort, transit users' exhibited risk averse behaviour; users' revealed greater preference for the transfer route with less uncertainty in the out-of-vehicle times. For comfort, transit users' displayed risk-taking characteristics when the waiting time for a seat was less than 5 min. Such findings suggest that increasing the consistency in out-of-vehicle times will increase attractiveness of transfer routes thus enabling a more efficient and integrated network of PT routes to result in enlargement of ridership. Policy makers and PT planners must focus on methods of reducing uncertainty in out-of-vehicle times during transfers. Analysis of transit users' perception of trip attributes, given their current station, revealed statistical evidence of differences for two trip attributes, transfer waiting time and vehicle delay. Such findings indicate that transit users who are accustomed to better out-of-vehicle facilities have a lower tolerance for uncertainty in transfer waiting times and delay times. To the authors' knowledge, this study provides for the first time in literature a comparison between the two cognitive models. The comparison revealed that CPT and fuzzy logic models are both capable of representing transit users' decision making process. However, while CPT provides an indication of transit users' preference for a transfer route, fuzzy logic is capable of providing a closer approximation of the proportion of transit users preferring a transfer route.

We evaluate the effects of this event by using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy that compares the brands that were involved in the fraud with those that were uninvolved. It emerges that the negative news with regard to product quality induced consumers to shift their demand from involved to not involved brands. These effects persisted over time, even after the media stopped giving attention to the issue. Retailers suffered part of the costs of the bad news about product quality: the retail margin on brands that were mentioned adversely by the media decreased after the negative publicity.","[De Paola, Maria; Scoppa, Vincenzo] Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria,"De Paola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",m.depaola@unical.it; v.scoppa@unical.it,,"DE PAOLA, Maria/0000-0002-1704-4136; Scoppa, Vincenzo/0000-0002-2774-0258",,,,,24,3,5,1,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

This study illustrates various policy directions and initiatives of Singapore to address how its transportation system is progressing in light of these three components. Sustainability targets economical efficiency, environmental justice and social equity by including policies for integrating land use and transport planning, ensuring adequate transport supply measures, managing travel demand efficiently, and incorporating environment-friendly strategies. Safety initiatives of its transportation system aim to minimize injuries and incidents of all users including motorists, public transport commuters, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Smartness incorporates qualities like real time sensing, fast processing and decision making, and automated action-taking into its control, monitoring, information management and revenue collection systems. Various policy implications and technology applications along these three directions reveal that smart technologies facilitate implementation of policies promoting sustainability and safety. The Singapore experience could serve as a good reference for other cities in promoting a transportation system that is sustainable, safe and smart. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Most concerns are related to the misappropriation of funds and over-staffing. To solve these problems, an effective approach is to employ an appropriate Finance and Personnel Management Institutional Structure (FAPMIS). This paper proposes a quantitative method to evaluate the performance of FAPMIS. FAPMISs are classified into three types based on their differences: vertical management structure (VMS), regional management structure (RMS), and hybrid of vertical and regional management structure (HVRMS). These three types are represented by three different graphical structures. Based on these structures, the authors propose three measures, i.e., graph entropy (GE), time efficacy entropy (TEE) and quality entropy (QE) to evaluate the performance of FAPMIS. When comparing the numerical results among the measures, we found that HVRMS got the minimum TEE and GE values, which indicates its inefficiency in combating the misappropriation of funds and over-staffing in TH management. Thus, HVRMS is not recommended for real-life applications in China. However, VMS attains a higher GE and TEE value than RMS, indicating that VMS will theoretically lead to relatively lower risk of misappropriation of funds and over-staffing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To represent travel time variability, a series of possible travel times per alternative (departure time, route or mode) are often used in stated choice experiments. In the traditional models, the probabilities associated with different travel scenarios (e.g., arriving early, on time and late) shown in the experiments are directly used as weights. However, evidence from psychology suggests that the shown probabilities may be transformed (underweighted or overweighted) by respondents. To account for this transformation of probabilities, this study incorporates perceptual conditioning through a non-linear probability weighting function into a utility maximisation framework, within which the empirical estimate of the value of expected travel time savings is estimated. The key advantage of this framework is that the estimated willingness to pay value can be directly linked to the source of utility (i.e., the probability distribution of travel time), while taking into account the perceptual transformation of probabilities.

Integrating a qualitative research method based on the use of in-depth semi-structured interviews, its prime conclusion emphasizes the fact that the motives which determine the support given to a social cause by the banking entities may be divided into three definite directions a commercial, a strategic, and a charitable one.

This thesis is a contrastive study of euphemism in English and Chinese, and makes an English-Chinese contrastive analysis of the expressive forms of a few main euphemisms of the aspects of value criterion, religious belief, culture, ethics and social system.

Using unique data from the DDB Worldwide Communications Life Style(TM) survey, this paper exploits a large battery of survey questions on self-reported life satisfaction and physical and mental health to study the impact of welfare reform on the subjective well-being of single mothers. The identification strategy relies on a difference-in-differences framework to estimate intent-to-treat effects for the welfare waiver and TANF periods. Results indicate that the bundle of TANF reforms had mostly positive effects on single mothers' subjective well-being. These women experienced an increase in life satisfaction, greater optimism about the future, and more financial satisfaction. Furthermore, these improvements did not come at a cost of reducing mental and physical health. Welfare waivers, in contrast, had largely neutral effects on well-being. I provide indirect evidence that the increase in single mothers' employment after welfare reform can plausibly explain the gains in subjective well-being.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Phoenix, AZ 85069 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Phoenix, AZ 85069 USA.",chris.herbst@asu.edu,,,,,,,69,25,34,1,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Sustainability assessment can be incorporated at the planning level in order to influence decision making, and support policies that affect regional sustainability. This paper reviews methodologies that can be applied in sustainability assessment in transportation planning in order to shed light on the procedures being used to incorporate sustainability more effectively in the planning process. Using data from the Atlanta Metropolitan Region, the study identifies performance measures based on sustainability issues and regional goals and evaluates proposed transportation and land use alternatives. The study evaluates and discusses several performance measures and aggregates them into indexes representing four parameters of sustainability: system effectiveness, environmental, economic, and social impacts, to enable visualization and assessment of tradeoffs and dominance for the competing alternatives. This study is potentially useful to agencies interested in understanding the range of tools being used for sustainability assessment, expanding or refining their performance measures to capture sustainability in transportation planning, and using them in evaluating tradeoffs among competing alternatives as well as in identifying dominant alternatives.

Many contradictions between parts and different levels of a SC have been identified in order to achieve overall objectives. Such shortfalls may result in decreased strength and competitiveness of the SC. This paper considers the main conflicts related to inventory, pricing and marketing costs in an unlimited three-echelon supply chain. Aimed at avoiding a profit decrease, the research focuses on finding an equilibrium between inventory, pricing and marketing cost of an unlimited three-echelon SC. On each level, the best leadership option with the greatest payoff is sought for between K retailer, M manufacturer and S supplier. According to Stackelberg non-cooperative game theory, each SC level can become a decision-making leader depending on the available negotiating power. Consequently, three leadership types are modelled on each level and the total SC profit is calculated and compared to ascertain the best option. The authors of the article found that transfer of leadership from a retailer to supplier results in reduction of the total profit. In addition, the research focused on the main effects of parameters used in leadership models. Finally, validation of the proposed model was examined by simulation and Arena software, which indicated that models based on a game theory were performed accurately.","[Jia, Peng] Dalian Maritime Univ, Transportat Management Coll, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China; [Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad] Univ Tehran, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran; [Govindan, Kannan] Univ So Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Odense M, Denmark; [Meidute, Ieva] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Business Management Fac, Dept Business Technol, Vilnius, Lithuania",Dalian Maritime University; University of Tehran; University of Southern Denmark; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Mahdiraji, HA (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran.",h.amoozad@ut.ac.ir,"JIA, PENG/HHZ-0077-2022; Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva/AAD-6877-2019; Govindan, Kannan/M-5996-2017; Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/AAT-9996-2020","JIA, PENG/0000-0002-3124-3924; Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva/0000-0003-0435-7632; Govindan, Kannan/0000-0002-6204-1196; Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/0000-0002-8382-6603",,,,,59,19,19,0,28,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Innovative cities and regions tend to grow faster and have higher average wages. Little research, however, has considered the potential negative consequences: as a small body of innovators gain relative to others, innovation may lead to inequality. The evidence on this point is fragmented, based on cross-sectional evidence on skill premia rather than overall levels of inequality. This article provides the first comparative evidence on the link between innovation and inequality in a continental perspective. Using micro data from population surveys for European regions and US cities, the article finds, after controlling for other potential factors, good evidence of a link between innovation and inequality in European regions, but only limited evidence of such a relationship in USA. Less-flexible labour markets and lower levels of migration seem to be at the root of the stronger association between innovation and income inequality in Europe than in USA.","[Lee, Neil] Work Fdn, Socioecon Res Ctr, London SW1H 0AD, England; [Lee, Neil] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",Lancaster University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lee, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,67,61,64,3,102,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Their research produced a considerable amount of literature that might be classified under three broad perspectives: happiness approach, capabilities approach and behavioral economics. Usually, these three approaches are considered to be distinct research programmes with their own hard core theories and assumptions, heuristics and protective belt. Nevertheless, one can easily find a series of reasons to question the validity of the research methodologies employed by these three research programmes, since the integration of the non-monetary dimension of life into a consistent measure of quality of life could be a very daunting task In this context, the aim of this paper is to test the consistency of the results obtained within the three approaches and to assess the measure in which these results display a ripple effect if correlated In order to achieve this aim an empirical study was conducted among 100 students and employees aged between 18 and 45 years that were willing to complete an online form consisting of10 queries about their own perceived happiness, quality of life and dissatisfaction. The results of various correlation analyses reveal that respondents are using similar standards to assess happiness and quality of life, but the standards are altered when it comes to evaluate the dissatisfaction level of certain quality of life dimensions. This insight seems to lead to the following conclusion that happiness and the capabilities approaches are more similar in terms of research methods since they render almost the same empirical results, whereas the approach of behavioral economics provides a different set of empirical results.","[Serban-Oprescu, George; Pirosca, Grigore Ioan] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Econ, Bucharest 010374, Romania; [Serban-Oprescu, Anca-Teodora] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Int Business & Econ, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Serban-Oprescu, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Econ, 6 Romana Sq, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",george.serban@economie.ase.ro; teo.oprescu@gmail.com; grigore.piroscal4@gmail.com,"Şerban-Oprescu, George/U-6347-2019","Pirosca, Grigore Ioan/0000-0001-8148-4163; Serban-Oprescu, George Laurentiu/0000-0002-7614-6298",,,,,25,2,2,0,8,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The current discussion in Germany about the skills shortage includes the question as to how the labour force can be expanded. In the centre of this discussion are migration, a higher labour participation of women and a longer working lifetime. In contrast, the annual working time is not extensively being discussed. Although increasing the working time will not reverse the trend in the number of workers, it would perhaps stabilize the macro economically important volume of work.

In order to establish what these empirical data mean in terms of economic development, the paper builds a theoretical model of secrecy jurisdictions as constructed spaces of exception and exemption. It then reviews how different economic paradigms explain, analyse and assign normative values to secrecy jurisdictions/tax havens, noting that the neoliberal account proffers ideological assumptions which cannot be empirically verified. This paper argues that the most robust evidence available indicates that secrecy jurisdictions lower onshore rewards to national stakeholders, and critically shrink the fiscal base required for sustainable economic development. Further, the paper argues that the extensive use of secrecy jurisdictions by development finance institutions sponsors an elite financial class in recipient countries, but otherwise undermines broad-based development embedded in economic justice.","Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Bracking, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Sarah.Bracking@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,88,7,7,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Buyers of these contracts were assured a pre-determined foreign exchange rate as long as the range of exchange rate fluctuation stayed within a narrow band. In 2008, however, the Korean currency depreciated considerably following the global financial crisis, forcing buyers of the KIKO contracts to incur enormous losses. Why were there both supply and demand for these contracts, and why did they become suddenly popular? This article employs a behavioral law and economics perspective to explain what transpired in the minds of the parties to the contracts. Psychological biases and cognitive limitations were perhaps at play, including herd behavior, investor myopia, information cascades, and optimism bias. Recognizing that these psychological factors could induce sub-optimal decisions of the contracting parties, we argue that de-biasing should be considered an important policy goal in financial contracting. While the scope of this paper is limited to the KIKO contracts, the principles used to examine this case can be broadly applied.","[Ko, Haksoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Law, Seoul, South Korea; [Moon, William J.] Yale Law Sch, New Haven, CT USA",Seoul National University (SNU); Yale University,"Ko, H (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Law, Seoul, South Korea.",hsk@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Our moral entitlement to equal respect or consideration, in concert with the ethical ideal of the common good, moreover, justifies preferential treatment for those whose basic rights are most imperiled. Thus states are morally bound to respect and promote the basic human rights of both citizen and resident alien, especially the most vulnerableand of these, in particular, women and children. Indeed, the duty to protect grounds the subsidiary duty to rescue, for example, through diplomatic initiatives, sanctions, and in extremis, humanitarian intervention in the case of genocide or mass atrocity. Disciples thus see and have compassion, even as compassion becomes a way of seeing. Compassion, then, not only guides them in the fitting application of universal, essential norms, for example, the rights of migrants, but gives rise to existential (personal and ecclesial) imperatives as they come to the aid of wounded humanity.","Santa Clara Univ, Jesuit Sch Theol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Santa Clara University,"O'Neill, WR (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Jesuit Sch Theol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",,,,,,,,77,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

For freight transport, the emphasis on fastest routes is not always in the interest of the truck driver and causes negative externalities when the routes run through built-up area. This paper reports the results of a field test that was conducted to test a new navigation system for trucks. A sample of 100 truck drivers participated in the experiment where they used the new system first in a tracking mode only and next in a full navigation mode for a period of two and a half months in total. During this period drivers kept a diary where they indicated the times and reasons why they deviated from routes suggested by the system. We analyze the diary data and GPS data logged by the system to investigate compliance with and influence of the new navigation system on route choice. The results suggest that the new navigation system for trucks has significant impacts on routes, the most important of which is a shift from use of smaller roads towards larger roads with beneficial consequences in terms of both efficiency and environment. Deviation from suggested routes occurs relatively frequently and for different reasons by drivers of heavy and lighter trucks. We conclude that development of dedicated navigation systems for trucks would serve the interest of the freight transport sector and quality of environment at the same time and more so when route advice is differentiated between heavy and lighter transport.

We test whether the HSR lines have affected the airlines' travel frequencies and market shares. Our results show that on average, HSR has reduced the number of air transport operations by 17 per cent.

Public transit service in the Ankara metropolitan area is primarily based on the bus system, which is operated by both the public and private sectors. The bus transit system is generally mixed with other traffic (Right-of-Way C); therefore, it is expected that travel times are subject to high degrees of variability. The system is organized in a hub-and-spoke fashion, with the hub at one of the city centers (Ulus or Kizilay) and the spokes extending to the urban outskirts. Regarding travel-time variability in the public transit bus system, three models are developed to account for variation caused by operational regions, highways, and individual bus lines. In addition, two sub-models have been developed with respect to the dependent variables used: the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation of travel times. Three main causes of travel-time variability have been identified and tested in this study: temporal dimension, spatial dimension, and service characteristics. Model results indicate that all of these factors affect travel-time variability. We conclude that a uniform reorganization of the system must be undertaken to control travel-time variability.

Our objective is to understand consumers' patronage shift patterns in response to a new outlet. This study develops a patronage shift model by incorporating outlet characteristics which affect the choice set formation of consumers. Factors of interest to us are the accessibility of the new outlet, outlet awareness, and inter-outlet substitutability. An empirical analysis of the motion picture exhibition industry shows that (i) patronage loss is significantly disproportionate across incumbent movie theaters due to the asymmetric substitution effect, (ii) substitutability is more crucial than accessibility in accurately capturing disproportionate substitution patterns at the market level, (iii) the probability of a consumer being aware of a new theater increases gradually, (iv) modeling the growth pattern of outlet awareness plays a significant role in representing actual market responses more accurately, and (v) patronage patterns estimated by the proposed model from aggregate market share data are consistent with actual consumer responses.

Nevertheless, many of them evidence difficulties, basically regarding access to and use of information technologies. This objective of this study is to analyze the determining factors for innovation and technological development of SMEs in the clothing industry in the Maracaibo Municipality, State of Zulia. The research was developed through a descriptive, field study, applying a semi-structured questionnaire to owners, presidents, managers and administrators of 16 enterprises. Results show that a lack of knowledge about public support policies for innovation, the existence of personnel with low-level training, difficulties in accessing financing, reduced demand and the long investment return period are factors that determine a lack of disposition for carrying out innovative processes in the sector under study, since these actions are directed mainly to acquiring capital goods, hardware and software. Conclusions are that executing innovation processes and taking advantage of incentives and benefits offered by the national government are necessary for driving modernization and developing this important productive sector in the country.","Univ Zulia, Escuela Adm & Contaduri Publ, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Elena, LMM (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Escuela Adm & Contaduri Publ, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",mylealm@yahoo.es,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,15,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

There is widespread recognition of the need to limit the demand for private car travel through travel demand management measures, such as information and incentives. This study examines the effectiveness of Let's Carpool, an initiative aimed at increasing vehicle occupancy in the Wellington region of New Zealand, and it examines factors related to solo driving. Let's Carpool uses ride-matching software to facilitate finding a carpool match for the commute to and from work. This evaluation study among nearly 1300 registrants of Let's Carpool shows that the percentage of commuters enrolled in the scheme who carpooled as their main mode of transport for getting to work increased significantly (from 12% to 27%), while the percentage of commuters indicating they drove alone decreased significantly. The frequency of driving alone also decreased significantly. Beliefs about cost, comfort, and convenience were related to solo driving. Based on the findings, recommendations are made to further enhance the effect of carpool initiatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This change in personal behavior is desired in order to reduce congestion and air pollutant emissions in city centers. This paper focuses on evaluating the impact of fare integration on transit ridership and travel behavior, using the city of Haifa, Israel, as a case study. The city's new, integrated, fare policy changed the historically complex per-boarding system to a simple five-zone fare system with free transfers, reducing fares for many passengers. Using fare-box data, on-board surveys and travel-behavior model estimation, we show that the new fare policy managed to negate the downward trend in transit ridership. Fare-box data showed a significant increase in single ticket sales of up to 25% over the first year following the launch of the reform; the survey's results pointed to an increase of 7.7% in passenger trips and 18.6% in boarding. The number of passenger boarding per trip increased from 1.38 to 1.52, implying that people were utilizing the free transfer option and enjoying a wider range of routes. The model results showed that fare reduction was a significant factor in attracting transit users, and that the public transport reform had three important contributions: first, it encouraged travelers to shift from private cars or taxi to buses; second, it created new trips, offering more opportunities for activity participation; and third, it increased travel options by allowing travelers to choose a better route.

This approach uniquely combines formal testing with graphical devices. We work with the one-step-ahead quantile residuals, which must be (univariate and multivariate) normal under the null hypothesis of a correct density model. Their corresponding autocontours are mathematically very tractable, and the tests based anthem enjoy standard asymptotic properties. We show that parameter uncertainty is asymptotically irrelevant under certain conditions, and that, in general, a parametric bootstrap provides outstanding finite sample properties. We provide simulation evidence on the finite sample performances of the tests and compare their performances with that of an alternative testing procedure. We also illustrate this methodology by evaluating bivariate density forecasts of the returns on US value and growth portfolios. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.

This article contributes to this literature by explicating the processes by which hybridization occurs by drawing on a comparative study of neoliberalism in three contemporary forest-based regions in the Global North: British Columbia, Canada; Tasmania, Australia; and the North Island, New Zealand. A key term for us is geographic limits, by which we mean regionally specific constellations (assemblages) of institutional and material forms that resist; hybridize; or, at junctures, even offset neoliberalism with alternative agendas. In turn, our idea of geographic limits is derived from our larger conceptual framework that integrates Anna Tsing's (2005) concept of friction with the notion of remapping and a four-leg stakeholder model that consists of different, albeit overlapping, institutional agencies that represent the political, the industrial, the environmental, and the cultural. These institutions provide the animus for a remapping that variously implements, modifies, and occasionally counters neoliberalism.","[Hayter, Roger] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Barnes, Trevor J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",Simon Fraser University; University of British Columbia,"Hayter, R (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",hayter@sfu.ca; tbarnes@geog.ubc.ca,,,,,,,91,25,28,0,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Long-term data on case filings, administrative resources, and judicial outcomes from the United States reveal that mixed regimes allow for the specialization of tasks between public and private enforcers: competition authorities focus on the regulation of dominance, while private litigants tend to identify collusion in contractual relations. The analysis further documents how judicial discretion under the rule-of-reason approach to substantive interpretation limits the predictability and credibility of legal constraints against anticompetitive practices.",,,"Rajabiun, R (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Informat Technol Management, Toronto, ON, Canada.",reza.rajabiun@gmail.com,,,,,,,142,14,14,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

This study compares the jobs/housing balance and mode choice of different groups of employees of a large employer (27,113 employees) and those of the reference groups from comparable employees working for smaller employers in Los Angeles. Based on spatial and statistical analyses, this paper finds the following: a) Across all employee groups, a better jobs/housing balance was accompanied by higher income, as was likelihood to patronize Travel Demand Management (TDM) programs. b) Employees from the large employer had more options for carpooling and thus drove alone less, even after controlling overall housing stock, residential location, annual income, and/or commute time. c) Across all employee groups, good jobs/housing balance did not necessarily bring about green mode choice. d) Comprehensive TDM measures by the large employer significantly reduced employees' dependence on driving, even in a region where autocommuting dominates. However, these measures were costly to implement. e) Different employee groups favor different TDM programs, and the patterns are marked by income. The above findings suggest that shared or consolidated TDM and housing programs, which pool smaller employers, might better promote green mode choice. Participating employers may also negotiate better deals for program implementation when these programs involve third-party transit agencies and contractors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Those findings are almost the same, whether a corporate governance index composed by each BOD characteristics is employed, or problem caused by endogenous relationships among variables is controlled. The results provide the first empirical evidence that real activity-based earnings management is influenced by corporate governance structure. This focus on real activity-based earnings management suggests new avenues for research on corporate governance.

In order to win the leader position in the marketplace marketing specialists work out different kind of strategies to achieve long lasting success. One of the most significant among these strategies is customer loyalty toward the brand. To achieve customer loyalty marketers should focus on brand image attributes and benefits in their efforts. By maintaining and strengthening the brand image and values, it will position the brand positively in the minds of consumers. Brand image comprises a consumer's knowledge and beliefs about the brand's diverse products and its non-product attribute. Brand image represents the personal symbolism that consumers associate with the brand, which comprises of all the descriptive and evaluative brand-related information. When consumers have a favorable brand image, the brand's messages have a stronger influence in comparison to competitor brand messages. Therefore, brand image is an important determinant of a buyer's behavior. Based on the brand image and the principle that identity is the source of brand positioning that can be used to attack a market with a view to growing market share at the expense of the competition. It is very important for any business organization to evaluate their consumer's perception towards the image of their brand or services offered. Measuring brand image based on consumer's perceptions helps a company to identify the strengths and/or diagnose the weaknesses of their company image, company's product or brand image and its position in the market. It is also important to understand that a brand has many images which are generally in the form of brand attributes and/or brand benefits. The primary purpose of this article is to illustrate the role of brand image in cosmetics industry, to summarize information from different studies and to describe the role of brand image in cosmetics industry. To analyse consumer's perceptions of these image attributes and benefits as it's a strategic way to identify the strength of a brand's quality and the meaning that consumers associate with the brand.","[Adonjeva, Karina] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,karina.adonjeva@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,8,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,7,12,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100001,0

For knowledge dynamics we use the semantic spectrum currently used in thermodynamics, through a metaphorical interface. In our view knowledge dynamics means to have complex transformations from one form of knowledge into another form of knowledge. In our research we considered the dyad containing cognitive knowledge and emotional knowledge. Cognitive knowledge is represented by the Western interpretation of the explicit knowledge, i.e. the rational knowledge. Emotional knowledge is represented by the result of processing our sensory information and integrating it into the non-rational thinking process. In nature and technology, one form of energy can be transformed into another form of energy. The classical example is the transformation of mechanical energy into thermal energy, and the reverse of this process, transformation of thermal energy into mechanical energy. Similar to energy, knowledge can be found in organizations and society in different forms: explicit knowledge, implicit knowledge, tacit knowledge, emotional knowledge, spiritual knowledge, symbolic knowledge. Our hypothesis is that one form of knowledge can be transformed into another form in a given context -Ba. Negotiation is a form of social knowledge exchange that displays opposing motives of cooperating and competing against one another. A good deal of research and practice literature focuses on ways to perform these activities effectively. In earlier studies, emotions were viewed as factors that obstruct performance, preventing successful coordination. In recent years we have learned that the facial expression of thoughts and cognitive knowledge can both help and impede negotiation progress. Facial expressions of cognitive knowledge and emotional knowledge may convey useful information about preferences; they can also signal dislike or hateful intentions. Whether the cognitive emotions move a negotiation forward or backward-or improve/threaten a relationship-depends on a variety of processes and the parties' awareness.","[Bratianu, Constantin; Iordache, Stefan] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Bejinaru, Ruxandra] Stefancel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,,cbratianu@yahoo.com; stefan.iordachel@gmail.com; ruxandrabejinaru@yahoo.com,"Bejinaru, Ruxandra/Y-4648-2019; Bejinaru, Ruxandra/AAW-4372-2021; CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/L-3402-2018; BEJINARU, RUXANDRA/CAF-3746-2022","Bejinaru, Ruxandra/0000-0003-2331-155X; CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/0000-0002-1029-7384; BEJINARU, RUXANDRA/0000-0003-2331-155X",,,,,13,0,0,0,5,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",,,978-606-19-0103-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,91,+,,,,,,2,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEN33,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317436900019,0

Both economic and non-economic factors of the quality of life are often taken into account and the role of external environment as objectivized measure for individual life satisfaction is emphasized. Hence, in examining the quality of life, two basic approaches of subjective perception of individual emotions, or approaches based on using objectified measurement methods classifying macroeconomic, social and demographic indicators chosen to reflect objective life conditions can be used. Determination of groups of cities with similar subjective quality of life assessment and the spatial patterns of similarity in the European area is the main research question studied in the paper with a proposition, how apparent is a difference between the cities of western, southern Europe and former communist countries. Database for comparison descends from the primary research carried out in seventy five European and Turkish cities on a sample of 37 626 citizens in 2009. Research was conducted through a questionnaire survey in which respondents answered 24 questions and the resulting document Survey on perceptions of quality of life in 75 European cities offers a basic descriptive comparison of the cities. In the article, the same survey primary data was processed using cluster analysis to classify the cities into eight groups according to similarity of citizen views. The subjective perception of the quality of life is confronted with the measurable quantitative indicators approach. The subsequent analysis examines the relation between objective and subjective assessment of quality of life. To clarify the classification of cities into clusters based on the subjective perception, four key indicators used in developing spatial typologies - GDP per capita, population, population density and the unemployment rate in the cities.","[Cernakova, Veronika; Hudec, Oto] Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Reg Vied & Manazmentu, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Cernáková, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Reg Vied & Manazmentu, Kosice, Slovakia.",veronika.cernakova@tuke.sk; oto.hudec@tuke.sk,"Ďuricová, Veronika/AAB-5492-2020; Hudec, Oto/F-4898-2019","Ďuricová, Veronika/0000-0003-2285-7550; Hudec, Oto/0000-0002-8877-8647",,,,,26,8,8,0,28,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Simultaneously, employing rational agent in the analysis that decides about labour input and deserved consumption allows developing a model following cyclical fluctuations observed in the economy. In order to do so multistage calibration-simulation procedure is used. The paper presents above mentioned assumptions i.e. seminal RBC model and augmented model with indivisible labour supply.

It is recognized that in spite of advances in transportation and communications, clustering remains most critical, and is consequently prevalent, in knowledge-intensive fields. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) that increasingly base their value creation and competitive advantage on knowledge-intensive activities are key participants in clusters, affecting both the nature and intertemporal evolution of local innovative activities. However, the role of MNEs in clusters remains under-researched. This paper traces the origins of research on geographic clusters, identifies the seminal contributions focusing on the role of MNEs, discusses potential problems inherent to this area of inquiry and develops an organizing framework for new research.","[Swift, Tim] St Josephs Univ, Dept Management, Haub Sch Business, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA; [Mudambi, Ram] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Saint Joseph's University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Swift, T (通讯作者)，St Josephs Univ, Dept Management, Haub Sch Business, Mandeville 380,5600 City Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA.",tim.swift@sju.edu,"Mudambi, Ram/A-8580-2008; Mudambi, Ram/N-1145-2019","Mudambi, Ram/0000-0002-5396-5602",,,,,124,60,62,3,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Building on a longitudinal single case study of a functional foods cluster in Finland, we present an institutional work framework for cluster formation. We argue that, in addition to ideational, material and bridging work, authentic leadership work is critical for cluster emergence.

An empirical analysis of recommended prices for legal services in Spain,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Professional associations; Recommended prices; Anticompetitive conduct,,"The European Commission Report on Competition in Professional Services found that recommended prices by professional bodies have a significant negative effect on competition since they may facilitate the coordination of prices between service providers and/or mislead consumers about reasonable price levels. Professional associations argue, first, that a fee schedule may help their members to properly calculate the cost of services avoiding excessive charges and reducing consumers' searching costs and, second, that recommended prices are very useful for cost appraisal if a litigant is condemned to pay the legal expenses of the opposing party. Thus, recommended fee schedules could be justified to some extent if they represented the cost of providing the services. We test this hypothesis using cross-section data on a subset of recommended prices by 83 Spanish bar associations and cost data on their territorial jurisdictions. Our empirical results indicate that prices recommended by bar associations are unrelated to the cost of legal services. Therefore, we conclude that fee schedules are not playing the role of providing useful cost information to practitioners and therefore this efficiency justification is weak.","[Ciarreta, Aitor; Paz Espinosa, Maria] Univ Basque Country, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, BRiDGE,UPV EHU, Bilbao 48015, Spain; [Zurimendi, Aitor] Univ Basque Country, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Derecho Empresa, BRiDGE,UPV EHU, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Zurimendi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Derecho Empresa, BRiDGE,UPV EHU, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",aitor.ciarreta@ehu.es; mariapaz.espinosa@ehu.es; aitor.zurimendi@ehu.es,"Espinosa, Maria Paz/AAW-3803-2020; Ciarreta, Aitor/H-7633-2015","Espinosa, Maria Paz/0000-0003-2189-4253; Ciarreta, Aitor/0000-0003-2627-4715; ZURIMENDI, AITOR/0000-0002-7600-3705",,,,,7,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

J,"Watson, M",,,,"Watson, Matthew",,,The great transformation and progressive possibilities: the political limits of Polanyi's Marxian history of economic ideas,ECONOMY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Karl Polanyi; The great transformation; market coordination; always embedded economy; sympathy; Adam Smith,,"Polanyi's The great transformation remains one of the stand-out texts of twentieth-century political economy, yet it contains important conceptual ambiguities. Perhaps most significantly, the later chapters reveal the influence of Polanyi's own notion of an 'always embedded economy', whereas the earlier chapters are constructed around a much more abstract notion of 'economy' derived from an essentially Marxian history of economic ideas. Marx worked within the basic Ricardian conception of economy as a method of immanent critique, but then proceeded also to project that same conception backwards onto pre-Ricardian traditions of economics. Polanyi did likewise, I argue, consequently missing the opportunity to connect his own ideas about the non-market influences on all market outcomes to pre-Ricardian studies of the substantive basis of functioning economic relations. I use the following pages to try to restore one such link, in this instance to Adam Smith's account of the moral 'sympathy' underpinning the process of market co-ordination. This reconstruction also has implications for progressive possibilities today. Polanyian responses to the ongoing crisis have tended to be framed by the basic Ricardian conception of economy and have accordingly been restricted to a discussion of more market or less, more social protection or less, more austerity or less. By contrast, tracing the lineage from pre-Ricardian concerns to Polanyi's notion of an always embedded economy allows the potentially much more radical question to be asked of what sort of economic relations today best serve essential human needs.","Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Watson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",matthew.g.watson@warwick.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/K010697/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K010697/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,54,9,9,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

It addresses three main issues. First, it investigates the existence of a relationship between road infrastructure and the industrial average product of labour. Second, it studies the determinants of such a relationship and quantifies the magnitude of the impact of road infrastructure on the average product of labour. Third, it analyses the spatial effects of road infrastructure in Mexico. The findings can be summarised as follows. First, road infrastructure has a positive and significant effect on the industrial average product of labour. However, not all the elements (roads or groups of roads) of the road system have the same effect. Second, we find that the actual magnitude of the effects of accessibility on the average product of labour depends on the physical attributes of the roads, as well as the peculiarities of the road network. Finally, we show that the regional gaps in the average product of labour across the country can be partially attributed to differences in infrastructure endowments. From a methodological perspective, the main contribution of this paper is the development of a comprehensive methodology for the analysis of some of the benefits of road infrastructure in Mexico. This methodology can be applied as a tool in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of actual infrastructure policy in this country. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is well known that such forecasts are uncertain, and some studies have taken that into account by using stochastic population projections jointly with economic models. We develop this approach further by introducing regular demographic forecast revisions that are embedded in stochastic population projections. This allows us to separate, for each demographic outcome and under different policy rules, the expected and realized effects of population ageing on public finances. In our Finnish application, demographic uncertainty produces a considerable sustainability risk.

Conditional upon a verdict, prosecutor participation raises the likelihood of a conviction by 38 percentage points. The results are robust to possible selection bias by the public agency.

Overall, however, the rebate's effects are small and short-lived, suggesting a muted response to this cash windfall in payday borrowing and repayment.","[Skiba, Paige Marta] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Law, Nashville, TN USA",Vanderbilt University,"Skiba, PM (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Law Sch, 131 21st Ave S, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",paige.skiba@vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,16,8,9,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

The results show that both organisational ageing and political connection have positive impact on organisation technology innovation outputs. The benefits from the knowledge and momentum accumulated over the years as the organisation gets older exceed the losses that resulted from organisational rigidity and path dependence. The technology innovation outputs of politically connected firms are significantly greater than those of non-connected firms. In addition, the impact of an organisation's political connection to different levels of governments on its technology innovation differs by industries, and firms with political connections to higher level of governments do not differ from those with political connections to lower level of governments in terms of how organisational ageing affects their technology innovation outputs.","[Shi, Yidan; Zhu, Pengyu] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Pengyu] Boise State Univ, Dept Community & Reg Planning, Boise, ID 83725 USA",Zhejiang University; Idaho; Boise State University,"Zhu, PY (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",pengyuzhu@boisestate.edu,,"Zhu, Pengyu/0000-0002-0892-3606",,,,,55,14,14,2,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

It develops this argument by tracing how the circulation of knowledge in the preparation for the Olympic Games establishes sociomaterial networks that are meant to allow the International Olympic Committee to coordinate the organization of the event. On the basis of Bruno Latour's concept of the oligopticon, the article develops a sociomaterial notion of power to govern at a distance that emerges through the triple movement of collecting and mobilizing information, casting it into stable intermediaries, and recirculating knowledge. At the same time, a parallel narrative considers how this power and its spatial reach remain always partial and are transformed by overflows as elements move in and out of networks and how forces outside the network bear on it, creating absent presences. Giving adequate attention to these topological multiplicities of sociomaterial networks offers an important counterweight to the dominant notion of stable social networks in economic geography and is particularly useful when analyzing the governance of projects and various other forms of ephemeral, distributed organizing.","Univ Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Müller, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin@martin-muller.net,"Muller, Martin/F-7045-2011","Muller, Martin/0000-0002-0734-4311",,,,,63,31,32,2,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

This type of externality occurs when both groups benefit, possibly with different intensities, from an increase in the size of one group and from a decrease in the size of the other. We explain why common externality is relevant for the health and education sectors. We focus on symmetric equilibrium and show that when the externality itself satisfies a homogeneity condition then platforms' profits and price structures have some specific properties. Our results reveal how the rents coming from network externalities are shifted by platforms from one side to the other, according to the homogeneity degree. Prices are affected but in such a way that platforms only transfer rents from consumers to providers. In the specific but realistic case where the common network externality is homogeneous of degree zero, platforms' profits do not depend on the intensity of the (common) network externality. This result differs from those of the two-sided models, which deal with standard positive inter-group network externality.","[Bardey, David] Univ Los Andes CEDE, Bogota, Colombia; [Bardey, David] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Cremer, Helmuth; Lozachmeur, Jean-Marie] Toulouse Sch Econ, IDEI, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Cremer, Helmuth; Lozachmeur, Jean-Marie] GREMAQ CNRS, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Bardey, D (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes CEDE, Bogota, Colombia.",d.bardey@uniandes.edu.co; helmuth.cremer@tse-fr.eu; Jean-Marie.Lozachmeur@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,7,16,19,3,117,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Extant theoretical work explains such variation by arguing that each investor finely tailors contracts to mitigate investment-specific incentive problems. We provide overwhelming evidence from 4,561 venture capital (VC) contracts that this tailoring is overstated: even though there is broad variation in contracting across VCs, each individual VC tends to specialize, recycling familiar terms. In fact, a VC typically restricts contracting choices to a small set of alternatives: 46% of the time, a VC uses the same exact cash flow contingencies as in one of her previous five contracts. We document specialization in both aggregated downside protection, and in each individual cash flow contingency term. Such specialization remains economically and statistically significant even after controlling for VC and company characteristics. We also find that VCs learn to use new contractual solutions from other VCs in her syndication network. Our findings challenge the traditional premise that each investor selects from the universe of combinations of terms to match an investment's unique contracting problem. Rather, the cumulative evidence indicates that contract-specialization arises because investors better understand payoff consequences of familiar terms, and are reluctant to experiment with unknown combinations.","[Bengtsson, Ola] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Knut Wicksell Ctr Financial Studies, Res Inst Ind Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Bernhardt, Dan] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Bernhardt, Dan] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Bernhardt, Dan] Univ Illinois, Dept Finance, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Lund University; University of Warwick; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Bengtsson, O (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Knut Wicksell Ctr Financial Studies, Res Inst Ind Econ, Lund, Sweden.",ola.bengtsson@nek.lu.se; danber@illinois.edu,,,,,,,41,8,10,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

This implies a shift in emphasis away from investments in new infrastructure and towards focusing on demand and taking full advantage of existing assets. The degree to which ports can modify tariffs depends, among other things, on forecasts of traffic, debt levels, objective annual profitability and reasonable yields on assets. Insofar as demand uncertainty affects ports' costs, this will affect ports' ability to meet efficiency and profitability targets. We analyze the effects of demand uncertainty of port costs using a panel data set of 26 Spanish port authorities observed over the period 1993-2007. Estimating a cost function using panel data techniques, we find a significant effect of demand on costs. Non-containerized general cargo was the service whose demand variability most affected port costs. We quantify the effects of demand variability on costs using a simple counterfactual exercise. On the basis of our results we find that if ports in Spain faced the same relative demand variability as the port with the lowest relative demand variability, as measured by coefficients of variation of demand, costs would be an average of 2-3% lower depending on the specification of demand. Different demand variabilities among ports should therefore be taken into consideration by regulators for pricing policy and when imposing minimum profit requirements on ports. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This manuscript examines the issue by focusing on university students, who have not been well studied in existing literature. It proposes a confirmatory framework for studies on university students' commuting mode and housing choice and their determinants. It also conducts a case study based on this framework to get more insights. This case study shows or re-confirms that when compared to the employees from the same university, university students are more likely to share a residence in exchange for rent affordability, bus proximity and short commute. They are also more likely to jointly determine their housing and mode choices. Transit pass subsidies significantly influence university students' alternative transportation use. Female students or graduate students are less likely to use alternative transportation. Undergraduate students have a shorter commute and use alternative transportation more.

In order to investigate the impact of public debt on economic growth, the paper uses pooled mean group estimator (PMG) for the period between 2000 and 2011. A battery of panel unit root as well as panel cointegration tests is used prior to performing the dynamic panel analysis based on PMG estimator According to the empirical results, in the long-run debt significantly influences the GDP growth having a negative sign as expected and pointing out that government gross debt lowers the GDP growth. In the short run, debt has statistically significant negative influence on the GDP growth as well, controlling for other determinants of growth (trade openness, total investment and industry value added). Designing policy frameworks that encourage export, promote industrial development and create better environment for long-term investment should foster sustainable growth. Therefore, we find that a credible fiscal consolidation strategy is needed combined with policies to promote lasting growth in order to reach debt-stabilizing levels.","[Casni, Anita Ceh; Badurina, Ana Andabaka] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Sertic, Martina Basarac] Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Croatian Academy of Sciences & Arts,"Casni, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",aceh@efzg.hr; aandabaka@efzg.hr; mbasarac@hazu.hr,"Časni, Anita Čeh/H-9236-2018; Andabaka, Ana/AAT-1381-2020; Sertić, Martina Basarac/AAH-4377-2019","Časni, Anita Čeh/0000-0002-2742-8619; Andabaka, Ana/0000-0003-2596-0561; Sertić, Martina Basarac/0000-0003-4182-8405",,,,,37,13,13,0,18,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

We consider a model with efficient bargaining ex ante in which firms do not compete in the final market. Assuming that the complementary innovations constitute a common input and that agents make complementary investments in its private exploitation, we find that, when complementarities are sufficiently strong, a commitment to openness may provide greater incentives than an exclusion regime. The theoretical framework may be applied to interpret Open Source Software licenses, intellectual property rights licensing arrangements within research joint ventures and royalty stacking issues. From a public policy standpoint, the paper allows to identify conditions under which the openness regime may be an appropriate choice to elicit further development of publicly funded technologies.","[D'Antoni, Massimo; Rossi, Maria Alessandra] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"D'Antoni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit & Stat, Piazza S Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",dantoni@unisi.it; alessandra.rossi@unisi.it,"Rossi, Maria Alessandra/AAH-8756-2021","D'ANTONI, MASSIMO ANDREA/0000-0003-2983-1409",,,,,43,2,2,0,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

German firms with inventors based in the United States disproportionately benefit from R&D knowledge located in the United States. The positive influence on total factor productivity is larger if the research of the inventors results in coapplications of patents with US companies. Moreover, research cooperation with American suppliers also enables German firms to better tap into US R&D, but cooperation with customers and competitors does not appear to aid technology sourcing.

The paper has two objectives: (1) examining the multi-scale health care inequality in Henan from two dimensions, urban-rural and core-periphery and (2) revealing the spatial effects of China's multiple transitions, provincial development strategies, and local economic development on health care distribution. The authors used geographic information systems-based spatial statistical methods to detect the spatial-temporal variation of health care distribution, and applied geographically weighted regression to reveal the effects of multiple transitions on the health care sector. The results illustrate that urban-rural and core-periphery gaps in Henan are still significant even though health care reforms and recent provincial policies have improved the access of rural and peripheral areas to health care. Health care inequality is sensitive to geographical scale and clustering, and spatial patterns of health care are shaped by the interwoven forces at national, provincial, and local scales.","[Li, Yingru] Auburn Univ, Dept Geol & Geog, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Wei, Yehua Dennis] Univ Utah, Dept Geog, Salt Lake City, UT USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Li, YR (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Geol & Geog, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",yingru.li@auburn.edu; wei@geog.utah.edu,"Wei, Yehua Dennis/A-7831-2009","Wei, Yehua Dennis/0000-0002-8510-388X",,,,,53,24,27,3,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The majority of these papers base their results on a class of econometric models that allows for time-variation in the coefficients and volatilities of shocks. While these models have been used extensively for studying evolving dynamics and for structural analysis, there has been little evidence that they are useful for forecasting UK output growth and inflation. This paper attempts to fill this gap by comparing the performances of a wide range of time-varying parameter models in forecasting output growth and inflation. We find that allowing for time-varying parameters can lead to large and statistically significant gains in forecast accuracy. (C) 2013 The Bank of England.

But all these operations involve estimating the reliably of enterprise value. Based on a statistical study conducted by the authors in Romania, it emerged that two methods are the most encountered in evaluating small and medium sized enterprises, respectively asset-based method (method based on substance) and income-based method (method based on hope). Considering the fact that a prudent investor doesn't offer a higher price than the price of a similar asset traded recently on the market, with all the imperfections of the financial market in Romania, the authors propose the market comparison method for estimating the value of small and medium enterprises.","[Bircea, Ioan] Petru Maior Univ Targu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania; [Manate, Daniel] Aurel Vlaicu Univ Arad, Arad, Romania","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures; Aurel Vlaicu University of Arad","Bircea, I (通讯作者)，Petru Maior Univ Targu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania.",,"Manate, Daniel/B-9254-2013","Manate, Daniel/0000-0001-7548-1388",,,,,8,0,0,0,2,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,513,524,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100071,0

In order to do so we estimate total factor productivity (TFP) growth by applying Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). A distance function was used on a sample of 14 ports terminals observed over the period 2004-2010 to evaluate their efficiency levels and to decompose productivity into technical efficiency, scale efficiency and technical change. We also decompose technical change - also known as technical progress or technological change - into several components. We find that the terminals improved their technical efficiency during the period of analysis, with Chilean terminals being more efficient than the Peruvians. This was influenced mainly by increased agility in the process of reforms implemented in Chile compared to Peru, which has allowed greater investment in infrastructure and technology in recent years. On average, TFP in the Chilean terminals declined while in Peruvian terminals it increased. The component change in pure technical efficiency and scale changes contributed positively to improvements in productivity in both countries, but the technological change component decreased. The latter result is related to the international financial crisis of 2008, which had a larger impact on the terminals of Chile, and is similar to results reported by other authors when analyzing TFP evolution in a period which included an international crisis. Moreover, the decomposition of the technological change shows that it was biased toward the capital input. These results have regulatory and economic implications, which are outlined.

Nowadays, counseling in the field of fraud risk management is acquiring high significance in all European Union countries. For this reason, The International Standard in Accounting 240 was created, considering a series of aspects, among which delineating the limit between fraud and error, imposing professional skepticism, and assessing the risks of erroneous presentations. According to ISA 240, assessing fraud risk is done precisely, for each financial exercise, at the level of annual financial statements and the main accounting assertions regarding the categories of transactions and events connected to the time period that was audited, assertions concerning the account balances at the end of the period, assertions concerning information presentations and descriptions. In specialist literature, in the case of assessing fraud risk, it is mentioned that the auditor take into account the contradictory events and aspects signaled in the past, but this is difficult for new clients, or in the situations when one cannot have access to the conclusions drawn by the previous auditor (Soltani 2003). In assessing fraud risk one should not overlook the time factor, because some financial infringements can be done and remain undiscovered throughout multiple financial exercises. In this paper, the authors, relating their views to the specificity of agricultural business in the county Iasi, have the aim of designing a fraud risk analysis, taking into account a series of economic and financial indicators. Simultaneously, they have taken into account the underlying factors in accounting frauds at the level of the agricultural entity. Based on the estimated level of fraud risk resulting from annual financial statements, the authors have delineated recommendations for planning and applying audit procedures in order to acquire the audit evidence, as well as recommendations for preventing and detecting fraud. In this paper, the authors, answering specific entities in agriculture in Iasi country, have proposed an analysis of fraud risk depending on a number of economic and financial indicators determined. Also have been the underlying factors accounting fraud risks at entity level in agriculture. Depending on the assessed risk of fraud resulting from the annual financial statements, the authors have outlined recommendations for both planning and performing audit procedures to obtain audit evidence and to prevent and detect fraud.","[Ignat, Gabriela; Iatco, Constantin] Ion Ionescu de la Brad Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Iasi, Romania","Iasi University of Life Sciences, Romania","Ignat, G (通讯作者)，Ion Ionescu de la Brad Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Iasi, Romania.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,696,704,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100092,0

Based on a philosophical link of methodological issues, Smith and North shared a conceptual framework and explanatory principles in common as well as similar historical illustrations. In terms of the use of comprehensive and integrated models of society, politics, and economy, they presented that economic development relies on how far congenial both institutional environments and sociocultural values of justice, liberty, security, and equality are to economic agents, allowing the interplay between economic performance and polity/culture. Meanwhile, these suggest a bridging role between old and new institutionalism, and, more importantly, a revival of Smithian moral philosophical tradition in the history of economics.","Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, K (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",glaskim@skku.edu,,"Kim, Kwangsu/0000-0002-9614-605X",,,,,50,9,9,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The specification of creative industries is undertaken on the basis of the concept of creative economy and is based on the basic classification of the economic activities (NACE). This classification is used by most of the European statistic offices. The study is analyses the development of creative industries in relation to the basic economic indicators (production, employment, net income and export). Each analyzed parameter proves a faster development than the overall average indicators. Production of the creative industries, which increased in the period 2005/2010 by 30% compared to 22% of the national average, is used as an example. Such results demonstrate the positive impact of creative industries to the economy. A similar effect has been demonstrated for other analyzed indicators. Employment in the creative industries has risen also very rapidly over the time. Moreover, the incomes in this industry are higher compared to the average. This leads to the stronger demand and in addition, it ensures higher payments to government budgets. Furthermore, the study analyses the impact of creative industries in every region of the Czech Republic. For this purpose, the Creative Industries Index (CII) was created. Its design is based on the share of creative industries in total production and at the same time it is based on the proportion of employees working in the creative industry in comparison to the total labor force. As a next step, the study uses correlation analysis to establish the link between CII and selected macroeconomic indicators (GDR vacancies, and incomes). In each case, the positive and high level degree of correlation was found. As a result, this study confirms the significant contribution of creative industries that help to maintain and develop a regional competitiveness.","[Kloudova, Jitka] Pan European Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Management & Econ, Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Chwaszcz, Ondrej] Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic",Pan-European University; Tomas Bata University Zlin; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Kloudová, J (通讯作者)，Pan European Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Management & Econ, Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Bratislava, Slovakia.",kloudova@fame.utb.cz; chwaszcz@seznam.cz,"Kloudova, Jitka/C-7634-2009",,,,,,18,4,4,0,36,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

To this end, we first introduce a new model that incorporates the effects of non-pervasive shocks, an Approximate Dynamic Factor Model with a sparse model for the idiosyncratic component. Then, we test the forecasting performance of this model both in simulations, and on a large panel of US quarterly data. We find that, when the goal is to forecast a disaggregated variable, which is usually affected by regional or sectorial shocks, it is useful to capture the dynamics generated by non-pervasive shocks; however, when the goal is to forecast an aggregate variable, which responds primarily to macroeconomic, i.e. pervasive, shocks, accounting for non-pervasive shocks is not useful.

Among the most significant techniques used by sophisticated investors and value analysts was the relative valuation based on company multiples (valuation ratios) derived from firms similar and relevant with the subject enterprise, the so called guideline companies. Practically, since there are no perfect identical entities comparative to any firm, one needs to adjust the valuation ratios observed in recent market transactions. Among many qualitative differences a key correction would be the one for different risk factors, such as: operating, business, economic, financial, market, asset, product and so on.

We provide bounds on the effect of immigration inflows on natives' election outcomes by considering alternative assumptions about nationalized immigrants' participation rates and voting behavior. We find that Latin-American immigration increased natives' participation rate and their support for the major leftist party (Socialist Workers' Party) over the major conservative party (People's Party (PP)). Conversely, African immigration only increased natives' support for anti-immigration formations relative to the PP while leaving unaffected their participation rate. The estimated effects are of modest size in all cases. We provide suggestive evidence that economic factors cannot account for such a heterogeneity in the effects of interest by immigrants' ethnic groups. We argue that Spanish natives' attitudes towards immigrants are mainly driven by noneconomic factors like dissimilarities between natives and immigrants in language, religion, and race.","[Mendez, Ildefonso; Cutillas, Isabel M.] Univ Murcia, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac Econ & Empresa, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Mendez, I (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac Econ & Empresa, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",ildefonso.mendez@um.es,,"Mendez, Ildefonso/0000-0002-2638-5071",,,,,30,44,49,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The purpose of education is to promote competitiveness and a greater flexibility of workers in a rapidly changing environment. Organizations must therefore use all available methods of education appropriately combined, and to set the whole process of education to be not only effective, but also financially acceptable. The economic crisis is taking longer than expected and companies can no longer afford staff training as before. One possibility is the introduction of e-learning in corporate training. The paper describes the various forms of education and based on the results of custom research (experiment) it compares the effectiveness of e-learning and traditional learning. Based on the conducted experiment, we can state that training in basic managerial skills with the help of e-learning is same efficient as traditional education methods. On the basis of the facts it certainly cannot be clearly stated that each organization (educational institution, business) shall introduce e-learning into the education system of their employees. It is necessary to access each organization individually. There are mentioned criteria and tools that can help you decide.

When dividing into sub-regions with low and high economic growth, we find that transfers from Central Government contribute essentially to increased economic growth in sub-regions with low economic growth, while human capital contributes essentially to increased economic growth in sub-regions with high economic growth.","[Quirino, Elisa; Nunes, Paulo Macas; de Matos, Antonio Fernandes] Univ Beira Interior, Dept Econ, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior,"Quirino, E (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, Dept Econ, Polo 4 Ringer Rd, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal.",macas@ubi.pt; fmatos@ubi.pt,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,17,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Until the previous decade, Middle East was thought to hold the maximum proven reserves of oil. This provided an incentive for western nations to maintain peace and stability in the region. However, discovery of new oil reserves in Brazil, Venezuela, Canada, Alaska and Russia, have challenged the status quo. Emerging Asian economies, namely India and China, will have to deal with an unstable supplier for one of the most important components in their energy portfolio. Given the situation, India is especially at risk as it imports almost 70% of its oil requirement, up to 65% of which originates from the Middle East. In a disruptive scenario of disturbance in the Middle East, India would find it difficult to meet its oil needs, jeopardizing its energy future. This paper analyzes India's energy consumption pattern, consumption of oil and oil products over the past four decades and the composition of India's oil import sources over the past five years Finally, a model is proposed to secure India's energy future.

The major difference between the Ideas aspirator and a business incubator is that within our community it prevails the idea that over time proved economically feasible, without any formal order requirements, such as: the existence of a company, a consistent documentation etc. The two concepts explained in this article can be connected in a functional manner amid them, meaning that the company raised in a business incubator may be the result of a collaboration corresponding to our proposed virtual community.

The possible results of this contamination are the invalidity of traditional analysis procedures, that is, the combination of exploratory factor analysis and structural model analysis from structural equation modeling (SEM). Ultimately, the possible theory developments and practical applications may be contaminated as well. To verify this proposition, this study constructed competitive models under the traditional and halo effect perspectives using the constructs of cognitive image, affective image, overall image, and travel intention. The Japanese island of Hokkaido was used as the focal destination to test the existence of common method variance and the empirical relationships under the traditional analysis procedure. The halo effect is theoretically operated at the item level, not at the construct level. To counter this theoretical problem, full models (instead of structural models) were constructed under both the traditional and the halo effect perspectives, and then the appropriate model comparison procedure was conducted. The Chi-square difference test results indicated that the model under the halo effect perspective was superior to the model under the traditional perspective. However, the variation of the error terms resulted in the unacceptable level of various fitness indexes under both models. These results suggested that the ignorance of error term covariation in exploratory factor analysis might provide an inappropriate picture for survey data in destination image studies. There are two main implications of this study. First, the combination of exploratory factor analysis and structural model analysis is not an appropriate statistical procedure for destination image researches, as the conclusions may be distorted for both academic researchers and practitioners in the destination image field. A more reasonable measurement model is needed. Second, at least for less familiar destinations, the cognitive and affective images of the destination in the consumers' minds are contaminated by a general image halo. The positive relationships between cognitive image, affective image, and travel intention are created mainly by this halo effect. Therefore, the relationships between destination image and travel intention in existing literature warrant further investigation.","[Tseng, Kuangjung; Yeh, Riwu] Hsuan Chuang Univ, Dept Business Adm, Hsinchu, Taiwan",Hsuan Chuang University,,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,2,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-154-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,703,719,,,,,,17,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA7DK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337485500109,0

Increasing export volumes can make a positive contribution to a country's economic growth rate, but it can also endanger the environment. How to reconcile the often conflicting phenomena of increased export activity, stronger economic growth and a lower carbon footprint is the focus of this study. A core outcome of the study was the creation of a single list using a cross-section of international sources, of low-carbon environmental goods, and their ranking according to their inherent ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, South Africa's capacity to produce them, and their economic benefits, as reflected in the export opportunities they present. These export opportunities were revealed through the application of the Decision Support Model (DSM), an export market selection tool that incorporates a systematic filtering and screening system. The results of the analysis should help guide policymakers in their strategic deliberations on which export sectors to incentivise and support with a view to encouraging more 'green' growth in South Africa in the years ahead.","[van Niekerk, Antoinette; Viviers, Wilma] North West Univ, Sch Econ & TRADE Res Ent, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"van Niekerk, A (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ & TRADE Res Ent, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",,"Viviers, Wilma/R-7877-2016","Viviers, Wilma/0000-0001-7471-7862",,,,,33,1,1,0,10,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Synchronizations in both time and space apply to these four forms of synchronizing, resulting in eight synchronization options. These eight synchronization options were then linked to different categories of policy options: (a) regulation, (b) pricing, (c) land use planning (d) infrastructure planning, (e) specific public transport policies, (f) marketing and communication, and (g) time related policies. We explain the relevance of these policy options for synchronization. Next we apply our structured overview to a case study, the redevelopment of the Rotterdam Soccer stadion of Feyenoord.

It also studies the consequence of rising materialism on the development of children. Due to their enhanced role in family purchase decisions marketers are making children sufferers of materialistic world. Marketers know that children easily get fascinated towards unrealistic belongings endorsed by their promotional offers and persuade their parents to purchase those belongings. However, the unfulfilled requests of children for materialistic things make them dissatisfied and unhappy, which later on cause conflicting situation in family. The exposure of children to media at small age also makes them susceptible towards external environment by generating materialism. This materialism is leading to excessive consumption and impulsive purchase by children. To deal with these issues, sufficient attention needs to be given by parents to divert child's attention from materialistic to the real world. Thus, the role of guidance provided by parents has been found very significant in mitigating the effect of materialism among children. (c) 2014 The Authors.

This paper compares the saving behavior of these two types of migrants, assuming that the former are authorized to work abroad for a specific period of time, while the latter can stay until apprehended and deported by the immigration authorities. Due to the risk of deportation, the saving rate of an illegal immigrant is found to be initially above that of a documented migrant. This precautionary saving phenomenon is, however, short-lived. A key finding of the paper is that the total repatriated assets of an illegal migrant are always lower than those of a documented worker, provided that their duration of stay abroad is identical. This is because the undocumented migrant's saving rate falls over time as her expected lifetime earnings are adjusted upwards every day that she avoids apprehension.","CER ETH Zurich, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Vinogradova, A (通讯作者)，CER ETH Zurich, Zurichbergstr 18,ZUE F 13, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",avinogradova@ethz.ch,,"Brausmann, Alexandra/0000-0002-8769-8944",,,,,38,7,10,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

This chapter aims to help define more precisely the nature of Chinese districts, discover what role they have played in China's dramatic economic growth, and interpret interactions between the Chinese and more mature economies in light of the developments in and interplay between districts. It will do so by analysing the nature and structure of the Wenzhou district economy, concentrating on the role played by endogenous and exogenous factors in the process of globalisation. The chapter will first of all address the role of trade - per se an exogenous factor - but an element so closely tied with the structure of the Wenzhou economy to be regarded as endogenous. Second, the study will focus on the role of informal finance, and on its recent impact during the global crisis. In both cases, the analysis will highlight the interplay of local institutions and central government, pointing out how Wenzhou's features as an industrial district do not fit neatly into an already established model. Rather, it can be described as a blend of Asian and Western features, where endogenous and exogenous factors were both responsible for its development.","[Zanier, Valeria] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Growth Contemporary Chinese Studies, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Zanier, V (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,"Zanier, Valeria/0000-0003-1460-1491",,,,,43,0,0,0,4,CHANDOS PUBL,SAWSTON,"80 HIGH ST, SAWSTON, CAMBRIDGE CB22 3HJ, ENGLAND",2052-2126,,978-1-78063-449-4; 978-1-84334-768-2,CHANDOS ASIAN STUD,,,2014,,,,,,,27,50,,,,,,24,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6UP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354492600003,0

The relationships of social category diversity, informational diversity, value diversity, and knowledge sharing and innovation performance have also been discussed. Result shows that social category diversity and value diversity are likely to cause informal groups, reduce trust and identity among team members, and increase the distance between team members.

After the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, carriers were free to serve any cities and routes they wished. In anticipation of carriers gravitating toward large urban markets, the Essential Air Service (EAS) program was created to maintain commercial service in smaller and more geographically isolated locales throughout the United States. EAS has been continuously funded since 1978, but has recently attracted the attention of many fiscal hawks. Serving only six passengers per flight, on average, with costs approaching $200 million, there are long held concerns that EAS is a poor use of federal monies. The purpose of this paper is to highlight costs of the EAS program and identify systemic inefficiencies in the allocation of EAS resources. We show that service redundancies exist, with EAS markets being cannibalized by both peer EAS airports and other commercial alternatives. Further, we highlight strategic consolidation possibilities for EAS allocations and services, facilitating federal appropriations reduction without sacrificing existing geographic service needs.

We reexamine the results obtained in the literature on contractual solutions to the hold-up problem. In contrast to Che and Hausch (1999 Cooperative Investment and the Value of Contracting, 89 American Economic Review 125-47.), we find that a simple contract can be valuable and even the first-best might be achievable in the cooperative investment case. For the case of selfish investment, the efficient result of Edlin and Reichelstein (1996 Holdups, Standard Breach Remedies, and Optimal Investment, 86 American Economic Review, 478-501.) does not hold in general if attention is restricted to simple contracts.

We focus on three mechanisms that drive network formation: (i) network endogeneity which stresses a path-dependent change originating from previous network structures, (ii) five forms of proximity (e.g. geographical proximity) which ascribe tie formation to the similarity of attributes of firms and (iii) individual characteristics which refer to the heterogeneity in the capabilities of firms to exploit external knowledge. The article employs a stochastic actor-oriented model to estimate the - changing - effects of these mechanisms on the formation of the interfirm network in the global video game industry from 1987 to 2007. Our findings indicate that, on average, the direction of the effects of the three mechanisms are stable over time, but that their weights change with the degree of maturity of the industry. To an increasing extent, video game firms tend to prefer to partner over short distances and with more cognitively similar firms as the industry evolves.","[Balland, Pierre-Alexandre; Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Dept Econ Geog, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [De Vaan, Mathijs] Columbia Univ, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10027 USA",Utrecht University; Columbia University,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Dept Econ Geog, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.boschma@geo.uu.nl,,"de Vaan, Mathijs/0000-0003-1971-7290; Balland, Pierre-Alexandre/0000-0003-2787-4376",,,,,95,156,187,19,209,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We find accounting for belief in the benefits results in sizeable reductions in the sensitivity to the levels of the charge, but quite small impacts on the sensitivity to revenue allocation.","[Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Hensher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",David.Hensher@sydney.edu.au; John.Rose@sydney.edu.au; Andrew.Collins@sydney.edu.au,"Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021","Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242; Collins, Andrew/0000-0002-2500-250X",,,,,17,16,17,0,12,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

In the literature, more advanced indicators are found, based on e.g. market potential or utility-based methods. This paper presents a generalised transport costs indicator for policy making which incorporates financial costs, travel times, and reliability of travel times. It calculates the average costs per kilometre of trips by transport mode, trip purpose, trip distance, region and time-of-day. A case study for the Netherlands shows that generalised transport costs by private car rose by 6% between 2000 and 2007. The main causes were increasing fuel costs and values-of-time. Average travel speed has increased despite more congestion on the trunk road network. Generalised costs of train trips have also risen by about 6%, because of an increase in train fare prices and the value-of-time. The time costs have, however, been reduced by improved reliability. Long-term scenarios without new policies also show an increase in generalised costs, both for cars and trains. The generalised transport costs indicator is not a panacea which can measure every aspect of accessibility, but it does represent an important step towards a more comprehensive approach to presenting accessibility changes for policy making.

This paper examines whether there is a relationship between walking or bicycling to school and the walking habits of caregivers or parents. A statewide pedestrian survey of New Jersey residents was used to assess the mode taken by children for their school trip (age of respondents (parents) 19-84; n = 353). Socio-demographic characteristics, public school density, full and part-time employment status of respondents, self-reported frequency of walking of adult respondents and perceived neighborhood environment characteristics are used as independent variables. Logit models are estimated to test associations between these variables. Non-minority ethnic status, women respondent's employment type, higher income, and vehicle ownership are negatively associated with active travel to school, while higher public school density is positively associated with choice of an active travel mode. Even in favorable circumstances for active travel to school, the employment circumstances of parents or caregivers may deter children from walking to school. When parents are active, their children are also more likely to be active. Poor sidewalk quality also deters parents from letting children use active modes for their school trip.

The recent intensified debate on tax havens is summarised, as is the important work of the OECD, the EU and the G-20 in this area and the ongoing research on the economic effects of tax havens. Ireland does not meet any of the OECD criteria for being a tax haven but because of its 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate and the open nature of the Irish economy, Ireland has on a few occasions been labelled a tax haven. There are three primary reasons for this identified, each addressed in the paper: a failure to distinguish between legitimate and abusive transfer pricing; a misunderstanding of the role and regulation of IFSC; and a dated but influential academic paper from 1994 that incorrectly included Ireland in a list of tax havens, based on a reason that has long since lost any validity.","[Tobin, Gary] Dept Finance, Dublin, Ireland; [Walsh, Keith] Off Revenue Commissioners, Dublin, Ireland",,"Tobin, G (通讯作者)，Dept Finance, Dublin, Ireland.",gary.tobin@finance.gov.ie; keithw@revenue.ie,,,,,,,43,11,13,2,22,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

In this model, the injurer's decision to take care reduces the likelihood of an accident only in the event that some nondeterministic intervention occurs. The effects of the negligence test depend on the information available to the court, and the manner in which the test is implemented. The key effect of the negligence test, in the presence of intervening causation, is to induce actors to take into account the distribution of the intervention probability as well as its expected value. In the most plausible scenario - where courts have limited information - the test generally leads to socially excessive care. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This was a central issue in the agencies' review of the acquisition of Motorola Mobility by Google in 2011, following which DG COMP opened investigations against Samsung and Motorola Mobility in early 2012 to assess whether these companies may have abused some of their essential patents. This article aims to contribute to the debate on the merit of the availability of injunctions for SEPs. We address the perception that the current system contains inadequate protection for licensees against the risk of hold up on the part of SEP owners through the application for injunctions. We provide an overview of court procedures currently in place across key jurisdictions and argue that the risk of hold up is overstated and that serious consideration should be given in the policy debate to the risk of reverse hold up by the licensees before contemplating change.

It questions the prevailing assumption in merger review according to which such transactions will have similar effects on retail price as that of downstream horizontal mergers. The analysis illustrates how a sophisticated profit-maximizing merged entity may find it more profitable to enter into efficient contracts that seek to maximize the profit of the distribution channel, and so ensure that retail prices are not raised. The merged entity uses its market power and improved bargaining position to extract as much of that profit as possible from the retailer. We therefore argue that one cannot simply assume a direct link between the creation of market power upstream following a merger transaction, and the subsequent increase in retail prices. An analysis of the effects of upstream mergers on retail prices should call for a more nuanced appraisal that distinguishes the transfer of wealth within the operators in the distribution chain from the possible price impacts on final consumers.","[Ezrachi, Ariel] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Ezrachi, Ariel] Oxford Ctr Competit Law & Policy, Oxford, England; [Thanassoulis, John] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Ezrachi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",ariel.ezrachi@law.ox.ac.uk; john.thanassoulis@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Historically, the Greek collective capitalist has utilized this framework for the purpose of reinforcing the degree of concentration (oligopolization) of the Public Works market. In the course of the year 1998 the legislator sought through implementation of Law 2576 to effect a forcible restructuring of the market and redistribution of the sectoral product to the benefit of the construction companies dominating the Public Works sector. Its aim was to either liquidate weaker contracting capitals or convert them into sub-contractors for construction oligopolies. It nevertheless transpires that the opposite results were produced to what was expected, so that there was a fall in the amount of Product appropriated by the hegemonic construction companies. The legislator accordingly introduced Law 2940/2001 within a juridical framework that came into effect at the same time as Law 2576/1998, the objective being to rectify the deficiencies of the older legislation.","[Metallinos, Pavlos] Univ Thessaly, Dept Civil Engn, Volos, Greece; [Metallinos, Pavlos] Pelekas Lefkaria, Corfu 49100, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Metallinos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Civil Engn, Volos, Greece.",kpaulosm@netscape.net,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

These public good benefits have also been well recognised in the context of a growing rural tourism sector. However, the high costs associated with the subsidy schemes, in conjunction with the ongoing economic recession, mean that it is necessary to explore alternative sources of funding in order to sustain the farming community. Through a case study in western Ireland, we explore the potential of a beneficiary pays approach to generate revenues for funding the maintenance of farm landscapes, which are a fundamental attractor of tourists to the region. Our results suggest that both tourists visiting the region and accommodation providers in the locality are willing to contribute towards the costs of preserving farm landscapes and that such a scheme may generate substantial contributions, albeit not sufficient to replace existing government funding.","[Yadav, Lava Prakash; O'Neill, Stephen; Van Rensburg, Tom] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Yadav, LP (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, St Anthonys Bldg, Galway, Ireland.",lava.yadav@nuigalway.ie; Stepheno_neill_1999@yahoo.com; thomas.vanrensburg@nuigalway.ie,"O'Neill, Stephen/N-8416-2018","O'Neill, Stephen/0000-0002-0022-0500",,,,,53,10,10,0,26,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

This paper examines the concept of quality and quality processes as an additional way of understanding the competitiveness of small and highly niched industries. In the theoretical framework, applied on the Swedish hi-fi industry, quality is identified as a promise and divided into three dimensions labelled performance, projection and protection. The quality framework provides a useful tool for analysing measurable and non-measurable aspects of quality sound and sound reproduction. Also, it is argued that competitiveness is stimulated when a product is associated with one of the quality dimensions and when a strong quality perception is inherent throughout the production network. Moreover, we find that quality processes are spatially embedded and that location facilitates both place-based branding and localised learning.","[Waxell, Anders; Jansson, Johan] Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Waxell, A (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Uppsala, Sweden.",anders.waxell@kultgeog.uu.se,,,,,,,66,2,2,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The model identifies conditions under which the court's optimal role may be to allow tyranny of the majority and the tyrannized minority will be better off as a result. This implication hinges on the timing of two events: lifting a veil of ignorance with respect to who gains and who loses from the policy subject to judicial review, and the revelation of new information (modeled as a random shock) that affects the level of the payoffs generated by that policy. We explain how the model applies to three controversial rulings (Serrano v. Priest, Kelo v. City of New London, In re Marriage Cases). In so doing, we demonstrate how the model can help distinguish scenarios in which judicial constraints on majority rule are socially beneficial from those in which they are harmful.

This paper describes how the urban transport problems of the developing world have changed in the last decade and assesses the extent to which the strategies recommended in 2002 have been successfully implemented. It shows that progress has been widespread in some areas - particularly in mass transit analysis and investment and some environmental policies - and that there have developed some good planning and public transport practices in a smaller number of model cities. But more strategic institutional and policy issues, including the mobilization and regulation of private sector initiative in meeting infrastructure and public transport supply deficiencies, have tended to be poorly developed. Above all, the growth of medium sized cities with weak institutions and finance highlights the need for the international development institutions to put greater emphasis on helping those cities by dissemination of best practice in strategic transport planning and traffic management.

For this purpose, a two-state time-varying transition probability Markov regime-switching process is added to the sticky price exchange rate model with shares. I estimated this model using quarterly data on the four most active floating rate currencies for the years 19732009: the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and the British pound. The results provide evidence that the Sharpe ratios of debt and equity investments influence the evolution of transitional dynamics of the currencies' deviation from their fundamental values.

Cash flow information enables practitioners to better understand the real operating performance and financial stability of a company, particularly when earnings information is noisy and of low quality. However, research suggests that analysts' cash flow forecasts are less accurate and more dispersed than earnings forecasts. We thus investigate factors influencing cash flow forecast accuracy and build a practical model to distinguish more accurate from less accurate cash flow forecasters, using past cash flow forecast accuracy and analyst characteristics. We find significant power in our cash flow forecast accuracy prediction models. We also find that analysts develop cash flow-specific forecasting expertise and knowhow, which are distinct from those that analysts acquire from forecasting earnings.

The latter question is raised by G. A. Cohen in his critique of John Rawls's theory of justice. In this paper I argue that Rawlsian liberals might provide an answer to Cohen's critique by establishing two distinct kinds of basic equality, thus providing a 'twofold account' of basic equality. A first kind of basic equality gains moral relevance in the context of respectful relations between individuals, and establishes egalitarian duties between them. A second kind of basic equality gains moral relevance in the context of respectful relations between the state and individual citizens, and establishes egalitarian duties of the state toward citizens. The strength of Cohen's critique depends, in part, on the fact that Rawls identified only one kind of basic equality while at the same time wishing to defend a dualist account of individual and state duties.","Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Pavia,"Carter, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",ian.carter@unipv.it,,,,,,,23,13,17,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

First, its implementation is extremely easy. Second, it allows for a separate test for unconditional coverage, independence and conditional coverage hypotheses. Third, Monte Carlo simulations show that for realistic sample sizes our GMM test has good small-sample properties. These results are corroborated by an empirical application on SP500 and Nikkei stock market indexes. It confirms that using this GMM test leads to major consequences for the ex post evaluation of interval forecasts produced by linear versus nonlinear models.

J,"Finn, B",,,,"Finn, Brendan",,,"Organisational structures and functions in Bus Rapid Transit, and opportunities for private sector participation",RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bus Rapid Transit; Institutional frameworks; Organisational structures,,"Over the past two decades, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) has become an established transportation technology, which delivers high quality, high capacity transit at much lower cost than rail-based modes. Although initially associated with South America, it is now global with a wide array of implementations in Asia, Africa, North America, Australia, and Europe. In most cases, implementation of BRT challenges institutional, organisational, operational, ownership, procurement and financing structures. Private sector involvement occurs at multiple layers - operation of transport services, provision of support services, financing of assets. It is necessary to develop structures whereby the public interest is maintained while harnessing and incentivising private sector participation. To date, BRT systems have not been implemented by the private sector or through PPP mechanisms, although the investment finance required is an order of magnitude less than for rail systems, with far lower engineering and fiscal risk. This paper reviews global BRT systems and their institutional and organisational diversity, and the participation opportunities and roles of the private sector. It sets out a framework of the BRT System Owner, BRT System Manager, and BRT Asset Owner(s) and the relationship among them. It presents a functional model of. the foreground and background transportation, customer-facing and support services for BRT, and considers the contractual arrangements under which these services are provided. Throughout, it considers the opportunities, practice and challenges for private sector participation. The paper draws from case studies in South America, South Africa, UK and USA and emerging BRT schemes in Africa and Asia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The existing bus corridors comprise about 280 corridors, 4300 km, 6700 stations and use 30,000 buses, serving about 28 million passengers per day. In 2010-2011, 19 cities completed new systems - 16 in the developing world - and seven cities expanded their current systems. By late 2011, about 49 new cities were building systems, 16 cities were expanding their corridors, and 31 cities were in initial planning. This impressive growth may be attributed in part to the successes of Curitiba, Bogota, Mexico City, Istanbul, Ahmedabad and Guangzhou. These cities show low cost, rapid implementation and high performance BRTs, with significant positive externalities. Interesting trends are emerging, such as the implementation of citywide integrated bus systems, improved processes for private participation in operations, increased funding from national governments, and growth of bus manufacturers and technology providers. Despite the growth, there are some outstanding issues: BRT and BHLS do not have a single meaning and image and are often regarded as a second best as compared to rail alternatives. In addition several systems in the developing world suffer problems resulting from poor planning, implementation and operation, due to financial, institutional and regulatory constraints. The BRT and BHLS Industry are in their infancy and there is need for consolidation and concerted effort. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A supermarket promotion in one week significantly increases the probability of a promotion for the same product at rival stores in the following week. Additionally, competitors seek to match or exceed the price cuts of their rivals when responding to promotions.

In terms of implications, the study permits advancing, on the one hand, in the relationship between informal institutions such as culture and entrepreneurial activity, from the more novel perspective of cultural diversity in the context of institutional theory. Also, the research has some practical implications for policy makers in terms of designing policies and strategies to promote entrepreneurial activity in the current context of globalization, which favors geographical mobility and therefore, cultural diversity.","[Alvarez, Claudia] Univ Medellin, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Medellin, Colombia; [Alvarez, Claudia; Urbano, David] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Empresa, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad de Medellin; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Alvarez, C (通讯作者)，Univ Medellin, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Medellin, Colombia.",claudiapatricia.alvarez@uab.es; david.urbano@uab.es,"Urbano, David/B-6879-2009; ALVAREZ, CLAUDIA/F-8180-2012; Urbano, David/GLQ-6309-2022","Urbano, David/0000-0001-7600-8656; ALVAREZ, CLAUDIA/0000-0002-6713-3823; Urbano, David/0000-0001-7600-8656",,,,,60,3,3,1,32,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Highly interesting conclusions can be reached from the results on the basis of the different effects of a single variable on each of the accident types according to severity. The greatest influence revealed by the results is exposure, which together with inexperienced drivers, speed and an ageing vehicle stock, have a negative effect, while the increased surveillance on roads, the improvement in the technological features of vehicles and the proportion of high capacity networks have a positive effect, since the results obtained show a significant drop in accidents.

Apart from supply and demand for bonds in the capital market and other factors the price of a bond responds to values of interest rates. It is possible to speculate in a bond price development on the base of interest rate estimations. It can help an investor for his/her decision making.

This allows us to test for the quality of forecast quantification methods by comparing quantified qualitative forecasts with actual quantitative forecasts. Focusing mainly on the widely used quantification framework advocated by Carlson and Parkin (1975), the so-called probability approach, we find that quantified expectations derived from the probability approach display a surprisingly weak correlation with the reported quantitative stock return forecasts. We trace the reason for this low correlation to the importance of asymmetric and time-varying thresholds, while individual heterogeneity across forecasters seems to play only a minor role. Hence, our results suggest that qualitative survey data may not be a very useful device for obtaining quantitative forecasts, and we suggest ways to remedy this problem when designing qualitative surveys.

Subsequently, and as they sought to respond to the current crisis, they embraced the view that only if public finances were kept under control would sustainable recovery be possible. Rules of fiscal governance were strengthened. In order to help themselves meet the conditions they had imposed upon themselves, the governments of many European Union member states made changes to their pension systems or to funds they had established specifically to pay the costs of population ageing. The intention of these actions was not to cut retirement benefits or to improve the efficiency of pension schemes and institutions in question. Rather, it was to free up resources immediately. The steps taken produced immediate cuts in public expenditure or in the borrowing requirement, and so helped fiscal targets to be met. Funded pension schemes and pension funds were merely convenient sources of money. They were treated like piggy banks that were raided when times became hard. Moreover, the policies pursued succeeded in meeting their objectives only because the system of national accounts according to which outcomes are judged does not recognise the way in which most of the fiscal gains are matched by future fiscal liabilities.","[Casey, Bernard H.] Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,,b.casey@warwick.ac.uk,"Casey, Bernard/IUO-4044-2023",,,,,,54,0,0,0,2,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-214-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,40,54,,,,,,15,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA4JV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335871100004,0

The proposed evaluation model combines factor analysis with entropy weight and the TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) to evaluate the financial performance of Taiwan's 50 listed opto-electronic companies. Finally, Spearman's and Kendall's rank correlations are used to verify that there is no significant difference between the 2007 and 2008 rankings of the companies.

We examine the relationship between their depression levels and their performance at this forecasting task. Across two different waves of predictions and with multiple measures and components of prediction accuracy, we find that depressed forecasters were less accurate. The poorer accuracy amongst the more depressed forecasters was primarily driven by a neglect of base rate probabilities: the depressed participants assigned probabilities that departed from the base rates more substantially, particularly for low base rate events. Given the high incidence of depression in the workforce, the importance of judgmental probabilistic forecasting in many settings, and the fact that we may be the first to look at the depression-accuracy relationship using a real-world prediction task involving exogenous uncertainty, these findings may have important implications for both theory and practice.

Those selected are domestic glass (beverage glasses, kitchenware, decorative glass, artistic glass, etc.) and jewelry. These are commodities that were identified in the available studies as causes for concern. The identified characteristic of these commodities was an insufficiently innovative approach throughout the business process of the companies. The intention of the authors, based on their own assessment of the innovation potential of the mentioned commodities, is to propose a procedure for the companies' possible involvement in innovative projects within the activities of the RCO (Regional Contact Organisation) Liberec. The present study was conducted from January 2001 to April 2012. First, an analysis of selected economic indicators was carried out for individual commodities produced by the glass industry of the Czech Republic. According to the results, commodities were selected for the evaluation of their innovation potential. The survey was preceded by a summary of the CSO survey for the period 2008-2010, focused on the innovative activity of firms (by sector) of the Czech Republic. To evaluate the innovative activities for selected glass commodities in the Czech Republic, according to industrial classification, the following sectors were selected: the manufacture of glass CZ-NACE 231 and jewelry CZ-NACE 321 (source of input data - Czech Statistical Office). Valuable information was obtained about the type of innovation and how it was funded. The authors' survey of the innovation potential of glass companies engaged in manufacturing domestic glass and jewelry was focused on companies in the Liberec Region municipalities with a high concentration of these businesses. 84 questionnaires were distributed, and 30 completed questionnaires were evaluated. Based on the survey results, it was found that respondents mostly showed low innovation potential. In this case it would not be effective to provide assistance in projects involving all companies in the EU framework programs. Therefore, a smaller number of companies were chosen to be offered cooperation with RCO Liberec, namely companies in which at least a moderate potential for innovation had been identified.","[Rydvalova, Petra] Tech Univ, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Podnikove Ekonomiky, Liberci, Czech Republic; [Pittnerova, Radka] VUTS As, Inovacne Technol Ctr, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec; VUTS a.s.,"Rydvalová, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Podnikove Ekonomiky, Liberci, Czech Republic.",petra.rydvalova@tul.cz; radka.pittnerova@vuts.cz,"Rydvalová, Petra/HLP-4991-2023","Rydvalová, Petra/0000-0002-4816-208X",,,,,12,1,1,0,12,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However, a question may be raised, whether cultural centres under conditions of finite resource are able to meet cultural demands of local residents. Thus, a scientific issue analysed in the article is motives that encourage society members to consume cultural products proposed by cultural centres, thus, strengthening the role of educational activity of cultural centres. The quantitative and qualitative research conducted in cultural centres of 8 border regions - Kybartai, Pagegiai, Svencionys, Lazdijai, Pelesa, Sovetskas and Gusev, enabled to identify cultural demands and factors of community members of these cultural centres, motivating the consumption of cultural products. Estimating different circumstances of the activity of Lithuanian cultural centres and cultural organizations operating in Russian and Belarus frontier zones (Lithuanian cultural centres, Lithuanian immigrant communities and cultural houses) a comparative approach revealed basic similarities and differences of motivation of local residents, creating premises for the improvement of the management of these processes.","[Urboniene, A.; Jureniene, V.] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Philosophy & Culture Studies, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Urboniene, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Philosophy & Culture Studies, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",aiste.urboniene@khf.vu.lt; virginija.jureniene@khf.vu.lt,,,,,,,11,0,0,2,17,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

A MICROECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,R&D; patent; productivity; innovation,ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; FIRM LEVEL; PATENTS; MODELS; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION,"Innovation is widely recognized as the main stimulus of economic growth. Considering that Taiwan has devoted increasingly more efforts to R&D since the late 1980s, a crucial question is posed: did the R&D productivity of firms begin to decline in Taiwan during the post-Asian Financial Crisis period when Taiwan's economic growth began to decelerate? This study investigates changes in R&D productivity for Taiwan's manufacturing firms from 1990 to 2003. By employing various approaches to obtain robust results, findings from firm-level microeconometric analysis suggests that overall R&D productivity in Taiwan appears to have been ascendant, particularly during the post-crisis period. This result is also evidenced by segmenting the sample into industry groups, whereby electronics firms have a significantly high R&D productivity growth relative to firms outside the electronics industry. Therefore, the slowdown of Taiwan's economic growth in the past decade is attributed to other influences rather than a slowdown in R&D productivity.","[Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli 320, Taiwan; [Huang, Chia-Hui] Aletheia Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City 51, Taiwan",National Central University; Aletheia University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 320, Taiwan.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw; chhuang@mail.au.edu.tw,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

More precisely, I will explore whether a high degree of collusion for advertisement expenditures facilitates tacit price collusion. Two environments are tested, in which the size of the spillover between advertising expenditures is varied. The results indicate that both degrees of collusion are correlated: a high degree of collusion on advertising functions as a signalling device triggering a significantly higher degree of price collusion by the opponent. Thus advertising expenditures seem to be a useful indicator for market regulators to detect non-competitive pricing.","Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Nicklisch, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",nicklisch@coll.mpg.de,,"Nicklisch, Andreas/0009-0000-3351-3863",,,,,42,6,6,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Most firms in our large sample of almost 20,000 LLCs are formed in the state where their principal place of business is located. As their size increases, firms become more likely to be formed outside that state, with Delaware emerging as the primary destination for LLCs that are not formed in the state of the principal place of business. We demonstrate that substantive law matters when LLCs choose their formation state. Limited liability companies are less likely to incorporate locally if their home state offers lax norms for minority-investor protection or creditor-friendly rules for veil piercing.

The results reveal first that ethical codes are only known to a limited extent by researchers in the Dutch CBA community, and formalized. Second, having the promoter of major infrastructure projects as the client for 'independent' ex ante CBA of those projects creates a conflict of interest, and limits the usefulness of CBA in modern societies. Third, respondents with a university background tend to value the interests of society more highly than consultants, who value the client's interests more. Fourth, role-related dilemmas can easily occur. A first dilemma in this category relates to the trade-off between the quality of research and constraints (on time, money, and delivery), a second dilemma relates to what research a university should or should not do, a third dilemma follows from the publication culture at universities. Fifth, the respondents believe that the Dutch OEI-guidelines (guidelines that explain that a CBA should be carried out for large national infrastructure projects, including how these CBAs should be carried out) increased the quality of CBAs for national projects in the Netherlands and reduced ethical dilemmas for researchers. We present several possible implications of our research, including arguments for developing codes of conduct for clients of research; doing CBA for more than only large national projects; and an independent second opinion or an independent committee supervising the CBA research.

God established people as stewards rather than owners of the world; they were entrusted with the special labor of enacting just and eternal laws that would perpetuate creation itself and dispense God's bounty for all. He intended them to be rational beings, seekers of justice, communitarian and free. By allowing, participating in, and often benefitting from unjust structures regarding land ownership, Christians engaged in theft.

Hence the property claims of the well-to-do are not to exclude the poor from what they need. The property-right claim of stockholders depends on the firm serving work and the interests of workers.

These spaces are characterized by the reproduction of collective identities in a context of economic and social marginality, which definitively results in concrete ways of acting when facing state institutions in charge of administering justice. Methodologically, the research is qualitative, since discourse of the popular sector inhabitants is obtained through group interviews and analyzed using a semiotic approach on a logical semantic level, which permits identifying categories that sustain and govern the discursive construction of the inhabitants. Conclusions are that, in the discourse originated by the inhabitants as enunciating actors, contradictions operate with regard to the administration of justice; these contradictions are not only categorizations of the world, they also operate as concrete acts in the inhabitants' daily life.","[Rojas, Carlos del Valle; Mayorga Rojel, Alberto Javier; Alarcon Silva, Mauricio Esteban] Univ La Frontera, Dept Lenguas Literatura & Comunicac, Fac Educ Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Temuco, Chile",Universidad de La Frontera,"Rojas, CD (通讯作者)，Univ La Frontera, Dept Lenguas Literatura & Comunicac, Fac Educ Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Temuco, Chile.",delvalle@ufro.cl; amayorga@ufro.cl; alarconm@ufro.cl,"Rojas Cruz, Carlos Alberto/GZM-2307-2022","Rojas Cruz, Carlos Alberto/0000-0003-0915-6653",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

However, not much work has been done in the area for more recent democracies. Forecasting election results in recently (re)democratized countries poses a serious challenge, given the very few observations of the dependent variable. Thus, we ask: is it possible to make valid election forecasts when the number of elections we have is very small? In this paper, we present recommendations on how to forecast elections under such circumstances. Our strongest recommendation is to evaluate forecasting models using subnational data. We illustrate our recommendations using Brazilian presidential elections since 1994 and data from the 27 states of the Union. Our findings indicate that forecasting elections in recent democracies is neither futile nor impossible, as some of the models presented here produce reasonably accurate forecasts.

It demonstrates that investment banking has played a central part in the securities industry, which has been by far the most expansive segment of the U.S. financial sector and a significant contributor to growing income inequality. The power of investment banking has risen over the past 30 years under the conditions of the growing demand for investment services, technological changes, deregulation, and globalization. Investment banks were at the heart of the shadow banking system, inventing many of the products used by it and often disguising its operation, thus contributing decisively to the outbreak of the global financial crisis of 20079. With leading U.S. investment banks converted into bank holding companies and the threat of reregulation, the future of investment banking is uncertain. One area of uncertainty is the banks' relationship with sovereign wealth funds, which involves both opportunities and challenges. The article identifies the economic geography of investment banking as one of the keys to understanding the dynamics of the contemporary world economy and promotes a mesolevel approach to geographies of finance.","[Wojcik, Dariusz] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Wojcik, Dariusz] Univ Oxford, St Peters Coll, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Wójcik, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",dariusz.wojcik@spc.ox.ac.uk,,"Wojcik, Dariusz/0000-0003-2158-284X",,,,,69,48,51,1,68,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

We compare paid medical malpractice claims brought by elderly plaintiffs in Texas during 1988-2009 to those brought by adult non-elderly plaintiffs. Controlling for healthcare utilization (based on inpatient days), elderly paid claims rose from about 20% to about 40% of the adult non-elderly rate by the early 2000s. Mean and median payouts per claim also converged, although the elderly were far less likely to receive large payouts. Tort reform strongly affected claim rates and payouts for both groups, but disproportionately reduced payouts to elderly claimants. We thus find evidence of convergence between the elderly and the adult non-elderly in both claim rates and payouts, which is interrupted by tort reform.

The response of users with different trip purposes to parking price increases (either continuing to travel to the zone by passenger car or shifting to alternative means of transport) was surveyed using face-to-face interviews in the Central Business District (CBD) in Belgrade (Serbia). These results, quantified through price elasticity coefficients, were used to develop the methodology for parking price (re)definition. The optimal parking price is defined as the price for which parking demand at the level of the desired use of the regular number of parking spaces has been predicted. Approximately 56% of parking space users in the current conditions stated that they would not give up travelling to the CBD by passenger car regardless of the parking price. Nonetheless, the price obtained by the applied methodology provided a balance between the supply and demand at the level between 84% and 98% of utilisation of the available number of parking spaces during the period subject to charge.

The identification relies on a regression discontinuity design by which individuals living in districts where a criminal politician was barely elected are compared with individuals living in districts where a criminal politician barely lost. The results show that criminal politicians decrease consumption by vulnerable sections of society: the monthly per capita expenditure of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, or other backward classes decreases by 19 percent.

We show why a board would release one inmate, but not otherwise observationally identical inmates with longer sentences: greater parole board discretion makes additional information more valuable. Consequently, increasing sentences can lead to even greater increases in expected time served. We determine how sentence length affects rehabilitation incentives. To encourage effort, sentences cannot be too short, but when inmates are sufficiently impatient, long sentences may also be undesirable. We show how different parole board priors can support multiple equilibria in rehabilitation effort and investigate the effects of discretion restrictions like parole eligibility.

In the United States after linkLine, the likelihood of a successful claim has been significantly diminished, particularly if there has been no prior course of voluntary dealing and no downstream predatory pricing. In contrast, in a series of decisions in liberalized telecommunications markets, the EU courts, in applying an as efficient competitor test, have focused on the preservation of competitive rivalry as equality of opportunity. This significantly broadens the potential liability for a margin squeeze in the European Union and reconstitutes EU competition law as a form of de facto regulation in liberalized markets. Faced with the uncertainty of this standard, the dominant firm has an incentive to avoid liability by raising its retail prices to the detriment of consumers. This article evaluates this divergence in the approach to the regulation of a price or margin squeeze in the United States and the European Union and traces these approaches to differing conceptions of dominant firm regulation, which in turn have informed different understandings of the regulation of a refusal to supply and the intersection of competition law with sector-specific regulation.","[Hay, George A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Law, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [McMahon, Kathryn] Univ Warwick, Sch Law, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Cornell University; University of Warwick,"Hay, GA (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Law, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",george.hay@cornell.edu; kathryn.mcmahon@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,6,7,2,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Results also suggest that the impact of advertising disclosure on the outcomes of financial behavior (e.g., recall, cognitive response, attitude toward mutual fund, and investment intention) can be moderated by the level of an investor's financial knowledge.

This study attempted to apply a system simulation model for investigating investigate the impact of alternative vehicle fuel policies, on the energy demand and GHG emissions in transport sector level and national level through the introduction of higher fuel efficiency engines for on-road vehicles. The model with a calibration period from 1976 to 2005 simulates the future change by 2050. The results indicate that the introduction of new engines with alternative energy will substantially reduce energy demand and GHG emissions from road transport sector, but it might result in different impacts on national total energy demand and GHG emissions. Using a non-fossil energy source to generate hydrogen may significantly reduce national total energy demand and GHG emissions; while conventional fossil energy sources may raise total national energy demand with a limited reduction of national total GHG emissions on comparison with hybrid engine scenario.

The Index of Sustainable Urban Mobility (I_SUM) is among the tools developed for supporting this new concept implementation. It is a tool to assess the current mobility conditions of any city, which can also be applied for policy formulation. This study focus on the application of I_SUM in the city of Curitiba, Brazil. Considering that the city is known worldwide as a reference of successful urban and transportation planning, the index application must confirm it. An additional objective of the study was to evaluate the index itself, or the subjacent assessment method and reference values. A global I_SUM value of 0.747 confirmed that the city has indeed very positive characteristics regarding sustainable mobility policies. However, some deficiencies were also detected, particularly with respect to non-motorized transport modes. The application has also served to show that a few I_SUM indicators were not able to capture some of the positive aspects of the city, what may suggest the need of changes in their formulation. Finally, the index application in parts of the city suggests that the city provides fair and equitable mobility conditions to all citizens throughout the city. This is certainly a good attribute for becoming a benchmark of sustainable mobility, even if it is not yet the ideal model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we qualify this result theoretically, showing that in the presence of risk aversion, loss aversion, or type I error aversion, type I errors have a stronger effect on deterrence than type II errors. We test these predictions with two experimental studies in which participants choose whether to steal from other individuals, under alternative combinations of probabilities of judicial errors. The results indicate that both types of errors have a significant impact on deterrence. As predicted, type I errors have a stronger impact on deterrence than type II errors.

We then model the drift term using the two-state Markov switching stochastic segmented trend model and present evidence of both short-run (one month) and long-run (up to one year) predictability for monthly exchange rates over the post-Bretton Woods period. This is an important result, as the recent literature has typically failed to find evidence of consistent multi-horizon predictability. The model strongly outperforms the random walk for 9 out of 12 exchange rate series at short horizons; for 7 of the 12 exchange rates, we find evidence of a long-run predictability that declines as the forecast horizon increases.

The present study will seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the weak-form efficiency in emerging economies. In terms of practical implications, the paper has direct implications for future research in EMH in particular emerging economies. The paper contributes in manly three ways: First, the paper collates and examines the broader and most effervescent literature and their findings. Second, it also presents a comprehensive, encompassing research work and a holistic view of various aspects of weak-form EMH. Finally, no studies have been conducted to date on a literature review of EMH weak-form efficiency in emerging economies. Nevertheless, the limitation of the study is that the findings are presented that may not be generalized to developed nations, which may be quite different in socio-cultural and political settings including the behavioral aspects of investors and the strength of the capital market.","Edge Hill Univ, Sch Business, Ormskirk L39 4QP, Lancs, England",Edge Hill University,"Nurunnabi, MR (通讯作者)，Edge Hill Univ, Sch Business, St Helens Rd, Ormskirk L39 4QP, Lancs, England.",mohammad.nurunnabi@edgehill.ac.uk,"Nurunnabi, Mohammad/T-7504-2018","Nurunnabi, Mohammad/0000-0003-0848-3556",,,,,125,10,15,4,41,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Yet intuitively we understand that much of our collective and individual existence escapes these efforts of rationalization. How then do we develop a conception of the social world that appreciates both the powerful drive towards rationalization and the things that escape or overflow? This article seeks to answer this riddle by examining the central role of ambiguity in social life in general and in organizational practice in particular. The concept of ambiguity is implicit in much social theory. Yet, over time, as theories become established, much of their openness to tension and ambiguity tends to be closed off. This article seeks to recapture some of that messiness, to shift the focus of attention slightly and to look at what slips out, does not fit or gets lost in translation. Drawing on the examples of two international organizations - the IMF and the World Bank - I explore the ways in which bureaucracies seek not only to contain ambiguity through various forms of quantification and standardization, but also to foster it.","Univ Ottawa, Sch Polit Studies, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Best, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Sch Polit Studies, Demarais 9154,55 Laurier Ave E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",jbest@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,69,88,96,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

To many, this implies an easier access to foreign markets and a harmonisation of business practices across the planet. However, to some this movement threatens indigenous values, norms, and traditions. Cross-cultural management has long been perceived as an important branch of international management. In the past, it has provided the community with insight as to why social and commercial processes may differ from culture to culture. The scholarly articles pertaining to the Czech Republic lack substance. Even the Hofstede cultural dimensions for this country are based on replications or estimates. Therefore, this paper investigates the current state of Czech cultural dimensions. Based on the qualitative research consisting of literature review, field observation, and surveys, the hypothesis Hofstede cultural dimensions attributed to the Czech Republic require substantial review and re-evaluation on a 'culture-alone' basis is confirmed. The paper discusses attained results from seven perspectives namely, Equality; The self, the group, and others; The Macho and the Virgin; Risks and distrusts; Looking towards the future; Language and communication; and Spirituality and belief. The first five equate to Hofstede's cultural dimensions, language and communication as well as spirituality and belief being a hybrid of both Hofstede and Hall. Furthermore, five other cultural aspects are also discussed in the paper - Uncertainty Avoidance; Masculinity/Femininity; Individualism-Collectivism; Power Distance; and Language and Religion. The paper establishes a Czech benchmark, which is open to discussion and may be used in both theory development and practice.","[Bures, Vladimir] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,,richard.brunet-thornton@vse.cz; vladimir.bures@uhk.cz,"Bureš, Vladimír/A-4353-2013","Bureš, Vladimír/0000-0001-7788-7445",,,,,56,22,22,1,24,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Data from the 2006 Census of Ireland are analysed to ascertain the characteristics of these households. The analysis of multiple car ownership presented herein examines individual specific, transport availability, and household characteristics to provide an indication of the individuals most likely to have access to more than one vehicle. Understanding the characteristics of households with more than one car is important for many reasons, such as how policies for emissions reductions or pricing regimes might affect households. Ireland, like many countries, has recently launched a number of electric vehicle and car sharing schemes. Traditionally these schemes have been aimed at reducing multiple car ownership, therefore it is important to develop an understanding of the households that would most likely give up an extra car and use a car sharing scheme or an electric vehicle. Also from a sustainability point of view, greater levels of car ownership can result in unsustainable transport patterns. This paper examines the Census data using a multinomial logit regression model to determine the relationships between multiple car ownership levels and several household characteristics. The findings of the paper demonstrate that occupation, public transport availability and residential density all have an impact upon the decision to own more than one vehicle. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our findings indicate that geographies of scope (or collocation among key related entertainment subsectors and inputs) explain much of the economic geography of entertainment even when scale is controlled for, though our regressions over time suggest the role of scope is decreasing. Furthermore, we find that the entertainment sector as a whole and its key subsectors are significantly concentrated in two superstar cities-New York and Los Angeles-far beyond what their population size (or scale effects) can account for, while the pattern falls off dramatically for other large regions.","[Mellander, Charlotta] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Econ, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Florida, Richard; Stolarick, Kevin] MaRS Ctr, Joseph L Rotman Sch Management, Martin Prosper Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada",Jonkoping University; University of Toronto,"Mellander, C (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Econ, Box 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",charlotta.mellander@ihh.hj.se,"Florida, Richard/AAD-7585-2020",,,,,,69,11,11,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The results of the study contribute to understanding the role of the absorptive capacity of a focal firm in partnership stability.","[Lee, Kyootai; Woo, Hangyun] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Technol Management, Ulsan Metropolitan City, South Korea; [Joshi, Kailash] Univ Missouri St Louis, Coll Business, St Louis, MO USA",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Technol Management, Ulsan Metropolitan City, South Korea.",kt78@unist.ac.kr,"Woo, Han Gyun/F-4731-2010","Woo, Han-Gyun/0000-0003-4628-9674",,,,,66,8,8,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

An examination of Melbourne and Perth,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Governance; Land use transport integration; Organisational structure,LAND-USE; KNOWLEDGE; INTEGRATION,"Land use and transport integration (LUTI) is a contemporary planning policy and practice that supports sustainable transport. Attempts to implement LUTI have raised questions about the appropriate organisational structure and the role of governance to deliver this policy. This paper presents the discussions from two public fora held in 2008 in Melbourne and Perth, Australia. Their purpose was to examine the governance arrangements for land use and transport integration. It is concluded that integration of land use and transport agencies does not mean that land use transport integration will be achieved in practice. Rather than simple organisational re-structuring, a focus on networked governance, together with strong regulation, is conducive to inclusive policy development and the implementation of land use and transport integration policies.

Specifically of importance is whether the Henderson moving-average procedure distorts the underlying time-series properties of the data for forecasting purposes. Given the weight of attention in the literature to the seasonal adjustment process used by various statistical agencies, this study hopes to address the dearth of literature on trending procedures. Forecasts using both the trended and untrended series are generated. The forecasts are then made comparable by detrending the trended forecasts, and comparing both series to the realised values. Forecasting accuracy is measured by a suite of common methods, and a test of significance of difference is applied to the respective root mean square errors. It is found that the Henderson procedure does not lead to deterioration in forecasting accuracy in Australian macroeconomic variables on most occasions, though the conclusions are very different between the one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasts.

To investigate forest owner preferences and willingness to accept compensation (WTA) to participate, we conduct a contingent valuation survey of non-industrial private forest owners in Norway. We find that WTA is negatively related to the size of the forest holding and absentee ownership. and positively related to the share of the forest classified as productive. The overall mean WTA per year per hectare is estimated at NOK 1800. Costs of reaching conservation goals can be saved by targeting small and relatively less productive forests and absentee owners first, before considering increasingly expensive forest areas. However, this recommendation only holds if desirable biological characteristics are not substantially less likely to be found in such areas. Results are potentially important both for our understanding of forest owner preferences and the costs of voluntary forest conservation schemes currently in use in many countries.

This paper examines the ABX, a crucial new market (set up in January 2006) widely used as a guide to these valuations. The paper outlines the origins of the ABX, discusses the sometimes fiercely contested process of the standardization of the credit default swaps that underlay it, and outlines how the ABX rendered the subprime crisis visible to financial markets. Credit default swaps and the ABX are traded in a specific form of market that I call 'the canonical mechanism'. Because canonical-mechanism markets are well regarded, it is easy when analysing them to slip into functionalism. Accordingly, this paper emphasizes the contested and sometimes precarious nature of canonical-mechanism markets, discussing disputes over how to standardize financial instruments, over the 'fairness' of prices and over the dependability of those prices as indicators of the economic value of financial instruments. Canonical-mechanism markets, the clashes of interests they can involve, the material ways in which prices are generated and circulated within them and their limits as generators of knowledge all need to be researched in depth.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"MacKenzie, D (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Chrystal Macmillan Bldg, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland.",D.MacKenzie@ed.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/G038481/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G038481/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,23,26,29,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This value is expressed as Economic Value Added in conjunction with business science. Firstly, the theoretical analysis of separate parts of EVA is carried out and the influence of CSR on EVA is discussed. Mostly the neutral or negative effect is deducted and only one possibility of positive effect is identified, namely in the possibility of using CSR to increase the firm's revenues. This could be realized only on condition of customers' altruism. Only altruistic customers are willing to pay higher price to help some other people. The second part of the article describes and sums up our own experiment on altruism testing. We modified the standard one-round design of the Dictator Game in three ways: firstly, more rounds are played, secondly, we differentiate stable and unstable pairs of players and thirdly, we differentiate certain and uncertain ends of the game. According to the second and third points we have obtained four different experimental sessions. We used standard methods of experimental economics as regards the instructions and subjects' motivation. Each session was played twice so that one hundred and sixty students could participate on this experiment. More than three thousand figures were acquired. Then the three hypotheses of altruistic or egoistic behavior were tested. The ANOVA, the sign test, and the paired t-test were carried out. The egoistic behavior was confirmed twice and one time we could not confirm either egoistic or altruistic behavior of experimental subjects.

Demonopolisation of public service production and the alternative service delivering arrangements in public sector can be marked as the one of conditions of such decision. Outsourcing services in public sector with is one of the most prevalent types of the alternative service delivering arrangements. To put outsourcing in perspective, it is necessary to consider pros and cons of internal and external forms of delivery. Concerning the positive potential of outsourcing, the relevant literature proposes that outsourcing may, but need not, improve individual choice, cost-effectiveness and the quality of delivery, equity and to some extend also expenditure control. On the other hand, many authors provide important arguments describing weak points of outsourcing and some risks connected with outsourcing services in public sector. The main reason, why outsourcing does not produce the expected results and even creates perverse effects in effectiveness and quality of outsourced services, is the improper implementation of contract management. This paper seeks to answer the question what factors account for success in outsourcing services in public sector by developing a explanatory model of outsourcing performance dependent on selected factor connected with contract management such as competition, ex ante evaluation of external supplier, contract monitoring, contract duration, contract payment and test it empirically.

Only in recent years, literature on social and economic development has emphasized increasingly the process of human development. Moving away from the identification of development with statistics on economic growth, this approach stresses the necessity to place human beings at the centre of development. The Human Development Index (HDI) is used now as a reliable indicator of human development [1]. Without sustainability, human development is not true human development. If human development means enabling people to lead long, healthy and educated, then sustainable human development is about making sure that future generations can do the same. The theoretical foundation of human development is the theory of human capital. This theory needs rethink in accordance with current situation. Human capital is the main recourse of the global knowledge-based economy, and it is created by education. Thus, the concept content of education should answer the purposes of development.","[Sudova, Tatjana] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,,s_tl@mail.ru,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,13,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,675,681,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100061,0

This paper is based on the historical data of CSI 300 index in Chinese stock market and combines the portfolio insurance strategies with the life insurance investment. The analysis focuses on the effects of Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI), Time Invariant Portfolio Protection (TIPP) and Constant Mix Strategy (CM) on the investment performance. The results indicate that: In downside stock market, CM strategy is preferred with the small income of premium; TIPP with a higher cushion should be chosen with the large income of premium. In upside stock market, CPPI is preferred regardless the income of premium.

The State had been spatially transformed during the Celtic Tiger era with (sub) urban sprawl, fuelled by Ireland's chronic car dependency, a feature of everyday life. Commuting to and from work increased noise and air pollution, traffic congestion and contributed considerably to carbon emissions augmenting globally negative anthropogenic climate change. In an apparent shift in transport policy, the government published Smarter Travel in 2007 where more environmentally sustainable modes of transport, such as walking, cycling and public transport, were encouraged to combat the country's unusually high levels of car dependency. An essential feature of the Smarter Travel initiative was telework (e-Working). Working from home has the potential to reduce, or eliminate, the daily commute to and from work and was regarded by policymakers as a crucial element in reducing Ireland's unsustainable patterns of mobility whilst continuing the pursuit of unhindered economic growth. However, telework remains marginalised in business terms and lacks the regulation and guidelines essential to legitimise it for employers and employees that wish to work from home. A neo-liberal approach to the practice adopted by policymakers is evident and in the absence of legislation employers retain sole discretionary decision making powers over telework schemes and home working conditions. Indeed, many key decision makers fail to appreciate or recognise the potential benefits that may accrue from telework, which is leading to ad hoc and disorganised arrangements to the detriment of this method of working. Telework appears destined to fail even before it has been given a chance to shine as an economic, social and environmental tool of sustainability.","Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Hynes, M (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.",mike@mikehynes.ie,"Hynes, Mike/U-8472-2017","Hynes, Mike/0000-0001-9160-1693",,,,,77,28,35,2,70,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We examine the behaviour of Spanish appellate courts in the context of motor liability insurance and pay particular attention to four characterising features. Specifically, we investigate (1) how the appellate court interprets the rules for updating the financial compensation when the courts' ruling is made in a different year to that in which the motor accident occurred; (2) the response of the appellate court when its legal medical evaluation differs from the court's decision; (3) whether the appellate court modifies the criteria when the insurance company was not charged with interest for delaying payment in the first instance; (4) whether the fault allocated by trial courts is revised by the appellate court. We apply a multi-categorical selection mechanism to deal with samples that are potentially non-random. This allows us to separately consider the characteristics of victim's and the insurer's decisions to appeal. The results indicate that disputing agents have significantly different appeal functions, where insurers show a more effective and consistent behaviour than victims.","[Santolino, Miguel] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr, Riskctr IREA, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Soederberg, Magnus] Mines ParisTech, CERNA, F-75006 Paris, France",University of Barcelona; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Santolino, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr, Riskctr IREA, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",msantolino@ub.edu; magnus.soderberg@mines-paristech.fr,"SANTOLINO, MIGUEL/AAL-5858-2021; SANTOLINO, MIGUEL/G-3984-2014","SANTOLINO, MIGUEL/0000-0002-0286-3673; Soderberg, Magnus/0000-0002-9931-6624",,,,,31,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This was also the case for Ugandan wage employees during the 1990s, a period of abrupt trade opening, market reforms and improved relations with neighbouring Kenya. As in other unskilled labour abundant countries, this is a surprising result in light of the standard Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) framework. By using a novel district-level analysis, I find that in fact increased trade reduced wage inequality in line with the H-O predictions. During the 1990s districts more exposed to the trade boom experienced a rise in wage premia 2.8 percentage points lower relative to less-exposed districts. On the other hand, the intensification of domestic trade across districts and the increase in average education were associated with increased wage premia during the period of analysis.","World Bank, Int Trade Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Calì, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Int Trade Dept, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mcali@worldbank.org,,,,,,,53,5,5,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The 'traditional' sources of location advantages (i.e. agglomeration economies, market access and labour market conditions) are considered together with innovation and socio-institutional drivers of investments, captured by means of regional 'social filter' conditions. This makes it possible to empirically assess the different role played by such advantages in the location decision of investments at different stages of the value chain and disentangle the differential role of national vs. regional factors. The empirical analysis covers the EU-25 regions and suggests that regional socio-economic conditions are crucially important for the location decisions of investments in the most sophisticated knowledge-intensive stages of the value chain.","[Crescenzi, Riccardo] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Pietrobelli, Carlo] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Pietrobelli, Carlo] Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy; [Rabellotti, Roberta] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Inter-American Development Bank; Roma Tre University; University of Pavia,"Crescenzi, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.crescenzi@lse.ac.uk,"Pietrobelli, Carlo/O-1938-2017; Crescenzi, Riccardo/F-9165-2014; Rabellotti, Roberta/AAX-1086-2020","Pietrobelli, Carlo/0000-0002-3989-8642; Rabellotti, Roberta/0000-0001-7637-3645; Crescenzi, Riccardo/0000-0003-0465-9796",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,83,99,102,7,114,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This paper presents a study into attitudes and perceptions of long distance travel in the UK, particularly in relation to HSR. A questionnaire was developed to investigate attitudes to travelling long distances and to HSR, importance of journey characteristics and current travel behaviours. A factor analysis of 46 attitude items yielded six factors: travel security, improvement to road and air, prestige of HSR, comfort, negative aspects of HSR and the usefulness of travel time. Analyses showed significant demographic and travel characteristic differences across the factors. There was also evidence of a more negative impact and lower prestige for people living closer to proposed HSR routes. Willingness to pay for travel time saved was related to a number of journey characteristics but the utility of time was also important. The findings are considered in light of theories of attitude change, attitudes to travel and sustainability and the implications for the future development of HSR policy, particularly in terms of balancing increased fares with utility of travel time.

The case draws attention to how issues of institutional context can frustrate collaboration and limit the scope of learning; simultaneously, it illustrates interventions that permitted the negotiation between situated and context-specific understandings on the one hand and the development of shared understandings and common conventions for action within the industry on the other.

Ramsey prices are optimal for airports with cost recovery problems, but are inefficient for busy airports. If so then it is interesting to check if current charges are close to the optimal one, and if not then why and by how much do they differ? A menu of landing fees for five German airports using a Ramsey pricing setup is calculated. The paper concentrates on fees for different distances and three types of aircrafts. A new approach of estimating marginal cost for different aircrafts is used. The calculated fees are compared with the actual fees charged by these airports. We compare the actual fees with the calculated Ramsey prices and explain the difference on the basis of different factors. We find a clear monotone dependence: Ramsey prices increase with distance and MTOW faster than the real fees, especially in the short-distance markets, but the difference between theoretical optimum and practice needs to be better understood. Based on the current calculation we suggest some policy implications both concerning our current results and the possible improvements of the regulation of uncongested airports.

This paper uses a unique dataset, which tracks the labour market position of a cohort of unemployment benefit claimants for almost two years, to evaluate the impact of a range of government sponsored training courses in Ireland. Overall, we found that those who participated in training were less likely to be unemployed at the end of the two year study period. However, the average effect of training varied by the type and duration of training received. We found strong positive effects for job search skills training and medium to high level skills courses, a more modest positive effect for general vocational skills programmes (which are not strongly linked to demand in the labour market) and less consistent effects with respect to low level skills training. We also found that training episodes with lower duration had a more positive impact, with the exception of high level skills training programmes where longer training durations appear more effective. We ensure the robustness of our results by employing propensity score matching to reduce the impact of non-random assignment of programme participants, and estimate generalised propensity scores to estimate dose response functions.","[McGuinness, Seamus; Kelly, Elish] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [McGuinness, Seamus; Kelly, Elish] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [McGuinness, Seamus] Flinders Univ S Australia, Natl Inst Labour Studies, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [McGuinness, Seamus] IZA Inst Study Lab, Bonn, Germany; [O'Connell, Philip J.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; Flinders University South Australia; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University College Dublin,"McGuinness, S (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",,,"Kelly, Elish/0000-0001-7035-2392; mcguinness, seamus/0000-0003-1729-3017",,,,,36,11,11,1,13,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Generally speaking, the bunkering port selection problem is solved by utilizing ship planning software. However, this can only work optimally when ship arrivals can be forecasted rather accurately, and its primary limitation is that it ignores unforeseen circumstances in actual operations. There are as yet no fixed rules for bunkering port selection. To address this, the paper develops a benchmarking framework that evaluates bunkering ports' performances with in regular liner routes in order to choose optimal ones. Bunkering port selection is typically a multi-criteria group decision problem, and in many practical situations, decision makers cannot form proper judgments using incomplete and uncertain information in an environment with exact and crisp values; thus, fuzzy numbers are proposed in this paper. A hybrid Fuzzy-Delphi-TOPSIS based methodology that divides the benchmarking into three stages is employed to support the entire framework. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed. The proposed framework can enable decision makers to better understand the complex relationships of the relevant key performance factors and assist managers in comprehending the present strengths and weaknesses of their strategies.

In these situations, liability gives rise to multiple equilibria, some of them inefficient. We analyze possible solutions to the multiple equilibria problem including precaution costs liability and regulation. Notably, we show that in a dynamic setting punitive damages do not eliminate the inefficient equilibrium, but make its attainment less likely; we thus provide a novel justification for punitive damages which is consistent with legal doctrine and practice. Our analysis illustrates the importance of compensating victims, when feasible, rather than merely burdening injurers, for efficiency purposes. This suggests that common theoretical conclusions on accuracy in assessing damages and on decoupling damages and compensation, which leave victims only partially compensated, may not apply.

We then show that the current practice of market definition in two-sided markets is only in part consistent with the above suggestions. Divergence between our suggestions and practice is due to the failure to fully incorporate the lessons from the economic theory of two-sided markets, to the desire to be consistent with previous practice, and to the higher data requirements and the higher complexity of empirical analysis in cases involving two-sided platforms.

A careful examination of the concerns put forward by Massey finds that several of Massey's are incorrect, invalid, or confused, accepts that sometimes Massey's concerns reflect legitimate differences in view, and demonstrates that in the one case where Massey points out an error, this error did not materially change the finding in the relevant case.

We detect few hidden earnings in most foreign-owned firms and larger firms, especially state-owned enterprises in heavily regulated industries. The same empirical strategy indicates that up to 80 percent of earnings of car owners in the private sector are hidden, especially in smaller companies and industries such as trade and services, where cash flows are easier to manipulate. We also find considerable hidden earnings in government services. Our approach sheds new light on the decline in the gross domestic product (GDP) in Russia after the collapse of communism and subsequent recovery; in particular, we argue that a good deal of these changes might represent changes in income reporting rather than actual changes in GDP.","[Braguinsky, Serguey] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Mityakov, Sergey] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA; [Liscovich, Andrey] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Clemson University; Harvard University,"Braguinsky, S (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,"Braguinsky, Serguey/S-3712-2019","Braguinsky, Serguey/0000-0003-3977-7848",,,,,36,20,22,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

I show that a change in the timing of payments through the use of roster bonuses leads to contractual renegotiation and termination earlier in the off-season. This change in renegotiation incentives has quantitatively important consequences for players' compensation and allocations. Players are willing to forgo approximately $260,000 for a contract with modified renegotiation incentives. Moreover, players who are terminated earlier sign more valuable subsequent contracts and rematch with other teams more frequently. These predictions are consistent with a model in which players in the NFL are subject to contractual holdup. Designing renegotiation incentives through an altered timing of payments-the roster bonus-ameliorates this problem, which substantially increases ex post transfers of players and changes player allocations.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Matvos, G (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,26,3,3,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Our approach utilises many output gap measures to construct ensemble nowcasts for inflation using a linear opinion pool. The predictive densities for the latent output gap utilise weights based on the ability of each specification to provide accurate probabilistic forecasts of inflation. In an application based on US real-time data, nowcasting over the out-of-sample evaluation period from 1991q2 to 2010q1, we demonstrate that a system of bivariate VARs produces well-calibrated ensemble densities for inflation, in contrast to univariate autoregressive benchmarks. The implied nowcast densities for the output gap are multimodal and indicate a considerable degree of uncertainty. For example, we assess the probability of a negative output gap at around 45% between 2004 and 2007. Despite the Greenspan policy regime, there still remained a substantial risk that the nowcast for output was below potential in real time. We extend our methodology to include distinct output gap measures, based on alternative Filters, and show that, in our application, the nowcast density for the output gap is sensitive to the detrending method.

Focusing on acquisitions, we claim that the location of the target firm influences the MNE's ownership choice. MNEs normally execute partial acquisitions to reduce their liability of foreignness and to preserve their target's inherent competencies, particularly in highly innovative and internationally competitive sectors. However, this phenomenon occurs less frequently if target firms are located in areas that are characterized by relevant externalities, such as core cities and industrial districts. In particular, core cities allow foreign MNEs to access a variety of information and knowledge as well as other externalities that are associated with international interconnectedness; industrial districts provide MNEs with easier access to industry-specific agglomeration economies (a local pool of skilled labor, local input-output linkages, and local knowledge spillovers). These locations provide substitutes for different aspects of the target firm's competences, thus reducing an MNE's need to maintain a local partner. Empirical evidence from foreign acquisitions of local manufacturing firms that occurred in Italy during the 2001-10 period confirms these expectations.","[Mariotti, Sergio; Piscitello, Lucia; Elia, Stefano] DIG Politecn Milano, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Mariotti, S (通讯作者)，DIG Politecn Milano, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",sergio.mariotti@polimi.it; lucia.piscitello@polimi.it; stefano.elia@polimi.it,"Elia, Stefano/AAL-3182-2020","piscitello, lucia/0000-0002-4817-315X",,,,,96,18,23,1,40,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

To do so, the article unravels the much-misunderstood experiences of eight Norwegian municipalities whose investments plummeted as the subprime crisis unfolded: investments that had no immediate ties to subprime mortgage lending or mortgage-backed securities. Focusing on the processes, practices, and instruments of financialization, the article puts forward two new analytical concepts-the fetishization of the knowledge of risk and fictitious distance-to help explain how the crisis spread so quickly and extensively that it threatened not only the municipalities' investments but also the functioning of global finance as a whole. In so doing, it becomes clear that financialization has set a far more risky form of capitalism that is manifest through concrete economic geographies, from towns and cities in the United States to distant Norwegian municipalities. In the highly interconnected entanglement of geographies and finance that make up the global financial system, the fetishes and fictions of finance cannot be ignored.","[Pani, Erica] Univ London, Sch Geog, London E1 4NS, England; [Holman, Nancy] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Pani, E (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Geog, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",e.m.pani@qmul.ac.uk; n.e.holman@lse.ac.uk,,"Holman, Nancy/0000-0002-4536-5092",,,,,71,16,16,2,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

A major concern about the concentration of this industry is that firms might be able to exercise market power. However, significant efficiency gains could result from this concentration process, especially if there are economies of scale present in the industry. The welfare effect of a merger is, therefore, ambiguous. In this article, we estimate the welfare implications of a merger between two medium-sized pension fund managers in Chile. For this purpose, we estimate the size of the economies of scale in this industry and use the results to simulate the merger using a simple imperfect competition model. The estimations, based on quarterly financial information about the Chilean Pension Funds system for the last eight years, show robustly the presence of significant economies of scale in operating costs. The merger simulation indicates that, despite the cost savings, the merger would induce a small price increase. This effect reduces consumer welfare, but aggregate welfare increases because of the efficiency gains from the economies of scale. Since aggregate elasticity in this industry is zero (because affiliation is compulsory), the price increase does not generate any efficiency loss.","[Agostini, Claudio; Willington, Manuel] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Santiago, Chile; [Saavedra, Eduardo] ILADES Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Agostini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Santiago, Chile.",claudio.agostini@uai.cl; saavedra@uahurtado.cl; manuel.willington@uai.cl,"Agostini, Claudio A./HLG-7336-2023; Willington, Manuel/H-4035-2018; Willington, Manuel/ABD-8214-2020; Saavedra, Eduardo/IQS-4264-2023","Agostini, Claudio A./0000-0002-3916-1501; Willington, Manuel/0000-0002-2803-6641; Willington, Manuel/0000-0002-2803-6641; Saavedra, Eduardo/0000-0002-2842-2526",,,,,19,1,1,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The question of precisely how to regulate the payday loan industry creates a number of difficult challenges for the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Whereas most consumer advocates would prefer to ban or strictly limit high cost payday lending activity and address unfair/abusive lending practices, the CFPB must also be attentive to the impact of regulation on credit access for low-wage, credit-constrained payday borrowers. This article highlights the policy, legal, and institutional issues raised during the CFPB's decision-making process. The CFPB has the opportunity to dramatically shift the longstanding consumer protection paradigm in favor of real-world protection of vulnerable borrowers and, thereby, to realize the hopes of the activists who helped to bring the Bureau into existence.","[Mayer, Robert N.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Silber, Norman I.] Hofstra Univ, Maurice A Deane Sch Law, Hempstead, NY 11550 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Hofstra University,,larrykirsch@earthlink.net; robert.mayer@fcs.utah.edu; norman.i.silber@hofstra.edu,,,,,,,47,3,6,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

We examine the theoretical basis for this criterion by extending existing models so that a subset of firms innovates and participates in an R&D cooperation agreement. We show that the incentive to increase innovation depends on a complex set of effects. We identify one, the outsider effect, that can lead firms to increase R&D under cooperation precisely when their combined market share is high. In a general model in which all firms innovate, we also find that R&D agreements can be more beneficial at higher market shares. We argue that existing theory therefore does not support limiting the exemption to low market shares. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

It has been assumed that measures of regional patenting activity or human capital are an adequate way to capture the endogenous creation of new ideas that result in productivity improvements. This process has been conceived as occurring in two stages. First, an invention or innovation is generated, and then it is developed and commercialized to create benefits for the individual or firm owning the idea. Typically these steps are combined into a single model of the invention in/productivity out variety. Using data on Gross Metropolitan Product per worker and on inventors, educational attainment, and creative workers (together with other important socioeconomic controls), we unpack the model back to the two-step process and use a SEM modeling framework to investigate the relationships among inventive activity and potential inventors, regional technology levels, and regional productivity outcomes. Our results show almost no significant direct relationship between invention and productivity, except through technology. Clearly, the simplification of the invention in/productivity out model does not hold, which supports other work that questions the use of patents and patenting related measures as meaningful innovation inputs to processes that generate regional productivity and productivity gains. We also find that the most effective measure of regional inventive capacity, in terms of its effect on technology, productivity, and productivity growth is the share of the workforce engaged in creative activities.","[Lobo, Jose] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Mellander, Charlotta] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Econ, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Stolarick, Kevin] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Martin Prosper Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Strumsky, Deborah] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Jonkoping University; University of Toronto; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Mellander, C (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Econ, Box 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",charlotta.mellander@jibs.hj.se,"Strumsky, Deborah A/HSE-8706-2023",,,,,,42,10,11,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The focus on regional development neglects the individual differences in success among members in the creative class and among firms within creative industries. We study firm founders in three design sectors (industrial design, graphic design and web design) and analyse the determinants of their personal income. Next to individual factors affecting income differences among designers, we look at the relational and spatial contexts in which designers operate. Hence, we can also assess whether spatial clustering and organisational networking are beneficial for designers. The main result, based on 200 telephonic questionnaires, holds that income is determined mainly by business experience and the use of advanced Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), while education and spatial clustering have no impact. We argue that policies in the design sector should be oriented towards helping young designers to gain experience as well as towards life-long learning in the use of ICTs.","[Vankan, Arthur] Dial Innovatie & Interactie, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Frenken, Koen] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Castaldi, Carolina] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Innovat Sci, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Castaldi, C (通讯作者)，Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Innovat Sci, Postbus 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",c.castaldi@tue.nl,"Castaldi, Carolina/Q-2128-2018; Frenken, Koen/C-4486-2017","Castaldi, Carolina/0000-0001-5747-6788; Frenken, Koen/0000-0003-4731-0201",,,,,48,4,4,1,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Two successful farmer organizations, one of them farming in both seasons (throughout the year), and the other farming only a single season per year, were selected for the study. Overall objective of the study was to examine the impact of group interactions on entrepreneurial behaviour of vegetable farmers. Stratified random sampling was used to select an overall sample of 60 vegetable farmers, having two samples consisting of 30 each from the two farmer organizations. Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted using the SPSS software package. Results indicated a significant relationship between the group interactions and entrepreneurial behaviour of farmers. Study revealed effective entrepreneurial behaviour involving high planning ability, and decision making ability Majority of the farmers were at a moderate level of innovativeness, risk orientation, coordinating ability, opportunity seeking behaviour, self-confidence, achievement motivation, and cosmopolitanism. Group interactions were moderate at seasonal planning, and in selecting of crops. Group interactions were low in land preparation, pest and disease controlling, harvesting, irrigation water distribution, participating in training programmes, and selling. Entrepreneurial behaviour of farmers has enhanced with group interactions. The two farmer groups had significant differences in group interactions and entrepreneurial behaviour due to group characteristics.

On this basis, we propose some specific countermeasures to promote concrete countermeasures of promoting Nanjing's talent advantage into economic advantage from the government level, innovation and entrepreneurship level, enterprise level, talent system and mechanism level. The research results not only provide the reference for economic coordinated development of Nanjing and other cities, but also enrich and deepen regional talent and regional economic coordinated development in theory and practice.","[Chen Shuangshuang; Zhao Yongle] Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China; [Chen Shuangshuang] Hohai Univ, Wentian Coll, Nanjing 243031, Peoples R China",Hohai University; Hohai University,"Chen, SS (通讯作者)，Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China.",brenda1981@163.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,DOCKLAND,"7 POINT PARK CRESCENT, DOCKLAND, VIC 3008, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9924140-8-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,697,705,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2MF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358894900113,0

A good infrastructure for the consultation of, and for the discussion between these stakeholders is needed in order to avoid high implementation costs. Following the theory of new institutional economics these implementation costs can be seen as transaction costs. This is especially relevant in Government-to-Business (G2B) and Government-to-Consumers (G2C) relationships where the projects and policy measures bring about (re) distribution problems. This chapter discusses various ways to organize these consultations with the help of experts as intermediaries, so that a compromise agreement is reached on the solution of the (re) distribution problem. These institutionalized structures of consultation are referred to as matching zones. Practical experiences, mainly from the Netherlands, provide guidelines for the effective institutional setup of such matching zones. Specifically, the design of a matching zone should try to adhere to the following principles: (i) there should be a common interest and ample incentives for reaching an agreement; (ii) there should be the prospect of long, repeated interaction; (iii) there should be a balance between representation and efficiency; (iv) the constraints should be clear from the onset of the matching zone; (v) fairness should be strived for; (vi) IC technology should be utilized optimally; and (viii) informal contacts and an amicable atmosphere should be promoted. Most importantly, however, independent experts appear to fulfil an important role in order to reach compromise agreements at sufficiently low implementation costs.","[den Butter, Frank A.

In the developing countries there are yet in practice traditional local systems of helping the other in the case of natural disasters. The transition to an organized system, based on buying insurance policies, is a very slow process and is, for the moment, used and accepted only by big land owners. The study based on a sample of 308 small farmers in Romania analyzes the factors influencing the decision of buying an insurance policy: age, education, size of the village, the proximity to a city, the type of culture, etc. The sampling method aimed at ensuring representativity on several levels: regional villages from different counties; education different levels of education for farmers and different fields of study; type of village villages of different sizes and situated at various distances from towns; type of crop farmers that mainly deal with vegetables, pomiculture, vine and field crops. Through two econometric models, Ordered Logit and Binary Logit, both the decision of buying an insurance policy and the type of insurance chosen (partial or full) are assessed. Results show a higher propensity towards using the insurance system in the case of younger farmers who have had access to tertiary education (especially in the field of economics and business), who live in big villages near important cities and who cultivate vegetables. Even though the study is regional, the emphasized mechanisms are universally valid and can be used by policymakers from developing economies.","[Dragos, Simona Laura] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Mare, Codruta] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Stat Forecasting Math, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Dragos, SL (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",simona.dragos@econ.ubbcluj.ro; codruta.mare@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Mare, Codruta/ADC-6680-2022; MARE, Codruta/AAZ-9390-2020; Dragos, Simona Laura/B-4689-2016","Mare, Codruta/0000-0002-4920-7462; MARE, Codruta/0000-0002-4920-7462; Dragos, Simona Laura/0000-0002-3037-3401",,,,,37,4,4,1,18,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Innovation cooperation is recognized as a driver of its potential side (PAC). Considering different forms of proximity, we expect to find a higher impact for interactions occurring between close partners. Human capital (HC) is expected to be as important as other organizational mechanisms for the innovation impact of PAC. An empirical application with Community Innovation Survey data confirms these arguments only partially. The firm's cooperation with geographically closer partners (i.e., in the same country) increases its PAC, but it is cooperation with institutionally distant ones (e.g., research organizations) that augments it. Among the integration mechanisms of external knowledge, those increasing the firm's HC are the only ones that positively moderate the innovation impact of PAC.","[Franco, Chiara; Marzucchi, Alberto] Catholic Univ Milan, Dept Int Econ Inst & Dev DISEIS, Milan, Italy; [Marzucchi, Alberto] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, INGENIO, E-46071 Valencia, Spain; [Montresor, Sandro] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Montresor, Sandro] European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville, Spain",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Bologna; European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Montresor, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",sandro.montresor@unibo.it,"Montresor, Sandro/K-1833-2019","Marzucchi, Alberto/0000-0002-4161-8734; Franco, Chiara/0000-0001-6500-9389; montresor, sandro/0000-0002-1195-901X",,,,,60,22,22,0,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

China was able to create a respectable stock market from scratch in the early 1990s, and its performance has been characterised by better behaviour, when compared with other transition economies, regarding market fundraising capacity, liquidity and capitalisation levels. China's stock market capitalisation has become the second largest in the Asian region, after Japan. Due to the prominent role of the Chinese economy and the continuous development of both its stock market and financial system, this study focuses on understanding the effects of the global financial crisis on China's mainland stock market. Our analysis looks at contagion and/or spillover effects originating in the US stock market to understand how they impacted on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. We look to identify whether the Shanghai Stock Exchange is affected by global shocks or whether it is more prone to regional shock waves emanating from major local markets. Regional analysis focuses its attention on the Hong Kong and Singapore stock exchanges, well-established markets in the region with strong connections to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Using the extended Forbes and Rigobon (2002) contagion methodology, this research finds significant evidence supporting the existence of spillover effects in the Asian stock market derived from the US. Nevertheless, our findings do not justify the existence of contagion effects running from the US or from the regional markets. Instead, the Hong Kong and Singapore stock markets appeared to be the ones affected by regional contagion effects. We also found that the Chinese stock market made a quick recovery after the global financial crisis, which could have contributed to the enhancement of contagion effects in the regional markets.","[Kong, Su Qian] Dublin Inst Technol, Coll Business, Financial Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Kong, Su Qian] Dublin Inst Technol, Coll Business, Econometr, Dublin, Ireland; [Morales, Lucia] Dublin Inst Technol, Finance, Dublin, Ireland",Technological University Dublin; Technological University Dublin; Technological University Dublin,"Kong, SQ (通讯作者)，Dublin Inst Technol, Coll Business, Financial Econ, Dublin, Ireland.",,"Morales, Lucia/ABB-2312-2021; Coughlan, Joseph/O-5610-2019","Morales, Lucia/0000-0002-9111-813X; Coughlan, Joseph/0000-0003-3092-2869",,,,,27,0,0,0,5,CHANDOS PUBL,SAWSTON,"80 HIGH ST, SAWSTON, CAMBRIDGE CB22 3HJ, ENGLAND",2052-2126,,978-1-78063-449-4; 978-1-84334-768-2,CHANDOS ASIAN STUD,,,2014,,,,,,,169,188,,,,,,20,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6UP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354492600009,0

Recent work has focussed on the importance of the quality of education while others have argued that the rigidity of the labour market constrains employment growth. This paper considers the spatial aspects of the day labour market and argues that the size and proximity of economic activity found in agglomerations ensure a thick labour market that allows for better matching between workers and jobs. The results indicate that the day labourers who were hired by the same employer more often received higher earnings. Once workers have a matric qualification they receive earnings above the average, as do workers who have completed vocational training.

In the article on the basis of the literature, the essence and the genesis of this concept has been shown, as well as a Polish SRI market was presented in a synthetic way. The article attempts to determine the effectiveness of socially responsible investment on the example of SRI funds. The analysis includes the following investments funds: Inwestor Zmian Klimatycznych, PZU Energia Medycyna Ekologia, SKOK FIO Etyczny 1, SKOK FIO Etyczny 2, PKO Biotechnologii i Innowacji Globalny and one pension fund - OFE Pocztylion. On the basis of the literature review it can be said that Poland is in the initial phase of development of socially responsible investment. The reason for the low demand for this type of investment may be insufficient knowledge of investors on this topic. What is needed then is a broad-based information campaign on SRI among individual and institutional investors. From the thoroughgoing analysis of the literature in the article, an unambiguous conclusions about the effectiveness of socially responsible investment can not be drawn. The reason for divergence of the results can be, for example, different investment time horizon, the atmosphere prevailing in the market during the period, or a variety of industry sectors.

This process, called reshoring, has recently started to gain some consistency. The trend is most notable in the sphere of production. In terms of business and IT services we cannot yet speak of a tangible start of the reshoring phenomenon, as it does in the sphere of production. Nevertheless we can see a slowdown in the offshoring of services and the emergence of new strategies in the field. Reshoring or quitting offshoring or outsourcing may be promising for Western economies, but they have to be stimulated by policies concerning the labor market or the educational system.","[Margulescu, Serghei; Margulescu, Elena] Nicolae Titulescu Univ Bucharest, Fac Econ Sci, Bucharest, Romania",,"Margulescu, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nicolae Titulescu Bucuresti, Calea Vacaresti 185,Sect 4, Bucharest, Romania.",margulescu@univnt.ro,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,UNIV PALACKEHO V OLOMOUCI,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87533-07-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,451,457,,,,,,7,Communication; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Communication; Business & Economics,BO0QO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000492971100046,0

Authors illustrate this finding through a comparison of the poverty and education levels of a selected minority group from each country in relation to the health outcomes for each population group. We found similarities between Slovakia and the United States in terms of inequities relative to education, income and social behavioral factors when comparing two significant minority populations to the respective non-minority populations of their respective countries.

This article will focus on the presentation and comparison of these theoretical approaches to international migration: neoclassical theory, the new economics of migration, dual labor market theory, world systems.","[Pogany, Tomas] Ekonomicka Univ Bratislave, Narodohospodarska Fak, Katedra Socialneho Rozvoja Prace, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Pogány, T (通讯作者)，Ekonomicka Univ Bratislave, Narodohospodarska Fak, Katedra Socialneho Rozvoja Prace, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",tomas.pogany@hotmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,1,2,UNIV PALACKEHO V OLOMOUCI,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87533-07-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,627,634,,,,,,8,Communication; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Communication; Business & Economics,BO0QO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000492971100064,0

The economic individualisation, migration and cultural fragmentation hold a devastating impact upon the living environment, namely significant growth of anonymity, distrust and discontent. As effect of those realities, the governments are searching responses to these processes of social liquefaction. Taking into consideration the fact that that the governance tools based on authority, hierarchy and bureaucracy are becoming useless due to the lack of effectiveness and legitimacy, we witness the emergence of new modes of public governance, in light to reconfigure solid ground, adequate for interventions. The design of a new type of governance should take into consideration its dual character. One component aims accountable community, as the traditional society has demonstrated that it is not able to generate spontaneously neither trust nor social capital. The second component is focused on identifying those strategies providing that accountability should be taken jointly by the public authorities and the other actors such as companies, third sector organisations and citizens. The accomplishment of such a model means to overcome several challenges. On the one hand, are the members of the community aware of the importance of their commitment? Are they truly motivated to participate in such a structure? On the other hand, how prepared are the political representatives and public authorities to accept cooperation with various categories of actors at community level? The space of strategic responsiveness introduced by the current research provides a possible scenario for responding to the above questions. Additionally, the research attempts to provide an answer to a special question, namely: how prepared is the Romanian actual society to adopt such a space in view to develop new perceptions on objectives, new modalities of analysis, innovative measures, aiming to provide an institutional response on liquefaction of modern social life. The research methodology will comprise bibliographic syntheses, comparative studies as well as social empirical researches.","Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Popescu, LG (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,7,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,14,25,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100001,0

The paper reveals the benefit of the use of the proposed model for corporate strategic changes. Greater possibilities are created to rationalise the process of corporate strategic changes and the use as well as development of human, material and financial potentials, which lead to greater competitiveness of an enterprise. The model guides to directions and actions to be taken in order to continue increasing effectiveness of an enterprise in the context of climate change objectives. The evaluation model suggested by the author is also analysed according to flexibility of proposed techniques, the characteristics of which can be modified and adjusted depending on specifics of the changing business environment.

Gaps in evaluations and a discussion based on an ethical perspective,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Safety; Indicators; Ethics; CBA,COSTS,"This paper discusses indicators (outcomes) that express road transport safety effects from an ethical perspective. Based on a review of policy documents and Cost-Benefit Analyses (CBAs) we conclude that safety levels are generally expressed in terms of fatalities or (seriously) injured people, either in absolute numbers or on a per capita or per kilometre basis. These indicators are very important but not complete. Not including at least the avoidance costs related to behavioural changes leads to an underestimation of the safety costs and the benefits of policies to improve safety. In addition the utilitarian approach of a CBA does not fully reflect the ethical dimensions of safety. If people adapt their behaviour because of perceived safety, freedom of movement may be at stake.

Based on the assumption that many volatility predictors are available to help forecast the volatility of a target variable, this study shows how to construct a covariate from these predictors and plug it into the GARCH(1,1) model. This study presents a method of building a covariate such that the covariate contains the maximum possible amount of predictor information of the predictors for forecasting volatility. The loading of the covariate constructed by the proposed method is simply the eigenvector of a matrix. The proposed method enjoys the advantages of easy implementation and interpretation. Simulations and empirical analysis verify that the proposed method performs better than other methods for forecasting the volatility, and the results are quite robust to model misspecification. Specifically, the proposed method reduces the mean square error of the GARCH(1,1) model by 30% for forecasting the volatility of S&P 500 Index. The proposed method is also useful in improving the volatility forecasting of several GARCH-family models and for forecasting the value-at-risk.

Existing methodologies to model credit rating migrations conditional on the business cycle suffer from poor accuracy, difficult readability, or model inconsistencies. The modeling methodology proposed in this paper extends ordinal logistic regression to estimate the complete migration matrix including default rates as a function of rating dynamics and macroeconomic indicators. The gradient and Hessian derivations show efficient optimization within the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The proposed modeling methodology is applied to model corporate rating migrations using historical data from 1984 to 2011. It is shown that the resulting model captures the cyclical behavior of credit rating migrations and default rates, and is able to approximate historic migration levels with good precision. The model therefore permits analysis of the impact of economical downturn conditions on a credit portfolio.

The trade in longevity risk is underpinned by accurate forecasting of mortality rates. Using techniques from macroeconomic forecasting we propose a dynamic factor model of mortality that fits and forecasts age-specific mortality rates parsimoniously. We compare the forecasting quality of this model against the Lee-Carter model and its variants. Our results show the dynamic factor model generally provides superior forecasts when applied to international mortality data. We also show that existing multifactorial models have superior fit but their forecasting performance worsens as more factors are added.

However there is scant, if any, research about the actual experience of new travel behaviours and their potential importance. Yet research in psychology has shown first impressions to be integral to all attitude development due to a phenomenon referred to as the 'primacy effect'. However the 'primacy effect' concept has never been explored in the context of urban transit, one of the key modes targeted for individuals to use in place of cars. This paper explores the experience of unfamiliar travel and its potential importance by comparing first trip experiences (which in this study context refers to individuals' first time using public transport to travel to a university campus) with perceptions of overall trip experiences through a university access survey. The results show that unfamiliar travel by transit tended to be more negative experience than familiar travel. 'Ease of navigation' (wayfinding), 'emotional state', 'ease of navigating transfer', and 'ease of ticketing' were particularly negative aspects of first trips. Unfamiliar travel was found to be significantly correlated with overall ratings of transit suggesting a strong basis for the 'primacy effect' in public transport. Results also suggest that first trip experiences are significantly correlated with subsequent transit usage but only for 'choice travellers' i.e. those with access to a car and not for 'captive' transit users. This is a novel research area with important implications for travel behaviour and user attitude research. Suggestions are offered for future research and practical applications for transport practitioners and organisations with an interest in reducing automobile reliance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These were years in which fee payment depended primarily on an honour system rather than on enforcement. Seventy-four per cent of ethicist participants and 76% of non-ethicist participants appear to have paid their meeting registration fees: not a statistically significant difference. This finding of no difference survives scrutiny for several possible confounds. Thus, professional ethicists seem no less likely to free-ride in this context than do philosophers not specializing in ethics. These data fit with other recent findings suggesting that on average professional ethicists behave no morally better than do professors not specializing in ethics.","Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Schwitzgebel, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",eric.schwitzgebel@ucr.edu,"Schwitzgebel, Eric/HHS-7162-2022",,,,,,18,7,8,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

We take into account the asymmetric characteristic of exchange rate fluctuations and use the dynamic panel threshold model in order to select gold prices in major gold-related currencies in the world: the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the euro, the Indian rupee, the Japanese yen, the South African rand, and the British pound. Using monthly data from January 1999 to January 2010, with lagged one-period exchange rate returns (US dollar depreciation rate) as the threshold variable, the estimation results suggest that there are two thresholds at -7.5% and -3.7%. These can be divided into regime 1 (exchange rate returns <= -7.5%), regime 2 (-7.5% < exchange rate returns <= -3.7%), and regime 3 (exchange rate returns > -3.7%). Regarding the effectiveness of gold hedging, regime 2 is higher than is regime 3. The risk hedging effect of regime 1 is not significant because it might be caused by the excessive devaluation of the US dollar in the short-term and the overshooting of the exchange rate adjustment, making gold unable to hedge the devaluation risks of the US dollar.","Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan",,"Wang, KM (通讯作者)，Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan.",wkminn@ocu.edu.tw,"Wang, Kuan Min/H-5247-2019","Wang, Kuan Min/0000-0002-0237-0596",,,,,30,15,15,0,20,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This regulatory setting allows us to observe the disciplining effect of legal enforcement on stockholder behavior. We find that minority stockholders reject about one out of ten freezeout offers, and that rejection is more likely when the bidder has controlled the firm for quite some time before the offer. Rejected offers take on average around three years to be settled in court, and litigation costs are almost never paid by minority stockholders. The court mostly prices rejected offers above the offer price, particularly when the firm is private, when the bidder has controlled the firm for an extensive period before the offer, and when the case is large. These findings suggest that minority stockholders consider most freezeout offers commensurate with the level of legal stockholder protection as enforced by the courts. The majority stockholder tends to underestimate the legal protection of minority rights in settings where these rights are particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Nevertheless, minority stockholders who take their case to court often face years of waiting, and for a highly unpredictable litigation return. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis shows how the intra-hospital coordination mechanisms, promoted by the hospitals, as well as mechanisms outside the hospitals facilitate the national organization of transplants, making possible the collaboration and consensus required to reach the optimal results that make the Spanish model an international referent. Results show that a set of managerial elements constitute critical success factors for the system; these include the coordination competencies developed, on the one hand, by the National Transplant Organization, and on the other, by the hospital coordinators in organ donation matters.

A coalition formation protocol leads the first innovators to start the pool immediately after they patent the essential technologies. The firms invest more than in the no-pool case and increase the speed of R&D for essential technologies as the number of patents progresses to the anticipated endogenous pool size, to the benefit of consumers. There is overinvestment in R&D compared to a joint profit-maximization benchmark.

Authorized users are not liable for paying an account, but because of Regulation B (which implements the 1974 Equal Credit Opportunity Act), the account's history factors into their credit scores. As a result piggybacking can be used to manipulate the signal of creditworthiness that scores provide and may help borrowers obtain credit for which they would not have otherwise qualified. This article investigates the policy questions raised by piggybacking. First, we evaluate whether the credit history disparities that motivated these provisions of Regulation B have persisted since they were written. Then, we assess the potential for score improvement through piggybacking. Finally, we evaluate the likely score effects of allowing credit scoring models to exclude authorized-user accounts, the most widely proposed policy response to the emergence of piggybacking.","[Brevoort, Kenneth P.] Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Washington, DC 20552 USA; [Canner, Glenn B.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Brevoort, KP (通讯作者)，Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Washington, DC 20552 USA.",kenneth.brevoort@cfpb.gov; robert.avery@fhfa.gov; gcanner@frb.gov,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Little is known about the causal relationship between the two decisions. It is interesting to ask if a decision on bicycle choice is made prior to the determination on a trip chain, or is dependent on the pre-determined chain pattern. This study aims to explore the relationship between the choices of bicycle and trip chain and capture the order of decision between them. Based on the survey data from a medium-sized Chinese city, the co-evolutionary approach with logit-modeling framework was estimated for the study purpose. Results show that there are more bicycle uses in the subsistence trip chains as compared to these non-subsistence ones. Considering the interaction between the two decisions improves the predicting accuracy of both bicycle choice and chain choice. In most cases, a trip chain is determined prior to a decision on bicycle choice, especially when the chain contains subsistence activities. For travelers who currently using a bicycle, most of them first decide the chain type and then choose a bicycle accordingly. Most of travelers who first determine the trip mode do not consider using a bicycle. We also estimate a model to predict the decision process of travelers. The order of decision is mainly impacted by the individual and household characteristics as well as the travel attributes. Findings of this study are discussed to assist the development of policies to promote cycling in urban areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In an empirical study of over 1,600 tickets, some sold as Paperless Ticketing tickets and others sold as conventional tickets, the price in the secondary market for the Paperless Ticketing tickets was nearly $100 higher than comparable conventional tickets sold. In addition, the quantity of Paperless Ticketing tickets available and sold in the secondary market relative to comparable conventional tickets was about 10 percent.

J,"Elvik, R",,,,"Elvik, Rune",,,Paradoxes of rationality in road safety policy,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cost-benefit analysis; Road safety policy; Rationality; Paradox; Valuation,,"Rationality is an ideal for transport safety policy. As developed within normative welfare economics, rationality denotes the efficient use of safety measures based on cost benefit analyses that include all relevant impacts of the measures. Efficiency in the technical sense of the term provides a perfectly clear and precise guideline for policy priorities. Nevertheless, some choices that are guided by cost benefit analysis may strike us as paradoxical or counterintuitive. A paradox of rationality refers to any situation in which conflicting choices can both be defended as rational. This paper discusses a number of choices that may seem paradoxical. The first involves the choice between options that have identical impacts on safety, but in which these impacts are valued differently. The second deals with the tendency for preference reversals to occur when preferences for the provision of safety are aggregated. The third discusses the inability of conventional measures of willingness-to-pay to reflect the intensity of preferences. The fourth concerns the tendency for policy choice to favour the rich at the expense of the poor when willingness-to-pay is not adjusted for the marginal utility of money. A fifth situation refers to the fact that a policy option that looks attractive ex ante may fail an ex post compensation test because utility functions depend on health state. There is a potential conflict between individual and collective rationality with respect to the costs and benefits of some road safety measures. When developing a road safety programme, a set of road safety measures whose benefits exceed the costs when considered as stand-alone measures could have benefits smaller than cost when combined in a programme consisting of all the measures. Finally, there is a potential conflict between efficiency and negotiated consensus as mechanisms of resource allocation in the public sector. The sources of the paradoxes and ways of avoiding them are discussed. Some of the paradoxes can be avoided if changes in risk are valued in terms of a fixed price per unit of risk rather than according to a non-linear demand function. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By assuming Cobb-Douglas technology and logarithmic preferences, we show that the introduction of a fertility-related component in the pay-as-you-go pension scheme may destabilise the long-term equilibrium and cause endogenous fluctuations when individuals have static expectations. The possibility of cyclical instability increases (resp. reduces) when both the subjective discount factor and relative weight of individual fertility in pay-as-you-go pensions (resp. the parents' taste for children) increase(s). Interestingly, when public pensions are contingent on the individual number of children, the financing of small-sized benefits may cause the occurrence of a flip bifurcation, two-period cycles and cycles of a higher order. In addition, we show through numerical simulations that these results hold in a more general setting with a constant inter-temporal elasticity of substitution utility function and a constant elasticity of substitution production function. Our findings identify a possible novel factor responsible for persistent deterministic fluctuations in a context of overlapping generations, while also representing a policy warning regarding the destabilising effects of fertility-related pension reforms, which are currently high in both the theoretical debate and the political agendas of several developed countries.","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Gori, Luca] Univ Genoa, Dept Law, I-16126 Genoa, Italy",University of Pisa; University of Genoa,"Gori, L (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Law, Via Balbi 30-19, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.",lfanti@ec.unipi.it; luca.gori@unige.it,,"Gori, Luca/0000-0003-1967-0840",,,,,70,17,18,0,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

During this time, Italian universities underwent a radical reform process, which granted them autonomy, and were confronted with a change in IP legislation, which introduced the professor privilege. We find that although the absolute number of academic patents has increased, (i) their weight on total patenting by domestic inventors has not, while (ii) the share of academic patents owned by universities has more than tripled. By means of a set of probit regressions, we show that the conditional probability to observe an academic patent has declined over time. We also find that the rise of university ownership is explained, significantly albeit not exclusively, by the increased autonomy of Italian universities, which has allowed them to introduce explicit IP regulations concerning their staff's inventions. The latter has effectively neutralized the introduction of the professor privilege.","[Lissoni, Francesco] Univ Bordeaux IV, GREThA, Pessac, France; [Lissoni, Francesco; Pezzoni, Michele] Univ L Bocconi, CRIOS, Milan, Italy; [Pezzoni, Michele] Univ Milano Bicocca, DEMS, Milan, Italy; [Poti, Bianca] CNR, CERIS, Rome, Italy; [Romagnosi, Sandra] Natl Agcy Evaluat Univ & Res Inst ANVUR, Rome, Italy",Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Bocconi University; University of Milano-Bicocca; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Lissoni, F (通讯作者)，Univ Montesquieu Bordeaux IV, GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",francesco.lissoni@u-bordeaux4.fr,"Lissoni, Francesco/E-3600-2012","Pezzoni, Michele/0000-0002-2255-8166; Lissoni, Francesco/0000-0002-2966-1414",,,,,56,26,31,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

J,"Chen, XJ; Zhao, JH",,,,"Chen, Xiaojie; Zhao, Jinhua",,,Bidding to drive: Car license auction policy in Shanghai and its public acceptance,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Car ownership policy; Public acceptance; Vehicle quota control; License auction; Shanghai,,"Increased automobile ownership and use in China over the last two decades has increased energy consumption, worsened air pollution, and exacerbated congestion. However, the countrywide growth in car ownership conceals great variation among cities. For example, Shanghai and Beijing each had about 2 million motor vehicles in 2004, but by 2010, Beijing had 4.8 million motor vehicles whereas Shanghai had only 3.1 million. Among the factors contributing to this divergence is Shanghai's vehicle control policy, which uses monthly license auctions to limit the number of new cars. The policy appears to be effective: in addition to dampening growth in car ownership, it generates annual revenues up to 5 billion CNY (800 million USD). But, despite these apparent successes, the degree to which the public accepts this policy is unknown. This study surveys 524 employees at nine Shanghai companies to investigate the policy acceptance of Shanghai's license auction by the working population, and the factors that contribute to that acceptance: Perceived policy effectiveness, affordability, equity concerns, and implementation. Respondents perceive the policy to be effective, but are moderately negative towards the policy nonetheless. However, they expect that others accept the policy more than they do. Respondents also hold consistently negative perceptions about the affordability of the license, the effects on equity, and the implementation process. Revenue usage is not seen as transparent, which is exacerbated by a perception that government vehicles enjoy advantages in obtaining a license, issues with the bidding process and technology, and difficulties in obtaining information about the auction policy. Nevertheless, respondents believe that license auctions and congestion charges are more effective and acceptable than parking charges and fuel taxes. To improve public acceptability of the policy, we make five recommendations: Transparency in revenue usage; transparency in government vehicle licensing and use, categorising licenses by vehicle type, implementation and technology improvements to increase bidding convenience, and policies that restrict vehicle usage in congested locations.

In this paper, we investigate a path to democracy that is very different from that typically described. During the Archaic period (800-500 BCE), many Greek poleis (city-states) replaced aristocracies with a more narrow governing institution-an autocrat known as the tyrant. Yet as classical scholars have noted, many of the poleis where tyrants reigned in the Archaic period became among the broadest democracies in the subsequent Classical period (500-323 BCE). We analyze a data set of ancient Greek political regime types and review the history of the best-known Archaic period tyrants in order to explore why a transitory narrowing of power-Greek tyranny was a transitory institution-can set the stage for democratization. We briefly consider other historical and modern examples. Our paper shows why an understanding of progress toward democracy requires recognizing the potential importance of nonmonotonic transition paths.","[Fleck, Robert K.; Hanssen, F.

Our setting is the US airline industry, where many large airlines have outsourcing relationships with smaller regional carriers. In the late 1990s, fixed price contracts began to replace revenue sharing agreements as the dominant contractual form in these relationships. Moreover, this change coincided with the diffusion and adoption of a new aircraft technology, the regional jet. We present evidence that the new aircraft technology changed the set of flights that airlines subcontracted to their regional partners and did so in a way that favored the use of fixed price rather than revenue-sharing contracts. In particular, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the new flights being subcontracted had characteristics that would have led to significant haggling costs under route-level revenue sharing.

Overall, the results of the present study are quite consistent with the original study by Aaker (1997). Nevertheless, the main difference consists in the appearance of a sixth dimension, spontaneity.

In economic geography, the regulation approach has been useful in explaining the persistence of capitalism despite its contradictory tendencies, and scholars have recently applied the regulation approach to the geography of natural resources and environmental governance. In this article, I argue that environmental regulation theory is ill equipped to explain the persistence of petro-capitalism in the United States. This literature has been constructed largely through a critique of regulation theory on two grounds: ignoring the ecological dimension and relying on periodization. Conversely, I aim to show that petro-capitalism can be usefully analyzed through the very classical regulationist lens that environmental appropriations jettison. First, rather than positing nature as an unexamined extra-economic dimension, the case of oil reveals how ecology can be integrated into a foundational concept of the regulation approachthe wage relation. Specifically, the Fordist wage relation of mass production for mass consumption was dependent on the construction of a specific kind of high energy economy. Massive productivity gains in the labor process, powered by electricity, created larger pressures for an equally energy-intensive geography of consumption. In this respect, oil played a decisive role in the extension of the spaces between home and work through the partial generalization of automobility and single-family home ownership. Second, I attempt to recuperate the method of periodization by explaining how a set of institutional supports served to regularize the provision of oil through the domestic oil market from 1935 through 1972. I end with a discussion of the institutional exhaustion of a specifically national form of petro-Fordism during the 1970s.","Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Dept Geog, 144 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,"Huber, M (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Dept Geog, 144 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",mthuber@maxwell.syr.edu,,,,,,,126,34,53,1,53,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

In this paper, we propose a research model to analyze the interrelationship between leadership, change readiness and commitment to change using the partial least square technique. Results of the study suggest that leadership positively and significantly affect change readiness but not commitment to change. Consequently, change readiness is found to significantly affect commitment to change. In other words, change readiness is found to mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and commitment to change. This may suggest that the influence of leadership is a sequential process affecting change readiness, and in turn, the commitment to change as opposed to the conventional belief that it affects both change readiness and commitment to change simultaneously. The implication of the study is further discussed.","[Santhidran, Sinnappan] Tunku Abdul Rahman Univ, Fac Creat Ind, Petaling Jaya 46200, Malaysia; [Chandran, V. G.

Two research questions are addressed: (1) when is it optimal for a buyer group to commit to exclusive purchase from a single seller, and (2) how does the presence of group buying and the exclusive purchase commitment associated with it affect firms' incentives to invest in quality improvement? We find that, even though exclusive purchase commitment benefits buyers when the competing products provide similar quality, it may lower buyer surplus if one product is significantly advantaged and/or the competing products are not highly differentiated horizontally. This result is robust even if the buyer group is formed endogenously. In addition, contingent on the similarity between the competing sellers' investment costs, the sellers' incentives to improve quality may be positively or negatively affected by the presence of group buying.","[Chen, Yuxin] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Li, Xinxin] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Northwestern University; University of Connecticut,"Chen, YX (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",yuxin-chen@kellogg.northwestern.edu; xli@business.uconn.edu,"Wang, Jinguo/JED-9233-2023",,,,,,37,19,27,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

The aim of this paper is to fill this gap and to present a higher education choice model that estimates the impact of travel distance on the decision of school leavers to proceed to higher education in Ireland, while also controlling for a range of individual level characteristics and school related variables. To do so we use data from the 2007 wave of the School Leavers' Survey and find that, on average, travel distance is not an important factor in the higher education participation decision, when factors such as student ability are accounted for. However, further analysis shows that travel distance has a significantly negative impact on participation for those from lower social classes and that this impact grows stronger as distance increases. We also find that the distance effects are most pronounced for lower ability students from these social backgrounds. This has important implications for higher education policy in Ireland, especially in relation to equity of access and the design of the maintenance grant system.","[Cullinan, John] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland; [Flannery, Darragh] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland; [Walsh, Sharon; McCoy, Selina] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [McCoy, Selina] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University of Limerick; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Cullinan, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.",john.cullinan@nuigalway.ie,"McCoy, Selina/ABC-9817-2020; flannery, darragh/F-2722-2015","McCoy, Selina/0000-0001-8774-4018; flannery, darragh/0000-0001-7192-8621",,,,,70,28,34,0,27,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

However, others disagree that catastrophic litigation is a viable threat to the audit firms and oppose legal reform at this time. To inform this debate, this study estimates the probability that a Big Four audit firm will face catastrophic litigation. Estimates are based upon recent disclosures by audit firms regarding settlements, litigation cost, and internal financial information. The results indicate that the likelihood of catastrophic liability is low in absolute terms. Assuming liquidation only when liability reaches a threshold that includes annual income, retirement benefits, and windup costs for the firm, the likelihood of at least one Big Four firm facing litigation substantial enough to trigger voluntary liquidation is 0.6% over a 5-year period. These findings are consistent with auditors being able to sustain litigation under the current legal system. However, the probability would increase dramatically if firms changed their financial structures to remove partner retirement benefits. In such a case, I estimate that the likelihood of catastrophic litigation is as high as 2.8% over a 1-year period and 14.1% over a 5-year period, depending on the level of variable associated litigation costs assumed.

There are two likely outcomes: (1) complex negotiations with existing operators and budget constraints will result in the in tow transformation occurring over an extended period of time: or (2) in toto transformation will simply not occur. In either case, cities will depend, for decades, on a 'hybrid' public transport system that combines both formal and paratransit operators. This paper presents a case for policy recognition of hybrid systems, and explores how such systems might best be managed. The following categories of hybrid public transport systems are explored through case studies: (1) transformative processes in which paratransit operators are to form or assimilate into companies to operate new services, but this incorporation has proved difficult to complete and the operational and regulatory frameworks remain unchanged; and (2) transformative processes that, from the outset, anticipated a hybrid system and designed the outcome accordingly. A third category of hybrid transport systems, defined as transformative processes that have been amended following a realisation that in tow transformation is unattainable, is also introduced and discussed. The paper concludes by tentatively drawing lessons for appropriate public transport regulation, particularly with respect to Cape Town's transformation project. It is argued that a review of the current national regulatory framework is required to enable possible project modifications that acknowledge system hybridity. It is suggested that regulatory frameworks that accommodate the likely hybrid nature of public transport system outcomes have greater prospects of success than frameworks that do not. Furthermore, it is argued that contextually appropriate and successful public transport transformation projects do not necessarily require the in toto substitution of incumbent paratransit operators, and that they can be integrated with, and complement, formal services.

In application to finance and financial crisis, it is laden with complexity. For Marxists, it has underscored a focus on the distinctions between production and circulation, real and fictitious capital. These debates have dominated Marxian responses to the financial crisis. In mainstream finance and economics, the term has undergone transformation and historically driven adaptation. Marxian analysis could fruitfully follow this lead. This paper identifies that transformation as an expression of capital's transforming calculation project. As capital becomes more liquid, the concept of fundamental value itself must embrace liquidity, yet, in embracing liquidity, fundamental value loses its established definitive capacity.","[Bryan, Dick] Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Rafferty, Michael] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Bryan, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",dick.bryan@sydney.edu.au; michael.rafferty@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,39,33,35,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

J,"von Arnauld, A; Zimmermann, KW",,,,"von Arnauld, Andreas; Zimmermann, Klaus W.",,,Regulating government ('s share): the fifty-percent rule of the federal constitutional court in Germany,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fifty-percent rule; Constitutional decisions; Optimal government's share,PUBLIC-EXPENDITURE; EXPOSITION,"Some numbers in the political sphere seem to be chosen rather arbitrarily. One example might be the rule set out by the Second Senate of the German Federal Constitutional Court in 1995 that the overall tax load on assets must be limited to 50% of the yield on those assets. This rule was understood by many as a general principle for taxation. The article first sketches the socio-political climate under which the rule originated: a rise of neo-liberal thought met with the inability of the political institutions to reform the German welfare state with its ever-growing expenses. The Constitutional Court's intervention is interpreted as a reaction to this stagnation in politics. An analysis from the perspective of Constitutional Law, however, reveals that the 50% rule cannot be convincingly based on the German Basic Law, and instead must be seen as a political move of the Court. But this move did not follow an economic rationality, either; for an optimal government's share can only be determined in relation to the economic performance of a country and not by fixing it generally at a maximum of 50% of GDP. The demise of the 50% rule already began four years later. In 2006, finally, the Senate moved away from the individual rights-based approach of 1995 to a more general assessment, taking also into account an increasingly globalized tax competition. The reason for this clear-cut change in the Court's jurisprudence can be found in a change of the socio-political and institutional parameters, thus witnessing to the effect of the political climate on court decisions. The analysis also shows that the rule was created and abandoned only on the basis of an introverted legal discussion, economic arguments hardly playing any role in the process. The new line of the Senate, however, might guarantee for a better integration of economic science into tax policy by exchanging fixed limits for a discursive model, demanding from the tax legislator better reasons for higher taxes.","[von Arnauld, Andreas] Univ German Armed Forces Hamburg, Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Publ Law Esp Int & European Law, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany; [Zimmermann, Klaus W.] Univ German Armed Forces Hamburg, Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Econ Policy Res, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University; Helmut Schmidt University,"Zimmermann, KW (通讯作者)，Univ German Armed Forces Hamburg, Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Econ Policy Res, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",arnauld@hsu-hh.de; kwzi@hsu-hh.de,,,,,,,71,2,2,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The paper investigates the determinants of sovereign credit risk ratings of Latvia from 1997 to 2012 assigned by the three leading credit rating agencies, Moody's Investment Service, Fitch and Standard and Poor's. Conducted analysis of sovereign credit ratings, by using first, an alignment and transformation of the rating scales into values and second, ordinary least squares regression, indicates key rating determinants. From the initial number of variables that can be used according to previous studies on the topic, GDP growth rate and unemployment are used in the model to explain actual credit ratings of Latvia in 19972012 and predict future ones in 2013-2014. According to the model, long-term foreign currency rating of Latvia is predicted to improve by the end of 2014 from currently assigned rating levels by two notches either by a single credit rating agency or by one notch by two rating agencies, but still being in the lower medium grade category. Collected data on the changes of the Latvia's credit ratings can be used to forecast the sovereign borrowing costs of Latvia, after joining to euro-zone.","[Arefjevs, Ilja] BA Sch Business & Finance, Riga, Latvia; [Braslins, Girts] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Arefjevs, I (通讯作者)，BA Sch Business & Finance, Riga, Latvia.",ilja.arefjevs@inbox.lv,"Arefjevs, Ilja/IUQ-3756-2023",,,,,,13,1,1,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,15,25,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100002,0

Usage at the potential stations is predicted using trip end and flow level demand models, and the extent of abstraction from neighbouring stations is considered. The benefits and costs of constructing the stations are then estimated, including direct financial gains and losses as well as wider economic impacts and social costs and benefits. Finally, these are brought together to calculate financial and social net present values and benefit-cost ratios, with break-even demand levels for new stations also provided. The framework provides a consistent means of estimating the costs and benefits of the large number of schemes for new local railway stations in the UK, and use of a standardised methodology allows those schemes with the best case for construction to be prioritised. Since rail privatisation in the mid-1990s the costs of new stations have escalated dramatically, meaning that stations have to demonstrate much greater revenue-earning potential than was previously the case to justify construction. By providing more accurate forecasts and thus reducing uncertainty over scheme costs and benefits, this appraisal procedure can help to ensure that the best return is obtained on the limited investment funds which are available.

Rapid rise in the competition coupled with rapid change in the business environment has forced organizations to come up with new technologies, processes and procedures to beat competition and turn challenges into opportunities. The unprecedented rise in the importance of knowledge management is the result of growing pressure on the organizations to effectively manage the knowledge within the organization. In 1980s and 90s, organizational learning gained importance in the management studies (Fiol and Lyles, 1985; Leibowitz and Beckman, 19981). Corporate brands on the other hand, are an increasingly important element of organisational and marketing strategy (Balmer, 2001a; Olins, 2000, Gilani 2011). Among the changes that businesses make as they move towards globalisation is a shift in marketing emphasis from product brands to corporate branding (Balmer, 1995, 2001a, b; de Chernatony, 1999, Gilani 2011). This research paper brings together the two subject areas of corporate branding and organizational learning in order to develop the competitive advantage of an organization. While the importance of these issues has been widely accepted, to date the linkages between organizational culture, learning, corporate branding and corporate identity have scarcely been examined together in the literature, particularly from an empirical perspective. Design/Methodology/Approach. This research paper explores the relationship amongst the two broad concepts with empirical research on data collected from organisations that imply their organisational learning towards their corporate branding. This particular research conducts an exploratory research using the case study method for collection of interviews to have an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon of organizational learning and corporate branding through Hybrid knowledge. The data collected would be analysed through qualitative methods using thematic content analysis. The exploratory findings would be used to devise a conceptual framework on the subject area. Originality/Value. The aim of this research is to explore more about the effectiveness and impact of hybrid knowledge on organizational learning as a tool to improve its corporate branding. For the purpose the higher education services industry was selected to explore the new strategies for generating more profit through knowledge management in an organization. Knowledge management plays a vital role in bringing the organization competent with knowledgeable, experienced and skilled employees effective for generating more profit for any industry. The research is original in its nature as there have not been many instances where the two subject themes of organisational learning and corporate branding have been interrelated and overlapped. This research would pave new research avenues to be explored and enhance academic contribution on the common subjects. Practical Implications. The motivation of this thesis comes from literature review to explore the impacts of organizational learning on corporate branding and the effectiveness of the employee participation in the whole process is the outcome of organization performance and satisfying the end users.",,,,hgilani@bite.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,0,0,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,251,267,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100025,0

Therefore it needs boosting policies in order to maintain the sustainability of land, and to improve, by introducing innovation and efficiency, its capability to provide important investment options and relevant job opportunities. Cadastre has always been the most important data source for the fiscal property drain, but the recent recourse to GIS technology has exploited the civil use of its database. Land and agricultural policies can take advantage from the enlargement of this databank by integrating into it the information provided by the spatial computing function of GIS technologies. The study we have carried out proposes an analysis and appraisal model useful for the evaluation of the merit of each territorial unit (cadastral parcels of land), aiming to be admitted to the agricultural boost policy. The model integrates the economic calculation capability of the spreadsheet into the spatial calculation ability of GIS. It is applied to a large land context located in the southern part of the municipality of Piazza Armerina (EN) and it processes a great number of data that are transformed into single scores through a utility function. By aggregating the scores to form a single a-dimensional rate it is possible to compare and successively rank all the land parcels in many different ways, each one representing a particular concern.","[Giuffrida, Salvatore; Gagliano, Filippo] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Ingn Civile & Ambientale, I-95124 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,,sgiuffrida@dica.unict.it,"Giuffrida, Salvatore/A-8579-2015",,,,,,27,0,0,0,1,MEDIMOND S R L,40128 BOLOGNA,"VIA MASERATI 5, 40128 BOLOGNA, 00000, ITALY",,,978-88-7587-690-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,103,116,,,,,,14,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BA8IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338155900010,0

Then, we investigate whether the mounting attention to CSR due to certain events has marginal effects on MSP, and whether CSR and MSP affect firms' market performances. Collectively, we find that: 1) firms' CSR levels significantly affect MSP and can substitute the governance role of minority shareholders to some extent; 2) exogenous shocks related to CSR can significantly affect MSP; and 3) firms with higher CSR level and lower MSP enjoy higher market value improvements. In addition, we find limited evidence that institutional investors may face conflict-of-interest pressures and vote against individual investors.

Tourists, originating from 12 different world countries within the period of two summer tourism seasons, travelling on a multi-destination tour to the Baltic States had been questioned if the information they had been provided with before travelling - while booking the particular tour, corresponded to the program they had received during the tour and if the tour program purchased from their travel agent corresponded to the program they had received on-site. 1330 questionnaires have been analysed before making conclusions. The aim of the research was to identify consequences of communication, the impact of cultural differences on information distribution and how it could affect the management of an international tourism enterprise.

In the current financial crisis, M&A transactions face higher degree of risk profiles, especially in the emerging markets. The greater the uncertainty, the more diligence is due. A number of globally active consulting companies performed surveys and got results which differ from the state of the scientific economic research to this topic. Companies investing in firms in those markets believe the risk assessment they do before investing in the lesser-known environment of emerging markets, needs to be enhanced. The problem is that common risk assessment approaches consider financial, legal, commercial, and other issues - but they are not discrete areas in emerging markets, because there is overlap between the public and private sector in these regions, information is unreliable and regulation unpredictable. As the surveys show, e.g. state intervention, political instability and litigation history are both commercial and reputational issues in emerging markets. Thus more integrated approach to due diligence is required in these regions than in developed markets. This paper focuses on a practitioner's experience with M&A due diligence and how the current state of research efforts in M&As due diligence fits to this experience. The comparison calls for a different, more integrated system of due diligence and shows the research deficit.","[Sacek, Alen] Univ Appl Sci Kufstein, Kufstein, Austria",,,alen.sacek@fh-kufstein.ac.at,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,7,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,511,521,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100048,0

Linked to a specific method and equipped with public funds LEADER should open up a laboratory for finding and testing new solutions for development problems in rural areas. The added value of LEADER in comparison to traditional regional and rural development instruments is often associated with strengthening governance and innovation. However, in 2010 the European Court of Auditors comes to the conclusion that LEADER produces innovation or interaction between different sectors only to a very limited extent. Ambiguous and even contradicting appraisals of LEADER raise questions on how to transfer the LEADER method into effective practice and how to evaluate intended outcomes. Departing from the basic proposition that the LEADER method, when properly applied, produces innovation the paper aims to uncover empirical patterns of innovation. The empirical analysis is based on the case study of an Austria LEADER territory covering six years of programme implementation (2007-2012). The subject of analysis is less the single projects but more strategic linkages of activities and interactions of the players involved. Thereby the focus is on tourism as one of the major drivers for employment and growth in rural areas. The main findings are that innovation in a rural tourism context occurs in smaller steps, concerns rather traditional competences and need often years to reach market entry. Municipalities and destination management organisations play a dominant role in project implementation whereas deficits occur in the integration of private businesses. This is particularly true for lagging areas. In stronger destinations innovation is more pushed by private companies.","[Salchner, Guenter] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,gsalchner@gmx.at,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,530,544,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100050,0

However, the application of the process approach has been implemented in two different ways: (1) a declarative application and (2) a real application in enterprise management systems. The fulfilment of the ISO 9001 standard concerning the application of a process approach into practice is represented by a business process model. As the standard requests, it usually contains identified processes and activities, their interactions, the determination of responsibilities for processes, and the determination of sources and proper indicators for monitoring and improving company processes. The existence of a business process model does not guarantee its real application in enterprise management and may only satisfy a declarative fulfilment of the ISO 9001 standard requirements, which is often sufficient for external auditors. Based on the above mentioned different approaches to application, two research questions have been defined: (1) does the declarative application of the process approach prevail over its real application in enterprises with the ISO 9001 quality management certificate and (2) what is the selected management areas where enterprises certified to the ISO 9001 standard could apply their developed business process models?

Myth, in this sense, is not a false story meant to amuse or discredit, but rather a story based on naturalised beliefs giving it the supremacy of the obvious. Through the process of emplotment, myths create internal logics that help relieve anxiety, rationalise behaviour and naturalise societal and individual convictions. As such, myths are a fundamental and habitual part of life. The myth of sustainable mobility is not one, but two stories that of development as quantitative growth and the discourse of sustainability which are merged, emplotted and naturalised. It is based on the fears of economic and environmental collapse, but while fear is an essential characteristic of myth and a source of much of its power the myth also offers hope. The hope lies in the promise of continued trends of increased mobility while still being able to preserve the world for future generations. This entangles the very notions of mobility, development and sustainability, creating a confusion of concepts as the contrast between growth and limits wanes.

J,"Gorecki, PK",,,,"Gorecki, Paul K.",,,Competition Policy in Ireland's Recession,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Recessions pose something of a dilemma for policymakers with respect to competition policy. Despite compelling evidence that relaxing competition policy during a recession is likely to have quite profound adverse economic consequences in terms of, for example, retarding the subsequent recovery, policymakers may nevertheless relax competition policy to try to prevent job losses and firm insolvency. In Ireland the policy response has been ambivalent. At first, between 2008-2010, competition policy carve out/exemptions were proposed, senior appointments to the Competition Authority were delayed or not made. However, in December 2010 the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland set a strongly pro-competition agenda. But will it last beyond the end of 2013, when the programme expires? There is reason for optimism. If the economy has recovered or is at least growing there will be less pressure for the state to accede to demands for carve outs and other such anti-competitive measures. If the EU-IMF reforms have successfully bedded down in terms of, for example, introducing greater competition in the service sector, turning back the clock may be difficult, since there will be public support for the results of the reforms. The EU-IMF inspired reforms to competition policy and their underlying rationale may be successful in persuading senior decision makers in government, both elected and non-elected, of the merits of competition. Policymakers often claim that they want evidence based policy. The reforms in the EU-IMF Programme are firmly grounded on the literature concerning the impact of relaxing competition policy as well as the Competition Authority's research into the professions. In contrast, there is little or no evidence to support the 2008-2010 interregnum.","Trinity Coll Dublin, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Gorecki, PK (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",paul.gorecki@esri.ie,,,,,,,57,2,2,0,11,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The econometric findings show that firms with less pre-bankruptcy operational losses and a better cash position are more likely to successfully execute their reorganization plan and that certain debt restructuring measures can contribute to firm rescue. Despite these positive findings, many firms still failed to reorganise under the 1997-reorganization law, which resulted in constant criticism on its effectiveness leading up to its recent replacement in 2009. My data also shows that within the former reorganization procedure the Belgian debtor was faced with high debt instalment payments compared to international practice and that successful plan execution relied too much on the uncertain realization of the operational cash flow projections. In discussing the legal framework of the new Law on Corporate Continuity enacted in 2009-replacing the 1997-law-I argue that this new law is a more effective legislation to save distressed businesses.","Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Leyman, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Bartleyman@hotmail.com,,,,,,,30,5,5,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

As resources allocated to education and R&D sector are significantly limited, a special emphasis should be given to their efficient use regarding the institutional and legal constraints. By applying non-parametric methodology, i.e. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a relative efficiency is defined as the deviation from the efficiency frontier which represents the maximum output/outcome attainable from each input level. An analysis of (output-oriented) efficiency measures shows that among the new EU member states Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia seem to be good benchmark countries in the field of primary, secondary and tertiary education, respectively. On the other hand, Cyprus and again Hungary dominate in the field of R&D sector, even if for different reasons. The empirical results also suggest that, in general, new EU member states show relatively high efficiency in tertiary education, while lag well behind in the R&D efficiency measures.","Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Aristovnik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",aleksander.aristovnik@fu.uni-lj.si,"Aristovnik, Aleksander/B-4642-2010","Aristovnik, Aleksander/0000-0003-1345-9649",,,,,41,46,48,1,53,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

A range of studies have examined different factors that influence perceptions of crime risk. This study uses structural equation modelling to explore the influences on perceptions of safety on public transport and the impact these perceptions have on ridership using a survey sample from Melbourne, Australia. The largest direct influences on feelings of safety on public transport were trust in others and feeling safe in one's home or on the street at night. Gender and age are commonly-cited influences in the literature but in this model their influence on feelings of safety was indirect. The total indirect effect of age was larger than the indirect effect of gender. Feelings of safety had a small but significant positive influence on how frequently people used public transport. This was slightly smaller than the negative effect of cars in the household but larger than the negative effect of distance from the city centre. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A significant body of literature suggests that local growth is often derived from social ties that bind firms together through trust, reciprocity, loyalty and forbearance. While there appears to be consensus in the literature that such relationships are important, there remain doubts in some sections of economic geography about two key elements of this institutionalist model. The first concerns the unequal power relationships that often exist between enterprises and the implications of these asymmetries for the performance of firms and localities. The second relates to the implied significance of geographical proximity whereby close spatial ties between firms are considered to be an important determinant of local competitiveness and economic performance. This article explores these issues through an empirical analysis of the transactional structures of 184 firms in Australia's manufacturing sector.","[Tonts, Matthew] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Plummer, Paul] Univ Calgary, Dept Geog, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Taylor, Michael] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Western Australia; University of Calgary; University of Birmingham,"Tonts, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",matthew.tonts@uwa.edu.au,,,,,,,113,8,8,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This paper suggests a novel way of addressing this selection problem by looking within the family to exploit variation in siblings' ages at the time of parental migration. The basic assumption underlying the analysis is that parental migration will have no effect on the educational outcomes of children who are at least 20 years old because they have already completed their education. Their younger siblings, in contrast, may still be in school, and thus will be affected by the parental migration experience. The results point to a statistically significant positive effect of paternal US migration on education for girls, suggesting that pushing a father's US migration earlier in his daughter's life can lead to an increase in her educational attainment of up to 1 year relative to delaying migration until after she has turned 20 years old. In contrast, paternal domestic migration has no statistically significant effect on educational attainment for girls or boys, suggesting that father absence does not play a major role in determining children's educational outcomes. Instead, these results suggest that the marginal dollars from US migrant remittances appear to enable families to further educate their daughters. Thus, policymakers should view international migration as a potential pathway by which families raise educational attainments of girls in particular.","Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Antman, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",francisca.antman@colorado.edu,,"ANTMAN, FRANCISCA/0000-0002-4283-149X","NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD066613, R24 HD066613] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,35,138,163,3,84,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Under democratic federalism, the constitution creates an annual policy game where the new majority and the elite each control one policy instrument of importance to the other. The game has a stable stationary equilibrium that the elite may prefer to autocratic rule. We apply our analysis to South Africa's transition from white, elite rule under apartheid to a multi-racial democracy. We calibrate our model to the South African economy at the time of the transition. Stable democratic equilibria exist for plausible estimates of redistributive preferences and rate of time preference (impatience) of the new majority during the early years of the new democracy.

It highlights the power of the ideal of respect for individual preferences with respect to the reward issue and the concern for potential harshness of the social criterion toward the individuals who fail to make good use of their opportunities.

Recently, new techniques have been developed, based on regularization, which can often produce accurate models in these settings. This paper describes the basic principles underlying the method of regularization, then focuses on those methods which exploit the sparsity of the predicting model. The potential merits of these methods are then explored by example. (c) 2012 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The experiment evaluates the ability of expert econometricians to make predictions based on commonly provided regression outputs. Visual displays of quantitative information, including simple plots of data, outperformed predictions based on R-squared values, t-statistics, and other common diagnostics. Reliance on graphing-on the visualization of uncertainty-was suggested more than a century ago by Karl Pearson, a founding father of statistics in the English language. The results of the Soyer and Hogarth experiment, when combined with evidence produced by Ziliak and McCloskey (2008) and others, suggests that graphing and visualization should receive more attention and tests of statistical significance, less.

In a closed economy, entry is always socially insufficient in the absence of scale economies, and it is socially insufficient in the presence of scale economies if the marginal cost difference between the leader and the followers is large. In an open economy with the foreign leader, entry is always socially insufficient.

The results obtained show that when working conditions and academic background are similar, women achieve better performance in sectors traditionally dominated by men.

With his 'impartial observer theorem', Harsanyi tried to show that the veil of ignorance argument leads inevitably to utilitarianism, an argument criticized by Sen, Weymark and others. A quite different use of the veil-of-ignorance concept is found in evolutionary biology. In the cell-division process called meiosis, in which sexually reproducing organisms produce gametes, the chromosome number is halved; when meiosis is fair, each gene has only a fifty percent chance of making it into any gamete. This creates a Mendelian veil of ignorance, which has the effect of aligning the interests of all the genes in an organism. This paper shows how Harsanyi's version of the veil-of-ignorance argument can shed light on Mendelian genetics. There turns out to be an intriguing biological analogue of the impartial observer theorem that is immune from the Sen/Weymark objections to Harsanyi's original.","Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Okasha, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.",samir.okasha@bristol.ac.uk,,,AHRC [AH/F017502/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/F017502/1] Funding Source: researchfish,AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),,,33,14,14,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

However, an overabundance of rules or badly designed regulation can cause confusion and delay, impose unreasonable compliance costs in terms of capital investment, labour and official paperwork, retard innovation, lower productivity and, accidentally, distort incentives for private initiative.

The main concern for the European Union is whether Europe can compete tomorrow alongside the fastest growing economies. The challenge for the European Union is to use international trade as a way out of the current economic crisis.","[Alexa, Ioana-Veronica; Toma, Simona Valeria; Sarpe, Daniela Ancuta] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,,Ioana.alexa@ugal.ro; Simona.Toma@ugal.ro; daniela.sarpe@ugal.ro,"Sarpe, Daniela Ancuta/V-7290-2017",,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",,,978-606-19-0103-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,11,14,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEN33,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317436900003,0
