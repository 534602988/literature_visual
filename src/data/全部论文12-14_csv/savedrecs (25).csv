This paper investigates whether this reasoning is relevant for the EU and other regional trade agreements (RTAs). I provide empirical evidence that customs unions and common markets (deep RTAs) do reduce the probability of war between members. Partial scope and free trade agreements (shallow RTAs) however have no effect on war probabilities. Accordingly, international insecurity has a differential impact on incentives to create RTAs. Deep RTAs are signed between countries that are involved in many interstate disputes and that have low trade costs with the rest of the world, whereas the opposite is true for shallow RTAs.

All classic examples of such distributions have two-dimensional support. Here we exhibit a distribution which has one-dimensional support and is simpler to describe than previous examples. The construction generalizes to give one-dimensional distributions with the same property in higher-dimensional simplices as well. As our second note, we give some results on the equilibrium payoffs when the game is modified so that players have unequal budgets.

This paper studies a principal-agent model of this kind, in which the principal sends a non-verifiable report of output to a competitive labor market interested in the agent's ability. It is assumed that the principal and agent write an enforceable contract over both payments and reports as a function of output, and that the contract terms they agree to cannot be observed by the market. When contracts are unrestricted, reports cannot affect the agent's future wage in equilibrium, because the agent will always pay the principal to give a good report. Under limited liability, reports can affect future wages, but only by designating output as good or bad. This informative performance reporting benefits the principal, and may more than make up for the costs imposed by limited liability. The possibilities that the market may have some direct information about output, that the principal may have additional information about the agent's ability, and that the principal may have psychological or reputational costs of misreporting output are also considered.","[Wolitzky, Alexander] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,,alexander.wolitzky@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The random utility model and the hedonic utility model of Netzer and Robson (NR) are special cases of this framework. We begin by applying information theory to our framework to derive general results concerning the expected regret of DM under observational limitations. We then turn our attention to the effects of observational limitations on choice behavior (rather than their effects on the regret values induced by that behavior). We focus on the special case of NR. First we derive two postulates assumed by NR. We then provide a simple derivation of the result of NR that a particular hedonic utility function satisfies certain optimality principles. Next we extend NR to allow a countable, rather than uncountable, set of states of the world. In particular we show how to use dynamic programming to solve for the optimal preference order of DM in this extension. We also extend NR by considering the case where more than two options are presented to DM. In particular, we show that the results of NR change in such a case, implying that the number of options being presented is a crucial aspect of choice problems.","[Wolpert, David] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Leslie, David S.] Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; University of Bristol,,david.h.wolpert@gmail.com; david.leslie@bristol.ac.uk,"Leslie, David S/F-3082-2012; Leslie, David/JXY-5368-2024","Leslie, David/0000-0001-5253-7676",,,,,46,3,3,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This paper studies the case of Taiwan after first determining the misalignment of Taiwan's currency by estimating the fundamental equilibrium real exchange rate. Three sub-periods for Taiwan's currency exchange rate misalignment are identified: undervaluation in the periods 1981-1986 and 19982008 and overvaluation during 1987-1997. Second, we use a vector autoregression (VAR) model to examine the Granger causality between exchange rate misalignment and GDP, by incorporating export and investment variables. The evidence shows that exchange rate misalignment does Granger cause GDP and it mainly comes from the third sub-period when the Taiwan dollar was undervalued. From past experience and the current economic doldrums of the last resort of global exports - the United States - currency undervaluation is not a validated strategy upon which emerging markets can wishfully impinge.","[Yan, Ho-don] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Yang, Cheng-lang] Nanhua Univ, Dept Managerial Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; Nanhua University,"Yan, HD (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung, Taiwan.",hdyan@fcu.edu.tw; chenglang@mail.nhu.edu.tw,,,,,,,51,3,3,1,6,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,1,,,,,37,57,,10.2298/PAN1201037Y,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,916OR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302113600003,0

We analyse the optimal income-based price subsidies in a strategic environment. We show that universal access is less likely to arise when price arbitrage prevents international price discrimination. When this is not the case, under some income ranges, bilateral universal coverage can be supported by equilibrium subsidies together with bilateral partial provision. In such a case, international health policy coordination becomes relevant. We also show that asymmetric universal access to medicines across countries can arise, even when countries are ex ante symmetric, when international price discrimination is possible and governments cannot design subsidies proportional to either income or quality.","[Acharyya, Rajat] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Econ, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India; [Garcia-Alonso, Maria D.

Simple pricing models value a convertible bond as being equivalent to a straight bond with an embedded option that enables the bond holder to convert to a specific amount of common stock. The straight bond is subject to both interest rate and credit risk, whereas the option to convert is dependent on the underlying stock price, which exposes the convertible bond holder to equity risk. The complexity of these features means that convertible bonds tend to be treated casually in major derivatives and corporate finance textbooks. This paper presents a survey of the theoretical and empirical aspects of convertible bond pricing.

In this paper, we propose a generalized trade restrictiveness index (GTRI) that extends Feenstra's (1995) tariff restrictiveness index (TRI) by relaxing the crucial assumption of a small open economy. We show that the GTRI can be measured using import tariffs, import shares, and the corresponding import and foreign export elasticities. We then apply the GTRI to examine how trade restrictiveness has evolved in China from 1997 to 2008, the period in which China entered the WTO. The GTRI indicates a higher level of protection than simple and import-weighted averages, but lower than the TRI. We further show a negative correlation between tariffs and product export supply elasticity, indicating that strategic trade policy was being pursued prior to China's WTO accession. Finally, we calculate the welfare loss and terms-of-trade gain due to tariff protection. The overall tariff pass-through increases from around 28% to almost 47% because of the WTO.

The resulting estimator is asymptotically normal with a parametric convergence rate. This method is faster than the conventional check function approach, when handling a sizable data set.

Financial imperfection creates income inequality, by benefiting borrowers (entrepreneurs) and harming lenders through its effect of lowering the capital rental rate. We show that globalization changes income for both borrowers and lenders in the same direction. However, the poorer is the financial institution, the greater its effect for entrepreneurs and the smaller for lenders. We also examine the effect of financial development and globalization in an enriched model where individuals are different in their abilities as well as their capital endowments. We show that financial development mitigates capital misallocation while the reduction of trade costs will not improve efficiency.","[Daisaka, Hiroshi; Furusawa, Taiji] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Yanagawa, Noriyuki] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; University of Tokyo,"Furusawa, T (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",furusawa@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26220503] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,30,10,11,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The vouchers increase training participation by almost 20 percentage points in two years, relative to a base rate of 0.45. This increased participation comes at a substantial deadweight loss of almost 60%. Consistent with predictions from human capital theory, we find that vouchers cause a shift towards more general forms of training. We do not find any significant impact of the program on monthly wages or on job mobility. The program does, however, have a significant impact on future training plans. Compared to always-takers, new trainees are more often male, more risk averse, work shorter hours and are less likely to have participated in training prior to treatment. Compared to never-takers, they are more often female, work longer hours and have a somewhat lower formal education level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

If a bad match takes place, discriminated workers will take longer to find another job, prolonging the costly period for the firm. This makes it less profitable for firms to hire discriminated workers, thus sustaining the discrimination. In contrast to Becker's model, the existence of employers with a taste for discrimination may make it more profitable to discriminate, even for firms without discriminatory preferences.","[Holden, Steinar] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Rosen, Asa] Stockholm Univ SOFI, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Oslo,"Holden, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",steinar.holden@econ.uio.no; asa.rosen@sofi.su.se,,"Rosen, Asa/0000-0001-8470-2859",,,,,43,4,4,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

In South Africa's case, these inflows were partly used to build the country's foreign exchange reserves, but more particularly to finance continued large current account deficits. During the course of the past two years, however, adverse domestic political developments, combined with the potential negative impacts of the unwinding of quantitative easing policies and the normalising of monetary policy in the United States on emerging markets in general, has raised the spectre of a sharp slowdown in foreign capital flows to South Africa and an associated reversal of the current deficit. This paper explores the potential impact of such a development on macroeconomic conditions in South Africa. The analysis consists of macroeconometric model-based alternative scenarios backed up by both the international evidence on the impact of such events and South Africa's own history.","[Smit, Ben; Grobler, Christelle] Univ Stellenbosch, Bur Econ Res, ZA-7599 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Smit, B (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Bur Econ Res, ZA-7599 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa.",bws@sun.ac.za,"fungsen, chan/H-1983-2016",,,,,,17,4,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

This model allows for dynamic changes in the degree of market integration, regional market risk premium, regional exchange-rate risk premium, and domestic market risk premium. Our findings show several interesting facts. First, the time-varying degree of integration in the Singapore market is satisfactorily explained by the level of trade openness and the term premium of US interest rates, which have recently tended to increase, however these markets remain substantially segmented from the world market. Second, the local market risk premium is found to explain a significant proportion of the total risk premium for emerging market returns. Our findings illustrate several important implications for portfolio hedgers for making optimal portfolio allocations, engaging in risk management and forecasting future volatility in equity markets. Our results are also of interest for both policymakers and investors, with respect to regional development policies and dedicated portfolio investment strategies in the ASEAN-5 region.

It uses a model focusing on the strategic reason for capital taxes to demonstrate that per capita fiscal capacity equalization improves the spatial allocation of capital provided a sufficiently rich (marginally) larger region and sufficiently strong agglomeration externalities. If tax revenue is used to finance public goods, per capita fiscal capacity equalization generally cannot simultaneously eliminate public good inefficiency and spatial inefficiency. However, the achievement of full efficiency for ex ante identical regions requires excessive (full) equalization in the presence (absence) of agglomeration externalities.","Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, D-90020 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Wrede, M (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, POB 3931, D-90020 Nurnberg, Germany.",matthias.wrede@wiso.uni-erlangen.de,,"Wrede, Matthias/0000-0001-8376-517X",,,,,29,7,7,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We show that home-ownership rates and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at the city level are strongly negatively correlated with local house price volatility. However, causal inference is confounded by house price levels, which are systematically correlated with housing risk in an intuitive way: in cities where the land value is larger relative to the local cost of structures, house prices are higher and more volatile. We disentangle the contributions of high price levels from high volatilities by building a life-cycle model of home-ownership choices. We find that higher price levels can explain most of the lower home-ownership. Higher risk in the model leads to slightly lower home-ownership and LTV ratios in high land value cities. The relationship between LTV and risk is corroborated by LTV's negative correlation with price volatility in the data and highlights the importance of including other means of incomplete insurance in models of home-ownership.","[Amior, Michael] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; [Halket, Jonathan] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Halket, Jonathan] Inst Fiscal Studies, CeMMAP, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Essex; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Amior, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England.",m.a.amior@lse.ac.uk; jonathan@halket.com,,"Halket, Jonathan/0000-0002-9944-2049",ESRC [ES/H012907/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H012907/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,72,16,19,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Investors who believe others hold more optimistic stock market expectations allocate more of their own portfolio to stocks even after controlling for their own risk and return expectations. However, second-order beliefs are inaccurate and exhibit several well-known psychological biases. We observe both the tendency of investors to believe that their own opinion is relatively more common among the population (false consensus) and that others who hold divergent beliefs are considered to be biased (bias blind spot).

Buyers in these markets sell the fish they purchase on a retail market; The paper provides an original model of boundedly rational behavior for wholesale buyers' behavior incorporating learning to improve profits, conjectures as to the bids that will be made and fictitious learning. We analyze the dynamics of the aggregate price under different market conditions in order to explain the emergence of market price patterns such as the well-known declining price paradox and the empirically observed fact that the very last transactions in the day may be at a higher price. The proposed behavioral model provides alternative explanations for market price dynamics to those which depend on standard hypotheses such as diminishing marginal profits. Furthermore, agents learn the option value of having the possibility of bidding in later rounds. When confronted with random buyers, such as occasional participants or new entrants, they learn to bid in the optimal way without being conscious of the strategies of the other buyers. When faced with other buyers who are also learning their behavior still displays some of the characteristics learned in the simpler case even though the problem is not analytically tractable.

This may happen when conservation improves land so that returns to non-conservation uses are increased, or when landowners' preferences become more pro-conservation as they see land flourish under conservation, for example. These post-contract changes may occur on the extensive margin (acres of land conserved) or intensive margin (intensity of land in a given use). If temporal spillovers exist, benefits from conservation programs estimated by focusing solely on the effects that occur during the conservation contract will overstate or understate the true benefits of the program. I lay out a simple model of temporal spillovers. I test this model in the context of the United States Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). I use a pre-analysis sample specification step to choose counterfactual land most like the CRP land. On the extensive margin, I find that CRP causes some land to be 20-25% more likely to be farmed, potentially offsetting some environmental benefits. However, farmed ex-CRP land is slightly more likely to use a conservation practice. This is a mitigating factor on the intensive margin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This issue is relevant in many industries ranging from manufacturing to energy retailing, where firms that are rendered risk averse by financial frictions decide on and commit to their hedging strategies before their product market strategies. We find that commitment to hedging modifies the pricing and production strategies of firms. This strategic effect is channeled through the risk-adjusted expected cost, i.e., the expected marginal cost under the probability measure induced by shareholders' risk aversion. It has opposite effects depending on the nature of product market competition: commitment to hedging toughens quantity competition while it softens price competition. Finally, not committing to the hedging position can never be an equilibrium outcome: committing is always a best response to non-committing. In the Hotelling model, committing is a dominant strategy for all firms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

I develop a two-country, stochastic general equilibrium model in which firms make production and pricing decisions in advance, and I consider its implications for the relative attractiveness of exporting and multinational production. I find that when multinational sales are priced in the local currency while exports are priced in the producer currency, destination volatility benefits exporters: during a foreign nominal contraction, the foreign exchange rate appreciates, causing exports to be relatively cheaper. Exporters gain non-linearly through demand, making profit convex in prices. As foreign volatility rises, the model implies that the home country should serve the foreign country relatively more through exports. I take this implication to bilateral U.S. data, using inflation volatility as a proxy for nominal volatility. Using sectoral data on sales by majority-owned foreign affiliates matched with U.S. exports, I find that higher inflation volatility is associated with a significantly lower ratio of multinational sales to total foreign sales.

The model suggested substantially modifies that of Keen (1995), who combined insights from Goodwin and Minsky within a model of fluctuating growth. In the real part of the model we introduce the possibility of disequilibrium in the goods market and formalize a mechanism of output adjustment based on the conventional dynamic multiplier. The model so obtained may exhibit persistent dynamics and provide insights to enable better understanding of the nature of real-world fluctuations. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We simulate a 2-period model of infrastructure investment with subsequent retrofit to purge its carbon emissions, under uncertainty about climate and retrofit costs. The energy intensity chosen upon investment depends on current and expected future energy and environmental costs, and on future retrofit cost. Simulations of a simplified but realistic model indicate that energy consumption and carbon emissions can be highly excessive when future energy and climate costs are not considered at the time infrastructure investments are made, and charged at globally suboptimal rates when operated; often by more than 50% when energy costs are undervalued at this rate both ex ante and ex post. Good anticipated retrofit options reduce ex post energy costs, but lead to ex ante choice of more energy-intensive infrastructure, which could more than fully offset the energy-reducing effect of the retrofit. These results are of particular importance for emerging economies with large current and anticipated energy-related investments, where long-term climate policy goals may be seriously jeopardized by policy makers facing too low energy prices, now and in the future.

In the presence of either bequests or aspirations, labor income shocks are transmitted intergenerationally, and this transmission, together with contemporaneous shocks, determines the distribution of wealth. We show that the introduction of aspirations (habits) decreases (increases) the average wealth, and increases (decreases) both its intragenerational variability and the degree of intergenerational mobility. Therefore, a distinction between aspirations and habits is relevant because they involve different implications for the distribution of wealth.","[Caballe, Jordi] Autonomous Univ Barcelona Bellaterra, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Moro-Egido, Ana I.] Univ Granada, Granada 18011, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Granada,"Caballé, J (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Barcelona Bellaterra, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",jordi.caballe@uab.es; aimoro@ugr.es,"MORO-EGIDO, ANA I./O-3432-2014; Caballe, Jordi/K-9199-2014","MORO-EGIDO, ANA I./0000-0002-5992-1408; Caballe, Jordi/0000-0003-0253-5634",,,,,31,7,7,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Interest in behavioral economics derives from unease with standard economic models that are based on restrictive assumptions, which confine the nature of human motivation. Although Adam Smith, the founding father of modern economics, had highlighted the multitude of psychological motives that drive human behavior, and despite the fact that many influential economists thereafter believed in tenets of modern behavioral economics, the homo economicus assumption became prevalent, until this construct was challenged by compelling evidence on social, cognitive and emotional factors that drive decision-making and social interaction. Since human interaction is germane to labor markets, one would expect behavioral economics to be highly relevant for labor economics. This paper gauges whether and how behavioral economics has left its mark on labor economics, considers the timing and structure of this development, and contemplates its future impact on labor economics.

Our experiments showed that IO tables estimated with more detailed and recent data contained smaller estimation errors and led to smaller quantitative prediction errors in CGE analysis. Despite the quantitative prediction errors, prediction was found to be qualitatively correct. As for the performance of updating techniques of IO tables, a cross-entropy method often outperformed a least-squares method in IO estimation with only aggregate data for the target year but did not necessarily outperform the least-squares method in CGE prediction.

We follow Stole and Zwiebel (1996a, 1996b) and assume that wages are determined by continuous bargaining between the firm and its employees. The model generates a nontrivial dispersion of firm sizes; when firms' production technologies exhibit decreasing returns to labor, it also generates wage dispersion, even when all firms and all workers are ex ante identical. We characterize the steady-state equilibrium and show that, with a suitably chosen distribution of ex ante heterogeneity across firms, it is consistent with several important stylized facts about the joint distribution of firm size, firm growth, and wages in the U.S. economy. We also conduct a numerical investigation of the out-of-steady-state dynamics of our model. We find that the responses of unemployment and of the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio to a shock to labor productivity can be somewhat more persistent than in the Mortensen-Pissarides benchmark where each firm employs a single worker.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hawkins, William B.] Yeshiva Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10033 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Yeshiva University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",daron@mit.edu; whawkins@yu.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023","Hawkins, William/0000-0001-6697-0200",,,,,68,35,51,0,38,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Our empirical approach follows the logic of the differences-in-differences estimator. In addition to temporal variation arising from the WTO accession, which we argue was exogenous to other countries' growth trajectories, we exploit spatial variation arising from differences in natural resource wealth. This allows us to compare changes in economic growth in the post-accession period relative to the pre-accession period between countries that were able to benefit from the surge in demand for industrial commodities brought about by China's WTO accession and countries that were less able to do so. We find that roughly one tenth of average annual post-accession growth in resource-rich countries was due to China's increased appetite for commodities. We use this finding to inform the debate about what will happen to economic growth in resource-rich countries as China rebalances and its demand for commodities weakens. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Most economic models (altruistic, paternalistic or exchange models) postulate that bequest behavior does not depend per se on parents' behavior. Yet because of data limitations, few empirical studies have analyzed the link between bequests left and inheritances received. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of inheritance relative to lifetime income on the amount that individuals bequeath, in the case of France. This study uses original historical data including wealth genealogies covering the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries for the Loire Inf,rieure d,partement. Empirical evidence suggests that the propensity to bequeath is much greater for inheritance than for human resources: a deceased having inherited twice the average wealth leaves 35-60 % more to his own heirs that the average for his generation.

Annual firm-level surveys that begin in 1992, complemented with industry-wide census in 1995, 2004 and 2008, are rich sources of data on firm behavior. It is well-known that working with Chinese data requires overcoming difficult measurement issues. Macroeconomic series, for example, are often suspected of suffering from reporting bias and political interference. Working with the firm-level data has its own challenges. In this paper, we provide an introduction to these data sets. We discuss and illustrate several of the issues that make comparability over time difficult and suggest solutions. The importance of a particular measurement issue often depends on the exact application. We illustrate this point by tracing the evolution of the relative productivity level of entrants and incumbents over time, distinguishing between changes in actual performance and changes driven by measurement problems.

We show that they are an important feature in today's CEO labour market in China: around one-tenth of corporations deploy performance bonds and they are equivalent to around 14% of CEO cash compensation. Consistent with principal-agent theory bonds are negatively associated with firm sales volatility. The complementarity between bonds and other incentive mechanisms such as bonuses and stock holding is consistent with optimal reward structures for multi-tasking agents. Those CEOs posting bonds are higher in the Communist Party ranks, were promoted via tournaments, and run larger firms, findings consistent with using bonds as an incentive to attract and retain the most able workers. Although state-owned enterprises are just as likely as privately owned ones to use bonds in CEO contracts, some of the theoretical predictions which assume profit-maximising firms do not hold where the state has an ownership stake.

We focus on all major trade liberalization bills introduced since the early 1970s in the U.S. Congress, in which House and Senate members serve respectively two- and six-year terms and one third of senators face elections every two years. We show that senators are more likely to support trade liberalization than House representatives. However, this result does not hold for the last generation of senators, who face elections at the same time as House members, suggesting that inter-cameral differences are driven by term length. Considering senators alone, we find that the last generation is less likely to support trade liberalization than the previous two. This result is pervasive and holds both when comparing the behavior of different senators voting on the same bill and that of individual senators voting on different bills. The protectionist effect of election proximity disappears for senators who are retiring or hold safe seats. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Firms differ in their productivity levels and can employ children in producing a heterogeneous good. The effect of trade liberalization will depend on how changes in a firm's productivity parameter affects the relative productivity between adults and children. When the productivity elasticity of children is higher (lower) than that of adults, trade liberalization will result in an increase (decrease) in the demand for child labor. Increasing the risk of using child labor will decrease its demand in most scenarios.","[Estevez, Kristian] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Theory, Barcelona, Spain; [Levy, Ting] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",University of Barcelona; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Estevez, K (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Theory, Barcelona, Spain.",kestevez@ub.edu,"Estevez, Kristian/H-5353-2015","Estevez, Kristian/0000-0001-8808-6352",,,,,20,1,1,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

These features can be well described in terms of a long memory model that incorporates both peaks in the spectrum. It is found that the order of integration at the zero frequency is about 0.6, and the one at the cyclical frequency is substantially smaller (of about 03) with the length of the cycles being approximately of about 74 periods (months), which is consistent with the length suggested by the business cycle theory.

These two types of economies with and without a uniform pricing constraint for cash and debit card payments are compared in a microfounded monetary model. We place particular emphasis on the distinctive features of cash and debit cards as payment methods: the cost of a cash transaction for the seller is typically lower than that of a debit card, whereas the cost of cash holdings for the buyer is higher than that of a debit card. Our results suggest that a uniform pricing constraint makes cash-holding costs decline but consumption dispersion between the poor and the rich increase. Numerical examples show that the beneficial effect of the constraint dominates its negative effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this controversy, the EU dimension, far from being autonomous, involves a variety of international stakeholders, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations, private networks of entrepreneurs of memory, the United States and Israel. Qualifications are placed on the hypothesis whereby, in new member states, the denunciation of the crimes of Communism competes with the institutionalization of commemorations of the Shoah, since some Bulgarian entrepreneurs of memory have stakes in both. The Bulgarian/Macedonia controversy surrounding the commemoration of the Shoah presents a situation wherein the appropriation of the past by EU institutions has paradoxically reinforced the claims by Bulgarian public officials to legitimacy, to telling the historical truth, even as historians are trying to emancipate their discipline from its ancillary role at the nation-state's service.","Rech & Enseignante Sci Po CERI, Paris, France",,"Ragaru, N (通讯作者)，Rech & Enseignante Sci Po CERI, Paris, France.",nadege.ragaru@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,82,2,2,0,2,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Using a rich longitudinal data set spanning the 1992-2001 period, this study explores this relationship across workers based on age, education, and gender in Slovenia after its secession from Yugoslavia in 1991. The results indicate that the first ten years of transition to a market economy dramatically altered the relationship between the relative wages and productivity of different types of workers, yet yielded relatively little convergence toward the equilibrium wage relativities one would expect to observe if wages were equal the value of workers' marginal product. The estimates indicate that relative wage and differentials decreased for older workers, increased for educated workers, and remain relatively constant for women.","Bank Slovenia, Anal & Res Dept, Ljubljana, Slovenia",,"Vodopivec, M (通讯作者)，Bank Slovenia, Anal & Res Dept, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",,,,,,,,22,1,2,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

This database is built from value-added tax (VAT) invoices collected under a comprehensive management information system, the Golden Tax Project (GTP). This project was established in 1994 to monitor and administer VAT collection and has been improved over the subsequent years. We present the structure, function, and evolution of the GTP, which provides reliable information on transaction values across provinces. We have access only to part of the GTP data set relevant to internal trade. The data suggests that internal trade in China has grown quickly but with seasonal fluctuations. Although the interprovincial trade in China is smaller than the interstate trade in United States and the intra-European Union trade, the high growth rate of the interprovincial trade suggests that economic connections among the provinces are strengthening. The positive relationship between internal trade and international trade in most regressions suggests the possible complementarity between these two types of trade. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Inconsistencies in pork statistics in China,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Consumption; Pork; Production; Statistics,FOOD; CONSUMPTION; HOME,"Official agricultural statistics for China are subject to major inconsistencies and have long been questioned by researchers. The major problem with Chinese meat statistics is that reported meat supply is far greater than consumption, and this is particularly true for pork. Factors contributing to the gap between pork supply and consumption include production over-reporting, loss and waste in the pork supply chain, pork consumed away from home (FAFH), and a mismatch in the Chinese rural household survey between food and mouths (i.e. migrant workers and boarding students who are counted as rural household members but live in urban areas for much of the year). Our estimates indicate that over-reporting of pork production has declined substantially since 2003, but it is still significant and is the largest contributor to the gap between reported supply and consumption. Our estimates also indicate that pork consumption is significantly under-estimated because of FAFH and the rural mismatch between food and mouths. Reforms to the agricultural statistical system should be considered that increase the incentives to report accurate production statistics. Statistics are currently based on reports from local officials who have incentives to inflate production figures so as to improve their performance reviews and prospects for promotion, or they are overseen by local statistical personnel appointed by local governments.

Worker abilities are selected from a distribution while firms face heterogeneous entry costs and direct their job offers to workers. We identify conditions under which technical progress increases or decreases the job finding rate, allowing for entry and the effects of technical changes on heterogeneity. We find that the effects of skill-neutral technical progress on job finding rates are unambiguously non-negative, but the effects of skill-biased changes depend on the elasticity of vacancy costs.

Based on a stylized model of an import-competing duopolistic market, we show the feasibility of moving toward tariff reductions when both domestic and foreign firms launch CSR initiatives in that their payoffs include not only individual profits, but also the benefits of consumers. For the case where the foreign exporter unilaterally adopts the consumer-oriented CSR as a strategy, there is a rent-shifting effect because the foreign firm's payoff increases whereas the domestic firm's profit decreases. In response, the importing country's government raises its tariff on the foreign product. If, instead, the domestic firm adopts the CSR strategy unilaterally, the rent-shifting effect disappears and both the competing firms' payoffs increase. We further identify the conditions under which the CSR initiatives of the firms constitute the dominant strategy, leading to a Pareto efficient outcome at which the firms' payoffs, consumer surplus, and social welfare are at their maximum levels.","[Chang, Yang-Ming] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Chen, Hung-Yi] Soochow Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wang, Leonard F.

The result shows that: host governments usually give a specific tax holiday for outward foreign direct investors, and during the period of tax holiday investment decision of investors would be influenced by technology spillover effect, specifically, the greater the technology spillover the slower the growth of investment stock. Once the system reaches a stable state, the host country will impose a tax on multinational corporations.

These findings are highly relevant in the Latin American context where these kinds of cash transfers have become an important component of social protection systems.","[Maurizio, Roxana] Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Maurizio, Roxana] Natl Council Sci & Tech Res CONICET Argentina, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Vazquez, Gustavo] Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Maurizio, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",roxanadmaurizio@gmail.com; gmvazque@ungs.edu.ar,"Maurizio, Roxana/AAE-9674-2020",,,,,,32,6,7,0,6,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2014,,113,,,,,115,137,,,,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AU9BM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345886800007,0

We demonstrate this first theoretically in a simple two-country model and then quantitatively for the case of capital goods trade in a multi-country model. To be quantitatively consistent with the observed capital goods trade flows across countries, our model implies that trade barriers must be large, yet our model delivers capital goods prices that are similar across countries. The absence of barriers to trade in capital goods delivers price equalization in capital goods but cannot reproduce the observed trade flows. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Foreign direct investments have largely been transferred to third countries primarily from the perspective of cost-effective and global management strategies. It may be economically advantageous for a firm to move overseas from the perspective of firm-specific advantages and location-specific advantages. This study examines the effects of relationships of entry modes between the two specific advantages and determines factors affecting a wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS). The existing empirical literature on the macro determinants was reviewed and correlations with key determinations that are subsequently tested in our empirical specification were identified. Hypotheses were derived from previous studies and relevant data were examined by means of a direct survey through decision-makers (CEO and/or senior officers) from February to May, 2012. A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) was applied to test two hypotheses with respect to Entry Modes. The GEE model presented highly significant p-values and most of all the coefficients supported our previous studies. This study has found that the mode of entry into South Korea shows highly significant location-specific factors rather than firm-specific factors. However, the firm-specific factors were found to have positive effects on the location of the headquarters, the size of the firm and investment motivation.

A binding capacity constraint induces firms to raise prices in order to take advantage of access to new markets. This generates markets with a flexible competitive structure giving rise to instances where trade and trade liberalization negatively impact welfare. Its key predictions can be identified by observing the presence of small yet highly productive firms and substitution by firms across markets as accessibility evolves. Using Thai firm-level data I establish the prevalence of these anomalous firms and demonstrate they face capacity constraints. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We propose procedures that offer more reliable inference results, and the corrected inferences indicate that the aggregate data of dividends and returns alone do not provide strong enough evidence to support the notion that the expected returns dominate the stock price variation. However, we show that an alternative measure of cash flows termed the net payout by Larrain and Yogo (2008) appears to lend strong support to the notion that the expected cash flow explains a large fraction of the firm value variation.

Using nationally representative samples of older people collected before and during the crisis, we show that mean net assets fell by 45% between 2006/7 and 2012/13. In spite of this massive fall in wealth, measures of health and well-being remained broadly unchanged. However, expectations about future living standards became less optimistic.

The model assumes infinitely lived, overlapping generations that maximize lifetime utility, and competitive firms that maximize their net present value in the presence of adjustment costs for investment. Domestic securities are assumed perfect substitutes for foreign securities and the economy is assumed small in the sense of being a price taker in international goods and assets markets. It is shown that the endogenous growth rate is determined solely as a function of the determinants of domestic investment, such as the world real interest rate, the technology of domestic production and adjustment costs for investment and is independent of the preferences of domestic households and budgetary policies. The preferences of consumers and budgetary policies determine the savings rate. The current account and external balance are functions of the difference between the savings and the investment rates. The world real interest rate affects growth negatively but has a positive impact on external balance. The productivity of domestic capital affects growth positively but causes a deterioration in external balance. Population growth, government consumption and government debt affect the current account and external balance negatively, but do not affect the endogenous growth rate.","Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, GR-10434 Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Alogoskoufis, G (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, 76 Patiss St, GR-10434 Athens, Greece.",alogoskoufis@me.com,"Alogoskoufis, George/HLP-6819-2023","Alogoskoufis, George/0000-0001-6196-6325",,,,,16,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We propose two alternative measurements based on current investment expenditures: one eliminates the capital stock by direct substitution, while the other employs generalized differences of detrended data and the Malmquist index. In short samples, these measures can exhibit consistently lower root mean squared errors than the Solow-Tornqvist counterpart. Capital measurement problems are particularly severe for economies still far from their steady state. This drawback of the Solow residual is thus most acute in applications in which its accuracy is most highly valued. As an application, we compute and compare TFP growth measures for developing countries in the Heston-Summers dataset. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show that if the principal prefers a poorer agent for all specifications of action sets, probability distributions, and disutility of effort, then the agent's utility of income must exhibit a coefficient of absolute prudence less than three times the coefficient of absolute risk aversion for all levels of income, thus strengthening the sufficiency result of Thiele and Wambach (1999). Also, we prove that there is no condition on the agent's utility of income alone that will make the principal prefer richer agents. Moreover, we show that, for an interesting class of problems, the principal prefers a relatively poorer agent if agent's wealth is sufficiently large.

Increases in the interest rate to reduce departures of inflation from the target imply that a higher primary surplus is required for stabilizing public debt/GDP ratio. This tricky situation is known as unpleasant fiscal arithmetic (UFA). This article develops a theoretical model showing how increased financial openness and capital account liberalization can mitigate UFA. Furthermore, empirical evidence from the Brazilian case through OLS, GMM, and GMM system methods is offered. The findings show that increases in capital mobility and financial openness work as a commitment technology, which contributes to the success of the inflation targeting and thus reduces the risk of UFA.","[de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira; Veiga, Igor da Silva] Univ Fed Fluminense, BR-24220000 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira] Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev CNPq, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense,"de Mendonça, HF (通讯作者)，Rua Dr Sodre 59, BR-26900000 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",helderfm@hotmail.com,"de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira/A-7415-2009","de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira/0000-0003-1465-1755",,,,,26,5,5,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

It is widely believed that turnout is negatively related to bond approval rates. Conclusions from previous empirical research, however, may be misleading because many sociodemographic factors and election parameters that influence bond support are also likely to influence voter turnout decisions. To account for the endogeneity of turnout, we employ an instrumental variable approach. We find that the persistent part of voter turnout plays a negligible role in explaining bond approval shares conditioned on election timing, past voting behavior, and district characteristics. Using first-difference models, change in turnout has a negative and significant influence on change in approval share and probability of bond success. Our results support previous research and suggest that targeted voter mobilization strategies have the potential to influence school bond outcomes.","[Gong, Huan; Rogers, Cynthia L.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Rogers, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, 308 Cate Ctr Dr,Rm 158, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",hgong7770@gmail.com; crogers@ou.edu,,,,,,,51,9,20,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Our analysis extends the literature on family bargaining by i) arguing that transfers from the couple represent semiprivate consumption (e.g. it is plausible that the wife cares more about her parents than about the husband's parents, and vice-versa) and ii) using results from laboratory experiments to help identify the model. We find that women have slightly more bargaining power than men in the couple's decision making. We also find that when an adult child receives an extra dollar of income, she transfers half of it to her parents; this result is consistent with previous work.

Using an analytical model and a numerical general equilibrium model, we analyse the welfare effects of carbon taxes and their interaction with other taxes applied in Russia. We find that substituting carbon taxes for labour taxes in Russia can substantially reduce the cost of carbon taxation compared to returning carbon tax revenues to households in lump-sum form and can even result in welfare gains in Russia. In conclusion, introducing carbon taxes has an indirect corrective effect with respect to the distorting effect of export taxation on energy resources. Furthermore, welfare costs of carbon taxation can be significant under the assumption of perfect international mobility of capital. Nevertheless, the cost can be more than compensated in case of a high carbon trade price.","[Orlov, Anton; Grethe, Harald] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Agr & Food Policy 420A, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Orlov, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Agr & Food Policy 420A, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",anton.orlov@cicero.oslo.no; grethe@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Orlov, Anton/0000-0003-3670-597X",,,,,36,4,4,0,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Firms choose between two strategies, either they engage in R&D or abstain from own R&D and imitate the outcomes of innovators. This yields three types of equilibria, in which either all firms innovate, some firms innovate and others imitate, or no firm innovates. Firms' equilibrium strategies crucially depend on external factors. We find that the efficiency of intellectual property rights protection positively affects firms' incentives to engage in R&D, while excessive competitive pressure has a negative effect. In addition, smaller firms are found to be more likely to become imitators when the product is homogeneous and the level of spillovers is high. Regarding social welfare our results indicate that strengthening intellectual property protection can have an ambiguous effect. In markets characterized by a high rate of innovation a reduction of intellectual property rights protection can discourage innovative performance substantially. However, a reduction of patent protection can also increase social welfare because it may induce imitation. This indicates that policy issues such as the optimal length and breadth of patent protection cannot be resolved without taking into account specific market and firm characteristics.","[Slivko, Olga] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Res Dept Informat & Commun Technol, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus 43204, Spain; [Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Reus 43204, Spain",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Slivko, O (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Res Dept Informat & Commun Technol, L 7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",slivko@zew.de; bernd.theilen@urv.cat,"Theilen, Bernd/Z-1589-2019","Slivko, Olga/0000-0001-6062-2870; Theilen, Bernd/0000-0001-7141-2780",,,,,45,20,22,3,77,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Unlike in standard taxation models, firms do not know workers' abilities, and competitively screen them through non-linear compensation contracts, unobservable to the government, in a Miyazaki-Wilson-Spence equilibrium. Adverse selection leads to different optimal tax formulas than in the standard Mirrlees (1971) model because of the use of work hours as a screening tool by firms, which for higher talent workers results in a rat race, and for lower talent workers in informational rents and cross-subsidies. The most surprising result is that, if the government has sufficiently strong redistributive goals, welfare is higher when there is adverse selection than when there is not.

The decomposition addresses the issue of interaction effects between factors which have been neglected in the decomposition literature. It has the additional advantage of being path-independent and aggregation consistent.

CO2 emission reduction and development of associated industry, bioethanol-blended gasoline without subsidy is more expensive than pure gasoline in Korea. The renewable fuel standard (RFS) can contribute to the development of a bioethanol market. However, without controlling the portions of domestic bioethanol, it is highly plausible that a new bioethanol market will be filled with imported bioethanol. If the entire supply of bioethanol is imported, Korea can no longer expect those co-benefits. This study aims at simulating the desirable ratios of domestic versus imported bioethanol as well as domestic versus imported feedstock for producing bioethanol in Korea by combining the marginal social benefit (MSB) with the marginal social cost (MSC) for bioethanol supply. MSB is derived from a choice experiment and the MSC is derived from the differences in the bioethanol production costs and the petroleum price. The simulation results show that considerable portions of bioethanol should be produced domestically under the condition that MSB is equivalent to MSC in bioethanol production. Thus, the upcoming RFS policy should allow for some quota on behalf of domestic bioethanol with domestic feedstock or more credit should be given to the petroleum companies that use domestic bioethanol with domestic feedstock.","Chonnam Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, Kwangju, South Korea",Chonnam National University,"Bae, JH (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, 77 Bukgu, Kwangju, South Korea.",jhbae@jnu.ac.kr,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,15,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

First, it is demonstrated that both profit-led and wage-led growth regimes can be accommodated within the Marxian circuit of capital model.

By setting sufficiently high red tape, the politician induces the incumbent firm in the intermediate sector to invest in political connections, which are valued also by voters, who recognize that bureaucratic costs can be reduced by connected firms. Within this framework, we study the Markov perfect equilibria of an infinitely repeated game among politicians, firms, and voters, and show that all equilibria are characterized by investments in political connections and the re-election of the incumbent politician. Political connections may prevent entry of advanced competitors and cause the economy to lag behind the technological frontier.

In this paper, we assume the adoption of new transport technology when trade increases and show that, given the standard effect of a PTA on regional trade, the welfare would be higher than that usually claimed due to the induced effect on the regional transport network. Moreover, there is evidence that with such sunk costs in transportation, the sequence of trade liberalisation matters: the free trade achieved under a regional PTA would lead to permanently higher welfare than the one achieved under multilateral liberalisation. A standard model of inter- and intra-industry trade is used and augmented by a 'hub-and-spoke' transport network structure, where transport costs depend on the distance between trade partners, the volume of trade and the level of development. Under a plausible parameterisation for scale economies in transport, regional liberalisation will have persistent effect on trade flows through an irreversible effect on regional transport costs that improve welfare.","[Carrere, Celine] Univ Geneva, Global Studies Inst, CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland; [Carrere, Celine] FERDI, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Geneva,"Carrère, C (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Global Studies Inst, CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland.",celine.carrere@unige.ch,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

A well-known result is that -price auctions dissolve a partnership efficiently when the share structure is sufficiently close to equal. We extend the setup in two directions. First, we introduce complementarities by assuming a nontrivial continuation value of the partnership that is lost in case of dissolution. This makes inefficient breakups as well as continuation possible outcomes. Second, we assume that dissolution is not given, but must be triggered by a deliberate decision of at least one partner. This implies a signaling game, where calling for dissolution signals private information. We show that, in our extended setting, standard -price auctions cannot dissolve a two-player equal-share partnership ex post efficiently.

This study aims to evaluate how effective tax incentives are in stimulating salary sacrifice participation. Using a regression discontinuity framework, we measure the response of individuals to different levels of tax concessions on salary sacrifice contributions. Results indicate that current tax incentives have a limited effect, if any, on the decision to make salary sacrifice arrangements. This result is consistent with more recent empirical research from the Northern Hemisphere. It is likely that the lack of response is due to the complexity of the incentive schemes in Australia and competing vehicles for long-term savings.","Monash Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Caulfield, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Feng, J (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Caulfield, Vic, Australia.",jimmy.feng@monash.edu,,"Feng, Jun/0000-0002-2417-0114",,,,,35,4,4,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Specifically, I examine which of two modes of conduct, Bertrand-Nash competition or collusion, better fits the data. Unlike previous literature, this paper employs a differentiated product approach to address the stylized discrepancy in refiners' brands' prices: stable stratification of prices among refiners, but an unlikely equilibrium outcome in the homogenous goods market. Correct understanding of refiners' conduct is important because appropriate policy responses to collusion differ significantly from appropriate responses to competition-driven outcomes. The results of this paper support the hypothesis that Bertrand-Nash competition better explains refiners' conduct.","[Jin, Yangsoo] KIM & CHANG, Seoul 110720, South Korea",,"Jin, Y (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seyang Bldg,223 Naeja Dong, Seoul 110720, South Korea.",yangsoo.jin@kimchang.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Despite the dramatic change in the macroeconomic dynamics that this event is likely to have caused, the literature has paid little attention to testing for the existence of such a break and establishing its qualitative characteristics. This empirical study, based on the Blanchard and Quah (1989) methodology for seven countries having adopted the Euro currency and three members of the European Union which have preserved their own currencies reveals: i) very significant breaks for the Euro countries around 1992- the year of adoption of the Maastricht Treaty - and 2000, not shared by the three non-Euro countries. ii) an increase in the influence of supply shocks on the dynamics of output, unemployment and the interest rate after the breaks for the Euro countries, along with an increase of the part played by monetary disturbances within total demand at long horizons. These conclusions do not generally hold for the three non-Euro countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although it is commonly assumed that agents learn over time, there is scant empirical evidence in support of this assumption. Thus, in this paper we test if the forecast of the three month 1-bill rate in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) is consistent with least squares learning when there are discrete shifts in monetary policy. We first derive the mean, variance and autocovariances of the forecast errors from a recursive least squares learning algorithm when there are breaks in the structure of the model. We then apply the Bai and Perron (1998) test for structural change to a forecasting model for the three month 1-bill rate in order to identify changes in monetary policy. Having identified the policy regimes, we then estimate the implied biases in the interest rate forecasts within each regime. We find that when the forecast errors from the SPF are corrected for the biases due to shifts in policy, the forecasts are consistent with least squares learning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We approached about 4500 households, each participating in an all-pay auction, a lottery, a non-anonymous voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM), or an anonymous VCM. In contrast to the VCMs, households in the all-pay auction and the lottery competed for a prize. Although the all-pay auction is the superior fundraising mechanism both in theory and in the laboratory, it did not raise the highest revenue per household in the field and even raised significantly less than the anonymous VCM. Our experiment reveals that this can be attributed to substantially lower participation in the all-pay auction than in the other mechanisms while the average donation for those who contribute is only slightly (and statistically insignificantly) higher. We explore various explanations for this lower participation and favor one that argues that competition in the all-pay mechanism crowds out intrinsic motivations to contribute.

The first is people's disproportionate disposition to help those they agree with while the second is the dependence of peoples' self-esteem on the extent to which they perceive that others agree with them. Government spending crowds out the charity that ensues from these forces only modestly. Moreover, people's donations tend to rise when others donate. In some equilibria of the model, poor people give little because they expect donations to come mainly from richer individuals. In others, donations by poor individuals constitute a large fraction of donations and this raises the incentive for poor people to donate. The model provides interpretations for episodes in which the number of charities rises while total donations are stagnant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly, when the spillover effect is so strong that the investment by one firm is beneficial to its R&D active rivals, all active firms will choose the same technology. A similar result can be derived from a socially desirable point of view except that the cut-off magnitude of spillovers is different.

In a controlled laboratory environment, we compare the performance of two university admissions procedures that both initially reserve a significant fraction of seats at each university for a special subgroup of students. The first mechanism mimics the sequential procedure currently used by the central clearinghouse for university admissions in Germany. This procedure starts by allocating reserved seats among eligible students and then allocates all remaining seats among those who were not already assigned one of the reserved seats in the first part of the procedure. The second mechanism is based on a modified student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm in which all seats are allocated simultaneously. In theory, the two mechanisms should lead to similar outcomes. Our experimental results, however, suggest that, relative to the sequential procedure, the simultaneous mechanism significantly improves the match outcomes for the beneficiaries of reserved seats.

We first establish a negative effect of trade intensity on exchange rate volatility using panel regressions, with distance as an instrument to correct for endogeneity. We also estimate a nonlinear model of mean reversion to compute half-lives of deviations of bilateral exchange rates from the levels dictated by relative PPP, and find these half-lives to be significantly shorter for high trade intensity currency pairs. This result does not appear to be driven by Central Bank intervention. Finally, we show that conditioning on PPP may help improve the performance of popular currency trading strategies, such as the carry trade, especially for low trade intensity currency pairs.

It analyzes the effect changes in well-being, age, health, wealth, employment status, gender, and education have on economic insecurity. The results show that the most significant variable is current exposure to adverse events, the second most significant is age, and the third is health. The current exposure to adverse events produces great anxiety and concern about and the inability to recover from these bad events. Older households assign higher probabilities to negative prospects and are thus subject to higher levels of economic insecurity. This also occurs when the household head is seriously ill. The effect of gender and wealth on negative expectations is very small, while education only affects Mexico, and self-employment affects only Chile. Finally, the similarities between Chile and Mexico provide evidence of identifiable patterns for economic insecurity in Latin American countries.","[Espinosa, Javier; Friedman, Jorge; Yevenes, Carlos] Univ Santiago, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Friedman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago, Dept Econ, Alameda 3363, Santiago, Chile.",Jorge.friedman@usach.cl,"friedman, jorge/ABC-4538-2021","friedman, jorge/0000-0002-3262-1296; Espinosa, Javier/0000-0003-0341-2708",,,,,15,8,8,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

J,"Kayatekin, SA",,,,"Kayatekin, Serap Ayse",,,The relation of morality to political economy in Hume,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hume; Morality; Political economy; Passions; Reason; Normative economics; Positive economics,,"In his Treatise of Human Nature, Hume argues that reason does not motivate action but rather directs our judgement by informing us about their causes and effects. He distances, in his argument, passions from reason by claiming that passions are not ideas, do not represent anything, are self-contained and thus cannot be contradictory to truth or reason. Moral judgements, according to Hume, are passions and as such they cannot be contrary to reason. For Hume, morality does not consist of immutable principles to be discovered by reason; it is based on human passions, which, through repetition, human beings come to associate with certain moral characteristics. Following on this statement, I here explore the following point: to the extent economic behaviour is determined by passions such as greed, benevolence and pleasure, we cannot separate economic activity and morality. As an extension, morality and political economy are inextricably linked in Hume. This suggests that ethics, through the study of morality and political economy, and the study of economic behaviour and institutions are inseparable subjects. It is interesting to observe this in the work of Hume, a fundamental influence on Adam Smith, one of the most important precursors of modern economics. The paper underlines the importance of understanding the evolution of the history of economic thinking that led to modern-day economics and which, though claiming Hume via Smith as one of its progenitors, argues for a complete separation of ethics and economics. In particular, the separation of positive from normative economics becomes infeasible in light of Hume's analysis, rendering problematic the claim of modern economics that Hume is the founding father.","Yasar Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Yasar University,"Kayatekin, SA (通讯作者)，Yasar Univ, Dept Econ, Univ Caddesi,Agacli Yol 35-37, Izmir, Turkey.",skayatekin@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Are there institutional preconditions that encourage such changes when present and discourage such changes when absent? I employ a general model which suggests that cascades which induce massive equilibrium changes are more likely to occur in regimes with centralized coercive power, defined as the ability to impose more than one type of sanction (economic, legal, political, social, or religious). Centralized authorities are better able to suppress subversive actions when external shocks are small, as citizens have little incentive to incur numerous types of sanctions. However, citizens are also more likely to lie about their internal preferences in such regimes (e.g., falsely declare loyalty to an oppressive government), entailing that larger shocks are more likely to trigger a cascade to a vastly different equilibrium. The model is applied to the severity of protests that followed austerity measures taken in developing nations since the 1970s.

An extension toward a two-region world economy shows robustness of results and other interesting interaction between forerunners and followers of the Industrial Revolution.","[Strulik, Holger] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Lower Saxony, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Strulik, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Lower Saxony, Germany.",holger.strulik@wiwi.uni-dgoettingen.de,,"Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,68,8,9,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Specifically, do students learn more in class if they attend more classes, or does class attendance create incentives for students to study harder outside class? To better understand this relationship, we designed an attendance policy in an economics course that does not significantly change students' attendance rates. Students who scored below a cut-off on the midterm exam were required to attend subsequent class lectures even though attendance had been implicitly made mandatory for all students, accounting for 10% of the course grade. Our regression discontinuity analysis suggests that our attendance policy significantly improved students' performance on the final exam, even though it had minimal impacts on their attendance rates. We also found that the policy worked via inducing students to reallocate their time spent studying other courses outside class to economics.","[Chen, Qihui] China Agr Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Int Ctr Appl Econ & Policy Res, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Okediji, Tade O.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",China Agricultural University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Okediji, TO (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",tokediji@umn.edu,"Chen, Qihui/I-2813-2019","Chen, Qihui/0000-0002-0944-0470",,,,,8,3,3,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We use the perspective of attention grabbing to analyse the market reaction to the dissemination of analysts' recommendations published in print media. This perspective is able to explain the asymmetric market reaction to buy' and sell' advice, which is difficult to rationalize within the price pressure hypothesis. We base our empirical analysis on the content of a weekly column in the most important Italian financial newspaper, which publishes past information and analysts' recommendations on listed companies. Our findings show asymmetric price and volume reactions on the publication day. Contrary to previous evidence, we document a positive relationship between the number of analysts quoted in the column and the price (volume) increase associated with positive recommendations. Because the weekly columns seem to simply attract investors' attention, with no additional new information, observing a reaction positively related to the column's salience (proxied by the number of quoted analysts) is natural. In addition, we find that the market reaction is higher when the order size is lower, i.e., when individual investors' trades constitute a higher fraction of the total trading activity in the market.","[Cervellati, Enrico Maria; Pattitoni, Pierpaolo] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Cervellati, Enrico Maria; Ferretti, Riccardo; Pattitoni, Pierpaolo] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Cefin, Ctr Studi Banca & Finanza, Modena, Italy; [Ferretti, Riccardo] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Commun & Econ, I-42121 Modena, Italy",University of Bologna; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Ferretti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Cefin, Ctr Studi Banca & Finanza, Modena, Italy.",riccardo.ferretti@unimore.it,"Pattitoni, Pierpaolo/P-2817-2019","Pattitoni, Pierpaolo/0000-0002-5283-1784",,,,,49,9,9,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using a panel data with 9 countries from 1870 onwards, we first show that the consumption-to-output ratio is minimal during WWII for participants. While this can be explained by an increase in public spending in the USA, this cannot be the case in other countries that participated in WWII, as they experience a large fall in output during wartime. To account for this, we build a variation of a Real Business Cycle model first proposed by Hercowitz and Sampson (1991). We extend the initial model to account for specific shocks that destroy private and public capital stocks - as conflicts do - by assuming an (exogenously) time-varying parameter in the law of capital accumulation. In addition, the model imbeds generalized TFP shocks capturing standard technological factors as well as the potential effects of war on the labor force. The model is estimated and used (i) to assess the importance of capital shocks during war episodes, and (ii) to quantify the welfare effects of conflicts. We show that capital shocks are crucial to account for the macroeconomic dynamics of countries that have experienced large war-related destruction, and that the welfare losses from fluctuations can be quite large when considering data samples that include major war episodes.

The increase in the long-run income elasticity is consistent with shifts in the composition of aggregate imports toward capital and consumer goods.

By employing a Heckman two-step estimation model, which controls for possible sample selection bias due to many zero bilateral observations, we find that labor taxes do influence FDI decisions.","[Hansson, Asa; Olofsdotter, Karin] Lund Univ Sweden, Dept Econ, Box 7082, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Hansson, Asa] Res Inst Ind Econ, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Hansson, Å (通讯作者)，Lund Univ Sweden, Dept Econ, Box 7082, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden.",asa.hansson@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,42,7,7,4,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

In other words, volatility caused by shocks is more persistent than that caused by financial underdevelopment. We decompose the business-cycle and long-run volatility by the spectral method and then test the hypotheses at the cross-country level. Empirical evidence provides support for both hypotheses. Higher private credit, a bank-based measure of financial development, dampens business-cycle volatility but not long-run volatility. Volatility of shocks, as measured by the volatility of changes in the terms of trade, magnifies both business-cycle and long-run volatility. The results are robust to accounting for endogeneity, a market-based measure of financial development, and an alternative method of volatility decomposition.","[Mallick, Debdulal] Deakin Univ, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Mallick, D (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",dmallic@deakin.edu.au,"Rajkumar, Muniyandi/H-4125-2015",,,,,,56,10,12,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Evaluating a set of measures in Spain,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fuel consumption; Cross-elasticities; Transport policies; Biofuel; Speed limit reduction,COMBUSTION ENGINES; SUBSIDIES; TRANSPORT,"Using a panel of 48 provinces for four years we empirically analyze a series of temporary and permanent policies aimed at curbing fuel consumption implemented in Spain between March and June 2011. The first policy was a reduction in the speed limit in highways. The second policy was an increase in the biofuel content of fuels used in the transport sector. The third measure was a decrease of 5% in commuting and regional train fares that resulted in two major metropolitan areas reducing their overall fare for public transit. The results indicate that the speed limit reduction in highways lowered gasoline consumption by 2% to 3%, while an increase in the biofuel content of gasoline increased this consumption. This last result is consistent with experimental evidence that indicates that mileage per liter falls with an increase in the biofuel content in gasolines. As for the reduction in transit fares, we do not find a significant effect for this policy. However, in specifications including the urban transit fare for the major cities in each province the estimated cross-price elasticity of the demand for gasoline - used as a proxy for car use - with respect to the price of transit is within the range reported in the literature. This is important since one of the main efficiency justifications for subsidizing public transit rests on the positive value of this parameter and most of the estimates reported in the literature are quite dated.

Buyers may spend nothing, a fraction or all of their money holdings, depending on their preference-shock realizations. Inflation reduces the extent of non-linear pricing.

We take stock of what the euro area crisis has taught us about monetary integration. At the inception of the euro area in 1999, the main parameters of the theory of monetary integration seemed to have been pretty well-settled. Although it was common knowledge that the euro area fell short of fully satisfying all the conditions needed for an optimally-functioning monetary union, most politicians and many economists thought that the euro area satisfied enough conditions so that it would not encounter major difficulties. This paper discusses several developments that came as surprises about the conditions needed for monetary unification as the euro crisis unfolded. These developments include the need of an adequate adjustment mechanism, the links between banking and sovereign crises, and the sharp costs of adjustment to adverse asymmetric shocks.

I highlight five facts about differences between gross and value-added exports. These differences are large and growing over time, currently around 25 percent, and manufacturing trade looks more important, relative to services, in gross than value-added terms. These differences are also heterogenous across countries and bilateral partners, and changing unevenly across countries and partners over time. Taking these differences into account enables researchers to obtain better quantitative answers to important macroeconomic and trade questions.

We find that the role of the state in adaptation policy is limited. We identify information policy, the provision of a suitable regulatory framework in some markets, the formation of human capital and policies fostering economic growth, as well as technological and medical knowledge as the main areas in which the public sector has a role in climate change adaptation.

Standard theory, which supposes that persons want more income and more leisure, does not predict how they resolve the tension between these desires. Empirical studies of labor supply have imposed strong preference assumptions that lack foundation. This paper examines anew the problem of inference on income-leisure preferences and considers the implications for evaluation of tax policy. I first perform a basic revealed-preference analysis assuming only that persons prefer more income and leisure. This shows that observation of a person's time allocation under a status quo tax policy may bound his allocation under a proposed policy or may have no implications, depending on the tax schedules and the person's status quo time allocation. I next explore the identifying power of two classes of assumptions that restrict the distribution of income-leisure preferences. One assumes that groups of persons who face different choice sets have the same preference distribution. The second restricts the shape of this distribution. The generic finding is partial identification of preferences. This implies partial prediction of tax revenue under proposed policies and partial knowledge of the welfare function for utilitarian policy evaluation.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",cfmanski@northwestern.edu,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,21,23,2,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

This problem can be mitigated by using expandable orders or iceberg orders, or by splitting a large order into smaller ones. An expandable order gives a trader an option to sequentially expand the size of his trade while holding the price fixed. An iceberg order enables a trader to commit to a maximal trade size at some price, without fully revealing that size to other traders. This paper provides a theoretical model of expandable orders and the accompanying quantity negotiation, called (also by practitioners) the workup. The workup is ubiquitous in the U.S. and Canadian bond markets and in over-the-counter markets. The model suggests that even when iceberg orders are available, traders will still use the workup if splitting an order is prohibitively costly, front-running is a threat, and the exchange lacks trust.","Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Pancs, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",rpancs@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,2,3,1,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

We propose and analyze a particular market failure that leads to inefficiently low fertility in equilibrium. The friction is caused by the lack of ownership of children: if parents have no claim on their children's income, the private benefit from producing a child can be smaller than the social benefit. We analyze an overlapping-generations (OLG) model with fertility choice and parental altruism. Ownership is modeled as a minimum constraint on transfers from parents to children. Using the efficiency concepts proposed in Golosov, Jones, and Tertilt [38], we find that whenever the transfer floor is binding, fertility choices are inefficient. Second, we show that the usual conditions for efficiency are not sufficient in this context. Third, in contrast to settings with exogenous fertility, a PAYG social security system cannot be used to implement efficient allocations. To achieve an efficient outcome, government transfers need to be tied to fertility choice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Open space conservation will likely increase total land values and municipal services in metropolitan areas that have stringent land use regulations, high development densities, and relatively little open space, but will likely reduce municipal services and total land values in small, lightly regulated cities surrounded by rural land and fiscally constrained in providing essential public goods (H4, R3, Q2).

On the basis of evidence on the productivity of public capital, we estimate public debt targets that governments should maintain if they wish to maximize growth for panels of OECD, EU and euro area countries. These are not arbitrary numbers, but are founded on long-run optimizing behaviour assuming that governments implement the golden rule of financing; that is, they contract debt only to finance public investment. Our estimates suggest that the euro area should target debt levels of around 50% of GDP if member states are to have common targets. That is about 15% points lower than the estimate for the growth-maximizing debt ratio in our OECD sample and comfortably within the Stability and Growth Pact's debt ceiling of 60% of GDP.

The use of a disaggregated data is an important feature of our empirical strategy: the undervaluation index (main covariate) is less likely to be determined by the growth rate of a specific manufacturing sector, partially addressing the specification problem that plagues standard cross-country regressions. We then explore the within sector-country variation to study the relationship between currency over/undervaluation and manufacturing sectors growth.

One reason for choosing this specification is that the periodogram of the hours worked series has a peak at a frequency away from zero. The empirical results confirm that this model works extremely well for hours worked. and it is then employed to analyse their relationship with productivity.

We show how the impact of patents on innovation, as determined by these two opposing effects, varies with industry characteristics. When the discount factor is sufficiently high, the negative profit division effect is negligible, and innovation monotonically increases in patent strength; otherwise, innovation has an inverted-U relationship with patent strength, and stronger patents are more likely to increase innovation when the discount factor or the fixed innovation cost is higher.

While inflation is an important determinant of EMP, we conclude that Chile and Peru are more likely than Mexico and Brazil to face pressure when commodity prices fall.

This paper presents a stochastic environmental DEA model that can measure environmental performance under random conditions. The proposed model has been applied to evaluate the environmental performance of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies in 2010. The results indicate that the stochastic pure environmental performance of APEC economies is indeed affected by random factors.

Productivity indices suffer from micro-level markup variation and underestimate entrants' productivity, when productivity is measured by nominal sales and expenditures but not quantities. This study makes the first attempt to estimate entrants' productivity by controlling for their markup difference, when prices or quantities are unobserved at the firm-level. The econometric methodology introduces demand side into a structural model of production to account for the price variation. The estimation routine deals with the endogeneity due to unobserved productivity using a control function approach, and retrieves average markups for entrants and incumbents together with a markup-adjusted productivity index. My findings show that entrants set on average lower markups than incumbents in Japanese manufacturing. When productivity is adjusted to markups, entrants are as productive as incumbents, while the standard measures of labor and total factor productivity indicate low productivity for entrant firms.

The results not only offer strong evidences that the natural resource production non-linearly impacts on urbanization process, but also show that there exists a dynamic response over time and space as well as space-time diffusion impact, in which these percentages are different from each other confirming an asymmetric effect of the natural resource production on urbanization process.

Our empirical results indicate that firms do not have a common shape of the growth rate distribution at the sectorial NAICS level, whereas firms may typically be described by the same shape of the distribution at the subsectorial level, even if the specific shape may not be the same for different subsectors.

Considering that the global economic crisis is hurting corporate profits, analysing the implications of CO2 emissions constraints for company business performance (BP) is a crucial task for both policymakers and companies. In this context, we analyse the relationship between surplus of allowances (SA) and BP in Spanish firms during the period 2005 to 2010. Using quantile regression techniques that provide a more complete picture of the relationship between the analysed variables, we draw two conclusions. First, an increase in company activity effectiveness led to a decrease in SA, indicating that activity effectiveness was not linked to good environmental performance, in terms of wasting the minimum number of allowances. Second, a decrease in SA, i.e., buying more or selling less EUAs is linked to an increase in company profitability. This provides evidence that the price of EUA was not sufficiently high to create a cost advantage for firms reducing their emissions. Based on our results, two policy measures are proposed.","[Segura, Sara; Ferruz, Luis] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Gargallo, Pilar; Salvador, Manuel] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Segura, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",ssegura@unizar.es,"Ferruz, Luis/AAF-7886-2019; Salvador, Manuel/H-2664-2015; Gargallo Valero, Pilar/H-2636-2015","Gargallo Valero, Pilar/0000-0003-1205-1756",,,,,16,9,9,1,82,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Political connection has been alleged as valuable in popular press in this mid-income economy studied, so it is worth an investigation. Significant share price increases of 4% or more abnormal returns accrue to connected firms relative to unconnected firms when identical political events occur. The impact is very pronounced during a severe economic crisis, when the stakes were high about an incumbent government being reelected. Our finding of higher value of politically connected firms is due to the expected value of preferential treatments, preference in project selections, and access to state benefits. Thus, share prices of politically connected firms react with greater impacts than nonpolitically connected firms to announcements of identical political events.","[Chen, C.

This can be realized either by temporarily reducing the fishing effort (i.e. capacity utilization) or quotas in the hope of increasing the resources available or reducing the actual fishing capacity. In both cases, the relationship between effort indicators and capacity needs to be resolved in order for the manager to introduce the right interventions. Previous studies have estimated these relationships in multi-species fisheries using either a multi-output distance function approach (DFA) or with a second stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. In this article, DEA and DFA are combined to reduce noise in the estimation and to establish more useful interpretations for the manager. The article compares the traditional DFA with the alternative approach for the Danish North Sea demersal trawlers. The alternative approach improves the estimation results and provides better estimates of efficiency scores, compared to the unadjusted DFA. Furthermore, the analyses suggest that the demersal trawlers have a limited ability to substitute catches of cod, plaice and Nephrops and that gross tonnage is a more consistent indicator of fishing capacity than engine power.","[Thogersen, Thomas T.] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Thogersen, TT (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",thth@foi.ku.dk,"; Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011","Thogersen, Thomas Talund/0000-0003-1619-2900; Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649",,,,,47,7,7,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We reexamine classic results on optimal commodity taxation and find a rich set of new findings. Two dynamic effects exist. First, households anticipating higher future addictive tax rates reduce current addictive consumption, so they will be less addicted when the tax rate increases. Therefore, addictive tax revenue falls prior to the tax increase. Surprisingly, the optimal tax rate on addictive goods is generally decreasing in the strength of tolerance, since strong tolerance strengthens this tax anticipation effect. Second, high current tax rates on addictive goods make households less addicted in the future, affecting all future tax revenues in a way which depends on how elasticities are changing over time. Classic results on uniform commodity taxation emerge as special cases when elasticities are constant and the addiction function is homogeneous of degree one. Finally, we also study features of addictive goods such as complementarity to leisure that, while not directly related to the definition of addiction, are nonetheless properties many addictive goods display.","[Bossi, Luca] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro] Deakin Univ, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Kelly, David L.] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Deakin University; University of Miami,"Bossi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",boluca@econ.upenn.edu,"Kelly, David L/D-1398-2013; Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro/AAS-6934-2020; Kelly, David/JMQ-6083-2023","Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro/0000-0002-3637-9142; Kelly, David/0000-0002-6132-6317",,,,,52,0,0,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This is because, joint patent ownership is found to positively impact the quality of an innovation (as measured by forward patent citations). In addition, the degree of quality increases with the number of patent owners. Since past research confirms the important links between patent quality and ongoing innovation, and between innovation and growth, those factors that impact patent quality are deserving of attention. Economic research on joint patenting is currently limited, but we hope to shed light on the importance of expanding dialogue on this topic.","[Briggs, Kristie; Wade, Mary] Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Omaha, NE 68178 USA",Creighton University,"Briggs, K (通讯作者)，Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Omaha, NE 68178 USA.",kristiebriggs@creighton.edu,,"Briggs, Kristie/0000-0002-3801-7057",,,,,33,25,28,3,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

But, in an open economy, two alternative measures of inflation coexist: domestic inflation and consumer price inflation. Which of the two should be the target variable? Most of the new open economy macroeconomics (NOEM) literature suggests that the monetary authority should stabilize domestic inflation. This is in sharp contrast with the practice of many inflation-targeting central banks that are using consumer price index (CPI) inflation as target variable. The paper shows that the standard result in the NOEM literature is derived under the simplifying assumption of flexible wages. The inclusion of sticky wages in an otherwise standard small open economy model is shown to rationalize CPI inflation targeting. This conclusion is robust to changes in key parameters, including the trade elasticity.","[Campolmi, Alessia] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Campolmi, Alessia] Magyar Nemzeti Bank, Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Campolmi, A (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary.",campolmia@ceu.hu,,"CAMPOLMI, Alessia/0000-0001-8711-3451",,,,,33,14,14,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The costs associated with such behavior are shared by both firms and individuals and can be large enough to even prevent the initiation of trade. Measurement of these costs is difficult because information is not available for transactions that fail to occur. We use a field experiment to identify opportunistic crime in a task that is important and relevant for trade: the delivery of mail. We subtly manipulate the content and information available in mail sent to households across neighborhoods that vary by income, and detected high levels of shirking and stealing. Eighteen percent of the mail never arrived at its destination, and significantly more was lost if there was even a slight hint of something additional inside the envelope. Our results demonstrate the importance of transaction costs created by crime and that not all populations are equally affected. Middle-income neighborhoods suffer the most.","[Castillo, Marco; Petrie, Ragan] George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci ICES, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Castillo, Marco; Petrie, Ragan] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Torero, Maximo] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Viceisza, Angelino] Spelman Coll, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Spelman College,"Castillo, M (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci ICES, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",mcastil8@gmu.edu; rpetrie1@gmu.edu; m.torero@cgiar.org; aviceisz@spelman.edu,"Petrie, Ragan/AAQ-2892-2021","Petrie, Ragan/0000-0002-9101-1666; Castillo, Marco/0000-0003-0756-7184",,,,,29,8,9,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

We show that optimal intellectual property rights (IPR) protection is stage-dependent. At an early stage of development, the country implements weak IPR protection to facilitate imitation. At a later stage of development, the country implements strong IPR protection to encourage domestic innovation. Therefore, the growth-maximizing and welfare-maximizing levels of patent strength increase as the country evolves towards the world technology frontier, and this dynamic pattern is consistent with the actual evolution of patent strength in China.

The empirical analysis is conducted using US data from the General Social Survey (GSS) and an Ordered Probit Model. We also attempt to overcome the endogeneity problem between marital happiness and infidelity using a recursive bivariate probit model. One of the advances of this study is to show that the determinants of marital happiness differ between men and women in interesting ways. While infidelity has similar effects for both sexes, we find that women have a detectable preference for a traditional division of labour within the household. In addition, social class, religion, age, children and income have differential effects between men and women. In particular, for marital happiness we find diminishing returns from household income for women and satiation for men. Hence, we find that most of the existing literature has left hidden important differences in the determinants of marital happiness between men and women.","[Elmslie, Bruce T.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Tebaldi, Edinaldo] Bryant Univ, Dept Econ, Smithfield, RI 02917 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Bryant University,"Tebaldi, E (通讯作者)，Bryant Univ, Dept Econ, Smithfield, RI 02917 USA.",etebaldi@bryant.edu,"Tebaldi, Edinaldo/D-6065-2019","Tebaldi, Edinaldo/0000-0003-3670-3245",,,,,31,8,9,7,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The process of modernization got a new and powerful impetus over the last decade. This impetus is increasing the speed of information translation (transfer). In short - speed. However inseparable from networks and metanetworks speed is that it can be studied relatively independently in a given context, as indicated by P. Virilio in his dromologic research. Dromologic research of man's status in the world shows that man - his perception, his language as well as his thinking is substantially changed by the speed of information translation.

The problem considered is an extension to the classic transshipment problem, and allows for change of delivery destination along the route with the progress of works, and for constraints resulting from the schedule of the works.","[Jaskowski, Piotr; Czarnigowska, Agata] Lublin Univ Technol, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland; [Sobotka, Anna] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland",Lublin University of Technology; AGH University of Krakow,"Jaskowski, P (通讯作者)，Lublin Univ Technol, Nadbystrzycka Ul 40, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland.",p.jaskowski@pollub.pl; sobotka@agh.edu.pl; a.czarnigowska@pollub.pl,"Sobotka, Anna AS/W-6148-2018; Jaskowski, Piotr/I-1184-2014; Czarnigowska, Agata/C-8561-2017","Jaskowski, Piotr/0000-0003-1661-3373; Czarnigowska, Agata/0000-0003-3715-3521",,,,,33,11,11,0,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This conventional wisdom relies on the effects that pooling has on downstream prices. However, it does not account for the potentially significant role of the effect of pooling on downstream product development and commercialization. We consider development technologies that entail spillovers between rivals and assume that final-demand products are imperfect substitutes. When pool formation facilitates information sharing and spillovers in development, then decreases in the degree of product differentiation can adversely affect welfare by reducing the incentives towards product development and product market competition - even with perfectly complementary patents. The analysis modifies and even negates the conventional wisdom for some settings and suggests why patent pools are uncommon in science-based industries such as biotech and pharmaceuticals that are characterized by tacit knowledge and incomplete patents.","[Jeitschko, Thomas D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zhang, Nanyun] Independent Project Anal Inc, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA",Michigan State University,"Jeitschko, TD (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jeitschk@msu.edu; nzhang@ipaglobal.com,"Jeitschko, Thomas/G-3290-2013; Jeitschko, Thomas/O-7318-2019","Jeitschko, Thomas/0000-0001-5903-3235; Jeitschko, Thomas/0000-0001-5903-3235",,,,,34,10,10,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Estimates from analyses that control for a rich set of economic, demographic, and geographic variables show that children in Mexican immigrant families are more likely to be food insecure than children in native families, but are less likely to participate in SNAP. Further, more vulnerable groups such as the first-generation Mexican immigrant families, families in the US for less than 5 years, and families with non-citizen children - that are at a higher risk of food insecurity are the least likely to participate in SNAP. Our analysis suggests that the US Department of Agriculture outreach initiative and SNAP expansion under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act increased SNAP participation of the mixed-status Mexican families, and there is some evidence that food insecurity declined among children in low-educated mixed status families.

Second, if the environmental damage parameter is sufficiently small, then the equilibrium emission tax rate is invariably negative. It is therefore an emission subsidy. Moreover, total emissions under the emission subsidy scenario become less than those under laissez-faire if the damage parameter is sufficiently small, and if the R&D cost is low. However, total emissions under the emission subsidy become greater than those under laissez-faire if the damage parameter is sufficiently small, and if the R&D cost is high. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Three are the main contributions of the study. First, link capital-and energy-productivity to machinery and equipment (M&E) imports using an empirical estimated relationship. Second, analyze the implications of specific spillovers embodied in trade of M&E. Third, analyze the interaction of climate and trade policies when accounting for indirect effects induced by spillovers. We find that explicitly modeling trade spillovers reveals significant effects thanks to the transmission mechanisms underlying imports of M&E. We then assess the net contribution of modeling trade spillovers within three policy scenarios. The aggregated net effects of spillovers are rather small confirming findings from previous studies. However, international and intersectoral redistribution effects can be significant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We use a sample of 30 transition economies over the period 2005 2011 and observe the relationships within three geographic sub-groups, three regulatory sub-groups and pre- versus during the recent crisis. Results suggest that less cumbersome regulation improves growth if combined with better institutions. Both channels the direct one working via firm creation and the indirect one working via informal economy reduction are found to exert positive and significant effect on growth. The composite effects are the strongest for countries with less business-friendly regulations and institutional environment, for regulatory chapters potentially relevant for the entire life-cycle of the firm, such as investors' protection, contract enforcement and trade, and during the crisis.","Univ Amer Coll Skopje, Sch Business Econ & Management, Skopje, North Macedonia",,"Petreski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amer Coll Skopje, Sch Business Econ & Management, 3 Makedonska Brigada 60, Skopje, North Macedonia.",marjan.petreski@uacs.edu.mk,"Petreski, Marjan/A-6336-2018","Petreski, Marjan/0000-0002-2675-8325",,,,,22,2,2,0,19,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

To determine these differences, we used a service orientation scale (SOS), developed by Dienhart, Gregoire, Downey and Knight and a job satisfaction scale developed by Lytle. Our assumptions were that there would be significant gender differences in service orientation and job satisfaction. Our research proved factor structures of the two scales we used. Specifically, we showed gender differences in two of three factors, concerning service orientation (organisational support and customer focus), and no gender differences in job satisfaction. Our study revealed that organisational support is more important to men because they value more structured labour and service procedures than women (t = 2.21, df = 110, p = 0.03). In contrast, customer focus is more relevant to a women because it is more crucial to see satisfied guests, as well as having a good relationship with them (t = 2.07, df = 110, p = 0.04). It is of great importance for hotel management to have in mind that male and female employees respond and behave differently depending on the stimuli in the work environment and their satisfaction varies because of it.","[Petrovic, Marko D.; Jovanovic, Tamara; Markovic, Jelica J.; Armenski, Tanja; Markovic, Vladimir] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Petrovic, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",marko.d.petrovic@uns.ac.rs,"Petrovic, Marko D./I-3554-2016; Jovanovic, Tamara/Z-5594-2019","Petrovic, Marko D./0000-0002-6561-0307; Jovanovic, Tamara/0000-0002-2899-9544; Markovic, Vladimir/0000-0002-6545-5263; Armenski, Tanja/0000-0002-9425-4663",,,,,87,17,20,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The magnitude of these costs is puzzling both from an accounting perspective - factor usage does not decline as much as output, resulting in large falls in measured productivity - and from a theoretical perspective. With the aim of resolving this puzzle, we present a framework that allows us to do the following. First, we account for changes in a country's measured productivity during a financial crisis as the result of changes in the underlying technology of the economy, the efficiency with which resources are allocated across sectors, and the efficiency of the resource allocation within sectors, driven both by reallocation amongst existing plants and by entry and exit. Second, we measure the change in the country's welfare resulting from changes in productivity, government spending, the terms of trade, and a country's international investment position. We apply this framework to the Argentine crisis of 2001 using a unique establishment level dataset and we find that more than half of the, roughly, 10 percent decline in measured total factor productivity can be accounted for by deteriorations in the allocation of resources both across and within sectors. We measure the decline in welfare to be of the order of one-quarter of one year's gross domestic product.","[Sandleris, Guido] Torcuato di Tella Univ, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Wright, Mark L.

We discuss several techniques available to elicit beliefs in an incentive-compatible manner and the problems involved in their use. We then look at how successful these techniques have been when employed in laboratory studies. We find that despite some problems, beliefs elicited in the laboratory are meaningful (i.e., they are generally used as the basis for behavior), and the process of eliciting beliefs seems not to be too intrusive. One hope for the future is that by eliciting beliefs, we may be able to develop better theories of belief formation.","[Schotter, Andrew; Trevino, Isabel] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Schotter, A (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",andrew.schotter@nyu.edu,,,,,,,68,106,111,0,19,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The European integration - whose greatest development is, to present time, the Monetary Union - is a political project: a matter of will and action. Surely, this political project has a strong and specific economic component. Still, it is political. Therefore, political variables are critical. They must be included in any analysis of the financial and economic circumstances, and they must be considered in any strategy to overcome the current roadblock. The Euro Area has to cope, not only with excessive indebtedness, fiscal unbalances and financial markets, but also with the democratic restrictions to austerity and economic recession, and with the democratic requirement to respect social rights, to look for public support and to engage in political dialogue and compromise. In liberal democracies, as ours, the employment, social protection, citizenship and the right to believe and hope are full goals for the public policies, including the economic and fiscal ones.","Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Ctr Econ & Finance, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Silva, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Ctr Econ & Finance, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",asilva@fep.up.pt,,"Santos Silva, Augusto/0000-0002-2270-0185",,,,,19,0,0,0,7,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2014,61.0,5,,,SI,,571,584,,10.2298/PAN1405571S,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AR8UI,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343849300004,0

I find that applying to one additional college increases students' likelihood of enrollment, but only for those applying to very few colleges. Going from one to two applications and two to three applications increases students' probabilities of enrollment by 40% and 10%, respectively.

The first method is a currency demand approach based on macrolevel data. The second and third methods rely on micro level data from household surveys. Overall, we find evidence that the amount of income underreporting decreased in the years following the reform. The biggest change is observed for households headed by a farmer, followed by other' types of households where the head does not report any working status. Employed and self-employed households appear very similar before the tax reform and show minimal adjustment in income reporting in the post-reform period.

The objective is to track inflation regimes for the Tunisian economy and to forecast its determinants. Using a Markov-switching approach, the authors identified two main regimes for inflation in Tunisia during this period: a low and stable inflation regime associated with a low pass-through level and a high inflation regime associated with a high pass-through level. To highlight the mechanisms underlying shifts in inflation regimes, the authors used a time-varying probabilities approach and identified a set of variables to assess their effects on inflation in Tunisia. The results show that the price level decreases in response to an increase in interest rates. Along with this, the empirical results provide strong evidence that the industrial production index has a negative and significant effect, as it increases the probability to stay in an inflationary regime and remain at a high pass-through level. The results also show robust support for the hypothesis that the imports increase the probability to stay in a high-inflation regime and maintain a high pass-through level. However, exports increase the probability of staying in a low-inflation regime and maintaining a low pass-through level.","[Khemiri, Rim] Univ Aix en Provence Marseille, Grp Rech Econ Quantitat, Marseille, France; [Ben Ali, Mohamed Sami] Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Finance & Econ, Doha, Qatar",Aix-Marseille Universite; Qatar University,"Ben Ali, MS (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Finance & Econ, Doha, Qatar.",msbenali@qu.edu.qa,"Ali, Mohamed Sami Ben/AAE-3983-2019","Ali, Mohamed Sami Ben/0000-0002-2993-1971",,,,,40,0,0,1,22,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,DEC 18,2013,7.0,,,,,,,,201343.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-43,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,274BX,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328581200001,0

Here, a 20 % sample of the 2006 Canada census is used to identify self-reported children living with same-sex parents, and to examine the association of household type with children's high school graduation rates. This large random sample allows for control of parental marital status, distinguishes between gay and lesbian families, and is large enough to evaluate differences in gender between parents and children. Children living with gay and lesbian families in 2006 were about 65 % as likely to graduate compared to children living in opposite sex marriage families.

The prospect of more broadly distributed capital earnings in future years provides incentives to profitably employ more labor and capital in earlier years. Without redistribution, modest changes in the system of corporate finance will enable market participants to price the value of more broadly distributed capital acquisition and thereby provide market incentives to produce (1) enhanced earnings for poor and middle-class people, (2) enhanced corporate profits and growth, (3) reduced need for welfare dependence, government spending, borrowing, and taxes, and (4) enhanced sovereign creditworthiness. The approach advanced in this article rests on a theory of fuller employment that operates in the long run as well as the short run. It is somewhat similar to Keynesian theory and yet also distinct and complementary. If the approach is implemented either alone or in conjunction with Keynesian policies, the fuller employment and broader distributive benefits may surpass expectations based on Keynesian theory and may make both austerity and stimulus strategies more affordable and politically feasible.","Syracuse Univ, Coll Law, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",Syracuse University,"Ashford, R (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Coll Law, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",,,,,,,,18,1,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

However, the most straightforward organizing principles from theory have not often taken hold in environmental policy or in the decentralized climate policy regime that is unfolding. One reason is inadequate recognition of a variety of institutions. This paper addresses three ways that the standard model may inadequately anticipate the role of institutions in the actual implementation of climate policy, with a U.S. focus: multilayered authority across jurisdictions, the impressionistic rather than deterministic influence of prices through subsidiary jurisdictions, and the complementary role of prices and regulation in this context. The economic approach is built on the premise that incentives affect behavior. We suggest that an important pathway of influence for economic theory is to infuse incentive-based thinking into the conventional regulatory framework. In a complex policy regime, incentives can be shaped by shadow prices as well as market prices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The pay media platform generates revenues from media consumers through subscription fees, while the free media platform generates revenues from charging advertisers either on a lump-sum basis (regime A) or on a per-consumer basis (regime B). We show that the free platform produces a higher advertising level and attracts more consumers in regime A than B although advertisers must pay more for ads and consumers dislike ads. Moreover, the pay media platform faces higher subscription fees and lower consumer demand in regime A than B. Compared to regime B, the profit of the free (pay) media platform is higher (lower) in regime A, while aggregate profits are higher only if the consumers' disutility from ads is sufficiently low. In addition, advertisers are better off in regime A than B, while the opposite is true for the media consumers.

In this way, universities can be a source of selective migration processes and possibly of diverging development paths, by augmenting the capability of economically dynamic regions to attract bright people from the lagging regions. In this paper, we argue that student mobility behaviour is a function not only of the quality of universities, but also of local labour market conditions in the destination locations. The paper relies on a gravity model, and shows that graduate migrations respond to several determinants, among which graduate job vacancies (that is, the dynamism of the local labour market) appear to be essential.","[Dotti, Nicola Francesco] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Geog, WE DGGF, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Fratesi, Ugo; Lenzi, Camilla] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, Dept Inst Anal & Publ Management, I-20121 Milan, Italy",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Polytechnic University of Milan; Bocconi University,"Fratesi, U (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",Nicola.Dotti@vub.ac.be; ugo.fratesi@polimi.it; camilla.lenzi@polimi.it; marco.percoco@unibocconi.it,"Dotti, Nicola Francesco/J-8998-2015; Fratesi, Ugo/IAM-5881-2023; Lenzi, Camilla/ABE-4498-2022","Dotti, Nicola Francesco/0000-0003-1029-173X; Fratesi, Ugo/0000-0002-0755-460X;",,,,,39,68,70,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

As a consequence, government debt has been on the rise again after a period of stable or declining government debt. In this paper we analyze debt stabilization in a country that features endogenous risk premia, imposed by financial markets that evaluate the probability of debt default by governments. Endogenous risk premia arise by assuming, e.g., simple linear relations between risk premia and the level of debt. As a result the real interest rate on government debt can be written as a constant (measuring the risk-free real interest rate corrected for real output growth) plus an endogenous risk premium that depends on the debt level. We bring such an endogenous risk premium into Tabellini (1986) model and analyze the impact of it. This gives rise to a non-linear differential game. We solve this game for both a cooperative setting and a noncooperative setting. The non-cooperative game is solved under an open-loop information structure. We present a bifurcation analysis w.r.t. the risk premium parameter. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using Chow breakpoint test we identified a structural break in the year 1989. Therefore, we have conducted our analysis on two sub-samples. The first one refers to the period 1952-1989 while the second one refers to the period 1993-2010. The years between 1990 and 1992 have been omitted from the analysis due to massive damage to the Croatian economy caused by the war at that time. Our findings suggest that there is a bidirectional feedback in the short-run and that causality runs from energy consumption to economic growth in the long-run in the first sub-sample. At that time, especially in mid 1970s, Croatia became a medium developed industrial country with the industry sector as the biggest consumer of energy so energy consumption played an important role in the growth process. After the structural break, we found a unidirectional causality running from economic growth to energy consumption. In this case, energy conservation policies together with the establishment of a competitive energy market may be feasible with little or no detrimental side effects to economic growth and employment.","Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theory, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Jakovac, P (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theory, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",pjakovac@efri.hr,"Jakovac, Pavle/P-1936-2018","Jakovac, Pavle/0000-0002-0433-824X",,,,,58,9,9,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

I use rich survey data from 2007 to 2009 of entrants into unemployment in Germany (the IZA Evaluation Dataset S) to calculate residual happiness, which displays higher (or lower) satisfaction levels than would be predicted by a number of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. I find a statistically significant inverted U-shaped effect of residual happiness on an unemployed individual's future reemployment probability and reentry wage, even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, labor market histories and future job prospects. Further investigation offers three mechanisms that have not been previously shown in this context: (a) happiness is mainly a predictor for exit into self-employment rather than regular employment: (b) only male unemployed experience an effect of happiness on reemployment: and (c) the concept of locus of control and the personality traits of neuroticism and extraversion are main drivers of the baseline effect on regular reemployment and are able to explain the effect on reemployment for males.

Consistent with the first part of this hypothesis, Fox and Milbourne (2006) concluded that an increase in the average level of human capital in Australian economics departments raised the research productivity of departmental members. This paper tests the robustness of this finding by using a direct, rather than a proxy, measure of human capital and confirms the existence of human capital externalities within Australian economics departments. But we extend the analysis in two important dimensions. Firstly, we investigate the second part of Lucas' hypothesis by testing whether the externality becomes manifest via co-authoring. We find no evidence that this type of interaction is associated with higher research productivity, especially for higher quality outputs. Secondly, we control for the likely endogeneity of one's peer group via instrumental variables estimation. In this case, we find that the peer group effect disappears completely for the highest quality outputs but remains for research output more broadly defined.","[Neri, Frank; Rodgers, Joan R.] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Neri, F (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Fac Commerce, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",fneri@uow.edu.au,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Since the Asian crisis of 1997-1998, the impact of external shocks on regional economies has grown important in the Asian business cycles as well as in the decision-making process of macroeconomic policies, as emerging Asian economies have become more integrated with the global economy. This paper designs a state-space representation of the panel vector autoregressive model with latent dynamic components in order to show the impulse response function of three external shocks including real income shock, financial shock, and long-term real interest rate shock. This paper finds the external real gross domestic product shock as a dominant one in emerging Asia. The shock has been persistent and has carried long-term effects on emerging Asia before and after the Asian crisis. Second, the external equity shock has also been an important factor influencing the business cycles in the region after the Asian crisis, while the effect has been insignificant before the Asian crisis. Last, the external monetary shock has presumably mitigated effectively by Asia's macroeconomic policy, but it has forced to give up monetary independency in the region.","Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Int Studies, Gyeonggi Do 1006008, Yongin Si, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Yang, DY (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Int Studies, 1 Seo Heon Dong, Gyeonggi Do 1006008, Yongin Si, South Korea.",yangdy@khu.ac.kr,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,13,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Both announced and unannounced policies are considered. A reduction in double taxation stimulates investment and improves welfare, but its impact on output is moderate and it has a negative effect on work hours. A temporary cut creates an investment boom but also generates an investment slump when the tax cut expires. Announcements of future tax cuts are found to have important effect on output dynamics. Agents respond to the tax policy even before it is implemented. If the tax cut is announced to be temporary, its impact on output is greatly reduced. Our study suggests that a temporary dividend tax cut is most effective in stabilizing a recession stricken economy when the policy change comes as news to the economy.

It operates on two fields of research that are often not related to each other. Firstly, the increasing interest in environmental economics for the determinants of green technological change, and secondly the impact of government policies aimed at subsidizing energy prices. Recent research claims a positive relationship between energy prices and the number of patents in the fields of energy efficiency. This paper extends this research by investigating the impact of the price structure of electricity on patent counts in 1) renewable energy sources, 2) wind energy and 3) solar power. In nearly all OECD countries in the period 1990-2006 industrial energy users pay a lower price per energy unit than households due, among others, to government subsidy policies. The empirical results show that reducing government subsidies and hence increasing the electricity price of (large) industrial electricity users relative to the price paid by (small) residential users provides a clear incentive to increase inventions as measured by number of patents in the technical fields of solar and wind energy. These results are an important input in the debate on reducing government support to large energy users. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Countries embarking on decentralization often struggle with decisions about the essential components of decentralization including the order of an introduction of decentralization policies, the number of years necessary to bring a full program on line, and the components of the transition strategy. We argue that the sequencing of decentralization policies is an important determinant of its success. The consequences of a poorly sequenced decentralization program can range from minor delays and complications to ineffectiveness and subsequent failing support of decentralization efforts, macroeconomic instability, and fundamental failure in public sector delivery. At a minimum, the strategy of making it up as we go will not lead to the same structure of decentralization as will a planned strategy. The paper raises two questions: First, is there an optimal sequencing for decentralization policies and implementation? Our answer is that there is, and that following these sequencing rules can reduce the costs and risks of implementing fiscal decentralization. Second, to what extent do countries follow these optimal sequencing rules? The answer is, in general, they do not. The gap between theory and practice is a result of the complexity of sequencing design, which discourages fiscal planners from implement the full process. In addition, sequencing requires a sustained discipline and vision for its implementing, as well as overcoming pressures from political actors, especially in developing countries.","[Bahl, Roy; Martinez-Vazquez, Jorge] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Bahl, R (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",,,,,,,,61,9,12,0,14,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

This is confirmed by means of Markov-switching vector autoregressive models that allow for phase shifts between the cyclical regimes of IP and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI). The timing of the severe recession regime mostly corresponds with periods of substantial financial market distress and severe credit squeezes, providing empirical evidence for the 'financial accelerator' theory.

A gravity model of international trade is employed to see if ICT positively affects bilateral international trade in fruit and vegetables between member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies. We examine if the use of the Internet, mobile telephones, and fixed telephone lines determine the value of bilateral trade. Empirical results for the importance of ICT differ markedly between importing activities and exporting activities in the international value chain of fruit and vegetables in APEC countries. Changes in ICT levels in the import sector of the value chain have no effect on international trade in fruit and vegetables. However, in the export sector, growth in some ICT products has significant positive effects on trade in fruit and vegetables between APEC countries. Surprisingly, the strongest impact was discerned for the traditional form of ICT, fixed telephone lines, but this impact probably reflects the fact that fixed telephone lines are a proxy variable for the general level of infrastructure development. Of the two digital ICTs, mobile telephony and the Internet, only the Internet had a significant impact on trade levels. The further development of the Internet and its diffusion should make exporters in APEC countries more competitive in the fruit and vegetables value chain, and boost their trade values in these products.","[Chung, Kit Chi; Fleming, Pauline; Fleming, Euan] Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, NSW, Australia",University of New England,"Chung, KC (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",efleming@une.edu.au,,,,,,,41,21,22,4,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Also, the testing for unit roots and cointegration in panels allows for heterogeneous fixed effects and deterministic trends. Using Egyptian data, it is shown that the empirical model produces reliable ex-post forecasts near the end of the full sample period. These pseudo forecasts are representative of what one would expect if the forecasting relationship is stationary. The long-run parameter estimates are then used to conduct ex-ante forecasting under plausible assumptions for policy making. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that reserve financing, coupled with a managed float exchange rate system, can maintain the country's fast growth rate while mitigating fiscal pressure on local governments. Productive infrastructure capital stimulates domestic demand, reducing the country's dependence on exports. To promote growth and maintain price stability, three factors are critical: return on infrastructure, swift fiscal adjustment, and rapid infrastructure financing.

When a bottom-up cost curve is available, we can explicitly represent this curve with a top-down model in order to replicate its shape instead of using arbitrary assumptions. We propose several methods to approximate a piecewise function from a step function using constant elasticity of substitution technologies. Specifically, we consider a pollution abatement sector and calibrate the parameters of the abatement function in order to allow proper assessment of the economic effects of an environmental policy. Our methodology can be applied to any sector characterized by decreasing returns to scale technologies. We conclude that the elasticities of substitution need not be estimated only on the basis of historical data, but can be precisely calibrated on the basis of engineering estimates of technology potential.

This paper constructs a theoretical model framework of bank lending behavior under both interest rate control and interest rate liberation. The impacts surrounding the implementation of capital adequacy requirements on banks' lending behavior are analyzed with regards to this baseline model. Simulations and empirical tests are then conducted on the model to identify the correlation between the implementation of capital requirements and lending discrimination against small businesses. The findings suggest that commercial banks do discriminate against small businesses in lending operations, and capital requirements would intensify such discrimination, making small business loans more difficult to obtain. Financial supervisory authority should take more flexible measures for capital supervision and adequately amend the existing regulatory provisions to encourage and motivate commercial banks to grant small business loans and thus mitigate lending discrimination.","[Ma, Li; Dai, Junxun; Huang, Xian] Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Liu, Miao] Columbia Univ, Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA",Wuhan University; Columbia University,"Ma, L (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",ml3085@columbia.edu,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,22,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Specifically, it is assumed that multinationals invest in countries with lower regulatory standards and that countries competitively undercut each other's standards in order to attract foreign capital. This paper tests this hypothesis and finds robust empirical support for both predictions. First, a reduction in employment protection rules leads to an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI). Furthermore, changes in employment protection legislation have a larger impact on the relatively mobile types of FDI. Second, there is evidence that countries are competitively undercutting each other's labor market standards. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The low market penetration is attributed to full or partial government ownership and entry restrictions on foreign insurers. Regulatory changes and adoption of liberal policies have aided the growth of the life insurance industry in the past decade. At the same time, economic and social factors were expected to promote insurance awareness and consumption. In this context, the paper analyses the factors explaining life insurance demand in 12 Asian economies, including economies from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and Association of Southeast Asian Nations regions, as well as China. The results suggest that income, financial depth, inflation, the real interest rate, and the youth dependency ratio are significant determinants of life insurance consumption. Foreign ownership and improved regulations may foster growth. But urbanisation and the literacy rate are among the few determinants found not to have the impact observed in previous studies.

The first data set is based on a survey of households who recently purchased a water heater before and after the rebate programs were in place. The other is based on a set of stated preference questions asked of households soon to face a replacement decision. While the former allows us to look at recent responses, the latter enables us to forecast future demand. We find that the programs significantly increase shares of solar/heat pump systems. The programs, however, appear less effective in reducing the stock of electric heaters for households with access to natural gas. This pattern is consistent in both datasets. Results from the discrete choice experiments suggest considerable heterogeneity with respect to household preferences toward different types of water heaters and the discount rates they hold. The effective cost of reducing carbon emissions via incentives for water heater replacement is considered from the counterfactual perspective of no government incentives. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the optimal belief depends on how risk-averse the agent is. Although the perfect Bayesian updating remains evolutionarily optimal for a risk-neutral agent, it is not for any other. Specifically, the belief is always positively biased for a risk-averse agent, and the more risk-averse an agent is, the more positively biased the optimally updated belief is. Such biased beliefs align with experimental findings and also offer an alternative explanation to the empirical puzzle that people across the population appear overconfident by consistently overestimating their personal hereditary traits.

We are the first to study how the elasticity of labor supply to the firm changes between economic contractions and economic expansions. We study two manufacturing firms operating in geographically distinct labor markets during the volatile inter-war period. Our analysis suggests that the elasticity of labor supply to the firm is lower during recessions than during expansions, providing evidence of differential wage setting power over the business cycle.

This article employs panel regression and Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) on 155 countries of which 42 are microstates. Panel regression results show that a percentage point improvement in the fiscal balance improves the current account balance by 0.4 percentage points of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The real effective exchange rate has no significant impact on the current account in microstates but the coefficient is significant in the global sample. PVAR results show that an increase in government consumption results in real exchange appreciation, but the effect on the current account after an initial deterioration dies out quicker in microstates than in the global sample. The result implies that fiscal policy has little effect on the current account in microstates beyond its direct impact on imports. Overall, the results suggest that the weak relative price effects make the effect of fiscal adjustment on the current account much more difficult in microstates.","[Endegnanew, Yehenew] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Amo-Yartey, Charles; Turner-Jones, Therese] Int Monetary Fund, Western Hemisphere Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Autonomous University of Barcelona; International Monetary Fund,"Amo-Yartey, C (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Western Hemisphere Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",Cyartey@imf.org,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By conducting the experiments during both the most important day of Ramadan (the Night of Power) and a day outside Ramadan, we find that Ramadan overall has a small and negative impact on positional concerns. Detailed analyses based on the sorting of individuals degree of religiosity reveal that the decrease in the degree of positional concerns during Ramadan is mainly explained by a decrease in positionality among individuals with a low degree of religiosity.","[Akay, Alpaslan] IZA Inst Study Labor, D-53072 Bonn, Germany; [Karabulut, Gokhan] Istanbul Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Martinsson, Peter] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",IZA Institute Labor Economics; Istanbul University; University of Gothenburg,"Akay, A (通讯作者)，IZA Inst Study Labor, Box 7240, D-53072 Bonn, Germany.",akay@iza.org,"Karabulut, gökhan/AAL-5666-2020; Martinsson, Peter/JAD-2096-2023","Karabulut, gökhan/0000-0002-8533-3554; Martinsson, Peter/0000-0002-1146-9248",,,,,18,9,11,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Public debates over which lever should be preferred have been paramount in France, with concerns focusing on redistribution issues between high wage high life-expectancy and low-wage low life-expectancy workers. In this paper, we empirically address this issue by simulating the differentiated impacts of the past French reforms on average retirement ages across wage quartiles. Our simulations show that increasing the required duration criterion-as was done by the 1993 and 2003 reforms-have redistributive impact as regards retirement age, while increasing the normal age-as was done by the 2010 reform-has a counter-distributive impact. The redistributive impact on average of the required duration criterion however only holds thanks to the fact that disabled workers-most of them in the lowest wage quartile-are exempted from it. Last, increasing minimal age has ambiguous impacts according to gender: redistributive among women but counter-distributive among men.","[Aubert, Patrick; Duc, Cindy; Ducoudre, Bruno] DREES, Bur Retraites, Sous Direct Observat Solidarite, Paris, France; [Aubert, Patrick] COR, Paris, France; [Aubert, Patrick] INSEE, CREST, Paris, France; [Ducoudre, Bruno] OFCE, Paris, France",,"Aubert, P (通讯作者)，DREES, Bur Retraites, Sous Direct Observat Solidarite, Paris, France.",patrick.aubert@insee.fr; cindy.duc@sante.gouv.fr; bruno.ducoudre@sciencespo.fr,"Aubert, Patrick/O-8709-2019; Aubert, Patrick/C-5205-2015","Aubert, Patrick/0000-0003-1777-8639; Aubert, Patrick/0000-0003-1777-8639; DUCOUDRE, Bruno/0000-0001-9799-0394",,,,,21,3,3,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2013,161.0,3,,,,,277,305,,10.1007/s10645-013-9212-6,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,206DG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323496800004,0

Assessing the effects of an LCR constraint for banks' optimal deposit and loan choices requires an intertemporal framework. Our analysis of a dynamic banking model shows that imposing an LCR constraint generally has theoretically ambiguous effects on the stability of banks' optimal dynamic balance-sheet paths. Even in special cases, such as a situation in which regulators prohibit banks from applying securities to fulfill the LCR constraint or in which banks simultaneously confront risk-based capital regulation while facing rigidities in their equity capital positions, optimal bank deposit paths exhibit increased intertemporal persistence but become more responsive to shocks to market interest rates.

We begin by documenting recent trends in advanced country sovereign indebtedness and reviewing events that preceded the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone. The mechanisms through which rising sovereign debt may impact bond yields, economic growth, and inflation are discussed and the evidence for such effects is reviewed. Our discussion highlights that there is no unique threshold beyond which sovereign debt exerts adverse macroeconomic effects, and that in order to understand the consequences of a given debt load one must analyse its structure in terms of internal and external creditors, currency denomination, the time to maturity of the bonds, and the legal code governing debt issuance, as well as various economic and political constraints measuring the fiscal space of the sovereign. We then turn our attention to episodes in which sovereign debt proves excessive and default occurs. We review explanations for the protracted and inefficient nature of defaults and describe some lessons from historical studies examining default outcomes. In the final part of the paper we discuss proposals for averting future debt crises, including jointly issued bonds such as eurobonds, contingent convertible bonds, and elements of a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism. In the course of our discussion we draw on each of the 11 articles included in the two issues of this journal devoted to sovereign debt.","[Bowdler, Christopher; Esteves, Rui Pedro] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Bowdler, Christopher] Univ Oxford Oriel Coll, Oxford OX1 4EW, England; [Esteves, Rui Pedro] Univ Oxford Brasenose Coll, Oxford OX1 4AJ, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Bowdler, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",christopher.bowdler@oriel.ox.ac.uk; rui.esteves@bnc.ox.ac.uk,"Esteves, Rui/JWO-4978-2024","Esteves, Rui/0000-0002-1966-7214",,,,,26,7,9,2,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The approach resolves all uncertainty before the first time period, drawing parameters from a distribution before initiating a given model run. This paper analyzes how closely a Monte Carlo based derivation of optimal policies is to the truly optimal policy, in which the decision maker acknowledges the full set of possible future trajectories in every period. Our analysis uses a stochastic dynamic programming version of the widespread integrated assessment model DICE, and focuses on damage uncertainty. We show that the optimizing Monte Carlo approach is not only off in magnitude, but can even lead to a wrong sign of the uncertainty effect. Moreover, it can lead to contradictory policy advice, suggesting a more stringent climate policy in terms of the abatement rate and a less stringent one in terms of the expenditure on abatement.

One problem is that most studies cover only a short time frame and do not consider dynamic effects. I show that introducing credit in a general model of intertemporal consumption creates a boom in consumption and reduces poverty initially, but eventually reduces mean consumption because credit substitutes for precautionary wealth. Using new consistent consumption data that cover a much longer time period than most studies, my empirical findings show that increased access to bank branches in rural India increased consumption initially and reduced poverty, but consumption later fell and poverty rose. The long-term effect is still positive, however, suggesting that credit may have a beneficial role beyond consumption smoothing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

On the other side, we endogenize the structure of the market of contents given the presence of NGNs, where a content provider can sell contents directly to consumers, by-passing telecom operators (disintermediation, over-the-top content).

This stands in contrast to the previous literature on costly state verification, which has shown that it is optimal to commit to an auditing strategy. The credible announcement of thoroughly auditing claim reports is a powerful deterrent. Yet, we show that uncertainty about fraud detection can be an effective strategy to deter ambiguity-averse agents from reporting false insurance claims. If, in addition, the auditing costs of the insurers are heterogeneous, it can be optimal not to commit, because committing to a fraud-detection strategy eliminates the ambiguity about auditing. Thus, strategic ambiguity can be an equilibrium outcome in the market. Even competition does not force firms to provide the relevant information. This finding is also relevant in other auditing settings, like tax enforcement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

For example, if provided with sufficient cover, reluctant altruists will often avoid situations that compel them to give, and they may even secretly renege on gifts they just made. This behavior puts pressure on classic explanations of altruism and raises many questions about its stability. Is everyone's altruism prone to such collapse? If not, how can one predict it? We show that some people exhibit more stable altruism, predicting who is who weeks prior to the task. We show that high degrees of justice sensitivity is associated with pro-social behavior across situations, while low degrees of justice sensitivity relate to the use of situational variables as excuse to display less altruistic behavior. Our findings contribute to recent research on altruism and give insight into how to predict it. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on 7000 firms during 1989-2009, our main objective is to examine the effect of exporting on firm productivity, correcting for selection bias using propensity-score matching, which allows a like-for-like comparison between new exporters and nonexporters. Robust to different matching estimators, we find evidence of learning-by-exporting that new exporters acquire rapid productivity growth after entry, relative to nonexporters. We also find that (1) exporters are more productive than nonexporters; (2) productive firms tend to self-select in entering the exporting market, and (3) least productive exporters are found to exit the export market as they experience adverse productivity effect prior to the year of exit. Our robust result on learning-by-exporting suggests that entering export market does appear to be a channel explaining the Indian recent growth miracle.","[Mallick, Sushanta] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London E1 4NS, England; [Yang, Yong] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Sussex,"Mallick, S (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",s.k.mallick@qmul.ac.uk,,"Mallick, Sushanta/0000-0003-3851-3680",,,,,39,61,62,3,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

By means of a representative survey among employers in Italy, Germany, Denmark, Poland, the Netherlands and Sweden in 2009, we show that employers mainly prefer to tackle such threats by offering short-time work, and by early retirement packages to older workers, in conjunction with buy-outs. The latter preference is particularly visible in countries where employers perceive the level of employment protection to be high. The only notable exception is Denmark, where employers prefer to reduce working hours. In general, a sense of generational fairness influences downsizing preferences, with those employers who favor younger workers particularly likely to use early retirement and buy-outs when downsizing, followed by working time reductions. Wage reductions and administrative dismissal are less favored by European employers. In particular, CEOs and owners are more inclined than lower-level managers to cut wages.","[van Dalen, Hendrik P.; Henkens, Kene] NIDI, NL-2502 AR The Hague, Netherlands; [van Dalen, Hendrik P.] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management TISEM, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Dalen, Hendrik P.] CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Henkens, Kene] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Anthropol & Sociol, NL-1012 DK Amsterdam, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; University of Amsterdam,"van Dalen, HP (通讯作者)，NIDI, POB 11650, NL-2502 AR The Hague, Netherlands.",dalen@nidi.nl,"van Dalen, Hendrik P./A-1736-2008; van Dalen, Harry/AAR-5621-2020","van Dalen, Hendrik P./0000-0002-1628-9764; Henkens, Kene/0000-0002-3416-5191",,,,,46,19,23,0,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2013,161.0,3,,,,,307,329,,10.1007/s10645-013-9211-7,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,206DG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323496800005,0

Such underlying rates can vary enormously, from. approximate to 1 percent for idiosyncratic diversifiable risk to. approximate to 7 percent for systematic nondiversifiable risk. Which risk-adjusted rate is chosen can have a huge impact on cost-benefit analysis. In this expository paper, I attempt to set forth in accessible language with a simple linear model what I think are some of the basic issues involved in discounting climate risks. The paper introduces a new concept that may be relevant for climate-change discounting: the degree to which an investment hedges against the bad tail of catastrophic damages by insuring positive expected payoffs even under the worst circumstances. The prototype application is calculating the social cost of carbon.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Weitzman, ML (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mweitzman@harvard.edu,,,,,,,13,70,73,0,40,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

We document that Portuguese firms, besides reducing employment or freezing nominal base wages, also make frequent use of other cost-cutting strategies, like freezing or cutting bonuses and other monetary or non-monetary benefits, slowing down or freezing the rate at which promotions are filled, or recruiting new employees at wages lower than those received by the employees that have left the firm. We show that the utilisation of these different adjustment strategies is affected by workers' and firms' attributes, as well as by some indicators of the economic environment in which firms operate. More importantly, we provide evidence that firms with more flexible base wages are less likely to reduce employment, and that such effect may be significantly strengthened by the availability of alternative labour-cost adjustment margins that firms can use in bad times.

The analysis focuses on the possible effects of globalization and differences between crisis and non-crisis periods. We model the dynamics of dependencies between the series of daily returns on selected stock indices over different time periods, and compare strength of the linkages. Our tools are dynamic copula models and a formal sequential testing procedure based on the model confidence set methodology. We consider two types of dependencies: regular dependence measured by means of the conditional Spearman's rho, and dependencies in extremes quantified by the conditional tail dependence coefficients. The main result consists of a collection of rankings created for the considered subperiods, which show how the mean level of strength of the dependencies have been changing in time. The rankings obtained for Spearman's rho and tail dependencies differ, which allows us to distinguish between the results of crises and the effect of globalization.","[Doman, Magorzata] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Appl Math, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland; [Doman, Ryszard] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Lab Financial Econometr, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Doman, R (通讯作者)，Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Lab Financial Econometr, Umultowska 87, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.",malgorzata.doman@ue.poznan.pl; rydoman@amu.edu.pl,,"Doman, Malgorzata/0000-0002-1868-7993",,,,,37,10,11,1,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

In this paper, we examine a related approach that has been used widely in practice-which we refer to as an offset. The idea behind offsets is to encourage firms or entities that may not be a part of the main regulatory system to produce environmental improvements. These improvements can then be used to offset pollution reduction requirements for regulated entities. This paper analyzes how offsets are used in practice, and identifies key economic and political factors that help explain the use of offsets in certain situations. We find that offsets may often fail to take adequate account of environmental or ecosystem damages. We argue that the effectiveness of an offset policy depends on the political and institutional context in which it is developed.","[Hahn, Robert] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford, England; [Richards, Kenneth] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Business, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Richards, Kenneth] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Maurer Sch Law, Bloomington, IN USA",University of Oxford; National University of Singapore; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Hahn, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford, England.",bob.hahn@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,10,14,0,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The paper argues that families are of key importance in the decision making process to buy such a private pension. Families do not only shape the way we make our financial decisions they can also be a source for cost-effective and reliable information. Depending on certain characteristics some individuals can process this information more easily. Results confirm that individual characteristics, in particular income and education, as well as family characteristics are correlated with Riester ownership. Adding a dynamic element to the analysis I find strong sequential correlations in Riester ownership between siblings. However, these correlations become weaker over time as the number of Riester owners in other social circles grows. Once a critical mass has been reached, positive spillovers can create a social multiplier leading to a higher coverage with private pensions in the future.","Max Planck Inst Social Law & Social Policy, Munich Ctr Econ Aging, Munich, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Lamla, B (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Social Law & Social Policy, Munich Ctr Econ Aging, Munich, Germany.",lamla@mea.mpisoc.mpg.de,,,,,,,65,1,1,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2013,40.0,3,,,SI,,483,504,,10.1007/s10663-013-9212-4,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,181KH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321666000006,0

Using a simple frictionless model with efficient international risk sharing, we show that the real exchange can depreciate in response to a rise in government purchases, if these purchases increase domestic private sector productivity, and labor supply is highly elastic.

Our analysis delivers both a good and a bad message. The good message is that, when traders invest constant fractions of their wealth in each asset and have equal consumption rates, markets are informationally efficient: the best informed agent is rewarded and asset prices eventually reflect this information. However, and this is the bad message, when asset demands are not constant fractions of wealth but dependent upon prices, markets might behave sub-optimally. In this case, asymptotic prices depend on preferences and beliefs of the whole ecology of traders and do not, in general, reflect the best available information.

Informal business owners from the wage worker species are less likely to register due to the reform, but more likely to become wage workers since the reform created jobs. Informal business owners from the formal business owner species are more likely to register, but only in municipalities with high pre-reform constraints to formal entrepreneurship.

We consider a standard political-agency model (Besley, 2006) where the incumbent leader may or may not be congruent, and where, to maintain power, both leader types need the support of the selectorate, an elite group having a say in selecting the leader, as well as associated access to special privileges. Primarily, we find that in autocracies, without electoral discipline to restrain the opportunistic behaviour of a leader, the size of the selectorate should be intermediate; if it is too small, the selectorate is captured by the leader and has no disciplinary role, but if too big, the leader's incentives are diluted.","[Gilli, Mario] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy; [Li, Yuan] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm China Econ Res Inst, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Li, Yuan] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst East Asian Studies, Duisburg, Germany",University of Milano-Bicocca; Stockholm School of Economics; University of Duisburg Essen,"Gilli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy.",mario.gilli@unimib.it; yuan.li@hhs.se,,,,,,,36,6,6,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

An Aggregate Analysis of Intra-Household Bargaining and Labour Supply,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,General aggregative models; Neoclassical; Time allocation and labour supply; Economics of gender; Marriage; Marital dissolution,TRENDS; ALLOCATION,"Are macro-economists mistaken in ignoring bargaining between spouses? This article argues that models of intra-household allocation could be useful for understanding aggregate labour supply trends in the U.S. since the 1970s. A simple calculation suggests that the standard model without bargaining predicts a 19% decline in married-male labour supply in response to the narrowing of the gender gap in wages since the 1970s. However married-men's paid labour remained stationary over the period from the mid 1970s to the recession of 2001. This article develops and calibrates to U.S. time-use survey data a model of marital bargaining in which time allocations are determined jointly with equilibrium marriage and divorce rates. The results suggest that bargaining effects raised married-men's labour supply by about 2.1 weekly hours over the period, and reduced that of married women by 2.7 hours. Bargaining therefore has a relatively small impact on aggregate labour supply, but is critical for trends in female labour supply. Also, the narrowing of the gender wage gap is found to account for a weekly 1.5 hour increase in aggregate labour supply.","[Knowles, John A.] Univ Southampton, Econ Div, CPC, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Knowles, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Econ Div, CPC, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G027153/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G027153/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,29,46,56,3,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Surprisingly, however, there is only limited empirical evidence that the availability of pay comparison information is detrimental for effort provision. In this paper, I study pay comparison effects in a gift-exchange game laboratory experiment where an employer is matched with two symmetric employees. I compare effort choices made by employees in a pay secrecy treatment and in two public wages treatments where employees are informed of the wage paid to the co-worker. In one public wages treatment the employer can choose both wages she pays to the employees, while in the other treatment the wage paid to one employee is regulated exogenously. I show that pay disclosure can be detrimental for effort provision if employees are treated unequally.

Studies in this literature generally use individual labor earnings. To uncover the role of welfare state and households in smoothening earnings shocks, we compute different income concepts ranging from gross earnings to net equivalent household income. We find evidence that the overall inequality of earnings in Germany and the United Kingdom has been rising throughout the period due to both higher permanent earnings inequality and higher earnings volatility. However, taking institutions of the welfare state and risk-sharing households into account, we find that the volatility of net household income has remained fairly stable. Furthermore, redistribution and risk insurance provided by the welfare state is more pronounced in Germany than in the United Kingdom.","[Bartels, Charlotte; Boenke, Timm] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Bartels, C (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",charlotte.bartels@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,55,10,11,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Recent advances in MHT techniques to control the multiple comparisons problem are uniquely showcased within a VAR and Granger causality testing of energy and emissions market interactions. Four generalized p-value-based MHT techniques show no evidence of interactions between European Union Allowance (EUA) prices and a range of energy prices - spanning key oil, gas, coal and electricity markets - over the first half or so (2008-2010) of Phase II of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

Stochastic poverty dominance tests show that rural areas are poorer in the three dimensions regardless of poverty line chosen. Stochastic inequality dominance tests find that the north and south dominate the centre in health inequality, and there is no dominance between the north and south. With respect to education inequality, dominance is declared for the south-centre pair only. A subgroup decomposition analysis finds that the south contributes the most to consumption and education poverty, while the centre is the largest contributor to health poverty. We establish that within-area inequalities (vertical inequalities) rather than between-area inequalities (horizontal inequalities) are the major driver of consumption, health and education inequality in Malawi.","Univ Malawi, Chancellor Coll, Dept Econ, Zomba, Malawi",University of Malawi,"Mussa, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malawi, Chancellor Coll, Dept Econ, Box 280, Zomba, Malawi.",rimussa@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,18,1,2,4,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Employing both qualitative and quantitative measures, the field research indicates that MFIs in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan do not have the traditional characteristics of microfinance business. Although both countries are at the pre-competitive stage, the qualitative research indicates that urban areas in Tajikistan are approaching a competitive edge. The research demonstrates that MFIs in these countries do not require their clients to give up membership of other MFIs, thus increasing the probability of cross-indebtedness. Moreover, if a client fails to repay a loan from one MFI, there is a high probability that this person will join another MFI.

This paper shows that differences in cognitive ability can also determine the division of labor in poor urban areas. We estimate the effect of IQ on time-to-first gang participation with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) and Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). Results from both the NLSY97 and PHDCN indicate that low-IQ is a robust predictor of gang participation. There are two plausible explanations of this main finding: (1) low-IQ individuals may have comparative advantage in violence as their opportunity costs of engaging in legal activities are low and (2) gangs may prefer low-IQ individuals as a way to reduce agency costs. We find strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that persons with lower IQs have comparative advantage in criminal activity in the PHDCN dataset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

China's government has put forth financial aid programs to enable poor students to access higher education. Although studies have shown that poor high school students are indeed able to attend college when their test scores are high enough (that is, few are unable to attend when they are qualified to attend), the literature has not explored whether poor students have sufficient amounts of aid to thrive in college. Using findings from a randomized controlled trial, this study evaluates the impact of providing full scholarships to students from poor rural areas (henceforth treatment students) on student stress levels, self-esteem/self-efficacy, and participation in activities in four first-tier colleges. To do so, we compare outcomes of the treatment students with students who were not given full scholarships by the project (and were left to search for scholarships and other sources of financial aid from the university system itself-the control students). The project was run among the 200 poorest first-year students in four first-tier colleges in inland China. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that treatment students (those receiving full scholarships from the project) were only slightly more successful in obtaining financial aid than control students. This suggests that control students (those who did not receive full scholarships from the project) were still able to access comparable levels of financial aid. Most importantly, scholarship recipients were statistically identical in outcome to control students in terms of stress, self-esteem, and participation in college activities, suggesting that poor students (who are dependent on aid from the university system) currently are able to access sufficient levels of financial aid, are able to take advantage of the activities offered at college, and do not shoulder heavy financial or psychological costs. We find, therefore, that efforts of the government to alleviate the financial burden of college on the poor have been relatively successful in first-tier colleges. Because of this, foundations and individuals may decide that if they want to improve human welfare, giving additional scholarships at high tier colleges may be having little effect.

As a result the dynamics of the economy can feature some underdevelopment traps: an economy starting with a low level of human capital can be caught in a vicious circle where low level of human capital leads to low wages, and low wages leads to emigration of valuable human capital.

In contrast, the type of support organization does not seem to affect the duration of the micro-enterprises, while the sponsors' individual characteristics do seem to have an impact on survival.

Finally, although extremely poor children increased their school attendance, there was no reduction in child labour, which remains a relevant issue in Bolivia.","[Grigoli, Francesco] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Sbrana, Giacomo] Rouen Business Sch, Mont St Aignan, France",International Monetary Fund,"Grigoli, F (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",fgrigoli@imf.org,,,,,,,29,2,5,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

There have been numerous efforts to reconcile affirmative action policies with celebrated matching mechanisms such as the deferred acceptance and top trading cycles algorithms. Nevertheless, it is theoretically shown that under these algorithms, the policy based on majority quotas may be detrimental to minorities. Using simulations, we find that this is a more common phenomenon rather than a peculiarity. To circumvent the inefficiency caused by majority quotas, we offer a different interpretation of the affirmative action policies based on minority reserves. With minority reserves, schools give higher priority to minority students up to the point that the minorities fill the reserves. We compare the welfare effects of these policies. The deferred acceptance algorithm with minority reserves Pareto dominates the one with majority quotas. Our simulations, which allow for correlations between student preferences and school priorities, indicate that minorities are, on average, better off with minority reserves while adverse effects on majorities are mitigated.","[Hafalir, Isa E.; Yenmez, M.

It is shown that a school whose students are disadvantaged on the labor market applies less demanding standards because such students have lower ability or less incentives to graduate. The model's predictions are tested using Dutch school-level data. Since students in the Netherlands have to participate in both a central and a school specific examination, we can identify the grading policy of individual schools. We find that schools which harbor greater shares of disadvantaged students tend to set lower standards.

In a public private partnership, the two tasks of building the infrastructure and operating it are delegated to one private contractor (a consortium), while under traditional procurement, these tasks are delegated to separate contractors. We find support for the theoretical prediction that, compared to traditional procurement, a public private partnership provides stronger incentives to make cost-reducing investments (which may increase or decrease service quality).

Unlike the existing study, combining the two frameworks in the fields of accounting and economics allows us to examine different earnings characteristics determined by the correlation between normal/abnormal earnings and the state of the economy. We derive a formula for the cost of executive earnings-based bonuses and obtain two key findings. First, we show that the typical bonus plan is beneficial to both shareholders and executives. To decrease the volatility of their wealth, shareholders prefer countercyclical earnings. Under this typical bonus plan, executives with countercyclical earnings can be greatly rewarded. Second, we find that the correlation between abnormal earnings and the state of the economy has a greater impact on bonuses than does the correlation between normal earnings and the state of the economy. This finding suggests that it is important to consider the relationship between abnormal earnings and the state of the economy when compensating an executive through an earnings-based bonus.

Meanwhile, on a per country and panel basis, the testing results using the DOLS approach match those of the short-run and long-run causal relations running from exchange rates to stock prices. These findings suggest that the monetary authorities for the ASEAN-5 should keep allowing their currency values of being determined by the economic fundamentals instead of interrupting them only in order to stimulate export growth unless a great deal of short-term speculative funds (hot money) flow into the currency markets.

Our estimates of value-added suggest that the domestic content of China's exports increased from only 53% to about 60% over the period 2003-2006.

In the EU, nearly one in every five children experienced poverty in 2008 while for the population as a whole, the risk of poverty was around 17%. The scale of this problem and its consequences underpin the importance of identifying and learning about the underlying processes. This article aims to study how family cash benefits have impacted on child poverty, over recent years. Based on microdata gathered by the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU_SILC) for the period 2004-2008, we generate a portrait of child income poverty in four countries: Italy, Portugal, Spain and Poland. Moreover, we consider the major legislative changes in family social security payments able to impact on child poverty. The international comparison enables an identification of the children's poverty profile and pattern of incidence across the countries analysed while also analysing just how family and child cash benefits have impacted on child poverty.

Ex ante disagreement is strongly correlated with dispersion in ex post forecast errors. Surprise movements in either measure lead to significant reductions in production that abate fairly quickly. We extend our analysis to US data, measuring uncertainty with forecast disagreement from the Business Outlook Survey. Surprise increases in forecast dispersion lead to more persistent reductions in production than in the German data.

We construct a panel dataset of 14,271 individuals who were awarded Ph.D.s between 1986 and 2000 in U.S. and Canadian economics departments. For this population of scholars, we amass complete records of publications in peer-reviewed journals listed in the JEL (a total of 368,672 observations). We find evidence of significantly diminished productivity in recent relative to earlier cohorts when productivity of an individual is measured by the number of AER-equivalent publications. Diminished productivity is less evident when the number of AER-equivalent pages is used instead. Our findings are consistent with earlier empirical findings of increasing editorial delays, decreasing acceptance rates at journals, and a trend toward longer manuscripts. This decline in productivity is evident in both graduates of top 30 and non-top 30 ranked economics departments and may have important implications for what should constitute a tenurable record. We also find that the research rankings of top economics departments are a surprisingly poor predictor of the subsequent research rankings of their Ph.D.s graduates.

We show that, in a context of a perfect capital market where agents inherit human capital and wealth, it is the inherited human capital level that determines agents' occupational choice and investment. The critical assumption is that the entrepreneurial activity is of increasing returns to scale. This creates a higher profile of revenue for entrepreneurs. Although every agent can choose to become an entrepreneur, and although there is no barrier of entry in entrepreneurship, only those who receive a relatively higher human capital will do so. Agents whose inherited human capital is lower than the human capital threshold, endogenously determined, are better off becoming workers. Even in the context of a perfect capital market, which allows less endowed agents to borrow and invest in education, it turns out that the agents who inherit a low level of human capital bear a greater utility cost in their education investment. So they are better off investing less in education, lending their savings, and working as workers. As a result, agents' occupational choice depends on the intergenerational transmission of human capital. In the long run, the population is polarized into the rich entrepreneurs and the poor workers, magnifying inequality persistence in human capital level and revenue.","Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75647 Paris 13, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Fall, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",falilou.fall@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

DFG also argue that the revived regime will be sustainable, despite its large global imbalances. While much of the literature generated by DFG's thesis points to specific differences between the earlier regime and revived regime that render the latter unstable, we argue that an underlying similarity between the two regimes renders the revived regime unstable. Specifically, to the extent that the present system constitutes a revived Bretton-Woods system, it is vulnerable to the same set of destabilizing forces including asset-price bubbles and global financial crises that marked the latter years of the earlier regime, leading to its breakdown. We extend the Markov switching model to examine the relation between global liquidity and commodity prices. We find an evidence of commodity-price bubbles in both the latter stages of the earlier Bretton-Woods regime and the revived regime.","[Hall, Stephen G.] Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Hall, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",,,,,,,,69,7,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Focusing on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) designated by the United Nations, we construct a new measure of trade cost, based on the Baltic Dry Index (BDI), as an instrument for trade. The BDI reflects the cost of utilizing dry bulk carriers, which are specially designed vessels for transporting primary goods internationally, where these goods dominate the output and export sectors of the LDCs. We find that a 1% expansion in trade raises GDP per capita by approximately 0.5% on average.

It is assumed that domestic companies in a more-developed country use more capital in production and that wages in a less-developed country are lower. Countries can compete for FDI by increasing the supply of public inputs in the economy, in addition to (or instead of) offering subsidies or tax reliefs to foreign investors. The results reveal that if governments of competing countries are not allowed to discriminate between domestic and foreign firms, there may be situations in which a less-developed economy will attract FDI depending on the labor cost differential and the responsiveness of foreign investor's and domestic companies' output to changes in the supply of public inputs. If tax discrimination between domestic and foreign firms is permitted, both countries will optimally raise the supply of public inputs, but the more-developed country will always win the foreign investment despite higher labor costs. Thus, governments of less-developed countries may have an incentive to work on an international agreement to disallow tax discrimination.","Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Public Finance,"Vuksic, G (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",goran.vuksic@ijf.hr,"Vuksic, Goran/A-7454-2016","Vuksic, Goran/0000-0003-1502-5561",,,,,22,3,3,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We apply bounds testing techniques to different energy types separately. Robustness tests are performed by including additional variables and restricting the analysis to the period after 1970. The results show that there exist robust long-run relationships going from real GDP toward heating oil and electricity consumption. The relationship between heating oil and GDP is in fact bidirectional, although weaker from heating oil toward GDP than in the reverse direction. When investigating the period 1970-2010 only, the estimate of the long-run income elasticity of electricity consumption loses statistical significance and that for heating oil becomes negative. Those results imply a possible decoupling between GDP growth and energy consumption, so that energy conservation policies are not necessarily expected to have a negative impact on Swiss economic growth.

This paper uses data for 132 countries for the period 1995-2008 to investigate the implications of these differences for the consumption of gasoline for road transport. To address the potential for simultaneity bias, we use both a country's oil reserves and the international crude oil price as instruments for a country's average gasoline pump price. We obtain estimates of the long-run price elasticity of gasoline demand of between -0.2 and -0.5. Using newly available data for a sub-sample of 43 countries, we also find that higher gasoline prices induce consumers to substitute to vehicles that are more fuel-efficient, with an estimated elasticity of +02. Despite the small size of our elasticity estimates, there is considerable scope for low-price countries to achieve gasoline savings and vehicle fuel economy improvements via reducing gasoline subsidies and/or increasing gasoline taxes.

These models capture the main properties of electricity spot prices well but estimation of the model parameters requires computer intensive methods. Moreover, the distribution of the price spikes must be fully specified although the high volatility of the spikes makes it difficult to check such distributional assumptions. Consequently, there are a number of competing proposals for the distribution in the spike regime. As an alternative, we propose a semiparametric Markov regime-switching model that leaves the distribution under the spike regime unspecified. We show that the model parameters can be estimated by employing robust statistical techniques. This presents an alternative to the existing estimation methods that are based on computer intensive numerical maximization of the likelihood function. The model in combination with the estimation framework is easier to estimate, needs less computation time and distributional assumptions. To show its advantages we compare the proposed model with a well-established Markov regime-switching model in a simulation study. Furthermore, we apply the model to logprices for the Australian electricity market. The results are in accordance with the results from the simulation study, indicating that the proposed model might be advantageous whenever the distribution of the spike process is not sufficiently known. The results are thus encouraging and suggest the use of our approach when modeling electricity prices and pricing derivatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We examine 3 possible explanations for the observed productivity gap between exporting and non-exporting firms: self-selection of high-performing firms into exporting; post-entry learning effects; and joint export-investment decisions. We consider both initial entry into exporting and subsequent expansion into new destination markets, showing that capital deepening and employment growth are associated with both types of entry. However, the timing of investment differs between the 2 entry events. The observed dynamics are consistent with a model of investment under uncertainty, in which first-time exporters delay investment to gain more information about the success of their export ventures, while experienced exporters pre-commit to capital deepening in advance of additional market expansion.

By using statistical and econometric tools, we first attempt to identify the long term relationship between WTI spot prices and the prices of futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Subsequently we model the short term dynamic between these two prices and this analysis points up several breaks. On this basis, a short term Markov Switching Vectorial Error Correction model (MS-VECM) with two distinct states (standard state and crisis state) has been estimated. Finally we introduce the volumes of transactions observed on the NYMEX for the WTI contracts and we estimate the influence of the non-commercial players. We conclude that the hypothesis of an influence of non-commercial players on the probability for being in the crisis state cannot be rejected. In addition, we show that the rise in liquidity of the first financial contracts, as measured by the volume of open interest, is a key element to understand the dynamics in market prices.

The sources of inefficiencies in each of the two cases arise from the different strategic use of the available information.","[Hortala-Vallve, Rafael] London Sch Econ, Dept Govt, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Llorente-Saguer, Aniol] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany; [Nagel, Rosemarie] Univ Pompeu Fabra, ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Max Planck Society; ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University,"Llorente-Saguer, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany.",aniol@coll.mpg.de,"; Nagel, Rosemarie/C-6311-2013","Llorente-Saguer, Aniol/0000-0001-8704-5284; Nagel, Rosemarie/0000-0001-6599-0664",ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,47,3,3,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

We draw on a rich German panel data set containing information about three generations. This allows instrumenting maternal education by the number of her siblings while conditioning on grandparental characteristics. The instrumental variables approach has not yet been used in the intergenerational context and works for the sample sizes of common household panels. We find substantial effects on health behavior for adolescent daughters, but neither for adolescent sons nor for the health status of newborns. We show that possible concerns for the validity of the instrument are unlikely to compromise these results. We discuss mother's health behavior, assortative mating, household income, and child's schooling track as possible channels of the estimated effects. Maternal education seems to affect daughter's smoking behavior through the higher likelihood of the daughter pursuing a higher secondary schooling track.","[Kemptner, Daniel; Marcus, Jan] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Kemptner, D (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",dkemptner@diw.de; jmarcus@diw.de,"Marcus, Jan/AAG-1203-2020","Marcus, Jan/0000-0001-9407-6660",,,,,35,11,13,2,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The main goal of our study is to use the estimation results to point to the optimal trade policy for Israel, and compare it with the current policy. Using disaggregated panel data on Israel's exports to its 22 main trading partners we were able to implement a unique estimation procedure, which enables a new and closer look at the effectiveness of the country's foreign trade policy. Our model estimates Israel's total export elasticities as well as specific elasticities of exports to each trading-partner. The model produces positive export elasticities with respect to a partner country's total imports and the real exchange rate. Free trade agreements (FTAs) were also examined, and were found to have a considerable positive effect on exports. A higher level of corruption in the destination country was found to be associated with a lower level of Israeli exports. Using our estimated results, and taking into account the array of Israel's foreign trade policy tools, we formulated recommendations for policy reform, highlighting the potential benefits of this reform on Israel's predicted exports. If no new foreign trade policy is introduced, a total growth of 74% in Israel's exports is expected over the course of 2012-2020; however, if reform recommendations are implemented, the expected growth rate nearly doubles, as Israeli exports are predicted to grow by a total of 135%.11 (C) 2012 Society for Policy Modeling.

Thus defining affirmative action within food security programs may be necessary as the current practice of designing food security programs around the poverty line is shown to deliver limited results. In this regard, another lack of consideration is region-specific analysis within the rural areas which shows varied influence, thereby cautioning against a 'one size fits all' general policy of the central government. Evidence also shows that socio-economic factors and social assistance programs had different impacts on calorie gap depending on ones nutritional status. This nonlinear relationship has been neglected in most studies on food security and thus raises doubt on past assessment and policy implications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our proposal would require that a small fraction of each MMF shareholder's recent balances, called the minimum balance at risk (MBR), be available for redemption only with a delay of 30 days. Most regular transactions in the fund would be unaffected; the requirement would only affect redemptions of the shareholder's MBR. In addition, in the rare event that a fund suffers losses, the MBRs of investors who have recently made large redemptions would absorb losses before those of nonredeeming investors. This subordination of redeeming investors' MBRs would create a disincentive to redeem if the fund is likely to have losses, but would have little effect on incentives when the risk of loss is remote. We use empirical evidence, including a novel data set from the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on MMF losses in 2008, to calibrate an MBR rule that would reduce the vulnerability of MMFs to runs.","[McCabe, Patrick E.] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC USA; [Cipriani, Marco; Holscher, Michael; Martin, Antoine] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"McCabe, PE (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC USA.",,"Cipriani, Marco/JWA-1923-2024","Cipriani, Marco/0000-0003-1960-3963",,,,,7,7,8,0,16,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The article starts with a theoretical discussion on the factors influencing efficiency of the procurement including potential impacts of the e-procurement and the e-auction. Than five hypotheses are formulated and the set of data is described. The next part introduces results of the regression analyses. It shows indirect proportion of the relation between the number of the submitted bids and the winning price. Each additional bid brings decrease of the price by approximately 3.4% of the expected price. The use of the e-auctions is connected with an increase of the number of the submitted bids by 0.7, which mean an average decrease of the winning price by approximately 2.4% of the expected price. The article concludes that the application of the e-auctions brings an indirect impact on the winning price. The reason is that it is more transparent than standard tenders. It probably affects the trust of bidders and increases of their number.","[Pavel, Jan] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Sicakova-Beblava, Emilia] Comenius Univ, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia",Prague University of Economics & Business; Comenius University Bratislava,"Pavel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",pavelj@vse.cz; ema@transparency.sk,"Sicakova-Beblava, Emilia/AAN-1160-2020; Pavel, Jan/E-5003-2017","Pavel, Jan/0000-0001-7028-0640",,,,,24,23,25,0,15,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In this sense, if a transmission planner suggests building some lines in anticipation of generation capacity investments, then it can induce generation companies to invest in a more socially efficient manner. In this paper, we solve for the optimal way of doing this anticipative power transmission planning. Inspired in the proactive transmission planning model proposed by Sauma and Oren (2006) we formulate a mixed integer linear programming optimization model that integrates transmission planning, generation investment, and market operation decisions and propose a methodology to solve for the optimal transmission expansion. Contrary to the proactive methodology proposed by Sauma and Oren (2006), our model solves the optimal transmission expansion problem anticipating both generation investment and market clearing. We use the marginalist theory with production cost functions inversely related to the installed capacity in a perfectly competitive electricity market and we find all possible generation expansion pure Nash equilibria.

We analyse the possible reasons why real GDP diverges from the theoretical concept of the objective level of value added adjusted for inflation. These reasons concern real exchange rate appreciation and overestimation of inflation due to quality changes in output after the collapse of central planning. To overcome the shortcomings of real GDP in explaining the true transformation story we develop the concept of comparable real GDP. This concept is calculated from nominal GDP, the exchange rate against the euro, and inflation in the euro area. While the differences between standard real GDP and comparable real GDP are modest and temporary in advanced economies, they are quantitatively and qualitatively significant and persistent in transformation and post-transformation economies. On the basis of the relevant literature we introduce two modifications of comparable real GDP. They account for likely differences in productivity patterns between tradables and non-tradables and between the performance of the export and non-export segments of the economy respectively. We conclude that true convergence is proceeding at a significantly higher pace than real GDP implies and that the Czech economy is converging to the euro area somewhat faster than the Polish economy and much faster than the Hungarian economy.","Czech Natl Bank, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank,"Singer, M (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Prikope 28, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",miroslav.singer@cnb.cz,,,,,,,21,10,10,0,12,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The results suggest that low access to credit of small and young firms, certainly in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), is mainly due to low application rates. However, there is evidence to suggest that firms may be anticipating the bank's decision on a loan application by not applying for credit. Using the Heckman methodology suggests that marginal applications are more likely to be rejected. There are significant country and regional differences in applications, with the latter also evident in the rejection decision. There is no evidence that rural firms have significantly lower application or acceptance rates, given their other characteristics, or that foreign firms crowd domestic ones out of the market for credit.

A central bank of a euro area type monetary union has a similar capacity as long as the integrity of the union is beyond doubt. By contrast, within any fixed exchange rate system the availability of inter-central bank credit determines the elasticity of a central bank in providing liquidity. Finally, domestic constraints, i.e. collateral rules, risk taking ability or legal prohibitions, can limit the elasticity of the central bank's response to liquidity shocks.","[Bindseil, Ulrich] European Cent Bank, D-60439 Frankfurt, Germany; [Winkler, Adalbert] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Bindseil, U (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60439 Frankfurt, Germany.",ulrich.bindseil@ecb.int; a.winkler@fs.de,,,,,,,30,2,2,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In line with previous work which has explored the determinants of good institutions, this paper examines the impact of economic and social inequalities between ethnic groups on government quality. I hypothesize that greater inequalities between groups will tend to undermine institutions both because they tend to legitimize corruption in the eyes of disadvantaged groups and because of the efforts of better-off groups to maintain their privileges. Based on a panel of 29 developing countries, I find that socio-economic ethnic group inequalities reduce government quality, something which suggests the convenience of policies that can level the playing field in ethnically heterogeneous societies.","Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Fac Ciencies Econ & Empresarials, Girona 17071, Spain",Universitat de Girona,"Kyriacou, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Fac Ciencies Econ & Empresarials, Campus Montilivi, Girona 17071, Spain.",andreas.kyriacou@udg.es,"Kyriacou, Andreas/G-8973-2015","Kyriacou, Andreas/0000-0001-9571-2833",,,,,83,19,19,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2013,66.0,1,,,,,78,101,,10.1111/kykl.12012,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,066ZV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313262000005,0

We define and analyze one type of heuristic strategy, in which firms choose strategies based on the expectation of their opponents' private information rather than the full information about the distribution of that private information. We find that, in equilibrium, the degree to which the heuristic strategy differs from the Bayesian strategy depends on: (1) the convexity of a firm's marginal profits with respect to their opponents' private information and (2) whether firm strategies are complementary or substitutable. Under certain conditions, firms' equilibrium profits are greater when all firms use heuristics than when all firms use the full information.

Analysis took into account the cross-sectional dependence and was applied to test the causality among the variables form the panel. Firstly, panel unit root tests were used for determining stationary of variables. As a result of the panel unit root tests, it was found that GDP and foreign direct investment have a stationary structure and that total credits and current account deficit contain unit root. In order to see whether there is a long-term relationship among the variables or not, the panel co-integration test was used. As a result of the test, it was concluded that there is a co-integration relationship among the series. The possibility of a causal relationship was analyzed among the variables using the causality test developed by Elena Ivona Dumitrescu and Christophe Hurlin (2012). Results of the analysis showed a unidirectional causal relationship from current account deficit and foreign direct investment to GDP.

Under persistent shocks, numerical simulations show that increasing the preference for robustness continues to imply more aggressive responses to cost shocks.

The idea of comparing the sectors arose from the discovery in two previous articles of a discrepancy in the results mainly for the indices proposed by Gu&Lev to measure intangibility and their impact on value creation. The database used was Thomson-Reuters collected in Datastream, with information covering the period from 2001 to 2010. Gu&Lev (2003, 2011) present a proposal that aims to calculate a variable, comprehensive value, which encompasses the tangible and intangible assets of the company and are therefore a proxy for their market value. If this variable explains the market value, it is a solution to a problem that afflicts accountants, which is how to account for intangibles in the balance sheet. They also propose two other variables, one that is a proxy for the flow of intangibles (Intangibles-Driven-Earnings-IDE), and another that is a proxy for the stock of intangibles (Intangible Capital-IC). They present a set of hypotheses that relate traditional variables linked to intangibility (research and development expenditures-RD, selling, general and administrative expenses-SGA, and investment in fixed capital-CAPEX) with the flow (IDE), stock of intangibles (IC) and intangibility indicators that explain the shareholder return. We observed differences between the sectors, reinforcing the conviction that the sectors are important to explain differences in the intangibility indices. The results indicated for the software sector that: (i) the explanatory variables expenditures on research and development (RD) and selling, general and administrative (SGA) were statistically significant in explaining the flow of intangibles (IDE) and the stock of intangibles (IC), but the strong correlation between the explanatory variables may have changed the RD signal, that (ii) the flow of intangibles (IDE) and earnings (EARN) represented by EBITDA showed no statistical significance in its relation to the return to shareholder (TSR), that (iii) the Comprehensive value presented positive and significant relationship with the market value of the company and (iv) the rate of intangibility ICBV and RI had significant explanatory power on the variable and shareholder return. The comparison with the hardware sector enabled us to verify that there are no repeated results. Since the results for the hardware sector indicate that: (i) the variables RD, SGA and CAPEX were significant in explaining the IDE, however, the variables RD and CAPEX showed negative signs which contradicts what was expected, since the variables RD, SGA and CAPEX were not statistically significant in explaining the IC, that (ii) IDE and EARN were not statistically significant compared to the TSR and that (iii) the Comprehensive value had a significant relationship with market value company and (iv) the rate of MtCV, ICM and RI had explanatory power in relation to shareholder return.","[Basso, Leonardo; Kimura, Herbert; Saliba, Juliana; Braune, Erica] Mackenzie Persbyterian Univ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,"Basso, L (通讯作者)，Mackenzie Persbyterian Univ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",leonardobasso@mackenzie.br; herbert.kimura@gmail.com; julianasaliba@hotmail.com; ericabraune@hotmail.com,"Basso, Leonardo Fernando Cruz/AAP-5595-2020; Basso, Leonardo Fernando Cruz/N-3925-2019","Basso, Leonardo Fernando Cruz/0000-0002-3064-0194",,,,,40,0,0,0,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,54,62,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000007,0

Economic interpretations of these gravity equations vary in terms of two basic elements: the exporter's mass variable and the elasticity of trade with respect to true ad valorem trade costs. In this paper, we offer three potential contributions. First, we formulate and estimate a structural gravity equation based on the standard Krugman model of monopolistic competition and increasing returns. In the context of this model, a key parameter, the elasticity of substitution in consumption (sigma), can be estimated precisely even without observable true ad valorem trade-cost measures - using exporter's population and observable variables that influence trade costs. Second, in the empirical context of the well-known McCallum Canadian-U.S. border puzzle, our approach - allowing estimation of sigma - yields considerably different general equilibrium comparative static trade-flow and economic welfare effects than those in an Armington endowment economy and assumed values of sigma. Moreover, our predicted trade flows and GDPs are highly correlated with their respective observed values in the case of bilaterally symmetric or asymmetric Canadian-U.S. border effects. Third, a Monte Carlo analysis confirms unbiased and precise estimates of all coefficients, the elasticity of substitution, and comparative statics using our approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the rule relates to the sectoral structure of the economy, and to demographic transition.

Assuming the retirement age at 62 we estimate the size of the economically active population in Slovakia to culminate in 2013 and decrease onwards rather sharply. Postponing the retirement age to 65 anticipates only a slowdown of the decreasing trend while postponing it to 70 would allow the number of the economically active population to culminate at higher levels earliest around 2020.

Contrarily, remittance inflows increase with the volatility in host countries, especially for middle-income countries. Lower interest rates in host countries lead to larger remittance outflows. Trade and capital account openness are the most important factors that determine both remittance inflows and outflows.

A detailed descriptive analysis reveals typical integration patterns, with DTTs and BITs often being first steps towards deeper integration. We consider the effects of PEIAs on bilateral goods trade, services trade, and FDI and provide conclusive evidence that single and combined PEIAs are associated with positive effects not only on single outcome but typically on all outcomes. Investment liberalization through DTTs and BITs seems to be particularly beneficial since concluding them alone or in any combination with other agreements encourages goods trade even more than the liberalization of goods trade per se.

Neoclassical economists tend to focus on market solutions such as carbon trading, drawing on ideas of perfect rationality of actors and the appropriateness of omarginal' analysis. To link such policies to the whole range of potential actions, from legislative and regulatory to changing individual behaviours, requires the economy and society to be analysed in its full complexity, recognising that omarginal' analysis can be not just irrelevant but positively harmful when the need is for systemic shifts in economic and social trajectories.

In sharp contrast, emerging and developing countries have followed procyclical fiscal policy, thus exacerbating the underlying business cycle. We show that, over the last decade, about a third of the developing world has been able to escape the procyclicality trap and actually become countercyclical. We then focus on the role played by the quality of institutions, which appears to be a key determinant of a country's ability to graduate. We show that, even after controlling for the endogeneity of institutions and other determinants of fiscal procyclicality, there is a causal link running from stronger institutions to less procyclical or more countercyclical fiscal policy.

The relation between industry sales growth and M&A gains is U-shaped. The extent of foreign competition within the industry, industry technological intensity and industry deregulation bear no significant association with M&A wealth effects, however.

To achieve this objective, a questionnaire was developed and the responses from 30 companies were analysed, and interviews with 6 project managers were conducted to further supplement and substantiate the survey results. The analysis reported that green building projects required an average of 8% more time than traditional building projects of similar size and characteristics.

I build upon Kremer's (1993) O-ring theory of production to explain this stylized fact. I posit that there are two kinds of jobs: O-ring jobs where strategic complementarities to skill are large, and a diminishing-returns Foolproof sector, where two mediocre workers provide the same effective labor as one excellent worker. Both production functions are available to each country. In equilibrium, an econometrician would only see small returns to skill within a country. In a world where countries vary only slightly in the average skill of workers, these assumptions are sufficient to generate massive differences in cross-country income inequality while generating only small amounts of intra-country income inequality.

Thereby, we explore the similarity between the resulting paradox and Kenneth Arrow's well known Impossibility Theorem. Based on these considerations we suggest a solution for the former problem along the lines of Herbert Simon and Amos Tversky, which might-if driven to its extreme-even provide a unique and arguably rational solution for consumer choice among multidimensional goods. Eventually, we argue that the resulting framework poses a potentially useful starting point for further developing an evolutionary theory of consumer choice.","[Kapeller, Jakob] Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Schuetz, Bernhard] Univ Linz, Dept Econ, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Steinerberger, Stefan] Univ Bonn, Math Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",Johannes Kepler University Linz; Johannes Kepler University Linz; University of Bonn,"Kapeller, J (通讯作者)，Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, Altenbergerstr 50, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",jakob.kapeller@jku.at; bernhard.schuetz@jku.at; steinerb@math.uni-bonn.de,"Kapeller, Jakob/AAP-1109-2020","Steinerberger, Stefan/0000-0002-7745-4217",,,,,39,7,9,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

For a rapid recovery from such a crisis, the government often undertakes Crisis Resolution Policy (CRP) measure(s). Existing studies have paid little attention to these CRP measures and their correlations with long-lasting banking crises. This study fills that literature void. The major finding is that the CRP measure that allows the regulation forbearance to keep the insolvent banks operative is strongly significant in increasing the duration of a banking crisis. Another CRP measure, which relieves bank borrowers from paying debt, is also significant but weakly significant in increasing the duration of a crisis.","[Dewan, Hasnat] Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, Canada; [Khan, Anichul Hoque] Univ Regina, Dept Econ, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",University of Regina,"Dewan, H (通讯作者)，Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, Canada.",hdewan@tru.ca,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Our analysis of the determinants of whether a country belongs or not to the blessed resources regime indicates that the level of democracy plays an important role while education and economic institutions have no effect.","[Konte, Maty] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, F-13236 Marseille 02, France; [Konte, Maty] Ctr Vieille Charite, EHESS, F-13236 Marseille 02, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Konte, M (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille 02, France.",maty.konte@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,30,19,22,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This has resulted in a growth of academic interest in ways of analysing their contribution. Following a review of the literature on the contrasting approaches that have been used, this paper assesses the economic impact of the Beijing Olympics, in particular the tourism impact, using computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling. To add novelty, it analyses the data under conditions of imperfect competition, an approach that has been used to good effect in other contexts, notably international trade. The findings suggest that staging the Beijing Olympics brought economic benefits to the host economy but that the scale of the impact was not significant compared to the total size of the economy. The welfare impacts of the Beijing Olympics under imperfect competition are shown to be higher than when perfect competition is assumed. This is explained by the pro-competitive effect.

We first show that unobservable risk aversion or cost leads to low-powered incentives. We then consider the case where both risk aversion and cost of the agent are unobservable to the principal. This multidimensional mechanism design problem is solved under two assumptions with regard to the structures of performance measurement system and wage contract. It is shown that if the deterministic and stochastic components of performance measures vary proportionally, the principal is inclined to provide a low-powered incentive contract. Moreover, it is shown that if the base wage depends on a quadratic function rather than the direction of the performance wage vector, no incentive is provided for most of the performance measures in an orthogonal performance measurement system.

These indicators are then partly connected together, showing some implications on the function of cooperatives and their profit. In the end, this paper suggests the close relationship of the agricultural cooperatives to joint-stock companies. The production cooperatives show closer relation to the COOP principles, but also declare lower number of profitable coops in sample.","[Mikus, Petr] Ekon Spravni Fak MU, Katedra Podnikoveho Hospodarstvi, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,,"Mikus, Petr/AAE-1129-2020",,,,,,4,1,1,0,4,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3636-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,394,399,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA8IJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338150300064,0

The results show that seafood import is price elastic. Exchange rate has a negative effect, while Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and tourism have positive effects on seafood imports. Import and domestic production do not have a short run causal relationship. The increase in Caribbean seafood imports is primarily due to decreasing import price and increasing domestic demand. The decline of domestic fisheries production has other causes than import competition. However, imports and domestic production have a negative long run equilibrium relationship.

In particular, we compare responses to two questions asked of all adult respondents about the likelihood that a lost wallet or purse will be returned either by osomeone who lives close by' or by a ocomplete stranger'. Although reported levels of trust are very low, we find that South African adults are significantly more likely to report trusting neighbours than strangers. We use ordered probit regressions to estimate the correlates of these two measures of trust and in particular, to probe race differences in trust. Consistent with studies from the USA and from South Africa, we find considerable racial variation in reported trust. In comparison with whites, other population groups in South Africa are significantly less likely to report trusting people who live close by. However, these race differences are dramatically reduced once differences in personal and neighbourhood income are controlled for. In contrast, race differences in trust of strangers are smaller, and they are even reversed among black South Africans, who appear more trusting than other population groups of strangers.","[Posel, Dorrit] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South Africa; [Hinks, Tim] Univ W England, Div Econ, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of West England,"Posel, D (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South Africa.",posel@ukzn.ac.za,"Posel, Dorrit/AAF-7750-2021","Posel, Dorrit/0000-0002-3343-875X; Hinks, Timothy/0000-0001-7761-931X",,,,,40,7,8,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

The phenomenon of agricultural land abandonment is complex and, in order to explain the causes, it is necessary to consider not only the physical and productive features of the land but also the social and economic characteristics of the area. It also appears to be conditioned by production specialization, since traditional livestock-raising areas show a higher risk of abandonment. The process, which is gradual, starts with a reduction in production intensity followed by increasing marginalization and, finally, the total abandonment of land use. Focusing on a representative area on the Cantabrian Coast of northern Spain, this study tests the hypothesis that a large portion of agricultural land in livestock-oriented regions is underused. It also evaluates the viability of forestry as an alternative use for abandoned lands and the potential effects of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform.","[Ramon Murua, Juan; Astorkiza, Inmaculada; Eguia, Begona] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Appl Econ 5, Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Murua, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Appl Econ 5, Bilbao, Spain.",inma.astorkiza@ehu.es,"Peña, Begoña Eguía/Y-1096-2019","Peña, Begoña Eguía/0000-0003-1852-1624",,,,,24,3,3,0,16,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,3,,,SI,,397,414,,10.2298/PAN1303397M,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,148KC,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319242500009,0

Therefore, in the current economic theories it is also very important to recognize the role of human capital and its management necessity, to understand the HC formation and application as a manageable process, which you need knowing well both in micro and in macro level. Evaluation of HC in macro level should include not only direct HC evaluation, but environmental evaluation as well. There must be evaluated not only the formal value of HC, but also the material, economical, social, environmental conditions, determining its appliance productivity and the need of systematic approach to HC. HC system evaluation framework in country level consists of a number of social and economic indicators, which depending on their size and system performance are expressed in various sizes of absolute or relative indicators. The integration of these indicators into a single one, form an integrated index. For various phenomena to investigate and analyze in practice, the index method is used often, which helps to reveal the links and the structure between the researched phenomena (Human Development Index (Human development report 2011), the index of Genuine Wealth Assessment (Genuine Wealth Assessment (2012), and so on.). Applying index calculation method, this article aims to reveal the indicators characterizing the formation principles of HC system, creating their evaluation methodology and on its base performing a comparative HC system-level analysis among the EU countries. The paper presents the main advantages of multi-factor indices method application, evaluating particular areas of social and economic activities; there is also proposed a seven stages process of HC system's integrated index formation and its practical adaptability comparing the selected EU countries and determining their level of HC development. The results of accomplished comparative evaluation of HC system in the 27 European Union countries using five groups of indices (social, innovation, consumer value - income, costs, and economic development) allowed creating an information basis selecting the effective indices, making it possible to evaluate the formation level of HC system in individual EU countries.","[Sakalas, Algimantas; Liepe, Zieduna] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Sakalas, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",algimantas.sakalas@ktu.lt; zieduna.liepe@ktu.lt,"Santos, Maria/E-8450-2014",,,,,,28,5,5,1,27,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Remittances have a significantly positive impact on capital accumulation while the impact on TFP growth is insignificant. These findings suggest that while remittances enhance investment and contribute to physical capital accumulation, the lack of efficiency enhancing effect or possible adverse impact on TFP growth would make the net effect on economic growth ambiguous.","Bloomsburg Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Bloomsburg, PA 17815 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania,"Senbeta, A (通讯作者)，Bloomsburg Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Bloomsburg, PA 17815 USA.",asenbeta@bloomu.edu,,,,,,,14,25,26,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Based on panel estimation methods, and using both a moving SD measure and the Peree and Steinherr (1989) measure of exchange rate uncertainty, the results show that US bilateral fresh fruit trade has been negatively affected by exchange rate uncertainty. We also find some evidence that the exchange rate between the US dollar and the currencies of Latin American trading partners accounts for most of the negative impact of exchange rate uncertainty on bilateral trade flows in fresh fruit. In contrast, when using panel estimation methods and both measures of exchange rate uncertainty, we find no statistically significant evidence for any negative effect of exchange rate uncertainty on US bilateral fresh vegetable trade.

Overall, our results suggest that the inclusion of factors in the VAR allows us to obtain a more coherent picture of the effects of monetary policy innovations, both by achieving responses easier to understand from the theoretical point of view and by increasing the precision of such responses. Moreover, this framework allows us to compute impulse-response functions for all the variables included in the panel, thereby providing a more complete depiction of the effects of policy disturbances.

In this article, we follow a rather unique approach by estimating the density functions of the observed trade flows and the density functions of trade flows generated by tariff removal using an intertemporal global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. Our inquiry is whether or not the trade flows generated by global tariff elimination impact economies in the long-run and alter their historical underlying distributions. If the latter case prevails, it implies that the economies follow a different transitional path into a new steady-state equilibrium. The density functions, estimated parameters and higher moments of the observed trade flow distributions are distinctly different from the parameter estimates of the trade flows generated by the model. In this sense, trade-inducing economic activity as generated by tariff removal and captured by the neoclassical specification of the model is associated with trade flows along a different transitional path from the observed trade flows.","USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Somwaru, AL (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",agapi.somwaru@yahoo.com,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the short run, the Granger causality test favors the 'wealth effect' hypothesis; conversely, in the long run, the existence of the 'credit-price' effect is discernible above a certain threshold value, whilst the 'wealth effect' is apparent below this threshold value, which implies a bi-directional feedback causal relationship.

In addition, banks, particularly the largest, have also dramatically expanded their retail banking operations over the past few years (Hirtle and Stiroh, 2007). Our goal, in this article, is to study the effects of default risk on equity returns through bank interest margin management under a renewed focus on domestic retail banking, a trend often attributed to the stability of banking activities. Specifically, this article explores the determinants of optimal bank interest margins based on an option-based firm-theoretical model with multiple sources of structural breaks due to political pressure. The model demonstrates how capital regulation and political pressure on foreign lending return and risk conditions jointly determine the optimal bank interest margin decision. We show that a more stringent capital requirement is linked with lower equity return, but higher default risk of the bank in the return to domestic retail banking. An increased focus on the political pressure on foreign lending return is linked with higher equity return and default risk of the bank. It is also showed that an increased focus on the political pressure on foreign lending risk decreases the bank's equity return and default risk. We conclude that the return to domestic retail banking may be a relatively stable activity when the political pressure decision impacts only the expected risk of the bank's foreign lending and not the return.","[Tsai, Jeng-Yan; Lin, Jyh-Horng] Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, Tamsui, Taipei County, Taiwan",Tamkang University,"Tsai, JY (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, Tamsui, Taipei County, Taiwan.",tsaijy@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This study considers prior findings that indicate that higher marketing expenditures for a brand reduce its price elasticity of demand, which may lead to higher prices, in the context of the Dutch pharmaceutical market. The authors find that parameters are heterogeneous across brands, and that marketing effects differ across product life cycle stages. They propose a separate analysis of established and new brands. For established brands, marketing efforts neither have a positive effect on sales, nor do they affect the price elasticity. For new brands, several proposed models might capture their diffusion pattern; the diffusion-of-innovation models provide the best results. Marketing accelerates the rate of diffusion and leads to a higher baseline level of sales.","[Wieringa, Jaap E.; Leeflang, Peter S.

Therefore, we analyze the effectiveness of monetary policy in steering euro area money market rates by looking at (i) the predictability of money market rates on the basis of monetary policy expectations and (ii) the impact of extraordinary central bank measures on money market rates. We find that during the crisis money market rates up to 12 months still respond to revisions in the expected path of future rates, even though to a lesser extent than before August 2007. We attribute part of the loss in monetary policy effectiveness to money market rates being driven by higher liquidity premia and increased uncertainty about future interest rates. Our results also indicate that the ECB's non-standard monetary policy measures as of October 2008 were effective in addressing the disruptions in the euro area money market. In fact, our estimates suggest that non-standard monetary policy measures helped to lower Euribor rates by more than 80 basis points. These findings show that central banks have effective tools at hand to conduct monetary policy in times of crises. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, past studies indicate that factors unrelated to betrayal aversion, such as loss aversion, could contribute to differences between treatments. Using a novel experiment design to isolate betrayal aversion, one that varies how strategic uncertainty is resolved, we provide rigorous evidence supporting the detrimental impact of betrayal aversion. The impact is substantial: holding fixed the probability of betrayal, the possibility of knowing that one has been betrayed reduces investment by about one-third. We suggest emotion-regulation underlies these results and helps to explain the importance of impersonal, institution-mediated exchange in promoting economic efficiency.","[Aimone, Jason A.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Tech Caril Res Inst, Roanoke, VA 24016 USA; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; George Mason University,"Aimone, JA (通讯作者)，Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Tech Caril Res Inst, 2 Riverside Circle, Roanoke, VA 24016 USA.",jaimone@vtc.vt.edu; dhouser@gmu.edu,"Houser, Daniel/JXX-4326-2024","Houser, Daniel/0000-0003-3583-8201",,,,,40,51,61,4,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Do the distinguishing features of off shoring introduce novel reasons for trade policy intervention? Does off shoring create new problems of global policy cooperation whose solutions require international agreements with novel features? In this paper we provide answers to these questions, and thereby initiate the study of trade agreements in the presence of offshoring. We argue that the rise of offshoring will make it increasingly difficult for governments to rely on traditional GATT/WTO concepts and rules-such. as market access, reciprocity and non-discrimination-to solve their trade-related problems.","[Antras, Pol] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Antras, Pol; Staiger, Robert W.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Staiger, Robert W.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Antràs, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, 1805 Cambridge St,Littauer 207, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",pantras@fas.harvard.edu; rstaiger@wisc.edu,,,,,,,56,128,141,7,99,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We estimate the dynamic responses of tax bases to changes in tax rates using aggregate panel data from Canadian provinces over the period 1972 to 2006. Our preferred empirical results indicate that a one percentage point increase in corporate income, personal income, and sales tax rates is associated with a 3.67, 0.76, and 1.17 percent reduction in their respective tax bases in the short run. The corresponding long-run tax base semi-elasticity estimates are higher: -13.60, -3.63, and -3.18, respectively. We use the tax base elasticity estimates to calculate the marginal cost of public funds (MCF) for the provinces' three major taxes. Our computations indicate that the corporate income had the highest MCF and that the sales tax had the lowest MCF in all provinces in 2006. The MCF for the personal income tax ranged from 1.44 in Alberta to 3.81 in Quebec. Our results imply that there would have been significant welfare gains in 2006 from reductions in provincial corporate income tax rates. Our computations also indicate that the equalization grant formula may reduce the perceived MCF of the provinces that receive these grants, and that increases in provincial corporate and personal income taxes can cause significant reductions in federal tax revenues.","[Dahlby, Bev] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada; [Ferede, Ergete] Grant MacEwan Univ, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Dahlby, B (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada.",bdahlby@ualberta.ca; FeredeE@macewan.ca,,,,,,,52,24,26,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In Argentina, issues relating to the supply of petrodiesel have been a crucial factor, whereas, in Brazil, the promotion of family farming has been a major objective.

From this it follows that in the near and not so near future, the United States will no longer be able to act as the driving force for world demand. In order to avoid a period of deflationary stagnation in major parts of the world economy, we finally propose the policy package of a global Keynesian New Deal that should consist of (1) reregulation of the financial sector, (2) reorientation of macroeconomic policies along (post) Keynesian lines, and (3) reconstruction of international macroeconomic policy coordination, in particular on the European level, and a new world financial order.","[Hein, Eckhard; Truger, Achim] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany; [Hein, Eckhard] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Hein, E (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany.",,"Hein, Eckhard/HQY-4102-2023","Hein, Eckhard/0000-0002-6542-6630",,,,,75,23,24,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The paper takes a minimum public sector size, dependent on each region's population, to present a public sector increasing in volume relative to falling population.

Second, we explore donation behavior when the recipient's work does not yield income or affect the dictator's endowment, but the recipient's work performance is made known to the dictator. Experimental results indicate that donating behavior is affected not only by the dictator working, but also by the recipient working.

The focus is on the impacts on China's energy system and GDP growth, and on global climate indicators such as greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, and global temperature change. We employ the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) framework and its economic component, the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. We demonstrate that China's commitments for 2020, made during the UN climate meetings in Copenhagen and Cancun, are reachable at very modest cost. Alternative actions by China in the next 10 years do not yield any substantial changes in GHG concentrations or temperature due to inertia in the climate system. Consideration of the longer-term climate implications of the Copenhagen-type of commitments requires an assumption about policies after 2020, and the effects differ drastically depending on the case. Meeting a 2 degrees C target is problematic unless radical GHG emission reductions are assumed in the short-term. Participation or non-participation of China in global climate architecture can lead by 2100 to a 200-280 ppm difference in atmospheric GHG concentration, which can result in a 1.1 degrees C to 1.3 degrees C change by the end of the century. We conclude that it is essential to engage China in GHG emissions mitigation policies, and alternative actions lead to substantial differences in climate, energy, and economic outcomes. Potential channels for engaging China can be air pollution control and involvement in sectoral trading with established emissions trading systems in developed countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We show how to aggregate plant-level data to this quantity and how to decompose APG into technical efficiency and reallocation components. This requires us to confront the non-neoclassical features that impact plant-level data, including plant-level heterogeneity, the entry and exit of goods, adjustment costs, fixed and sunk costs, and market power. The APG decomposition includes one term per plant related to technical efficiency and one term for each input at each plant that is a function of the value of marginal product - input price gap and that relates the reallocation of inputs to growth. We compare APG to several competing variants of productivity growth that are based only on plant-level technical efficiency. Two simple theoretical examples illustrate that technical-efficiency reallocation can be negatively correlated with actual APG reallocation because technical efficiency is a production concept and need not have any relation with the APG reallocation gaps. We illustrate this point empirically using panel data from manufacturing industries in Chile, where we show technical-efficiency reallocation differs substantially from measured reallocation based on our definition of APG.","[Petrin, Amil; Levinsohn, James] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Levinsohn, James] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University,,petrine@umn.edu; james.levinsohn@yale.edu,,,,,,,51,100,122,3,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

The approach gives form to the covariance matrix in random coefficient models. The factors act directly on the random coefficients as unobserved attributes. The structural equations allow the factors to act on each other building structures that can represent a variety of concepts such as global heterogeneity and segmentation. The practical outcomes include parsimonious and identified models with rich covariances and better fit. Of greater interest is the ability to specify models that represent and test theory on the relationships between the taste heterogeneities for covariates and in particular between the attributes within a discrete choice experiment. The paper describes the general model and then applies it to a discrete choice experiment with seven attributes. Four competing specifications are evaluated, which demonstrates the ability of the model to be identified and parsimonious. The four specifications also demonstrate how competing a priori knowledge of the structure of the attributes used in the experiment can be empirically tested and evaluated. The outcomes include new behavioral insights and knowledge about choice and choice processes for the subject area of discrete choice experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Hardship indicators are increasingly influential, so the source of this age gradient has considerable policy implications. We propose a theoretical and empirical strategy to decompose the sources of this relationship. We exploit a unique feature of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA) survey, which collects reports of hardship from all adult household members. This facilitates within-couple estimates, allowing us to identify age-related reporting bias. The majority of the raw agehardship gradient is explained by observed resources, particularly wealth and home ownership. One third of the relationship is explained by unobserved differences between households, which we interpret as age-related behavioral choices.

Our estimation results from cross-country regressions for the period 1996-2008 indicate that: (i) there is a positive relationship between market size and FDI inflows; (ii) openness to trade has a positive impact on FDI flows; (iii) higher financial development has negative effect on FDI inflows; (iv) the prevalence of the rule of law increases FDI inflows; (v) higher FDI goes where foreign aid also goes; (vi) agglomeration has a strong positive impact on FDI inflows; (vi) natural resource endowment and exploitation (such as oil) attracts huge FDI; (vii) East and Southern African sub-regions appear positively disposed to obtain higher levels of inward FDI.

Our results show that managerial diseconomies of scale, which arise when contractors integrate more activities, and the different types of complexity, affect the relative advantages of hierarchical governance. In a novel result, we also show that interactions between the number of integrated activities and the types of complexity affect the relative merits of hierarchical governance to handle an activity, meaning that complexity and the extent of a project's integration are systematically intertwined in the explanation of boundary choices. Our findings indicate a need for research on interdependencies between different boundary choices and suggest that the evaluation of these interdependencies should consider the complexity of activities.

We solve the profit maximization problem when demands are linear and parallel as a function of the cost of separating markets.

We propose a Sender's signaling strategy which does not depend on either the game payoffs or the initial probability distribution. The Receiver's strategy partitions the set of possible sequences into subsets, with a single action assignment to each of them. The Sender's signaling strategy is a Nash equilibrium, i.e. when the Receiver responds best to the Sender's strategy, the Sender has no incentive to deviate. An example shows that a tie-breaking decoding is crucial for the block-coding strategy to be an equilibrium. Efficiency is analyzed by comparing how close ex-ante expected payoffs are to those of noiseless communication. Moreover, we study how long communication should be to achieve a given payoff-approximation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

(TEPCO), on the stock prices of the other electric power utilities in Japan. Because the other utilities were not directly damaged by the Fukushima nuclear accident, their stock price responses should reflect the change in investor perceptions on risk and return associated with nuclear power generation. Our first finding is that the stock prices of utilities that own nuclear power plants declined more sharply after the accident than did the stock prices of other electric power utilities. In contrast, investors did not seem to care about the risk that may arise from the use of the same type of nuclear power reactors as those at the Fukushima Daiichi station. We also observe an increase of both systematic and total risks in the post-Fukushima period, indicating that negative market reactions are not merely caused by one-time losses but by structural changes in society and regulation that could increase the costs of operating a nuclear power plant.

We propose the concept of the R&D content of intermediates, which represents the knowledge stock embodied in the intermediate inputs used in production. Using a sample of 32 countries and 13 manufacturing industries we compute the elasticity of industry-level TFP with respect to the R&D content of intermediates. We find that among high-R&D industries, the R&D embodied in inputs purchased from the own industry is significantly associated with industry-level TFP. In this case, both own-industry domestic inputs as well as those imported from the G5 countries are relevant. In contrast, intermediate input trade does not appear to be a significant channel of R&D diffusion among low-R&D industries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Ricardian and Hotelling rents, and policies that would correct externalities such as Pigovian taxes or a cap and trade system set to achieve emissions reductions consistent with cost benefit assessment. Partial equilibrium concepts have been extended to general equilibrium models, including their realization in relatively detailed empirical models that faithfully adhere to theoretical concepts of neoclassical economics. With such models we are then able to see how resource depletion and environmental degradation are affecting the economy, and how efforts to reduce the impact of these environmental and resource constraints could improve economic growth and performance. The foundation for traditional computable general equilibrium models are the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs), input-output (I-O) tables, and expanded Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs). The basis for extending these to include environmental and resource assets and goods are so called Integrated Economic and Environmental Social Accounts (IEESAs). While environmental effects are often considered to be non-market, many of the impacts of environment are often reflected in market accounts through damages that might include, for example, less labor (due to environment related health problems), reduced productivity of agroecosystems, or damage to infrastructure and other produced assets. The challenge is to make the environmental connection explicit so as to provide a guide to where changes in policies could provide benefit. However, some damages do not enter the accounts at all, and mainly this is because household labor and leisure time are generally not valued in traditional accounts. Hence the cost of illness in terms of reduced ability to contribute to household activities would be missed in the standard accounts. While the theoretical structure for expanding the accounts has been laid out in various reviews, the empirical challenge of doing so is substantial. Careful attention to expanding NIPA accounts, making it a regular part of government statistical agencies' efforts would improve the foundation for analysis of potential green growth policies and measures.

In response, the Federal Reserve partnered with other central banks to inject dollars into the international financial system. Empirical studies of the success of these efforts have yielded mixed results, in part because their timing is likely to be endogenous. In this paper, we examine the cross-sectional impact of these interventions. Theory consistent with dollar appreciation in the crisis suggests that their impact should be greater for countries that have greater exposure to the United States through trade and financial channels, less transparent holdings of dollar assets, and greater illiquidity difficulties. We examine these predictions for observed cross-sectional changes in CDS spreads, using a new proxy for innovations in perceived changes in sovereign risk based upon Google-search data. We find robust evidence that auctions of dollar assets by foreign central banks disproportionately benefited countries that were more exposed to the United States through either trade linkages or asset exposure. We obtain weaker results for differences in asset transparency or illiquidity. However, several of the important announcements concerning the international swap programs disproportionately benefited countries exhibiting greater asset opaqueness.

We show that the probability that real housing prices stop falling is higher the smaller was the pre-slump house price run-up; the greater has been the cumulative house price decline, the faster is GDP growth, and, most importantly, the lower are mortgage interest rates. Slumps are longer where the construction sector is more responsive, allowing booms to create larger supply overhangs, but shorter the more developed are financial markets and institutions, enabling new buyers to access credit and enter the market. Falling house prices can lead to lower private sector credit flows, in turn limiting the scope for new home purchases and creating the danger of a vicious spiral of slumping housing prices and distressed financial institutions. This suggests that policymakers should take steps to break the link between the housing market problems and banking problems by intervening to recapitalize distressed banking systems while using quantitative easing and credit easing to lower mortgage interest rates and help revive the housing market directly.

Financial experts (n = 156) and laypeople (n = 153) with low versus high confidence in the economic recovery spontaneously associated thoughts and beliefs about the crisis and to economic and political stakeholders. Following a mixed-methods approach, they evaluated economic stakeholders with regard to six trust items. The study was conducted in March 2010 in Austria, which was moderately affected by the crisis. The results indicate that economic variables (e.g., unemployment) were central to the social representations of the crisis, while underlying feelings of unfairness and egoism surfaced during the ongoing process of association. The social representation did not comprise a general criticism of the economic system. The differences between the subgroups depended on identification-based self-protection and economic knowledge. Experts and laypeople tended to attribute the economic crisis to specific stakeholders in a self-protecting way: experts blamed the media, laypeople blamed the managers, and both blamed the politicians. Interestingly, the subgroups tended to evaluate the banks as being relatively neutral. Expertise and differentiated economic knowledge was related to confidence in the economic recovery. Thus, the perceived capability of politicians in terms of competence and morality seems crucial for regaining public confidence in the economy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Stigma explanations, however, cannot account for the large increase in the use of unsecured credit during this period. I explain the simultaneous increase in bankruptcy rates and unsecured credit as the result of improvements in credit-rating technologies. Using an environment where borrowers face heterogeneous default costs (unobservable by creditors), I show that such improvements will lead to agents with high default costs, i.e., safe borrowers, being able to borrow more. A quantitative example illustrates that this increased access to credit can be large enough to raise both equilibrium borrowing and default rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The halt in the growth in inequality in the lower half of the wage distribution (as measured by the 50:10 percentile ratio) since the mid-1990s, in contrast to the continued inequality growth in the upper half of the distribution, suggests the possibility of a minimum wage effect and spillover effects on wages above the minimum. This paper analyses individual wage changes, using both a difference-in-differences estimator and a specification involving comparisons across minimum wage upratings, and concludes that there have not been minimum wage spillovers. Since the UK minimum wage has always been below the 10(th) percentile, this lack of spillovers implies that minimum wage changes have not had an effect on the 50:10 percentile ratio measure of inequality in the lower half of the wage distribution.","Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Stewart, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",mark.stewart@warwick.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F029969/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F029969/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,24,27,29,1,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We employ quarterly data covering the period from 1990:1 to 2008:1. Empirical findings suggest that there is a unique long-term equilibrium relationship between natural gas prices, industrial production and stock prices in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany and Luxembourg. However, no relationship is found between these variables in the other ten EU-15 countries. Although we detect a significant long-run relationship between stock prices and natural gas prices, Granger causality test results imply an indirect Granger causal relationship between these two variables. In addition, we investigate the Granger causal relationship between stock returns, industrial production growth and natural gas price increase for Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany and Luxembourg. As a result, increase in natural gas prices seem to impact industrial production growth at the first place. In turn, industrial production growth appears to affect stock returns.

Two polar market structures are considered for the energy market: free entry and natural monopoly. First, it is shown that investment subsidies may induce a larger equilibrium investment into cleaner technologies either under free entry or natural monopoly. However, in the latter case, this happens if and only if the average cost is decreasing fast enough.

In the presence of market frictions, better protection makes investors more willing to take on entrepreneurial risk when lending to firms, thereby improving the degree of risk sharing between financiers and entrepreneurs. On the other hand, by increasing risk sharing, investor protection also induces more risk taking. By increasing entrepreneurial risk taking, it raises income dispersion. By reducing the risk faced by entrepreneurs, it reduces income volatility. As a result, the relationship between investor protection and income inequality is non monotonic, since the risk-taking effect dominates at low levels of investor protection, while risk sharing becomes stronger when more risk is taken.

On disentangling the influence of policy in observed outcomes,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Naming and shaming; Benchmarking; Panel data model; School dropout,HIGH-SCHOOL DROPOUTS; POPULATION-GROWTH; UNITED-STATES; EDUCATION; IMPACT; WORK,"Naming and shaming is a frequently applied incentive by supra-national organizations. Although common practice, a mere comparison between the outcome variable is meaningless. The observed outcome variable consists of two parts: (1) a part which is due to the general economic climate and where the policy maker does not have an influence on; (2) a 'net' part which is the direct result of policy interventions. This paper suggests a regression model to estimate the net policy outcome. The proposed linear panel data model accounts for short and long term economic influences, as well as time and country fixed effects. This yields an indication on the effect attributed to policy making. It is applied to early school leaving outcomes, which increasingly attract attention since recent policy actions stipulated in, e.g., the Lisbon Agenda or the No Child Left Behind Act. Despite Portugals' best performance in the traditional naming and shaming model, once controlled for non direct policy influences, the results indicate that Luxembourg and the Netherlands can be named, while Portugal and Spain should be shamed.

I consider the joint choice of quality and export promotion costs when trade relationships are subject to temporary disputes. When transparency is low and macroeconomic instability is high, disputes arrive more frequently and, therefore, firms may inefficiently choose lower levels of quality and export promotion. These, in turn, build shallower trading relationships with less trade volumes and higher tariffs, and generate greater trade reductions during the more common trade disputes. Several institutional features of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism that are generally lacking in preferential trade agreements such as improved transparency, dispute investigation, and the provision to recommend asymmetric continuation payoffs can ameliorate these inefficient quality choice outcomes. Hence, lower quality output and lower quality trading relationships may be more endemic to countries that depend on preferential trading areas as opposed to the WTO. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The dairy sector is emerging in China. There are many fundamental questions about how farmers make dairy marketing decisions in China at the farm gate level that are unanswered. This makes the dairy sector in China a good place to study farmers in emerging marketing chains. Based on three sets of unique data collected in the mid-2000s in Greater Beijing, the analyses show that small farmers were the major producers of milk. There is no evidence that small farmers are being excluded from emerging marketing channels. One of the differences of China's dairy sector in the mid-2000s is that its marketing chain itself had many different types of agents that procure milk - and few of them were large; most were individual entrepreneurs. The high level of the competiveness may be the reason that individual agents do not have monopoly power and why small farmers can operate in the system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A key distinction is made between long-standing controls that cover a broad range of assets (walls) and episodic controls that tend to be imposed on a narrower set of assets (gates). The paper presents a new data set that differentiates between controls on inflows and on outflows as well as among asset categories for 44 developed and emerging market economies over 1995-2010. The imposition of episodic controls is found not to have followed the prescriptions of theories that suggest first imposing controls on those inflows most likely to contribute to financial vulnerability. Estimates show significant differences in the partial correlations of long-standing and episodic controls with the growth of certain financial variables and with GDP growth, but these differences seem to arise because countries with long-standing controls are poorer on average than the other countries in the sample. With a few exceptions, estimates that control for GDP per capita find little evidence that capital controls affect the growth of these financial variables, the real exchange rate, or GDP growth at an annual frequency. These preliminary results raise doubts about assumptions behind recent calls for a greater use of episodic controls.","Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Klein, MW (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",,,,,,,,43,59,72,0,15,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Our results contradict previous studies that have argued that poverty has shown little improvement over time or that antipoverty efforts have been ineffective. We find that moving from traditional income-based measures of poverty to a consumption-based measure and, crucially, adjusting for bias in price indexes lead to the conclusion that the poverty rate declined by 26.4 percentage points between 1960 and 2010, 8.5 percentage points of which has occurred since 1980. Our consumption-based measure suggests considerably greater improvement than the income-based measures for single-parent families and the elderly, but relatively less for married-parent families. Changes in tax policy explain a substantial part of the decline in poverty; Social Security has also been important, but other transfer programs have played a small role. Changes in education have also contributed, but other demographic trends have had little impact. Measurement error in income likely explains some of the most noticeable differences between changes in income poverty and in consumption poverty, but saving and dissaving appear to play a modest role for most demographic groups.","[Meyer, Bruce D.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sullivan, James X.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Chicago; University of Notre Dame,"Meyer, BD (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,79,29,33,0,27,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The observed gender wage gap is relatively high in these two countries, compared to Hungary and Poland. A relatively small but positive part of the observed gender wage gap can be explained by gender differences in characteristics in the Czech and Slovak Republics, with a high contribution of job characteristics.

In order to distinguish between aggregate and sectoral shocks, we construct independent VAR models for identifying each shock separately: a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) for aggregate shocks and a sectoral SVAR for sectoral shocks. Our aggregate model in particular extends the conventional small-scale VAR to the FAVAR framework of Bernanke et al. (2005) so that it can address the potential bias from omitted variables. The main findings are as follows: most industries exhibit negative employment responses to an aggregate technology shock while exhibiting positive responses to a sectoral technology shock. By comparing our FAVAR framework with Chang and Hong's (2006) small-scale VAR, we show that applying the FAVAR results in significant differences in the estimated responses to an aggregate technology shock. Real rigidities (such as slow diffusion of new technology or frictional labor reallocation), rather than nominal rigidities (such as sticky prices), are crucial in accounting for the cross-industry difference in employment responses. In particular, the slow diffusion of new technology is closely related to the sluggish response of sectoral employment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This study draws its sample from the population of Centrelink income-support recipients, targeting persons identified in the administrative data as having recent experience of homelessness, as well as others with similar characteristics who may be vulnerable to housing difficulties in the future.

We show that the effect of retirement on various well-being measures available in the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) are compatible with this prediction: the overall effect on life satisfaction is negligible, while satisfaction with the free time increases and satisfaction with household income decreases. The life cycle model also predicts that involuntary retirement is likely to have adverse effects because individuals would actually prefer to work in order to consume more, but are prevented from doing so. We find that indeed, involuntary retirement results in an overall negative effect that can partly be explained by a bigger drop in income satisfaction and a smaller increase in satisfaction with the free time.

Although the Ottomans were quick to adopt advancements in military technology, they waited almost three centuries to sanction printing in Ottoman Turkish (in Arabic characters). Printing spread relatively rapidly throughout Europe following the invention of the printing press in 1450 despite resistance by interest groups and temporary restrictions in some countries. We explain differential reaction to technology through a political economy approach centered on the legitimizing relationships between rulers and their agents (e.g., military, religious, or secular authorities). The Ottomans regulated the printing press heavily to prevent the loss it would have caused to the ruler's net revenue by undermining the legitimacy provided by religious authorities. On the other hand, the legitimizing relationship between European religious and political authorities was undermined over a century prior to the invention of the press. European rulers thus had little reason to stop the spread of printing as public policy, nor could the Church have stopped it had it wanted to. The Ottomans eventually sanctioned printing in Arabic script in the 18th century after alternative sources of legitimacy emerged. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (3) (2012) 357-371.

This study is based on a new database of nearly 600 Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian firms. I show that tax evasion is a major factor of the engagement of firms in administrative corruption. The latter increases with the share of sales hidden by the firm as long as it is below half of total sales, and slightly decreases thereafter. State capture is fostered by a failing enforcement of property and contract rights. Interestingly, less competitive firms appear to engage more in both forms of corruption than the most dynamic ones. After assessing the robustness of my empirical results, I draw a comparison of the factors of corruption in North Africa, Uganda and transition countries.","[Delavallade, Clara] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Delavallade, Clara] SALDRU, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Delavallade, Clara] Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France",University of Cape Town; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Delavallade, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",clara.delavallade@ensae.org,,,,,,,32,10,11,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

However, absent anchored fiscal expectations, the advantages from anchoring monetary expectations are smaller the larger is the average level of indebtedness.

Following the literature of the economics of crime a la Becker (Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach, 1968) and Enrlich (Participation in Illegitimate Activities: A Theoretical and Empirical Investigation, 1973) and using a System GMM approach for the time span 1985-2003, the authors empirically test whether total crime in Italy is affected by the presence of tourists. Findings confirm the initial intuition of a positive relationship between tourism and crime in destinations. When using the level rather than the rate of total crime and controlling for the equivalent tourists (i.e. the number of tourists per day in a given destination) the effect of the tourist variable is confirmed.

We show that, by affecting the technological-knowledge bias, subsidies explain the simultaneous rise in the exports sector, the skill wage premium and the economic growth rate. Then, to shed light upon the causal nexus between production-related subsidies and exports, we use a Portuguese longitudinal database (1996-2003) and implement a propensity score matching approach. Empirical results seem to prove the theoretical predictions: subsidies generate the rise in the wage premium of exporters and the increase in the relative size of export sector, even if no impact of subsidies is found in the capacity of transforming domestic firms into new exporters.

Current projects to develop large dams for hydropower in Chilean Patagonia impose an environmental price by damaging the natural environment. On the other hand, the increased use of fossil fuels entails an environmental price in terms of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. This paper studies the debate on future electricity supply in Chile by investigating the preferences of households for a variety of different sources of electricity generation such as fossil fuels, large hydropower in Chilean Patagonia and other renewable energy sources. Using Double Bounded Dichotomous Choice Contingent Valuation, a novel advanced disclosure method and internal consistency test are used to elicit the willingness to pay for less environmentally damaging sources. Policy results suggest a strong preference for renewable energy sources with higher environmental prices imposed by consumers on electricity generated from fossil fuels than from large dams in Chilean Patagonia. Policy results further suggest the possibility of introducing incentives for renewable energy developments that would be supported by consumers through green tariffs or environmental premiums. Methodological findings suggest that advanced disclosure learning overcomes the problem of internal inconsistency in SB-DB estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This is neither an exceptional situation in which some stock price soars too high to be priced, nor the one where some stock price plummets too much to be traded. By introducing the concept of Knightian uncertainty, Dow and Werlang (1992) account for the existence of portfolio inertia, which has not been accounted for under the concept of risk. This paper provides a characterization of the spread between buying and selling prices based on a parameter proposed by Ozaki and Streufert (1999, 2001) that enables us to estimate the attitude towards Knightian uncertainty, and shows that an increase (a decrease) in Knightian uncertainty expands (shrinks) the interval in which an investor never changes her initial position.

The first level specifies the triggering conditions for novelty creating activities for the agents, i.e. firms. Here the behavioral elements and the modes of actions for the firms are portrayed using an agent-based approach (Section 2). On the second level, the consequences of successful innovations and imitations in a given sector of economic activities are dealt with (Section 3). This depends on the frequency of successful novelties and on the way they diffuse in that sector. We use an agent-related functional approach, applying difference equations for depicting the stylized facts of the diffusion dynamics. Only if these different levels of economic dynamics are distinguished as well as related to each other, is it possible to derive aggregate effects of novelties for the whole economy. This will be done by way of computer simulations (Section 4).

The theoretical considerations are exemplified in a comparative study of two patenting fields-information technology and semiconductors. It turns out that information technology shows the highest increases in patents, but only a moderate move towards the center of the knowledge base. By contrast, semiconductors develops towards a key technology, despite a moderate increase in the number of patents.

The result is that since the early 1990s the relative productivity levels between the two regions have continuously diverged, leading to a transatlantic productivity gap. Much of the explanation for this is the strong performance of the US in the so-called new economy or knowledge economy and in particular the underinvestment in R&D, and as a result, productivity and innovation has been at the forefront in the European Policy agenda.

Investment in the assets of the poor will play an essential role for formulating pro-poor growth policies. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential impact of FDI on the poor in Pakistan over the period 1985-2011. The regression model encompassing the impact of FDI on poverty reflects that if there is one percent increase in FDI is likely to reduce poverty by 0.47% at urban, 0.44% at rural and 0.46% at national levels respectively. The result concludes that although, there is a positive impact of FDI on poverty, this positive impact is not sufficient enough to conclude that investment is pro-poor in Pakistan, because, an intensity of income inequality is more than the FDI's poverty reduction at rural, urban and national levels. Pakistan's investment, poverty and inequality statistics were studied for the first time in terms of pro-poor growth scenario. Pro-poor investment index (PPII) and poverty equivalent investment rate (PEIR) reveal that investment is pro-poor in Pakistan from 1985-1986 to 2002-2005, however, the subsequent years from 2005 to 2011 demonstrated pro-rich investment scenario in Pakistan. If the investment still remains anti-poor in the subsequent years as reflected in the years 2005 to 2011, there is a likelihood that investment may not trickle down to the poor but instead to the non-poor in Pakistan. Thus checking vulnerability would offer wide option for the policy makers to settle the issue of the severity of poverty in the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the experiment, all individuals in a group decide whether to make a costly effort, which produces a random (independent) outcome for each one of them. The group members then vote on whether to redistribute the resulting and commonly known total sum of earnings equally amongst themselves. This game has two equilibria, if played once. In one of them, all players make effort and there is little redistribution. In the other one, there is no effort and nothing to redistribute. A solution to the repeated game allows for redistribution and high effort, sustained by the threat to revert to the worst of these equilibria. Our results show that redistribution with high effort is not sustainable. The main reason for the absence of redistribution is that rich agents do not act differently depending on whether the poor have worked hard or not. The equilibrium in which redistribution may be sustained by the threat of punishing the poor if they do not exert effort is not observed in the experiment. Thus, the explanation of the behavior of the subjects lies in Hobbes, not in Rousseau.","[Cabrales, Antonio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Cabrales, Antonio; Mora, Jose V.

However, almost all the existing studies on the subject rely on individual-level data. In this paper, we study the gender patterns of SOE labor retrenchment using a unique enterprise-level dataset for the period from 1995 to 2001. We find that disproportionately large share of discharge was borne by female workers and that female discharge rates were more sensitive to output growth than male discharge rates. Further, estimating dynamic labor demand equations by gender, we find that female employment was more sensitive to negative output shocks experienced by enterprises than male employment but less sensitive to positive output shocks. Further, we find that sensitivity of female employment to output was greater for reformed than non-reformed enterprises and for male-intensive than female-intensive sectors. These results provide new insights into the gender patterns of employment adjustment of Chinese SOEs to output shocks during the retrenchment period. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We find that this is merely due to the fact that flexworkers receive less employer-funded training, a gap they can only partly compensate for by their own training investments. Flexworkers particularly participate less in firm-specific training that is meant to keep up with new skill demands than workers with permanent contracts. However, for those who participate in employer-funded firm-specific training, a temporary contract appears to facilitate the transition to a permanent contract with the same employer. However, this does not hold for participation in self-paid training.

We also show that there is a special class of equilibria in which there exists a unique, globally stable steady state. In both types of equilibria, one country unilaterally reduces its tariff from the static Nash equilibrium, the other country reciprocates in response to the first country's implicit promise to lower its tariff even further, and this process continues forever, converging to a steady state with tariffs lower than the static Nash tariffs.

Hence, this may generate distortions. We analytically identify a set of neutral tax rates (a tax regime) that preserve the post-tax investment threshold if taxes change, and determine normal and paradoxical settings for investments. Unlike other tax paradoxes neither depreciation rules nor loss offset restrictions cause these paradoxical reactions. Taxes affect each project individually, depending on the project risks involved.

The statistical methods used included ANCOVA, multiple regression analysis and chi-square tests. The factors explaining the innovation levels were provided. Innovation and corporate culture indices were created and found to be correlated. Four variables were shown to explain innovation management in the six countries: corporate culture, formal processes/innovation department, company size and review of products. The respective SME perceptions, key factors and levels of innovation management were thus differentiated for the six countries.

By using panel data on Korean manufacturing firms between 1999 and 2008, we find that R&D investment is sensitive to fluctuations in internal cash flow and that debt is more important than equity in financing R&D expenditure. This empirical result supports the traditional theory of financing hierarchy. In relation to equity ownership, the empirical result shows that ownership concentration and foreign ownership positively affect R&D investment, but institutional ownership does not show any significant effect on investment.

Individual first period voting behavior may become less conservative under supermajority rules, and it is even possible that a project is implemented in the first period under a supermajority rule that would not be implemented under simple majority rule. We characterize the optimal majority rule, which is a supermajority rule.

The accumulated impulse response functions of the structural VAR indicate that although profit share sustains capital accumulation, a high debt ratio restrains it. In other words, the income distribution-capital accumulation pattern of the Japanese economy over the past 20 years has been a profit-led one, and the debt-capital accumulation pattern over the same period has been a debt-burdened one.","Hannan Univ, Fac Econ, Matsubara, Osaka, Japan",,"Nishi, H (通讯作者)，Hannan Univ, Fac Econ, Matsubara, Osaka, Japan.",,,,,,,,27,17,19,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Second, the structural panel vector autoregression (VAR) model is constructed to analyze macroeconomic consequences of real and financial integration such as cross-country output and consumption relation. The results suggest that (i) the degree of real integration significantly increased after the crisis, both regionally and globally; (iii) quantity and price measures showed an increased financial integration after the crisis, but the consumption relation did not; (iv) the degree of regional financial integration is smaller than that of global financial integration, based on the consumption relation; and (v) financial integration lags real integration, especially for regional integration.","[Kim, Soyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Lee, Jong-Wha] Korea Univ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Korea University,"Kim, S (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",soyoungkim@snu.ac.kr; jongwha@korea.ac.kr,"Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016","Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961; Kim, Soyoung/0000-0003-3612-1691",,,,,27,36,37,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Currently, auctions are becoming an important tool to deal with this duty. In this context, the rules that the auctioneer establishes are particularly relevant, as the final outcome depends on them. When auctioning many related items, such as spectrum licenses, the bidders' values for one item may depend on the number of items already obtained (complements and substitutes items). In such circumstances, combinatorial auctions are the most appropriate alternative for allocating lots. This paper analyzes the implications of selecting a particular pricing mechanism on the final result in a combinatorial sealed-bid auction. The following pricing rules are selected: the first-price mechanism, the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, and the bidder-Pareto-optimal (BPO) core mechanism, a core-selecting auction. To test these pricing rules, a simulator of the auction model has been developed. Then, to tackle the complex problem of simulating bidders' behavior, a co-evolutionary system has been designed to identify improved strategies. The results revealed that the first-price mechanism yields inefficient outcomes and a notable reduction in the seller's revenues. Both the VCG and BPO mechanisms yield outcomes that are closer to the efficient allocation, and differences in revenues are affected by the presence of asymmetries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

I find that production techniques differ substantially across countries and factors, but differ much less across industries within a country. Davis and Weinstein (2001) argue that modeling cross-industry differences (multiple-cone specialization) improves the fit of the Vanek prediction: however, their test statistics are unchanged when one restricts techniques to be identical across industries within a country. Thus, the bulk of world factor content of trade does not arise from specialization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, the sensitivity to the number of constraints (level of dis-aggregation) and imposition of returns to scale constraints is evaluated. Further, the shadow or dual values are recovered from the linear program and compared to the market prices used in the ideal Fisher index approach. Empirical application to U. S. state-level time series data from 1960-2004 reveal productivity change decreases with increases in the number of constraints. Divergence in productivity measures is observed due to the choice of method imposed, various levels of commodity/input aggregation, and technology assumptions. Due to the piecewise linear approximation of the nonparametric programming approach, the shadow share-weights are skewed leading to the difference in the productivity measures due to aggregation.","[Shaik, Saleem] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Mishra, Ashok K.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Agctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Atwood, Joseph] Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Shaik, S (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, 504 Richard Barry Hall, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",Saleem.Shaik@ndsu.edu; amishra@lsu.edu; jatwood@montana.edu,"Mishra, Ashok K./J-7228-2019; Shaik, Saleem/F-6771-2012; Shaik, Saleem/HSH-3760-2023","Mishra, Ashok K./0000-0002-0988-1428; Shaik, Saleem/0000-0001-6177-2520",,,,,16,3,3,1,10,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,,,J APPL ECON,J.

Conflicts with industry over the timing of disclosure and the choice of topics are common. Moreover, collaborations with industry may require academics to negotiate formal contracts about the ownership of intellectual property. To help understand the factors that might mitigate these conflicts, this paper examines how the professional and collaborative experiences of academics shape their perceptions of the barriers to industry collaboration. Using a rich dataset of UK academics, we find that perceived barriers to collaboration are lower for academics with industrial and collaborative experience and for those who trust their industry partners. However, for the transactional costs of industry engagement, we find entrepreneurial experience and the diversity of methods used to collaborate with industry increases the perceived barriers to collaboration.","[Tartari, Valentina; Salter, Ammon] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, London SW7 2AZ, England; [D'Este, Pablo] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC UPV, Valencia, Spain",Imperial College London; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC),"Tartari, V (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England.",v.tartari@imperial.ac.uk,"Tartari, Valentina/B-2599-2012; Tartari, Valentina/ABB-4882-2021; Salter, Ammon/A-9217-2010","Tartari, Valentina/0000-0001-7332-8590; Salter, Ammon/0000-0003-2065-1268; D'Este, Pablo/0000-0002-4040-8209",ESRC [ES/G042993/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G042993/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,65,76,87,0,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The choice-theoretic framework captures a decision-maker's attitude towards vagueness by his optimism. The new trade-off is between incentive provision and exploitation of heterogeneity that arises endogenously because of the vague environment. Consequently, the optimal contract may distort effort in order to relax incentive compatibility and fully exploit the endogenously created heterogeneity, even when the agent is risk neutral and there is no insurance need in the relationship.

It studies a general equilibrium model where students attend university to earn higher incomes in the labour market, and universities teach them and carry out research. Each university chooses its tuition fee to maximise the amount of resources it can devote to research. Research bestows an externality on society. Government intervention needs to balance labour market efficiency considerations - which would tend to equalise the number of students attending each university - with considerations of efficiency on the production side, which suggest that the most productive universities should teach more students and carry out more research. We find that government concentrates research more that the private market would, but less than it would like to do if it had perfect information about the productivity of universities. It also allows fewer universities than would operate in a private system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical evidence supports several explanations for the shrinking size premium. First, there has been a convergence in the returns to worker characteristics at large and small firms over time. Second, small and large firms are hiring more workers with similar characteristics. Particularly important are the declining share of workers at large manufacturing firms and the rising share of workers at large retail firms.

For any parametric quantal response function arising from a unimodal distribution of exchangeable payoff disturbances, we find that a mis-specified homogeneous rationality parameter will have downward bias.

Our empirical analysis exploits German register data on highly attached displaced workers. We apply duration models to analyze gender differences in job search taking into account observed and unobserved worker heterogeneity and censoring. Simple survival functions show that displaced women take longer to find a new job than comparable men. Disaggregation by age groups reveals that these differences are driven by differential behavior of women in their prime-childbearing years. There is no significant difference in job search duration among the very young and older workers. These differential outcomes remain even after we control for differences in human capital and when unobserved heterogeneity is incorporated into the model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The second notion points to the limits to what the economy can attain at a given moment in time; within this framework, scarcity depends not only on technology but also on the possibility of (persistent) underutilization of resources. Thus, while within the marginalist framework scarcity is an original datum for analysis, within the Classical-Keynesian-Sraffian framework it is an endogenous variable, jointly determined by a partly endogenous technology (via dynamic increasing returns to scale) and by the social, political and economic factors which determine the degree of utilization of available resources.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Stat, I-00100 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Roncaglia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Stat, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00100 Rome, Italy.",alessandro.roncaglia@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Organizations, on the other hand, have well-defined memberships and create explicit information transmission and enforcement mechanisms. Inmates cannot rely on norms for governance when the inmate population is large, increasingly crowded, and when fewer inmates arrive with a prior prison commitment. When norms fail, inmates create organizations to protect themselves and provide governance. Once these groups have the power to deter predators, they prey on others.

The economy faces an increase in the relative price of the high-skill intensive sector. Using decision rules for choosing high-skill, middle-skill and low-skill education, it is shown that such a terms-of-trade shock can lead to polarization: shrinkage of middle-skill jobs, combined with higher shares of high-skill as well as low-skill workers in the total workforce. The effects of off-shoring on wages and job composition are also studied. Off-shoring of low-skill and high-skill tasks, not middle-skill tasks, is shown to contribute towards polarization in job composition.","Indian Stat Inst Delhi Ctr, Planning Unit, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi,"Das, SP (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst Delhi Ctr, Planning Unit, 7 S J S Sansanwal Marg, New Delhi 110016, India.",das@isid.ac.in,,,,,,,28,0,0,2,16,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 13,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,20126.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-6,0.0,,,45,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,928BG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302954000001,0

To explore this question, I examine the determinants of the Arab world's democratic deficit in 2010. I find that the percentage of a country's landmass that was conquered by Arab armies following the death of the prophet Muhammad statistically accounts for this deficit. Using history as a guide, I hypothesize that this pattern reflects the long-run influence of control structures developed under Islamic empires in the premodern era and find that the available evidence is consistent with this interpretation. I also investigate the determinants of the recent uprisings. Taken in unison, the results cast doubt on claims that the Arab-Israeli conflict or Arab culture or Muslim theology is a systematic obstacle to democratic change in the region and point instead to the legacy of the region's historical institutional framework.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Chaney, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,67,47,50,0,24,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We argue that the current evidence of these effects, while important in terms of scholarly debates, does not readily lend itself to policy evaluation. The reasons for this are two-fold. First, the existing evidence on nonlinearities is relatively difficult to integrate into a common coherent view. Different models of nonlinearity appear in different papers: these models are often nonnested and do not present a clear alternative to linear growth models. Second, we argue that the econometric evidence of nonlinearities is often developed in ways that do not allow one to examine explicitly the effects of alternative policies on growth. We describe some recent econometric methods that can address these problems. To illustrate the utility of these methods we then study the current debate on the efficacy of aid on growth in developing countries. We find that none of our methods suggests that aid should be given to countries with better policy quality. In fact, when considering robust policies, our results strongly reject the conclusion that aid should be allocated in higher amounts to countries where the policy quality is high.

Specifically, the symmetry in macroeconomic disturbances of the East Asian economies is examined as satisfying one of the preconditions for forming an Optimum Currency Area (OCA). We extend the existing literature by improving the methodology of assessing the symmetry shocks in evaluating the suitability of a common currency area in the East Asian economies employing the Bayesian State-Space Based approach. We consider a model of an economy in which the output is influenced by global, regional and country-specific shocks. The importance of a common regional shock would provide a case for a regional common currency. This model allows us to examine regional and country-specific cycles simultaneously with the world business cycle. The importance of the shocks decomposition is that studying a subset of countries can lead one to believe that observed co-movement is particular to that subset of countries when it in fact is common to a much larger group of countries. In addition, the understanding of the sources of international economic fluctuations is important for making policy decisions. The falling share of country specific factor and the rising role of region factor indicate that East Asia has become increasingly favorable for a monetary union. However, the share of country-specific factor that is still significant implies that it could be costly to renounce individual currencies to advance into a monetary union in East Asia.

It shows that the dynamics of the interest rate consistent with price stability requires a response to stock-price changes that depends on the shock driving them: a supply shock (e.g. productivity) does not require an additional, dedicated response relative to the standard Representative-Agent framework, while a demand shock does. Moreover, we show that implementing the flexible-price allocation by means of an interest-rate rule that reacts to deviations of the stock-price level from the flexible-price equilibrium incurs risks of endogenous instability that are the higher the less profitable on average equity shares. On the other hand, reacting to the stock-price growth rate is risk-free from the perspective of equilibrium determinacy, and can be beneficial from an overall real stability perspective.

Initially in the 16th century, with the Ottoman conquest of the area, institutions in Palestine involved de facto private user-rights. The level of expropriation by elites was low, and this enabled the people to develop the lands that they had acquired the right to cultivate. In the 17th and 18th centuries, with the exception of the Galilee in the middle of the 18th century, institutions became extractive due to tax farming, rapacious governors and Bedouin raids. From the middle of the 19th century until 1948, there was a second reversal back to private property institutions, first slowly until the First World War, and then more rapidly under the British Mandate after the First World War.

Relative to existing models of this type, our model incorporates two important features. First, we consider a two-country monetary union structure, which makes it well suited to simulate fiscal measures by relatively large countries in a currency area. Second, we provide a notable degree of disaggregation on the government expenditures side, by explicitly distinguishing between (productivity-enhancing) public investment, public purchases and the public sector wage bill. In addition, we consider a labor market characterized by search and matching frictions, which allows to analyze the response of equilibrium unemployment to fiscal measures. In order to illustrate some of its applications, and motivated by recent policy debate in the Euro Area, we calibrate the model to Spain and the rest of the area and simulate a number of fiscal consolidation scenarios. We find that, in terms of output and employment losses, fiscal consolidation is the least damaging when achieved by reducing the public sector wage bill, whereas it is most damaging when carried out by cutting public investment.

This paper develops a theoretical model of differentiated goods with endogenous quality to investigate the impact of digitization on the distribution of firms. It finds that supply-side factors can generate superstars and long tail outcomes, and that coexistence of both phenomena can be explained by either a fall in fixed costs for basic products or a decline in market size.

Effective tax and subsidy rates (ETRs and ESRs) on human capital investment via post-secondary education are estimated for Canada in the years 2000 and 2006. The flattening of the federal personal income tax structure in 2001 substantially reduced the tax disincentive for investment in human capital. Effective subsidy rates also declined as public spending did not keep pace with rising tuition fees. The change on the tax side was strong enough to dominate the subsidy reduction according to our main results, but disaggregation shows that this result did not hold in all cases.

We explore whether the comparatively low labor productivity in East Germany after reunification is caused by the depreciation of human capital at reunification, or by unfavorable job characteristics. East German workers should have been hit harder by reunification the more specific human capital was. Treating both human capital and job characteristics as unobservables, we derive their relative importance in explaining the low labor productivity by estimating a spatial structural model that predicts commuting behavior across the former East-West border and the resulting regional unemployment rates. The identification of the model is based on the slope of the unemployment rate across the former border. The results indicate that East and West German skills are very similar, while job characteristics differ significantly between East and West in the sample period 1998-2004. Hence, they suggest that a significant part of the human capital accumulated in the East before 1990 was transferable. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (1) (2012) 1-21.

Contrary to intuition, this result even holds in a situation where parallel trade freedom implies the closure of the smaller market.

In a high-level equilibrium, the quality of utility services is high, consumer willingness to pay for services is high, the utility is well funded and staff well paid in order to induce high quality of performance. In a low-level equilibrium the opposite is the case. Which alternative occurs depends on both the quality of utility management, and public perceptions about service quality. If a utility administration has the potential to offer high-quality service, and the public is aware of this, high-quality equilibrium also requires the public's service payments to be high enough to fund the needed pay incentives for the utility staff. When the public lacks knowledge about the utility administration's quality, the public's initial beliefs about the utility administration's quality will also influence their willingness to pay sufficiently for a high-quality equilibrium to be realized. This paper shows that, with low confidence, only a low-level equilibrium may exist: while with higher initial confidence, a high-level equilibrium becomes possible. Intermediate (in between the low- and high-level) outcomes can also occur, in early periods, with high-level outcomes later on. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There is a consensus among economically advanced countries, that exiting from the crisis and having again a healthy economic growth can be achieved by stimulating investments in infrastructure, but especially by developing human capital through education, research and innovation. High level of education increases chances to adapt to labour market and it contributes to increasing the quality of life. On the other hand, education is dependent on population's living conditions. The relationship between education and socioeconomic development level confirms that the development of a country is closely related to the level of education. This paper presents the general context of labour and youth employment problem at the labour market in Romania. It shows the situation of inserting youth into the labour market in terms of the current economic climate, of training of youth, of improved inclusion through education, by linking educational programs with labour market requirements.

Some in the public circles of these countries argue that immigration fueled this rise. Each year, Canada admits about 225 000 immigrants, but information on the effect of immigration on house prices in this country is lacking. Our extensive econometric analysis based on panel data at census division levels obtained from the 1996, 2001 and 2006 population censuses indicates a statistically significant but small effect of immigration on prices of privately owned dwellings in Canada. An out migration of the native born from the areas where new immigrants settle, or an increased supply of housing due to expectations of higher demand in those areas may have caused this result.","[Akbari, Ather H.; Aydede, Yigit] St Marys Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Akbari, AH (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",ather.akbari@smu.ca,,,,,,,23,42,47,3,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our results show that, first, responsibility attribution can be effectively shifted and, second, this can constitute a strong motive for the delegation of a decision right.

We propose that the magnitude of the response to a given result depends on the importance of the game, which is measured in two ways. First, we consider the extent to which the clubs are close rivals vying for similar league positions, as winning such games is particularly significant. Second, we argue that each individual game becomes more important for those clubs likely to be promoted or relegated as the season draws to a close, since a given match will have increasing information content concerning the final league position of the club. Using a fairly large panel comprising data for 19 clubs, we find some support for the notion that stock prices are affected more by the results of important matches than matches of lesser importance. We also observe that the difference between the number of points the club secures from a given match, and the number it was expected to secure, affects its stock price, as does the number of goals that the club under question scores in the match, relative to its competitor.","[Bell, Adrian R.; Brooks, Chris; Matthews, David; Sutcliffe, Charles] Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, Reading RG6 6BA, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Brooks, C (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, POB 242, Reading RG6 6BA, Berks, England.",c.brooks@icmacentre.rdg.ac.uk,"Brooks, Chris/ABF-4040-2021; Brooks, Chris/C-9033-2016","Brooks, Chris/0000-0002-2668-1153; Bell, Adrian/0000-0003-4531-0072; Sutcliffe, Charles/0000-0003-0187-487X",,,,,56,35,44,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Model of compensations presents financial and non-financial rewards linked to efforts and performances of employees and executives. Since this activity is understood as very important due to two main reasons, that compensations are motivation factor for employees and operational costs are for the company, there is a demand of making rewarding process highly effective and efficient for reaching employees and shareholders satisfaction. Besides this, many frauds, risks and problems related to amounts of executive compensations in the past initiate the need of appropriate management and control of this process. One possible way of reaching the effectiveness and efficiency of compensation process in terms of appropriate governance, risk management and control is the internal audit. Internal audit can be defined as method of independent and objective validation that increases the value and improves the operation and performance of organization and also facilitates the effects of related processes to achieve organization's goals and objectives. The main objective of this paper was to explore the reasons for, the processes involved in and risks of internal audit in HRM area of compensation and benefits. In the paper a desk research method has been used. First, the authors made a review of literature available on internal audit, with significant analysis of internal audit standards. In continuation, the rewarding process and compensations and benefits structure has been analyzed according to the practices of organizations systems and literature of HRM. After theoretical analysis, the authors integrated appropriate aspects and steps of internal audit in compensation process, where they emphasized the role of internal audit in compensation and benefit structures and amount of compensation's expenditures (related to the executive compensations). Findings of this paper are that the main reason for implementing internal audit through planned system of steps (gathering information, evaluation, analysis and action planning) and approaches (mainly by surveys) is to obtain information that would be helpful for the organization as a whole in terms of improvement of business processes related to compensation and benefit. Also, internal audit of compensation and benefit package can minimize risks that are linked to HR compensation process (employment market risk, reputation risk, compliance risk, external partnership risk, operation risk, financial reporting risk, etc.) where reputation risk is one of the most common reasons for performing internal audit. Areas where internal audit can be done are human resources strategic management, workforce planning and selection; training and development; compensation and benefit system; employee and labor relations; human resources information systems, etc. As the most important areas of HR compensation internal audit there are emphasized overall plan design, cash and stock-based compensation, deferred compensation and pension and retirement contributions. The paper presented one theoretical research made to point out the role of internal audit in HR compensation process. Previous researches related to this topic usually were made to analyze the relation between internal audit and several or even all HR functions. Authors tried to develop a comprehensive model for internal audit of compensations and benefits. Also, the paper described both, internal audit and rewarding processes which were integrated in function of better management in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.","[Berber, Nemanja; Vugdelija, Vesna Kocic] Higher Sch Profess Business Studies, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Pasula, Milan] PepsiCo, Beograd 11070, Serbia; Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Ikonov, Dejan] Petr Ind Serbia, NIS Gazprom Neft, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",PepsiCo; University of Novi Sad; Gazprom; Gazprom Neft,"Berber, N (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Profess Business Studies, Vladimira Perica Valtera 4, Novi Sad, Serbia.",berber_nemanja@yahoo.com; milan.pasula@gmail.com; radosevic@uns.ac.rs; dejan.ikonov@gmail.com; vesna.kocic-vugdelija@teachers.org,"Berber, Nemanja/JFS-1642-2023; Berber, Nemanja/C-8235-2018","Berber, Nemanja/0000-0002-1433-6416",,,,,45,13,14,6,60,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Our experimental design allows us to estimate treatment effects on two margins of choice separately: the decision to enter the market at all (the extensive margin) and the choices among alternatives offered (the intensive margin). The key result of this study is to show that a cheap talk script appears to affect both margins in ways distinctly different than when choices involve actual payments. Specifically, participants in hypothetical choice experiments including cheap talk are more inclined to enter the market but are also more price-sensitive as compared to when payments are real. Interestingly, the average influence of cheap talk on market participation and price-sensitiveness could result in total willingness to pay (WTP) estimates that are similar to real payment treatments since the two effects identified act in opposite directions when computing WTP. However, they may do so by inducing behavior that is distinctly different than those of consumers facing real choices. Our results highlight that future reliance on cheap talk as a bias mitigation tool requires extensive testing for empirical regularities to gain any confidence that the tool can be effective, and under what circumstances.","[Bosworth, Ryan] Utah State Univ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Taylor, Laura O.] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; North Carolina State University,"Bosworth, R (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ryan.bosworth@usu.edu; laura_taylor@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,36,23,25,1,29,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Consider an industry consisting of a vertically integrated firm, the incumbent, and an independent retailer, the entrant, which requires access to the services of the incumbent's wholesaler. The wholesaler can discriminate against either of the retailers by supplying it an input of lower quality than its rival. We show that, in our setting, vertical separation of the incumbent reduces discrimination against the entrant's retailer, although it does not guarantee non-discrimination. Furthermore, with vertical separation, the wholesaler may discriminate against the incumbent's retailer. Vertical separation impacts social welfare through two effects. First, through the double-marginalization effect, which is negative. Second, through the quality degradation effect, which can be positive or negative. Hence, the net welfare impact of vertical separation is negative or potentially ambiguous.","[Brito, Duarte] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, CEFAGE UE, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Brito, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, CEFAGE UE, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal.",dmb@fct.unl.pt; pedro.br.pereira@gmail.com; joao.vareda@concorrencia.pt,"Brito, Duarte/B-9620-2009; Pereira, Pedro/GNN-0031-2022","Brito, Duarte/0000-0003-2971-9572; Pereira, Pedro/0000-0002-9036-0354; Vareda, Joao/0000-0001-8803-0447",,,,,24,3,3,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Previous studies using data from non-recessionary periods have found that part of this increase was caused by a 1994 redesign in the way the Current Population Survey measures unemployment duration. This paper uses data from recessionary and non-recessionary periods to determine how the size of the redesign's effect on the distribution of unemployment duration changes over the business cycle. I find that, for most measures of unemployment duration, the redesign effect is relatively constant across business cycle conditions, but the redesign effect on median unemployment duration tends to shrink during recessionary periods. This suggests a constant adjustment factor will adequately correct for the CPS redesign for most variables I consider, but for median duration the use of a constant adjustment factor will lead to underestimating the true median duration during high unemployment periods such as the Great Recession.","Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Busch, ME (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",buschmi4@msu.edu,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

As a consequence, spending cuts have started to affect a large number of decisions that directly or indirectly may be expected to have an impact on health. These effects are likely to be unevenly distributed among different groups within the population. Therefore, not just health levels but also its distribution may be at risk with the financial consequences of the crisis. The main message of this paper is to show first social concern on the nature of the trade-offs in redefining expenditure priorities. On the prescriptive side of our work we argue that in the present situation we should not focus so much on health expenditure as we should do on the social protection system as a whole. In addition, to fight against poverty (and not so much focusing on income inequality in itself) should be the most important consideration for health policy design. Thus, more selective, tailored made combination of integrated policies should be addressed. Fragile groups need to be prioritized at this stage in battling for poverty alleviation (poverty induces health losses) and for a sound job creation economy (workfare strategies require health at the same time that they produce health). Universal old-style welfare policies commonly lack focus, are not financially sustainable, and overall, they have lower redistributive impacts. Otherwise, random, not well understood, effects in welfare may result from these policies due to side effects from economic crisis, unemployment and changes in life style. Results may also depend on the type of groups benefiting from sustained social spending in practice. A welfare function is required in order to compare losers and winners. This is a part of the second welfare theorem where non superior Pareto agreements are achievable, and lack of consensus may easily emerge, in designing health strategies since politics may not build the necessary consensus for policies.","[Casasnovas, Guillem Lopez I.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Bori, Marina Soley] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Pompeu Fabra University; Boston University,"Casasnovas, GLI (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem/A-9342-2013","Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem/0000-0001-8020-9987",,,,,50,0,0,0,28,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2012,,201,,,,,113,132,,,,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,980QZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306909400005,0

An individual's probability of survival is assumed to be dependent on past levels of consumption. Endogenous probability of survival implies that the rate of time preference (or degree of patience) of an individual is endogenously determined. We solve the dynamic optimization problem facing an agent and provide a complete characterization of the steady states and their stability properties. We find that with endogenous rate of time preference an economy may have multiple steady state equilibria. The equilibrium an economy converges to depends on its initial conditions. The results are interpreted in light of the growth experiences of developing economies. The model can explain why two economies that have identical production technologies and identical preferences may converge to different levels of income depending on initial conditions. We estimate the relationship between adult probability of survival and lagged consumption for a cross section of countries. Our estimation results and subsequent simulations of the model suggest that if we interpret capital in our model broadly to include both physical and human capital, poverty traps are empirically plausible.","Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Chakrabarty, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",debajy-oti.chakrabarty@sydney.edu.au,,"Chakrabarty, Debajyoti/0000-0003-0637-644X",,,,,25,3,4,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

In contrast to the existing studies, we do not impose any break points a priori. We use recently developed techniques for sample splitting in the data on US cigarette demand, and find that using a time index as a transition variable can cluster cigarette demand into four distinct regimes. In the past four decades a myopic-to-rational switch in cigarette consumption behaviour was observed in response to various anti-smoking information events. In particular, we find strong evidence in support of the rational addiction model in the 1980s and 1990s. Moreover, in line with the theoretical prediction, our estimate of the long-run elasticity is twice as large as the short-run elasticity. Our empirical framework should improve policy makers' understanding of the dynamics of cigarette consumption in response to various anti-smoking campaigns, and stress the role of sound policy making in improving smoking control measures.","[Chen, Yi-Chi] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Lin, Chang-Ching] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chen, YC (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",yichi@ncku.edu.tw,,"Lin, Chang-Ching/0000-0001-8471-7583; Chen, Yi-Chi/0000-0001-8130-2382",,,,,41,3,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Organisation activities appeal to voluntary work. Presented services are more qualitative because they are fulfilled by dedicated volunteers; they are more efficient, because volunteers are not paid. Sometimes it happens not to know how to initiate the process of organisation development: not every member is involved into the process of voluntary organisation even if he has very good ideas; work is distributed inefficiently etc. Then many members become disappointed in such activity and do not believe that they can change or improve something in their lives. A closed circle forms: there are people who wish to work for the good of community but poor work motivation and misjudgement of initiatives disappoint people, and social activity sort of dies or is performed by two or three the most active members. Therefore such activity becomes more on paper than practical. It is very important that as much people as possible would understand the input and importance of their work and could act the country wellbeing and their welfare. Efficient motivation of volunteers work is necessary on purpose to achieve these goals. Behaviour of every person is determined by motives that are inner forces stimulating performance of certain actions. Motives are regulated by human needs realizing possibility and degree of their satisfaction. Human behaviour is pointless if motives and aims of the behaviour were incomprehensible. People motivation is pursuit to satisfy essential needs and to acquire something what is missing. People actualizing themselves do not have unsatisfied fundamental needs but they have impulsions. They work, endeavour and have ambitions, although not in the common meaning. Motivations for such people mean character perfection and expression, maturation and growth, in other words actualization of themselves in voluntary activity. Attitudes towards motivation and motives, motivation means of work activation of volunteer organisation members (volunteers) are analyzed in the publication. Importance of volunteers' motives to continuity of voluntary work is highlighted; essential examples of voluntary work motives and motivation means are indicated.

The main findings are that the mineral sector has achieved a considerable influence over the economy of Southeastern Para, so that during the cycle of investments each 1% in the growth of the mineral production creates growth possibilities of about 0.83% for the agricultural sector and about 0.86% for the local urban sectors. Considering just the production growth, a percentile point will imply growth at, respectively, 0.73% and 0.76% for those sectors.

Model estimates provide interesting evidence that wage bargaining process is determined mainly by the power of the firms. These results support the view of flexible wage environment in both economies. On the other hand, the firms are confronted by the increasing vacancy posting costs that limit vacancies creation.

Monthly data covering the period 2000 M1 to 2010 M12 were collected from the Monthly Report on Tourism, which is published by the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan. The studied variables included the gross domestic product (GDP), the consumer price index (CPI), the exchange rate, and the hotel operating characteristics. Forecasting performance is assessed in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The superior performance of the VAR model implies that the inclusion of endogenous variables is required in forecasting international tourist hotel demand.

The first stage of the estimation model involves a Probit analysis of the water reuse decision and the second stage employs an endogenous switching regression to estimate the intake water demand equations. Results suggest that water charges may act as an effective mechanism in inducing firms to undertake water reuse investments and in reducing intake water demand.

We first compare investment behavior in the no tax baseline to a tax control setting, in which the income from investments is taxed. We find that investors significantly reduce their risk-taking as predicted by theory. Next we compare the baseline investment choices to choices under three different types of income taxation. We observe that risk-taking is significantly increased with partial and with capped loss deduction, but is unaffected by a tax system that allows no loss deduction. Since in all these treatments the after tax outcomes of the prospects were identical, we conjecture that investors have a positively biased perception of partial and capped loss deduction that promotes their willingness to take risks.

The results show a significant decrease in the size of the wage premium attributable to higher education during the last few years, particularily among technicians and clerks. This may be the result of an excessive supply of persons with college and university education in some segments of the Polish labour market.

We consider a bargaining procedure in which the seller makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to a buyer. An initial stage in which the buyer is permitted to convey information to the seller is introduced into this framework. The decision regarding what information will be conveyed is made before the buyer knows his exact valuation. We study the type of information the buyer would be willing to transmit to the seller. The analysis determines that buyers with low valuations, in effect, reveal their valuations whereas buyers with high valuations conceal them. Communication between buyer and seller before the bargaining process begins improves both the overall efficiency of the process as well as the welfare of both buyer and seller.","[Gayer, Gabrielle] Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Segev, Ella] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Bar Ilan University; Ben Gurion University,"Gayer, G (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel.",gabi.gayer@gmail.com; ellasgv@bgu.ac.il,,"Segev, Ella/0000-0003-4445-2562",,,,,25,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We find strong evidence for the learning-by-exporting hypothesis. We also find that exporting induces plants to introduce new products and rationalize their products beginning from one year prior to, and until two years after, export market entry. The synchronous responses of product churning and TFP suggest that new-product introduction and product rationalization are indeed one mechanism of the learning-by-exporting effect.

The approach provides a useful normative model of land allocation that obviates distributional assumptions and expected utility specifications, and one that selects an optimal allocation that weighs skewness and other higher order moments in addition to mean and variance. This is of particular interest because crop returns often exhibit skewness, which is not accounted for by traditional Mean-Variance (MV)-based approaches.

One issue, in particular, is the increasing interest in finding ways to bridge the gap between the stated choice response and real choosing, as a way of increasing the confidence with which an individual would hypothetically purchase or use an alternative that is actually chosen in the choice experiment. In this paper we investigate the relationship between the respondent's response to a certainty question, defined on a 1-10 scale of surety, and features of the choice experiment that may have a bearing on the degree of confidence that can be placed on the stated choice, controlling for exogenous effects such as socioeconomic characteristics and attitudes to vehicle emissions. The focus on response certainty in this paper is as an external validity test. We find, using a generalised ordered logit model, compelling evidence that the number of acceptable alternatives and hence associated levels of attributes, together with the contrast of attribute levels of each designed alternative relative to an experienced status quo (or reference) alternative, play an important role in establishing certainty of response in a real market. The evidence should be taken on board in the future design of more realistic choice experiments.","[Hensher, David A.; Rose, John M.; Beck, Matthew J.] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Hensher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",david.hensher@sydney.edu.au; john.rose@sydney.edu.au; matthe.beck@sydney.edu.au,"Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021","Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980; Beck, Matthew/0000-0003-1111-2852; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,,27,26,27,0,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

This determinant points out the need to leave vertical organization and functional-structured enterprise, and directs attention of its management to horizontal process-oriented organization. This paper formulates the roles that are supposed to support this organizational transformation. The transformation from functional departments to business processes is not exclusive in the sense that it does not necessarily mean elimination of functional aspects and functional structure of the organization. In the process of transformation towards process orientation, management chooses one form of a so-called horizontal or process organizational structure that favors a specific enterprise. Besides the purely functional orientation or the purely process orientation, in certain situations, when internal organization circumstances permit, it is possible to combine both approaches successfully.","[Krstic, Bojan; Jovanovic, Sonja] Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Nish, Serbia; [Kahrovic, Ernad] State Univ Novi Pazar, Dept Econ Sci, Novi Pazar, Serbia",University of Nis,"Krstic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Nish, Serbia.",,"Krstic, Bojan/V-1867-2019; Kahrovic, Ernad/AAQ-1035-2020","Krstic, Bojan/0000-0003-4597-6819; Kahrovic, Ernad/0000-0002-0892-4908; Jovanovic, Sonja/0000-0003-0937-9195",,,,,16,1,1,0,5,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

Needless to say, the key reasons for this are the low income levels in Tajikistan and the country's special relationship with Russia, which has been enjoying rapid economic growth. Yet while interest in the relationship between migration and foreign remittances has existed for a long time, not many studies have looked at this region. This article uses household survey forms from two points in time to profile households in Tajikistan and international labour migration by Tajiks, and examines the relationship between household income levels in Tajikistan, the poorest of the former Soviet republics, and foreign remittances received from international labour migrants and the likelihood of migrants being supplied. It finds no correlation between household income levels and amounts of money received from abroad, which suggests that altruistic models of the relationship between migration and remittances do not apply. Moreover, it also finds that households with high incomes are more likely to supply migrants, indicating that international labour migration from Tajikistan may not be pro-poor.","Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Kumo, K (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",kumo@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,"Kumo, Kazuhiro/G-7527-2016",,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23330089, 23243032] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,32,9,12,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24.0,1,,,,,87,109,,10.1080/14631377.2012.647630,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,918PH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302262100005,0

When export volume is decomposed into the extensive and intensive margins, panel regressions presented in this study reveal that exchange rate uncertainty negatively affects the extensive margin and positively affects the intensive margin, with both effects being statistically significant. These two opposing effects cancel each other out when combined, producing an insignificant effect on overall export volume. This study goes on to develop an analytically tractable monetary model of heterogeneous firms and endogenous extensive and intensive margins, which predicts these empirical results.","Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Lin, CY (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, 101,Sec 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",lincy@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,0,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Then, by converting the evaluation information of different experts in different granularity to the same granularity by two-semantics, the comprehensive evaluation values can be obtained by integrating information of different experts. Further, the objective weights of the evaluation indexes were determined by the entropy method and an evaluation method were proposed based on the VIKOR method.

Several unfortunate examples of this analytical error are presented including macroeconomic data analysis conducted by a representative figure in this field.

Both microdata regressions and grouping estimators unambiguously indicate that cohabiting women respond less to variation in male wages than married women. However, the magnitude of the difference is not sizeable. We also assess the magnitude of married men's and cohabiting men's own wage elasticities and find that they do not differ much. Combined with the fact that male earnings account for roughly two-thirds of family earnings, these two findings explain why the impact of changes in male wages on family earnings is very similar for married couples and cohabiting couples: in both cases, a 10% decline in male wages appears to induce roughly a 6% drop in family earnings.","[Morissette, Rene; Lu, Yuqian; Hou, Feng] STAT Canada, Social Anal Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada",Statistics Canada,"Morissette, R (通讯作者)，STAT Canada, Social Anal Div, 100 Tunneys Pasture Driveway, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada.",rene.morissette@statcan.gc.ca,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In 1970 a higher fraction of men than women completed a college education. During the following four decades, the gender gap in education not only decreased but became negative. However, this was not always so. The pre-1970 period (1950-1970) was characterized by an opposite trend: the gender gap strongly increased. This paper develops a model to quantify, within a unified framework, the relative importance of supply and demand forces on the rise and fall of the U. S. gender gap in education. Specifically, I build and calibrate an assignment model for the U. S. economy with endogenous human capital accumulation of women and men, where three different sources of education gains exist: (1) supply shifts, (2) a within-sector skill-biased technical change (SBTC), and (3) the creation of new high-skill services/sectors. I find that asymmetrical supply shifts by gender were the major force behind, first, the increase in the gender gap during the pre-1970 period and, second, the decrease in the gap during the post-1970 period. The empirical results show positive supply shifts for men but not for women during the pre-1970 period, and negative supply shifts for men together with no changes in supply for women during the post-1970 period. I discuss some explanations for the dissimilar behavior of women's and men's supply during both periods.","Finance Minist Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Parro, F (通讯作者)，Finance Minist Chile, Santiago, Chile.",fparro@hacienda.gov.cl,,,,,,,19,1,1,1,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Trade takes place in lotteries. Individuals face a standard budget constraint, while the incentive compatibility constraints are imposed on the production set of the intermediaries. This formalization encompasses moral hazard, as in Jerez (2003, 2005), and private information economies. Equilibrium allocations are constrained efficient, but, contrary to what stated for example in Jerez (2005), the set of equilibrium allocations may be empty and the Second Welfare Theorem may fail. This happens for two reasons. First, constrained efficient allocations may violate the necessary and sufficient conditions of price supportability for the individuals. Second, even when constrained efficient allocation are price supportable, they may fail to be a profit maximizing choice of the firm at the individual supporting prices. To restore existence of an equilibrium the firm has to be restricted to supply allocations with support in the set of incentive compatible contracts. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The results suggest that horizontal competition arising from local fragmentation minimize differences between direct and representative local government, providing support for wider applicability of median voter-based empirical models of local government behaviour in the US.","[Turnbull, Geoffrey K.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Finance, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Tasto, Michael T.] So New Hampshire Univ, Dept Econ, Manchester, NH USA; [Salvino, Robert] Coastal Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Myrtle Beach, SC USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Coastal Carolina University,"Turnbull, GK (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Dept Finance, POB 161400, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",gturnbull@bus.ucf.edu,,,,,,,16,2,6,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is argued that the drive for major cuts in public expenditure comes from seeking to achieve a balanced structural budget and reductions in estimated potential output.

In particular, the evaluation focuses on the inter-relationship between inflation and the output growth/gap in these emerging economies between the pre- and post-inflation-targeting periods. A bivariate GARCH (1,1) model is applied. The results reveal lower variability in inflation and output growth after the implementation of the inflation targeting regime. The persistency of inflation and output also decline. The study finds no evidence of greater disinflation cost experienced in these economies after the implementation of the inflation-targeting regime. Overall, the results imply that inflation targeting works well in these emerging markets.","[Sek, Siok Kun] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, George Town, Malaysia; [Har, Wai Mun] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Accountancy & Management, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR),"Sek, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, George Town, Malaysia.",sksek@usm.my; harwm@utar.edu.my,"sek, siok kun/A-9233-2011; Har, Wai Mun/HMP-0607-2023","Har, Wai Mun/0000-0002-2276-9799; SEK, SIOK KUN/0000-0002-3616-9815",,,,,25,6,6,0,12,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,5,,,,,599,608,,10.2298/PAN1205599S,0.0,,,10,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,068XA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313398300004,0

The hypothesis is that there are important synergies between telecommunications and remittances. Migrants with greater telecom access may have higher demand for remittances, because more frequent communication with relatives raises altruistic motivations for remitting. Migrants who remit more may also demand greater telecommunication service if they seek to monitor remittance recipients' expenditure patterns. Suggestive evidence of complementarities in telecommunication and remittance demand is found using a cross-sectional dataset of temporary migrants in Qatar from developing countries. This finding highlights an overlooked, yet potentially important role of telecommunication in stimulating greater remittances.","Edmund A Walsh Sch Foreign Serv Qatar, Doha, Qatar",,"Seshan, GK (通讯作者)，Edmund A Walsh Sch Foreign Serv Qatar, Doha, Qatar.",gks7@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Clean production and green products have become important issues to manufacturers as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has produced frameworks such as the ISO14001 series. These standards are intended to provide organizations with the elements of an effective environmental management system (EMS) that can be integrated with other management requirements and assist organizations achieve environmental and economic goals. Firms have adopted environmental management systems (EMS) due to mounting government and industry pressures, yet little data exists in terms of the implementation of and practices within EMS. This paper aims to improve understanding and generate empirical data on firm activities in environmental management practices. This research will examine the nature and levels of environmental management practices within the industrial coatings industry by surveying the primary supply chain within an emerging market context. This paper employs a quantitative cross-sectional survey approach to provide empirical data from a sample of firms which have implemented an EMS. The study is executed in an emerging market country allowing for international comparisons in similar contexts. For the purpose of this study the population comprised suppliers of industrial coatings raw materials and industrial coatings manufacturers operating within the broader chemicals sector in South Africa. This emerging market country context provides a unique environment with opportunities to expand theory. A diverse sample frame ensured heterogeneity in the final sample representing several value chain activities in this industry. The survey was administered electronically to key players in this industry, with a 64 per cent response rate, resulting in a final sample of 84 respondents. The study results confirm that larger organizations and/or multi-nationals that are involved in export markets are committed to higher levels of EMS practices. These companies are securing their long-term survival by ensuring that they meet global sustainability objectives. In addition, these mostly private companies are reassuring internal and external stakeholders with their commitment to environmental protection. Based on a descriptive statistical analysis it is encouraging to note that a significant number of companies in this study have shown commitment to advancing environmental sustainability and have implemented a structured EMS. This EMS formed part of their mission statements and management practices at the corporate, manufacturing and operations levels were implemented. The results also indicate that the majority of organizations surveyed have, to some extent, incorporated environmental management into the strategic process of the organization, which was done by employing environmental experts, ensuring that the environmental function was housed by a separate department and was incorporated into the strategic planning process of the organization. EMS reporting in annual financial reports is also an encouraging trend. This research has contributed to the evolving field of environmental management and has provided valuable insights as to the nature in which firms are practicing EMS. Since the majority of respondents in the present study are multi-national companies it may be beneficial to expand this research to other countries with different regulatory obligations, to be able to compare and contrast EMS practices.","[Urban, Boris; Govender, Deon P.] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, ZA-2196 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Urban, B (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, 2 St Davids Pl, ZA-2196 Johannesburg, South Africa.",boris.urban@wits.ac.za; dgovender@wits.ac.za,"urban, boris/Q-1768-2019","Urban, Boris/0000-0002-6212-0169",,,,,25,18,22,0,81,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Next to CO2 emissions, GRAM also includes different resource categories. Using GRAM, we are able to estimate the amount of carbon emissions embodied in international trade for each year between 1995 and 2005. These results include all origins and destinations of emissions, so that emissions can be allocated to countries consuming the products that embody these emissions. Net-CO2 imports of OECD countries increased by 80% between 1995 and 2005. These findings become particularly relevant, as the externalisation of environmental burden through international trade might be an effective strategy for industrialised countries to maintain high environmental quality within their own borders, while externalising the negative environmental consequences of their consumption processes to other parts of the world. This paper focuses on the methodological aspects and data requirements of the model, and shows results for selected countries and aggregated regions.","[Wiebe, Kirsten S.; Lutz, Christian] Gesell Wirtschaftliche Strukturforsch mbH, Osnabruck, Germany; [Wiebe, Kirsten S.] US Univ MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Bruckner, Martin; Giljum, Stefan] Sustainable Europe Res Inst, Vienna, Austria",Maastricht University,"Wiebe, KS (通讯作者)，Gesell Wirtschaftliche Strukturforsch mbH, Osnabruck, Germany.",wiebe@gws-os.com,"Giljum, Stefan/M-3162-2015; Wiebe, Kirsten Svenja/I-4498-2019; Bruckner, Martin/O-7443-2016; Lutz, Christian/AAA-3299-2022","Giljum, Stefan/0000-0002-4719-5867; Wiebe, Kirsten Svenja/0000-0003-3105-4194; Bruckner, Martin/0000-0002-1405-7951; Lutz, Christian/0000-0001-8849-8197",,,,,40,109,119,5,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

This paper assesses the major explanations for the surge of China's exports and trade surplus and tackles the issue of whether an appreciation of the RMB would help the US to reduce its trade deficits. After conducting simulation exercises on the multi-country macro-econometric Fair model, this paper offers some new explanations for the unexpected surge in China's trade surplus, namely a low overall price elasticity and a high domestic income elasticity for the tradable goods in both countries, and a consequential sluggish price pass-through process of the RMB appreciation on the US market. It thus questions the effectiveness of RMB appreciation as an instrument to restore the trade balance between China and the US.","Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Sch Business, Fac Business & Law, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Zhang, JXH (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Sch Business, Fac Business & Law, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",james.zhang@newcastle.edu.au,"Zhang, James X./AFN-7901-2022","Zhang, James X./0000-0002-6251-0474",,,,,51,8,8,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Although there have been many contributions documenting that downstream prices are more reactive to increases than to decreases in upstream prices, little is known about the forecasting performance of econometric models incorporating asymmetric price transmission from crude oil to gasoline. In this paper we fill this gap by comparing point, sign and probability forecasts from a variety of Asymmetric-ECM (A-ECM) and Threshold Autoregressive ECM (TAR-ECM) specifications against a standard ECM. Forecasts from A-ECM and TAR-ECM subsume the RFH, while the ECM implies symmetric price transmission from crude oil to gasoline. We quantify the forecast accuracy gains due to incorporating the RFH in predictive models for the prices of gasoline and diesel. We show that, as far as point forecasts are involved, the RFH does not lead to significant improvements, while it can be exploited to produce more accurate sign and probability forecasts. Finally, we highlight that the forecasting performance of the estimated models is time-varying. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical evidence on this relationship is rare so far and suffers from methodical weaknesses, such as the absence of time variability, which is crucial for addressing this issue. Using a synchronization index that is constructed on a year-by-year basis (1993-2011), we uncover a strong and robust empirical finding: the adoption of the euro has significantly increased the correlation of member countries' business cycles above and beyond the effect of higher trade integration. Thus, our results substantially strengthen the conclusion by Frankel and Rose (1998), i.e. a country is more likely to satisfy the criteria for entry into a currency union ex post rather than ex ante. Remarkably, however, this reasoning is even verified when controlling for the effect of increased trade linkages implied by entering a currency union. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In an experimental trust game we study whether and how trustor's behaviour is affected by social influence of other trustors' choices over time. We account for three important factors of trustors' preferences: risk attitude, generosity and expected trustworthiness. Our results confirm that trustor's behaviour is affected by peers. We find a general convergence in trusting behaviour: the effect of social influence is (for most of subjects) significantly reducing the amount sent by trustors in each period. Furthermore, analyzing contagion within the neighbourhoods, we find that agents tend to imitate similar types ((un)-generous or (un)trusting) when placed in the same neighbourhood. Indeed - in the few neighbourhoods with a prevalence of generous and risk-loving subjects - trust substantially increases over time. Nearness, without any strategic component, is a clear element of contagion in trustors' behaviour.

In a framework with one self-interested and one reciprocal player, gift-giving never arises in equilibrium. Instead, any equilibrium in a large class of multistage games must involve mutually unkind behavior of both players. Besides gift-exchange, this class of games also includes moral hazard models and the rotten kid framework. Even though equilibrium behavior may appear positively reciprocal in some of these games, the self-interested player never benefits from reciprocity. We discuss the relation of these results to the theoretical and empirical literature on gift-exchange in employment relations.","[Netzer, Nick; Schmutzler, Armin] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Netzer, N (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",nick.netzer@econ.uzh.ch; armin.schmutzler@econ.uzh.ch,,,,,,,61,7,9,1,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Accordingly, it is increasingly important for the independent E&P companies that are relatively vulnerable to market uncertainty to choose appropriate additional reserves of oil and gas. This paper provides a real options framework for analyzing the reserve replacement decisions of independent E&P companies, considering uncertain revenues and irreversible costs. The model considers the extraction cost per unit well associated with the remaining reserve level per well and instant production. Focusing on the North American E&P companies, threshold levels of oil and gas prices are identified for economic feasibility, above which it is optimal to undertake investment for reserve additions. The results indicate that the relative gains from gas E&P projects are steadily decreasing, primarily because of lowered gas prices triggered by recent gas development booms in the North America. The policy implications from this finding support a more conservative strategy and increased attempts in the field of gas development projects.","[Park, Eunchun] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Park, Hojeong] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136713, South Korea",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Korea University,"Park, H (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136713, South Korea.",eunchun@okstate.edu; hjeongpark@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,15,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

I use data for a wide cross-section of countries over the period 1970-2009 and find that although increasing manufacturing exports is important for sustained economic growth, this relationship only holds once a threshold level of development is reached. Specifically, I use an endogenous sample-splitting technique, known as regression tree analysis, to identify possible economic development thresholds in the relationship between the level of manufacturing exports and GDP per capita growth.

From the perspective of production cost, we build an agrifood quality-cost function and its elasticity estimation model and then empirically estimate this model in China's dairy industry. Analysis of survey data, estimation results of raw milk quality-cost elasticity and quantity-cost elasticity indicate that, in current factors market and under current policy environment, an economy of scale for raw milk quality does not exist and the economic incentive to improve raw milk quality is not enough. In contrast, raw milk quantity exhibits an economy of scale, and increasing the production scale is profitable. This provides a theoretical basis for explaining why improving raw milk quality is much more difficult than increasing quantity.

We study the random dynamical system describing prices and wealth dynamics and characterize local stability of the long-run equilibria in which one or a group of traders dominate. Multiplicity of stable and unstable equilibria, leading to path dependency and persistent heterogeneity, turns out to be a common phenomenon generated by two different mechanisms. Firstly, conditioning investment decisions on endogenous market variables implies that the relative performance of investment rules, in terms of average growth rates, may be different for different prevailing prices, so that the market may fail to select a global winner.

First, we find that the cost of debt is lower and the cost of equity is higher for family firms than non-family firms, but the differences are not significant. The WACC of family firms becomes higher than that for non-family firms and the difference is significant probably because family firms in Japan use less leverage. Next, we find that the stocks of family firms are traded with higher information asymmetry than non-family firms. As for information asymmetry and illiquidity measures, we utilize the variables Adjusted PIN and Probability of Symmetric Order Flow Shocks (PSOS). Concomitantly we also estimate alternate conventional measures of market liquidity as a robustness check. Overall, the evidence on liquidity is somewhat mixed, while we find family firms show higher information asymmetry, which may affect cost of equity. As a final policy implication, we recommend family firms in Japan conduct more voluntary and timely disclosure, in particular, for the benefit of general stock investors, and may want to increase leverage to reduce the WACC.

To that end, we model tax and public input competition within a differential game framework between two unequally sized countries. The model accounts for the widely recognized characteristic that small states are more flexible in their political decision-making than larger countries. However, we also acknowledge that small size is associated with limited institutional capacity in the provision of public services. The model shows that the long-term outcome of international competition crucially depends on the degree of capital mobility. In particular, we show that flexibility mitigates against - but does not eliminate - the likelihood of collapse in a small economy. Finally, we note that the beneficial effect of flexibility in a small state increases with its inefficiency in providing public services and with the degree of international openness.

A logit model with random individual effects is estimated using an unbalanced panel of 23,879 households surveyed over the period 2002-2011. An estimation in difference is performed to identify the impact of the policy. The tax credit is found to have had no significant effect during the first two years, suggesting a latency period related to inertia in households' investment decisions, possibly due to the complexity of the tax credit scheme. The tax credit had an increasing, significant positive effect from 2007 to 2010, before slightly decreasing in 2011. This is in line with changes in the tax credit rates, suggesting a correlation with the level of subsidy. Defined as the situation in which the subsidized household would have invested even in the absence of the subsidy, free-ridership progressively decreased over the period, was lower for insulation of opaque surfaces (roofs, walls, etc.) than for insulation of windows and depended on individual characteristics. The estimated average proportion of free-riders varies between 40% and 85% after 2006. In addition, we assess the potential bias caused by time-varying unobservable variables and conclude that our estimates of the impacts of the policy are conservative. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Sustaining modern services exports (MSEs), which in India enjoy comparative advantage, is important for sustaining service-led growth and maintaining stability on the external sector. In this context, we examine key drivers of India's surge in MSEs which have important implications for policy. The results reveal that endowment factors such as human capital, tele-density, financial development, physical infrastructure and institutions are the key drivers of India's MSEs along with the world demand, exchange rate and foreign direct investment. Therefore, India needs to focus on and speed up the ongoing reforms to improve supply side factors such as education, infrastructure, financial sector deepening, governance and broad-band tele-density to improve competitiveness of India's modern services exports.

The approach takes account of the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day. Using data available for 2007 through 2009, with a focus on carbon dioxide (CO2), we find substantial variation among locations and times of day. Marginal emission rates are more than three times as large in the upper Midwest compared to the western United States, and within regions, rates for some hours of the day are more than twice those for others. We apply our results to an evaluation of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The CO2 emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car in the western United States and Texas. In the upper Midwest, however, charging during the recommended hours at night implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. Underlying many of our results is a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals: the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. In addition to PEVs, we show how our estimates are useful for evaluating the heterogeneous effects of other policies and initiatives, such as distributed solar and real-time pricing.

We suggest graph theory to structure a network of variables that depict vulnerability and resilience from a sustainable development perspective. Vulnerability is defined as the propensity to incur adverse shocks whereas resilience is the capacity to cope with their negative effects. We identify two control dimensions of vulnerability-resilience (economic and political) and three contingency factors (the social, environmental and the peripheral dimensions). The specificity of the control dimensions is rooted in their impact on all other sides of the pentagon. We propose an algorithm to select the key variables useful in building a composite index that conforms to the structure of these five dimensions while preventing loss of information.

But there has been an explosion of poor mega-cities over the last 30 years. A simple urban model illustrates that in closed economies, agricultural prosperity leads to more urbanization, but that in an open economy, urbanization increases with agricultural desperation. The challenge of developing world mega-cities is that poverty and weak governance reduce the ability to address the negative externalities that come with density. This paper models the connection between urban size and institutional failure, and shows that urban anonymity causes institutions to break down. For large cities with weak governments, draconian policies may be the only way to curb negative externalities, suggesting a painful trade-off between dictatorship and disorder. A simple model suggests that private provision of infrastructure to reduce negative externalities is less costly when city populations are low or institutions are strong, but that public provision can cost less in bigger cities.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Glaeser, EL (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eglaeser@harvard.edu,,,,,,,26,92,106,2,77,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The aim of this paper is to use the method proposed in Konya (2006) to carry out a causality test among M&A activities, economic growth and stock prices, because the causal relationships that may be uncovered by this would be meaningful for both policymakers and stockholders. This paper uses quarterly data from six OECD countries for the period from April 1980 to March 2010. The bootstrap panel Granger causality test that this work applies also considers cross-sectional dependency and slope heterogeneity simultaneously. The findings of the paper are as follows. There is significant one-way causality from stock prices to M&A activities, and thus changes in stock prices lead M&A activities. With real GDP as the control variable, for all the countries surveyed, except Australia, stock prices lead M&A activities. As for the impact that economic growth has on M&A activities, we conclude that, when using stock prices as the control variable, there is almost no lead-lag relationship between economic growth and M&A activities, except for in Japan.

However, the financial and insurance sectors are found to be relatively unaffected. Mining industry profits and nominal output substantially increase in response to commodity price shocks. Construction output is also found to increase significantly, especially in response to a bulk commodity shock, as a result of increased demand for resource related construction. Increased demand for construction has a positive spillover effect to the parts of the manufacturing industry that supply the construction sector with intermediate inputs, such as the non-metallic mineral sub-industry. In contrast, other manufacturing sub-industries with only tenuous links to the resources sector such as textiles, clothing and other manufacturing, are relatively unresponsive to commodity price shocks.

French natives are less happy than other Europeans, whether they live in France or outside.

The labour income tax and the allocation of tax revenue between social security and forward intergenerational public goods are determined in a bidimensional majoritarian voting game played by successive generations. The political equilibrium is characterized by an ends-against-the-middle equilibrium where low-income and high-income individuals form a coalition in favour of a lower tax rate and less social security while middle-income individuals favour a higher tax rate and greater social security. Government spending then shifts from social security to public goods provision if higher wage inequality is associated with a borrowing constraint and a high elasticity of marginal utility of youth consumption.,"[Arawatari, Ryo] Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ono, Tetsuo] Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan",Nagoya University; Osaka University,"Arawatari, R (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",,"Arawatari, Ryo/HKO-6865-2023","Arawatari, Ryo/0000-0001-6875-881X; Ono, Tetsuo/0000-0002-9838-828X",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23730189] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,26,1,1,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

Then, in the political arena, delegates build on these proposals, but also consider values and interests. The present paper attempts to revise such an understanding of local economic development (LED) and argues that many of the deficiencies deriving from such a view can be remedied by deliberative participation, which is not merely a theoretical necessity, but also a practical possibility. With regard to the issue of public participation and deliberation, the paper identifies two main approaches in the LED literature: the political and the apolitical, of which the latter is mainly characterised by economic theorising. We take a closer look at the apolitical approach and demonstrate that in fact it is very much political. Therefore, we call for the transgression of the borderline between politics and expertise in LED, and suggest a joint democratisation of these interrelated terrains. We argue that deliberative participation is able to contribute to the quality of both the expert proposals and the working of the politics.","[Bajmocy, Zoltan; Gebert, Judit] Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Bajmócy, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Szeged, Hungary.",bajmocyz@eco.u-szeged.hu; gebert.judit@eco.u-szeged.hu,,"Bajmocy, Zoltan/0000-0002-4462-0469",,,,,65,8,9,0,12,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Starting out with the bootstrapping technique, several data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimates were generated, allowing the use of confidence intervals and bias correction in central estimates to test for significant differences in efficiency levels and input-decreasing/output-increasing potentials. Previous studies have focused on the measurement and explanation of the factors affecting the performance rather than the prediction. The use of neural networks combined with DEA results as part of an attempt to produce a model for insurance companies' performance with effective predictive ability is investigated. The findings indicate that older insurance companies with Portuguese origin tend to be more efficient. Results also suggest that opportunities for accommodating future demand appear to be scarce.","[Barros, Carlos Pestana] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Econ Gestao, Lisbon, Portugal; [Dumbo, Silvestre] Univ Gregorio Semedo, Rio De Janeiro, Angola; [Wanke, Peter] Fed Univ Rio Janeiro, COPPEAD Grad Business Sch, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Barros, Carlos Pestana] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Econ & Gestao, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Dumbo, Silvestre] Univ Gregorio Semedo, Luanda, Angola; [Wanke, Peter] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPEAD Grad Business Sch, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Barros, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Econ & Gestao, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal.",cbarros@iseg.ULisboa.pt,"Wanke, Peter/G-3184-2010","Wanke, Peter/0000-0003-1395-8907",,,,,62,17,18,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Increasing longevity generally leads to declining home ownership rates among young people, with bigger declines if the government increases taxes and pensions rather than relying on additional private provision of retirement income. The model suggests raising tax rates to provide pensions can reduce the welfare of all agents, even those who are net beneficiaries, because they tighten credit constraints on young people.","[Coleman, Andrew] Univ Otago, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Coleman, Andrew] New Zealand Treasury, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Coleman, A (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand.",andrew.coleman@otago.ac.nz,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

We survey efforts to use behavioral economics to improve some of the underpinnings of the New Keynesian model specifically, consumption, the formation of expectations and determination of wages and employment that underlie aggregate supply, and the possibility of multiple equilibria and asset price bubbles.

These models are said to exhibit procyclical news shocks. We find that all models that exhibit procyclical news shocks in our paper have two commonalities. There are mechanisms to ensure that: (I) consumption does not crowd out investment, or vice versa; (II) the benefit of forgoing leisure in response to news shocks outweighs the cost. Among the models we consider, we believe, one model holds the greatest potential for explaining procyclical news shocks. Its critical assumption is that news of the future technology also illuminates the nature of this technology. This illumination in turn permits economic actors to invest in capital that is forward-compatible, i.e. adapted to the new technology. On the technical side, our paper reintroduces the Laplace transform as a tool for studying dynamic economies analytically. Using Laplace transforms we are able to study and prove results about the full dynamics of the model in response to news shocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Dependence risk analysis and portfolio optimization,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy stocks; C-vines; D-vines Dependence structure; Risk measures; Portfolio optimization,VINE COPULAS; MANAGEMENT; ENERGY,"This article models the dependence risk and resource allocation characteristics of two 20-stock coal-uranium and oil-gas sector portfolios from the Australian market in the context of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. The modeling framework implemented consists of pair vine copulas and, linear and nonlinear portfolio optimization methods with respect to five risk measures. The paper's objectives are to find out if the oil and gas stocks are riskier than the coal and uranium stocks, to identify the optimization method and risk measure that produce the best risk-return trade-off, to recognize the stocks in which the optimal weight allocations converge on average, and to acknowledge the vine copula model that best accounts for the overall dependence of the energy portfolios. The research findings indicate that the oil stocks have higher dependence risk than the coal, uranium and gas stocks in financial crisis periods. The higher risk of the oil stocks is confirmed by the larger concentration of symmetric and asymmetric dependence they have in the negative tail. The canonical vine (c-vine) copula model is observed to better capture the overall dependence of the energy portfolios. The combination of a pair c-vine copula and nonlinear portfolio optimization produces the highest return relative to risk. The optimal weight allocations converge on average in some stocks.

The small modular reactor (SMR) is viewed as a possible solution to the problems of energy security as well as climate change. In this paper, we use an integrated assessment model (IAM) to investigate the evolution of a global energy portfolio with SMRs under a stringent climate policy. Technology selection in the model is based on costs; we use results from previous expert elicitation studies of SMR costs. We find that the costs of achieving a 2 C target are lower with SMRs than without. The costs are higher when large reactors do not compete for market share compared to a world in which they can compete freely. When both SMRs and large reactors compete for market share, reduction in mitigation cost is achieved only under advanced assumptions about SMR technology costs and future cost improvements. While the availability of SMRs could lower mitigation costs by a moderate amount, actual realization of these benefits would depend on the rapid up-scaling of SMRs in the near term. Such rapid deployment could be limited by several social, institutional and behavioral obstacles. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although this insight is not new, the link between knowledge transfer and knowledge diffusion so far has not been picked out as a central theme in the relevant research field but instead it seems that it has been treated as a theme on the fringes yet. This paper mainly argues, first, that the speed of knowledge diffusion as well as the shape of the cumulative knowledge diffusion function is governed in most instances by knowledge transfer mechanisms. Second, these knowledge transfer mechanisms differ within and between heterophilic groups who participate in the knowledge transfer process. By perfectly disentangling between and within knowledge transfer mechanisms, the paper in general tries to uncover the link between knowledge diffusion and knowledge transfer within a dynamic model which is embedded in a stochastic environment. The model is able to replicate both, symmetric as well as asymmetric cumulative knowledge diffusion patterns. This is certainly an appealing attribute of the model, because from an empirical point of view there is no clear evidence for the existence of purely symmetric cumulative knowledge diffusion curves. Further, the model can be used directly for empirical investigations.","Univ Augsburg, Dept Econ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Klarl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Dept Econ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",torben.alexander.klarl@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,,,,,,,33,17,22,1,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The senders possess the same information and sequentially send messages about that information. In one-dimensional sequential message cheap talk games where the state space is unbounded, the information is fully transmitted under the self-serving belief, as suggested by Krishna and Morgan (2001b). However, this result depends crucially on the structure of the one-dimensional model. It generally does not hold in two-dimensional models. We consider the extended self-serving belief, which implies full information transmission even if the self-serving belief cannot work.

Subjects make the same number of decisions as in the short-term counterparts, but they decide once a day. We compare these treatments to corresponding standard laboratory treatments and also to short-term internet treatments lasting one hour.

Instead, I find that socioeconomic factors that affect the need for medical care, as well as interactions between the Medicare system and other parts of the health system, can account for most of the variation in spending. I also find that controlling for health attributes at the state level explains more of the state-level variation associated with omitted health attributes than controlling for them at the individual level, an econometric difference that likely explains much of the difference between my results and those of the Dartmouth group. More broadly, I find that geographic variations in health spending do not provide a useful way to examine the inefficiencies of our health system. States where Medicare spending is high differ in multiple ways from states where it is low, and it is difficult to isolate the effects of health spending intensity from the effects of the underlying state characteristics. I show, for example, that previous findings about the relationships between health spending, the share of physicians who are general practitioners, and health care quality, are likely the result of omitted factors rather than the result of causal relationships.","Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution,"Sheiner, L (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,,,,,79,12,13,0,16,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2003). It expands the model by incorporating borrower collateral as an exogenous variable to partly assuage lender concerns about excessive risk, and a theory of lender deception is then developed. Deception is posited as a costly activity that effectively makes fraud undetectable and extracts the borrower's economic rent arising from moral hazard despite the presence of third-party enforcement and borrower collateral. We identify under what conditions a lender may have sufficient incentives for employing deception and to what extent they would employ it. The likelihood of, and outcomes from, deception are compared between monopoly lenders those in competitive markets. The model suggests that competitive lenders have more incentive to deceive than a monopoly lender facing the same borrower.","NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Tippit, RA (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.",art5@nyu.edu,,,,,,,30,2,3,0,12,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

The GDS reveals how the 'structural' aspect of debt sustainability-as indicated by trends in the non-interest current account-is closely interlinked with sustainability from a 'financial' point of view as indicated by the relationship between the growth and the interest rate.

If the fiscal deficit policy is sustainable, reductions in bond-financed deficit increase per worker capital stock and lower the unemployment rate in the long term, though the policy will raise the unemployment rate in the short term. When population growth is sufficiently low and/or per worker public debt is sufficiently large, population aging will not only increase per worker public debt but also raise the unemployment rate, thereby running counter to the bond-financed deficit cut policy.

S. Shackle's volume Expectation in Economics, introducing a unique attempt to discard the probability framework in the investigation of behaviour under uncertainty. Through a fresh reading of the textual evidence, including correspondence held at Cambridge University Library, the article assesses why decision theorists' interest in Shackle's theory, substantial during the 1950s, faded away in the early 1960s. The article argues that, apart from Shackle's refusal to comprehend that his critics were under the influence of a new subjective probability perspective, a major explanation of the dismissal of his work stays in Shackle's stance not to establish a collaborative link with those critics who showed a positive attitude towards his theory. The article shows, though, that the discussion between Shackle and his critics hinged on a number of topics that are still crucial to the current developments of decision theory.","[Zappia, Carlo] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Zappia, C (通讯作者)，Dept Econ & Stat, Piazza San Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",zappia@unisi.it,,"ZAPPIA, CARLO/0000-0003-2471-5839",St. Edmund's College,St. Edmund's College,"University of Siena.

The sectorial concentration of highly educated workers contributes to increase wages for all workers. This study also finds evidence of increasing returns to education in Brazil and diminishing returns to education in the United States. This finding may be explained by differences in supply of skilled workers in both economies. In addition, the short supply of highly skilled workers in Brazil likely explains the importance of the spillover effect from the business supporting sector.","[Schumacher, Florian I.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Piracicaba, Brazil; [Dias, Joilson] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Econ, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Tebaldi, Edinaldo] Bryant Univ, Dept Econ, Smithfield, RI 02917 USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Maringa; Bryant University,"Tebaldi, E (通讯作者)，Bryant Univ, Dept Econ, Smithfield, RI 02917 USA.",etebaldi@bryant.edu,"Schumacher, Florian/E-9821-2012; Tebaldi, Edinaldo/D-6065-2019","Tebaldi, Edinaldo/0000-0003-3670-3245",,,,,25,5,5,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We employ a laboratory experiment, using modified dictator games, in which a dictator can remain willfully ignorant about the payoff consequences of his decision for a receiver. A third party can punish the dictator after observing the dictator's decision and the resulting payoffs. On the one hand, willfully ignorant dictators are punished less if their actions lead to unfair outcomes than dictators who reveal the consequences before implementing the same outcome. On the other hand, willfully ignorant dictators are punished more than revealing dictators if their actions lead to fair outcomes. We conclude that willful ignorance can circumvent blame when unfair outcomes result, but that the act of remaining willfully ignorant is itself punished, regardless of the outcome.

Education and employment may therefore become the short-run policy targets in combatting HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among the active population and achieving economic growth. Our results equally suggest that GDP growth by itself may not be an HIV/AIDS reduction driver.,"[Afawubo, Komivi] Univ Lorraine, CEREFIGE, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Afawubo, Komivi] Univ Franche Compte, CRESE, Besancon, France; [Mathey, Samuel] ICN Business Sch, Metz, France",Universite de Lorraine; Universite de Franche-Comte,"Afawubo, K (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, CEREFIGE, F-54000 Nancy, France.",komivi.afawubo@univ-lorraine.fr,,,,,,,15,4,4,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Estimating the models using monthly data from 1991:1 to 2011:12, the results show that monetary policy (measured by short-term interest rate) has a negative and statistically significant long-run effect on real output in bull and bear market periods while the effects are stronger in bear periods than bulls. In the short run, there is no statistically significant relationship between monetary policy and real output. These results are consistent with finance constraints (capital market imperfection) models that predict that monetary policy is more effective during bear periods than bulls.","[Zare, Roohollah; Azali, M.; Habibullah, M.

We then use the gap between these measurements (missing inputs) to explain variation in investment behavior of villagers. Investment behavior is gauged with two simple artefactual field experiments. Our main results are that corruption (i) undermines incentives for voluntary contributions to local public goods and (ii) may reduce private investments of individuals subject to rent-seeking by the chief in real life.

This was especially so after the fall of the Berlin wall, when the spectre of Communism seemed to have been finally exorcised. The current financial crisis, however, has vindicated him. For Schumpeter, capitalism rightly meant, not just individual property rights, but the ability to 'create money from nothing.' This is such an enormous and dangerous power that it obviously has to be subject to the strictest constraint, which was traditionally provided, however imperfectly, by denial of incorporation with limited liability to those who dealt in money. The decline of capitalism began when financiers were released from this discipline, and it ended with the catastrophe caused by belief that bureaucratic control could replace it. The cause of the change was the progressive capture of democratically elected politicians by interests. On this, Schumpeter's The Crisis of the Tax State (1918) was almost as insightful as his later book. When Governments could not allow banks to fail, they signalled the definitive arrival of centralized financing, which is a fundamental characteristic of a socialist economy.","Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Kingston, W (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland.",wkngston@tcd.ie,,,,,,,67,3,3,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We also analyze heterogeneity in WTP by sub-group and changes in individual WTP over time between 2008 and 2010. We find that a large majority of residents are willing to pay additional taxes to reduce the number of uninsured in the state, and that average WTP remained remarkably stable despite the economic downturn and the politically polarized discussions surrounding the Affordable Care Act. Decomposing the changes in individual WTP, we find that economic factors related to the recession, including changes in income and employment status, cannot explain changes in individual WTP, whereas individual changes in political opinions about health insurance reform between 2008 and 2010 are strongly correlated with changes in WTP.

We find that both ethnic fractionalization and polarization are negatively associated with growth if considered in isolation; an effect that is though primarily attributed to their link to other growth-related activities (i.e., investment, conflict, control of corruption, fertility). We study the corresponding transmission channels and calculate their relative importance in explaining a development curse based on ethnic diversity. For both measures of ethnic fragmentation, we find the corruption channel to be the most important one.
