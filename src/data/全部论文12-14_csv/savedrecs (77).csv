J,"Markowitz, S",,,,"Markowitz, Sara",,,"WHERE THERE'S SMOKING, THERE'S FIRE: THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING POLICIES ON THE INCIDENCE OF FIRES IN THE USA",HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,cigarettes; structural fires; cigarette taxes; smoking bans,INDOOR AIR LAWS; IGNITION PROPENSITY; EXCISE TAXES; CIGARETTE; PRICES; IMPACT; BANS,"Fires and burns are among the leading causes of unintentional death in the USA. Most of these deaths occur in residences, and cigarettes are a primary cause. In this paper, I explore the relationship between smoking, cigarette policies, and fires. As smoking rates decline, there are fewer opportunities for fires; however, the magnitude of any reduction is in question. Using a state-level panel, I find that increases in cigarette prices are associated with fewer residential fires and deaths. However, laws regulating indoor smoking are associated with more fires; in particular, restaurant and bar smoking bans are associated with an increase in fires at eating and drinking establishments. This increase is important given the growing popularity of smoking bans in the USA and around the world. As workplaces, schools, and businesses ban smoking and remove ashtrays, smokers who continue to smoke are left without safe options for disposal of cigarettes, leading to more opportunities for fires to start.

The focus is on one-sided conditional t-tests. Theoretical and numerical work shows that the conditional 2SLS and Fuller t-tests perform well even when instruments are weakly correlated with the endogenous variable. When the population F-statistic is as small as two, their power is reasonably close to the power envelopes for similar and non-similar tests which are invariant to rotation transformations of the instruments. This finding is surprising considering the bad performance of two-sided conditional t-tests found in Andrews et al. (2007). We show these tests have bad power because the conditional null distributions of t-statistics are asymmetric when instruments are weak. Taking this asymmetry into account, we propose two-sided tests based on t-statistics. These novel tests are approximately unbiased and can perform as well as the conditional likelihood ratio (CLR) test. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

There is no randomized controlled trial evidence to support this schedule, and model based analysis is required. This paper describes a novel data collection and model calibration process to analyze the cost-effectiveness of alternative follow-up schedules for early breast cancer survivors. Methods: A discrete event simulation model describes the progression of early breast cancer after the completion of primary treatment, representing impalpable and palpable recurrence and the detection of impalpable disease via follow-up mammography. Retrospective data from the South Australian Cancer Registry and clinical and administrative hospital databases were linked for 407 postmenopausal women diagnosed with moderate-prognosis early breast cancer from 2000 to 2008. These data formed the basis of a patient-level probabilistic calibration process. Results: For 50- to 69-year-old survivors, annual follow-up for 5 years, with visits every 2 years thereafter, appears to be cost-effective. for women aged 70 to 79 years at diagnosis, a surveillance schedule similar to general population screening (2 yearly) appears to be most cost-effective if high rates of adherence can be maintained. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the potential value of combining linked, retrospective data and decision analytic modeling to provide estimates of costs and health outcomes that are sufficiently robust to inform cancer clinical guidelines and individual patient decisions regarding appropriate follow-up schedules.","[Bessen, Taryn; Karnon, Jonathan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Populat Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Bessen, Taryn] Royal Adelaide Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",University of Adelaide; Royal Adelaide Hospital,"Karnon, J (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Populat Hlth, Level 7,178 North Terrace,Mail Drop Dx650550, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",jonathan.karnon@adelaide.edu.au,,"Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) in Australia,National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) in Australia,"Taryn Bessen was the recipient of Doctoral Funding from the National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) in Australia, The funding was to support project-related costs, and the NBCF had no input into the design, conduct, analysis, or reporting of this study.",,40,7,7,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2014,17,6.0,,,,,669,678,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.07.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AP8XS,25236990.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342363300002,0

Validation to external studies is an important part of demonstrating model credibility. Objective: Because the CDM is widely used to estimate long-term clinical outcomes in diabetes patients, the objective of this analysis was to validate the CDM to contemporary outcomes studies, including those with long-term follow-up periods. Methods: A total of 112 validation simulations were performed, stratified by study follow-up duration. For long-term results (>= 15-year follow-up), simulation cohorts representing baseline Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) cohorts were generated and intensive and conventional treatment arms were defined in the CDM. Predicted versus observed macrovascular and microvascular complications and all cause mortality were assessed using the coefficient of determination (R-2) goodness-of-fit measure. Results: Across all validation studies, the CDM simulations produced an R2 statistic of 0.90. for validation studies with a follow-up duration of less than 15 years, R-2 values of 0.90 and 0.88 were achieved for T1DM and T2DM respectively. In T1DM, validating against 30-year outcomes data (DCCT) resulted in an R-2 of 0.72. In T2DM, validating against 20-year outcomes data (UKPDS) resulted in an R-2 of 0.92. Conclusions: This analysis supports the CDM as a credible tool for predicting the absolute number of clinical events in DCCT- and UKPDS-like populations. With increasing incidence of diabetes worldwide, the CDM is particularly important for health care decision makers, for whom the robust evaluation of health care policies is essential.","[McEwan, Phil] Swansea Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Cardiff CF10 1BR, S Glam, Wales; [McEwan, Phil] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Monmouth, England; [Foos, Volker; Palmer, James L.] IMS Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Lamotte, Mark] IMS Hlth, Brussels, Belgium; [Lloyd, Adam; Grant, David] IMS Hlth, London, England",Swansea University,"McEwan, P (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Westgate House,Womanby St, Cardiff CF10 1BR, S Glam, Wales.",phil.mcewan@hear.co.uk,"Grant, David/HGU-0154-2022",,,,,,59,152,156,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2014,17,6.0,,,,,714,724,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.07.007,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AP8XS,25236995.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342363300007,0

We use a difference-in-differences approach that exploits a natural variation in the program rollout across collective agreement areas in the construction sector and over time. The results show only little evidence of an effect on the prevention of injuries requiring medical attention in the first 3 years after the program was introduced. Despite this, we find evidence of significant positive effects on several labor market outcomes, suggesting that the program enables some work-injured individuals to maintain their work and earnings capacity. In view of its low costs, the program appears to be cost-effective overall. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This makes it possible to express the fact that an agent knows that there are some facts of which he is unaware. In that logic, it is not possible to model an agent who is uncertain about whether he is aware of all formulas. To overcome this problem, we keep the syntax of the earlier paper, but allow models where, with each world, a possibly different language is associated. We provide a sound and complete axiomatization for this logic and show that, under natural assumptions, the quantifier-free fragment of the logic is characterized by exactly the same axioms as the logic of Heifetz et al.

This paper provides new evidence on the impact of a specific type of liberalization, decriminalization, on initiation into cannabis use. Our identification strategy exploits variation in the timing of cannabis policy reforms and our estimation framework marries a difference-in-difference approach with a discrete time duration model. Our results reveal evidence of both heterogeneity and dynamics in the response of cannabis uptake to decriminalization. Overall, we find that the impact of decriminalization is concentrated amongst minors, who have a higher rate of uptake in the first five years following its introduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although several knee-specific instruments exist, no patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure correlates function with improved stability, motion, satisfaction, and confidence. Objective: To address both the above limitations by developing a PRO measure to assess the phenomenon of a normal knee after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods: A draft conceptual model linking the impact of clinical mechanics to hypothesized functional outcomes was generated after a literature review of available assessment tools. Participants aged 18 to 80 years having undergone TKA within the past 10 to 18 months were identified and screened by clinical sites to participate in phase 1 focus groups or phase 2 in-depth interviews. Participants were asked to describe their TKA experiences, including how their knee feels now, followed by cognitive debriefing of Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) draft items. Results: Phase 1 results indicated that concepts of confidence, stability, and satisfaction in patients' replacement knee when performing certain activities were distinct and important in the patients' assessment of their TKA. Phase 2 efforts yielded a final version of the PKIP measure containing nine items assessing the broader concepts of stability, confidence, and satisfaction in association with activities. Presurgical and postsurgical versions of the measure were created. Conclusions: Results of this qualitative study support use of the PKIP as a complementary PRO measure to assess performance after primary TKA. Psychometric evaluation of the PKIP is planned.","[Lewis, Sandy; Price, Mark] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Dwyer, Kimberly A.] DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruct Inc, Warsaw, IN USA; [O'Brien, Seamus; Beverland, David] Musgrave Pk Hosp, Belfast Trust, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Heekin, R.

The model is simple yet flexible and can be safely applied to both stationary and nonstationary situations with different sources of parameter changes. For the 3-to 12-months ahead out-of-sample forecasts of the US yield curve from 1998:1 to 2010:9, the ADNS model dominates both the popular reduced-form and affine term structure models; compared to random walk prediction, the ADNS steadily reduces the forecast error measurements by between 20% and 60%. The locally estimated coefficients and the identified stable subsamples over time align with policy changes and the timing of the recent financial crisis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It has been recommended that IV methods should be avoided if the instrument is not econometrically perfect. The fact that IVs can produce better results than naive regression, even in nonideal circumstances, remains underappreciated. In this paper, we propose a diagnostic criterion and related software that can be used by an applied researcher to determine the plausible superiority of IV over an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator, which does not address the endogeneity of a covariate in question. Given a reasonable lower bound for the bias arising out of an OLS estimator, the researcher can use our proposed diagnostic tool to confirm whether the IV at hand can produce a better estimate (i.e., with lower mean square error) of the true effect parameter than the OLS, without knowing the true level of contamination in the IV.

It is found that the implied volatility is subject to a systematic bias in the presence of pricing errors, which makes it inconsistent to the underlying volatility. We propose an estimator of the underlying volatility by first estimating nonparametrically the option price function, followed by inverting the nonparametrically estimated price. It is shown that the approach removes the adverse impacts of the pricing errors and produces a consistent volatility estimator for a wide range of option price models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by numerical simulation and empirical analysis on S&P 500 option data. (C) 2013, Elsevier B.V.

Only a dentist may legally perform most dental procedures; however, a smaller list of basic procedures may be provided by either a dentist or a dental hygienist. Since dentists and hygienists possess different levels of training and skill and receive very different wages, it is plausible that these regulations could distort the optimal allocation of skills to work tasks. We present simple theoretical framework that shows different ways that such regulations might affect the way that dentists and dental hygienists are used in the production of dental services. We then use a large database of dental insurance claims to study the effects of the regulations on the prevailing prices of a set of basic dental services. Our empirical analysis exploits variation across states and over time in the list of services that may be provided by either type of worker. Our main results suggest that the task-specific occupational regulations increase prices by about 12%. We also examine the effects of related occupational regulations on the utilization of basic dental services. We find that allowing insurers to directly reimburse hygienists for their work increases one year utilization rates by 3-4 percentage points. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We distinguished between the effects on the growth of the expenditures and its adjustment to violations of a long-run equilibrium linking HCE with macroeconomic and demographic trends. Regarding the influence of partisan ideology, we found that if governments are sufficiently long in power, right-wing governments spend less on public health than their left-wing counterparts. Furthermore, if a right-wing party governs without coalition partners, it responds more strongly to deviations from the long-run HCE equilibrium than left-wing governments. With regard to electoral motives, we found that health expenditure increases in years of elections. Independent of their partisan ideology, single-party (minority) governments induce higher (lower) growth of public HCE. Each of these political factors by its own may increase (decrease) HCE growth by approximately one percentage point. Given an average annual growth of HCE of approximately 4.1%, political factors turn out to be important determinants of trends in public HCE.

A structural approach allows us to model the labour force participation decision, the occupational and shift-type choice, and the decision about hours worked as a joint outcome following from maximising a utility function. Disutility from work is allowed to vary by occupation and also by shift type in the utility function. Our results suggest that average wage elasticities might be higher than previous research has found. This is mainly due to the effect of wages on the decision to enter or exit the profession, which was not included in the previous literature, rather than from its effect on increased working hours for those who already work in the profession.

We provide conditions under which the estimator is asymptotically Gaussian and we investigate the finite sample performance of the method. An approach to testing the specification against a competing fixed effects specification is introduced. The paper presents an application to study the effect of class size and composition on educational attainment. The evidence suggests that while smaller classes are beneficial for low performers, larger classes are beneficial for high performers. The fixed effects specification is rejected in favor of the interactive effects specification. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from nurse practitioners and physician assistants,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health care workforce; Occupational licensing,NONPHYSICIAN CLINICIAN; WORKFORCE; SPECIALIZATION; OUTCOMES; ACCESS; TRENDS; IMPACT,"Nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) now outnumber family practice doctors in the United States and are the principal providers of primary care to many communities. Recent growth of these professions has occurred amidst considerable cross-state variation in their regulation, with some states permitting autonomous practice and others mandating extensive physician oversight. I find that expanded NP and PA supply has had minimal impact on the office-based healthcare market overall, but utilization has been modestly more responsive to supply increases in states permitting greater autonomy. Results suggest the importance of laws impacting the division of labor, not just its quantity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We study its behavior under misspecification. We also propose an efficient version of our estimator. We develop a procedure based on a distance metric statistic for testing restrictions on parameters as well as a bootstrap technique to account for the bandwidth's influence. Our new methods are simple to implement, apply to non-smooth problems, and perform well in our simulations. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Pivato, M",,,,"Pivato, Marcus",,,Multiutility representations for incomplete difference preorders,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"A difference preorder is a (possibly incomplete) preorder on a space of state changes (rather than the states themselves); it encodes information about preference intensity, in addition to ordinal preferences. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for a difference preorder to be representable by a family of cardinal utility functions which take values in linearly ordered abelian groups. We also discuss the sense in which this cardinal utility representation is unique up to affine transformations, and under what conditions it is real-valued. This has applications to interpersonal comparisons, social welfare, and decisions under uncertainty. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for the period 1999-2005 merged with data on state HED reforms from the National Association of State Boards of Education Health Policy Database and the 2000 and 2006 School Health Policies and Programs Study. To identify the spillover effects of HED requirements on parents' behavior, we use several methodologies (triple differences, changes in changes, and difference in differences) in which we allow for different types of treatments. We find a positive effect of HED reforms at the elementary school on the probability of parents doing light physical activity. Introducing major changes in HED increases the probability of fathers engaging in physical activity by between 6.3 and 13.7 percentage points, whereas on average, this probability for mothers does not seem to be affected. We analyze several heterogeneous impacts of the HED reforms to unveil the mechanisms behind these spillovers. We find evidence consistent with hypotheses such as gender specialization of parents in childcare activities or information sharing between children and parents.

HCV-related complications as well as the highly debilitating effects on patients represent a significant item of expenditure for the National Health Service. Early detection of HCV infection is an excellent opportunity to improve patients' quality of life and to rationalize resource allocation. Objective: The aim of this study was to provide a cost-effectiveness evaluation of an anti-HCV screening program in the Italian National Health Service perspective. Methods: We built a Markov model made up of two arms. The Test Strategy arm involves a screening program based on the enzyme immunoassay for detection of antibodies as first-level test and the research of HCV RNA as second-level detection; patients with positive test results are treated with peg interferon alfa in combination with ribavirine. Parameters were derived from the literature and validated through experts' opinion. Costs and benefits were discounted by 3.5%. Results were expressed as cost/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained through the screening program compared with the treatment of symptomatic patients. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the Test Strategy is (sic)5171/QALY, definitively below the cost/QALY of other approved treatments in Italy. Model results turned out as sensitive to the age of the target population, the prevalence of HCV infection, and the time horizon adopted. Conclusions: The anti-HCV screening program is a valid health-related investment improving patients' quality of life and survival with an acceptable expenditure increase for the National Health Service.","[Ruggeri, Matteo; Coretti, Silvia; Cicchetti, Americo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Fac Econ, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Gasbarrini, Antonio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Fac Med, I-00168 Rome, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli,"Ruggeri, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Fac Econ, Lgo F Vito 1, I-00168 Rome, Italy.",mruggeri@rm.unicatt.it,"Embrett, Mark G./H-4466-2014; Ruggeri, Mirella/E-6091-2010; Cicchetti, Americo/AAP-9403-2021; Gasbarrini, Antonio/AAB-8487-2019","Embrett, Mark G./0000-0002-3969-0219; Gasbarrini, Antonio/0000-0003-4863-6924; Gasbarrini, Antonio/0000-0002-6230-1779; ruggeri, matteo/0000-0002-5703-7424; Cicchetti, Americo/0000-0002-4633-9195",,,,,20,28,29,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,965,972,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.07.005,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041346.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700007,0

We estimate a three-level random intercept probit model to attribute unexplained variation in hospital-acquired complications to hospital effects, hospital-specialty effects and remaining random variations, controlling for observable patient complexities. The combined information provided by the posterior means and densities for latent hospital and specialty effects can be used to assess the need and scope for improvements in patient safety at different organizational levels. Posterior densities are not conventionally presented in performance assessment but provides valuable additional information to policy makers on what poorly performing hospitals and specialties may be prioritized for policy action. We use surgical patient administrative data for 2005/2006 for 16 specialties in 35 public hospitals in Victoria, Australia. We use posterior means for latent hospital and specialty effects to compare hospital performance in patient safety. Posterior densities and variances are also compared for different specialties to identify clinical areas with greatest scope for improvement. We also show that the same hospital may rank markedly differently for different specialties.

Any continuous symmetry of a preference relation implies that its representations satisfy a system of PDEs. Conversely the system implies the continuous symmetry if the latter is generated by a field. Moreover, solving the PDEs yields the functional form for utility equivalent to the symmetry. This framework is shown to encompass a variety of representation theorems related to univariate separability, multivariate separability, and homogeneity, including the cases of Cobb-Douglas and CES utility.

Furthermore, there is suggestive evidence that use has trended upwards recently for groups that have traditionally been at low risk of using ST, and thus started to diffuse across demographics. This study provides the first estimates, at the national level, of the effects of magazine advertising on ST use. The focus on magazine advertising is significant given that ST manufacturers have been banned from using other conventional media since the 1986 Comprehensive ST Act and the 1998 ST Master Settlement Agreement. This study is based on the 2003-2009 waves of the National Consumer Survey (NCS), a unique data source that contains extensive information on the reading habits of individuals, matched with magazine-specific advertising information over the sample period. This allows detailed and salient measures of advertising exposure at the individual level and addresses potential bias due to endogeneity and selective targeting. We find consistent and robust evidence that exposure to ST ads in magazines raises ST use, especially among males, with an estimated elasticity of 0.06. There is suggestive evidence that both ST taxes and cigarette taxes reduce ST use, indicating contemporaneous complementarity between these tobacco products. Sub-analyses point to some differences in the advertising and tax response across segments of the population. The effects from this study inform the debate on the cost and benefits of ST use and its potential to be a tool in overall tobacco harm reduction. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An Exploratory Study Using the Person Trade-Off Technique,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,decision making; deliberation; preferences; utility,SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; ELICITATION; PREFERENCES; DISEASE; BURDEN; VALUES; RULE,"Background: This article explores two gaps in the health state valuation literature: the effect of processes and the stability of health state valuations, and the existence of preexisting valuations. Stability in health state valuations over time depends on whether preferences are considered to be preexisting (axiom of completeness) and therefore can be gathered reliably, or are constructed during consideration and debate. Under the former, changes in revealed preferences are evidence of poor reliability; under the latter, it is a function of the deliberative process. Methods: This study explores the effect of deliberation on health state valuations elicited by using the person trade-off technique. Quantitative analysis was used to explore whether respondents changed their responses following deliberation and the impact of change on aggregate health state values. Qualitative methods were used to explore respondents' views on the elicitation process and the impact of deliberation on their responses. Results: Following discussion and deliberation, 74% of the participants changed their person trade-off valuations and this did have an impact on the aggregate valuations. The qualitative analysis lends some support to the construction of preference assumption. Conclusions: The results from this exploratory study challenge the notion that individuals have preexisting health state preferences and call for further detailed research in this area. Furthermore, it raises concerns over current practices around preference elicitation exercises, which have tended to be carried out as a solitary exercise without allowing time for respondents to reflect and deliberate on their decisions.","[Robinson, Suzanne] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Bryan, Stirling] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Curtin University; University of British Columbia,"Robinson, S (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Level 3,Bldg 400,Kent St, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",suzanne.robinson@curtin.edu.au,"Robinson, Suzanne/B-6604-2013","Robinson, Suzanne/0000-0001-5703-6475",University of Birmingham,University of Birmingham,Source of financial support: The University of Birmingham supported the study.

This study developed and examined the preliminary reliability and validity of the new National Comprehensive Cancer Network/Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Kidney Symptom Index 19. Methods: Fifty patients with advanced kidney cancer provided open-ended and survey responses ranking their most important symptoms. Responses were reconciled with published clinician reports of the most important symptoms. Ten experienced oncologists rated symptoms as disease- or treatment-related. Patients completed quality-of-life and performance status measures. Results: A 19-item index was produced from symptoms that were rated as most important by patients or clinicians. It includes three subscales: disease-related symptoms (DRS), treatment side effects (TSE), and general function and well-being (FWB). Internal consistency was good for the full instrument (alpha = 0.83), the DRS subscale (alpha = 0.76), and the FWB subscale (alpha = 0.78) but lower for the TSE subscale (alpha = 0.59). Convergent validity was demonstrated through correlations with the FACT-General. Patients with differing performance status were distinguished by the total score (F-2,F-47 = 17.37; P < .0001), the DRS subscale (F-2,F-47 = 14.22; P < .0001), and the FWB subscale (F-2,F-47 = 13.40; P < .0001) but not the TSE subscale (F-2,F-47 =1.48; P = 0.2380). Conclusions: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network/FACT-Kidney Symptom Index 19 combines symptoms deemed most important by patients and clinicians. Preliminary evidence suggests that the total score and DRS and FWB subscales are reliable and valid as summary indexes. The TSE subscale may be least relevant given the advent of newer therapies.","[Rothrock, Nan E.; Jensen, Sally E.; Beaumont, Jennifer L.; Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med Social Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Jensen, Sally E.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Surg, Div Organ Transplantat, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Abernethy, Amy P.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Med Oncol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Jacobsen, Paul B.] Univ S Florida, H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr, Hlth Outcomes & Behav Program, Tampa, FL 33682 USA; [Syrjala, Karen] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Div Clin Res, Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Syrjala, Karen] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Robert H Lurie Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Duke University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Robert H.

The test is based on the behavior of the CDF of bids near the reserve price. We show that the curvature of the CDF is drastically different under private values (PV) and common values (CV). We then show that the problem of discriminating between PV and CV is equivalent to estimating the lower tail index of the bid distribution. Our approach admits unobserved auction heterogeneity of an arbitrary form. We develop a Hill (1975)-type tail index estimator and find the presence of common values in BC Timber Sales.

This paper considers low-frequency tests about cointegrating vectors under a range of restrictions on the common stochastic trends. We quantify how much power can potentially be gained by exploiting correct restrictions, as well as the magnitude of size distortions if such restrictions are imposed erroneously.

Methods: A Bayesian approach was used to reanalyze the data underlying a guidance by the Dutch National Health Insurance Board about the quadrivalent HPV vaccine Gardasil. Several studies document the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing cases in different subpopulations. None of these (sub)populations, however, is representative of the actual target population that the vaccination program will be applied to. We used a Bayesian approach for restructuring the data by means of reweighting the subpopulations by using HPV prevalence data, to estimate the effectiveness that can be expected in the actual target population. Results: The original data show an effectiveness of 44% in the entire population and an effectiveness of 98% for women who were compliant and were HPV-free at the start of the study. In the study population, the HPV prevalence was below 4%. In the relevant target population, however, the actual prevalence could be very different. In fact, some publications find an HPV prevalence of around 10%. We used Bayesian techniques to estimate the effectiveness in the actual target population. We found a mean effectiveness of 25%, and the probability that the effectiveness in the target population exceeds 50% is virtually zero. The results are very sensitive to the HPV prevalence that is used. Conclusions: A supplementary analysis can put together the bits and pieces of information to arrive at more relevant answers. A Bayesian approach allows for integrating all the evidence into one model in a straightforward way and results in very intuitive probability statements.","[Woertman, Willem; van der Wilt, Gert Jan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Dept Hlth Evidence, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Woertman, W (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Nijmegen, Dept Hlth Evidence, POB 9101, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands.",W.Woertman@ebh.umcn.nl,"van der Wilt, Gert Jan/H-8120-2014","van der Wilt, Gert Jan/0000-0002-5856-762X","Council for Health and Health Services Research from The Netherlands, ZonMw [80-82500-98-8201]","Council for Health and Health Services Research from The Netherlands, ZonMw(Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development)","This study is part of a larger project (Title: Potential and limitations of Bayesian analyses in synthesis of evidence from multiple sources.

We first reconcile their debate and discuss the value judgments implicit in their indices. Next, we provide a formal definition of the previously undefined value judgment in Wagstaff's correction. Finally, we show empirically that the choice of index matters, as illustrated by comparisons between countries using data from the European Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement.

This paper addresses the need for a theoretical foundation of this research and develops a theoretical framework for analysing fourth hurdle processes from an economics perspective. On the basis of a decision-analytic framework and the theory of agents, fourth hurdle processes are described as sets of institutions to maximize the value derived from finite healthcare resources. Benefits are assumed to arise from the value of better information about and better implementation of the most cost-effective choice. Implementation is improved by decreased information asymmetries and better alignment of incentives. This decreases the effects of ex ante and ex post moral hazard on service provision. Potential indicators of high benefit include high costs associated with wrong decisions and large population sizes affected by the decision. The framework may serve as a basis both for further theoretical work, for example, on the appropriate degree of participation as well as further empirical work, for example, on comparative assessments of fourth hurdle processes. It needs to be complemented by frameworks for analysing fourth hurdle institutions developed by other disciplines such as bioethics or law. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Rogowski, W.

Our findings provide evidence for full convergence for only two components, namely physician and other professional services' and home health care'.

Methods: A discrete-choice experiment was conducted with adult rheumatoid-arthritis patients who had never been treated with biological agents from two university hospitals-public and private-in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We evaluated preferences for seven treatment attributes (with two to three levels each): effectiveness, mode of administration, frequency of administration, local and systemic adverse events, severe infections, and out-of-pocket costs. A probit regression model was used to analyze the relative importance of rheumatoid-arthritis treatment attributes. We estimated attributes' relative importance and their 95% confidence intervals. Results: Survey responses from 240 patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were included in the study. All tested biological agents' attributes significantly affected the choice of treatment. Attributes' relative importance in decreasing order was the following (mean, confidence interval 95%): cost, 0.81 (0.69-0.92); systemic adverse events, 0.66 (0.57-0.76); frequency of administration, 0.61 (0.52-0.71); efficacy, 0.42 (0.32-0.51); route of administration, 0.41 (0.30-0.52); local adverse events, 0.40 (0.31-0.49); and serious infections, 0.29 (0.22-0.37). Conclusions: Different treatment attributes had a significant and different influence in rheumatoid-arthritis patients' choice of biological agents. This type of study can not only inform about patients' preferences but also about the trade-offs among different possible treatments or process-related attributes.","[Augustovski, Federico; Beratarrechea, Andrea; Irazola, Vilma; Rubinstein, Fernando] Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy IECS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Augustovski, Federico; Beratarrechea, Andrea; Rubinstein, Fernando; Tesolin, Pablo; Scolnik, Marina; Navarta, David; Soriano, Enrique R.] Hosp Italiano Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Gonzalez, Juan] RTI Hlth Solut, Raleigh, NC USA; [Lencina, Veronica; Waimann, Christian; Citera, Gustavo] Inst Rehabil Psicofis IREP, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires; Research Triangle Institute,"Augustovski, F (通讯作者)，Ravignani 2024, RA-1414 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",faugustovski@iecs.org.ar,"rubinstein, fernando/W-1805-2019; Soriano, Enrique R./AAN-4206-2020","Soriano, Enrique R./0000-0003-3143-1084; Rubinstein, Fernando/0000-0001-5653-5766; Andrea, Beratarrechea/0000-0002-6397-4406; Gonzalez, Juan Marcos/0000-0002-5386-0907",BMS; Bayer; Sanofi Aventis; Novartis; Pfizer,BMS(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Bayer(Bayer AG); Sanofi Aventis(Sanofi-Aventis); Novartis(Novartis); Pfizer(Pfizer),"This study was sponsored by BMS.

We show however that specific assumptions about the behavior of the stronger measure of risk aversion also give rise to the linex utility function which belongs to the class of one-switch utility functions. In particular, this utility class is the only one that satisfies a stronger version of Kimball's (1993) standard risk aversion over all levels of wealth.

Methods: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare the treatment of latent TB infection in subgroups of contacts to no treatment over a 6-year time horizon in a Canadian setting. Contacts were stratified into 32 groups on the basis of five binary variables: type of contact (close or casual), tuberculin skin test (TST) results (positive or negative at 5 mm cutoff), Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination status, place of birth (foreign- or Canadian-born), and age group (cutoff 35 years). Risk of TB reactivation was calculated for each subgroup from a longitudinal registry of contacts, adjusted for several potential confounders and comorbid conditions. We calculated the quality-adjusted life-years gained because of delayed or prevention of active TB via treatment of latent TB infection versus quality-adjusted life-years lost because of the adverse events to INH. Results: A targeted policy based on adopting INH therapy only in subgroups with positive expected incremental net health benefit resulted in a different treatment decision than the current guidelines in five subgroups comprising 3.9% of the contacts. Namely, the targeted policy comprised no INH therapy in casual contacts with a positive vaccination history even with a positive TST result and INH therapy in foreign-born close contacts younger than 35 years even with a negative TST result. Conclusions: From a benefit-risk viewpoint, INH treatment of contacts should be tailored on the basis of risk assessment algorithms that consider a range of factors at the time of screening.","[Sadatsafavi, Mohsen; Marra, Carlo; Lynd, Larry] Univ British Columbia, Collaborat Outcome Res & Evaluat, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Marra, Fawziah] Univ British Columbia, BC Ctr Dis Control, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Moran, Onofre] Queens Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Sadatsafavi, Mohsen; FitzGerald, J.

Such experiments are often designed and conducted deliberately for the purpose of designing new products. There is a long-standing literature on nonparametric and Bayesian modelling of preferences for the study of consumer choice when there is a market for each product, but this work does not apply when such markets fail to exist as is the case with most product attributes. This paper takes up the common case in which attributes can be quantified and preferences over these attributes are monotone. It shows that monotonicity is the only shape constraint appropriate for a utility function in these circumstances. The paper models components of utility using a Dirichlet prior distribution and demonstrates that all monotone nondecreasing utility functions are supported by the prior. It develops a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior simulation that is reliable and practical given the number of attributes, choices and sample sizes characteristic of discrete choice experiments. The paper uses the algorithm to demonstrate the flexibility of the model in capturing heterogeneous preferences and applies it to a discrete choice experiment that elicits preferences for different auto insurance policies.

(2010) prove that Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers still converge to the correct posterior distribution of the model parameters when the likelihood estimated by the particle filter (with a finite number of particles) is used instead of the likelihood. A critical issue for performance is the choice of the number of particles. We add the following contributions. First, we provide analytically derived, practical guidelines on the optimal number of particles to use. Second, we show that a fully adapted auxiliary particle filter is unbiased and can drastically decrease computing time compared to a standard particle filter. Third, we introduce a new estimator of the likelihood based on the output of the auxiliary particle filter and use the framework of Del Moral (2004) to provide a direct proof of the unbiasedness of the estimator. Fourth, we show that the results in the article apply more generally to Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes with the likelihood estimated in an unbiased manner.

To emphasize the presence of heterogeneous agents, we distinguish intergroup consumption externalities from intragroup consumption externalities. We show that if there are intragroup consumption externalities alone, then the steady state equilibrium satisfies saddle-point stability and the equilibrium path of the economy is uniquely determined. In contrast, even if the intragroup consumption externalities do not exist, the intergroup external effects of consumption may yield either instability or local indeterminacy of the steady-state equilibrium. In addition to analytical considerations, we show the relationship between the stability and the consumption externalities in numerical examples. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The possibility of highly related moments arises when there are many of them. Knight and Fu (2000) designate the issue of similar regressors as the nearly singular design in the least squares case. In the nearly singular design, the sample variance converges to a singular limit term. However, Knight and Fu (2000) assume that on the nullspace of the limit term, the difference between the sample variance and the singular matrix converges in probability to a positive definite matrix when multiplied by an appropriate rate. We consider specifically Continuous Updating Estimator (CUE) with many weak moments under nearly singular design. We show that the nearly singular design affects the form of the limit of the many weak moment asymptotics that is introduced by Newey and Windmeijer (2009a). However, the estimator is still consistent and the Wald test has the standard chi(2) limit. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We prove that a slight memory effect characterizing the learning-by-doing process is enough to generale business cycle fluctuations through a Hopf bifurcation leading to stable periodic orbits. This is obtained for reasonable parameter values, notably for both the amount of externalities and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Hence, contrary to all the results available in the literature on aggregate models, we show that endogenous fluctuations are compatible with a low (in actual fact, zero) wage elasticity of the labor supply.

To this end we develop Pearson-type test statistics based on GEL implied probabilities formed from general kernel smoothed versions of the moment indicators. We also modify the statistics suggested in Guggenberger and Smith (2008) for a general kernel smoothing function. Importantly for our conclusions, we provide GEL time series counterparts to GMM and GEL conditional likelihood ratio statistics given in Kleibergen (2005) and Smith (2007). Our analysis not only demonstrates that these statistics are asymptotically (conditionally) pivotal under both classical asymptotic theory and weak instrument asymptotics of Stock and Wright (2000) but also provides asymptotic power results in the weakly identified time series context. Consequently, the empirical null rejection probabilities of the associated tests and, thereby, the coverage probabilities of the corresponding confidence regions, should not be affected greatly by the strength or otherwise of identification. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study indicates that a number of the tests proposed here represent very competitive choices in comparison with those suggested elsewhere in the literature.

We explore two alternative definitions of awareness and estimate a trivariate probit model with selection, which accounts for common, unmeasured factors underlying the following: (1) self-reporting chronic disease; (2) participating in biomarker collection; and (3) having disease, conditional on participating in biomarker collection. Our findings suggest that current estimates of racial/ethnic disparities in chronic disease are sensitive to selection, and also to the definition of disease awareness used. We find that African-Americans are less likely to be unaware of having hypertension than non-Latino whites, but the magnitude of this effect falls appreciably after we account for selection. Accounting for selection, we find that African-Americans and Latinos are more likely to be unaware of having diabetes compared to non-Latino whites. These findings are based on a widely used definition of awareness the likelihood of self-reporting disease among those who have disease. When we use an alternative definition of awareness, which considers an individual to be unaware if he or she actually has the disease conditional on self-reporting not having it, we find higher levels of unawareness among racial/ethnic minorities versus non-Latino whites for both hypertension and diabetes.

We also collected information on factors such as the indication and type of media involved and whether the letter referenced Section 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act. Results: Of 291 DDMAC letters sent to pharmaceutical companies during the study period, 35 (12%) cited a health economic violation. The most common type of violation cited was an implied claim of cost savings due to work productivity or functioning (found in 20 letters) and economic claims containing unsubstantiated comparative claims of effectiveness, safety, or interchangeability (7 letters). The violations covered various indications, mostly commonly psychiatric disorders (6 letters) and pain (6 letters). No DDMAC letter pertained to Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act Section 114. Conclusion: The FDA has cited inappropriate health economic promotions in roughly 12% of the letters issued by the DDMAC. The letters highlight drug companies' interest in promoting the value of their products and the FDA's concerns in certain cases about the lack of supporting evidence.","[Neumann, Peter J.; Bliss, Sarah K.] Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Tufts Medical Center,"Neumann, PJ (通讯作者)，Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 800 Washington St,Box 063, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",pneumann@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,,,Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center,Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center,Source of financial support: This study was funded by internal resources at the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center.,,12,5,5,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15,6.0,,,,,948,953,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.05.002,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999146.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800022,0

This essay notes that the curve defined by the log of US national health care expenditures per capita plotted against the log of the US gross domestic product per capita has been remarkably straight since 1929 despite Medicare and Medicaid and all of the more recent reform attempts. After establishing stationarity and considering cointegration and endogeneity, the slope of this loglog relationship suggests a per capita expenditureincome elasticity of 1.388. The authors suggest two explanatory hypotheses consistent with the observed constant slope. First, many new technologies are endogenous because their introduction is determined by their expected market, which is in turn dependent on GDP per capita. Second, the authors emphasize the potential utility gained by spending disproportionately larger proportions of our growing income on hope, uncertainty-reducing information, and consumer amenities, all of which may be independent of any improved health outcome.

Implementation of this change began in 2007. The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the expanded newborn screening program compared with the previous standard screening in Texas. Methods: A Markov model (for a hypothetical cohort of Texas births in 2007) was constructed to compare lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between the expanded newborn screening and pre-expansion newborn screening. Estimates of costs, probabilities of sequelae, and utilities for disorder categories were obtained from a combination of Texas statistics, the literature, and expert opinion. A baseline discount rate of 3% was used for both costs and QALYs, with a range of 0% to 5%. Analyses were conducted from a payer's perspective, and so only direct medical cost estimates were included. Results: The lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for expanded versus pre-expansion screening was about $11,560 per QALY. The results remained robust to both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Expanded newborn screening does result in additional expenses to the payer, but it also improves patient outcomes by preventing avoidable morbidity and mortality. The screened population benefits from greater QALYs as compared with the unscreened population. Overall, expanded newborn screening in Texas was estimated to be a cost-effective option as compared with unexpanded newborn screening.","[Tiwana, Simrandeep K.] Alberta Hlth Serv, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Tiwana, Simrandeep K.; Rascati, Karen L.; Park, Haesuk] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Alberta Health Services (AHS); University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Tiwana, SK (通讯作者)，136 Royal Rd, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",simran.k.tiwana@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,24,24,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15,5.0,,,,,613,621,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.007,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867769.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100003,0

We show that the inverse problem is well-posed for self-reporting data under the assumption that the probability of truthful reporting, is nonzero, which is supported by empirical evidences. Comparing with ill-posedness, well-posedness generally can be translated into faster rates of convergence for the nonparametric estimators of the latent distribution. Therefore, our optimistic result on well-posedness is of importance in economic applications, and it suggests that researchers should not ignore the point mass at zero in the measurement error distribution when they model measurement errors with self-reported data. We also analyze the implications of our results on the estimation of classical measurement error models. Then by both a Monte Carlo study and an empirical application, we show that failing to account for the nonzero probability of truthful reporting can lead to significant bias on estimation of the latent distribution.

Using the longitudinal follow-up data at age 23, 33, 42 and 46, we build a dynamic model to investigate the influence of each determinant on health and the mediating role of education and lifestyles in the relationship between early-life conditions and later health. Direct and indirect effects of early-life conditions on adult health are explored using auxiliary linear regressions of education and lifestyles and panel Probit specifications of self-assessed health with random effects addressing individual unexplained heterogeneity. Our study shows that early-life conditions are important parameters for adult health accounting for almost 20% of explained health inequality when mediating effects are identified. The contribution of lifestyles reduces from 32% down to 25% when indirect effects of early-life conditions and education are distinguished. Noticeably, the absence of father at the time of birth and experience of financial hardships represent the lead factors for direct effects on health. The absence of obesity at 16 influences health both directly and indirectly working through lifestyles.

Given a candidate value distribution function in a sieve space, we simulate bids according to the equilibrium bid function involved. We take the difference of the empirical characteristic functions of the actual and simulated bids as the moment function. The objective function is then the integral of the squared moment function over an interval. Minimizing this integral to the distribution functions in the sieve space involved and letting the sieve order increase to infinity with the sample size then yields a uniformly consistent semi-nonparametric estimator of the actual value distribution. Also, we propose an integrated moment test for the validity of the first-price auction model, and an data-driven method for the choice of the sieve order.

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on social preferences under which a social planner will allocate more health care resources to populations at higher risk. Changes in risk are defined by the concept of stochastic dominance up to order n. The shape of the social utility function and an equity weighting function are used to model the inequality aversion of the social planner. We show that for higher order risk changes, the usual conditions on preferences such as prudence or relative risk aversion are not necessarily required to prioritise health care when there are different levels of uncertainty associated with otherwise similar patient groups.

Hosomatsu's lemma is firstly generalized in the sense that a necessary and sufficient condition for stability in a variety of discrete systems is derived for a much larger range of the parameter setting. By virtue of this key finding, asymptotical stability under one Cournot adjustment dynamic follows immediately, where all firms update their outputs simultaneously at each period. However, if adjustment-decisions are made sequentially so that the latter firms are able to recognize newly-adjusted outputs of the former in each period, it turns out that this revised dynamic is more stable. That is, under sequential decision the convergence to equilibrium behavior can be achieved more easily. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A more traditional approach to this problem is outlined before a social decision-making approach is developed, which demonstrates that social time preference for health is revealed through the budget allocations made by a socially legitimate higher authority. The relationship between the social time preference rate for health, the growth rate of the cost-effectiveness threshold and the rate at which the higher authority can borrow or invest is then examined. We establish that the social time preference rate for health is implied by the budget allocation and the health production functions in each period. As such, the social time preference rate for health depends not on the social time preference rate for consumption or growth in the consumption value of health but on growth in the cost-effectiveness threshold and the rate at which the higher authority can save or borrow between periods. The implications for discounting and the policies of bodies such as NICE are then discussed.

Data stem from the first three waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). With these informative data, non-parametric matching and instrumental variable (IV) methods are applied to identify causal effects. It is found that retirement significantly increases the risk of being diagnosed with a chronic condition. In particular, it raises the risk of a severe cardiovascular disease and cancer. This is also reflected in increased risk factors (e.g. BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure) and increased problems in physical activities. Furthermore, retirement worsens self-assessed health and an underlying health stock.

This may be, however, either unattainable physiologically or financially unviable for drug development. The objective of this study is to provide an empirical basis for this discussion by estimating the potential for price decreases to impact on the cost-effectiveness of new therapies in hypertension. Methods: Cost-effectiveness at launch was estimated for all antihypertensive drugs launched between 1998 and 2008 in the United Kingdom using hypothetical degrees of incremental clinical effectiveness within the methodologic framework applied by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were computed and compared with funding thresholds. In addition, the levels of incremental clinical effectiveness required to achieve specific cost-effectiveness thresholds at given prices were estimated. Results: Significant price decreases were observed for existing drugs. This was shown to markedly affect cost-effectiveness of technologies entering the market. The required incremental clinical effectiveness was in many cases greater than physiologically possible so, as a consequence, a number of products might not be available today if current methods of economic appraisal had been applied. Conclusions: We conclude that the definition of cost-effectiveness thresholds is fundamental in promoting efficient innovation. Our findings demonstrate that comparator price attrition has the potential to put pressure in the pharmaceutical research model and presents a challenge to new therapies being accepted for funding.","[Camejo, Rodrigo Refoios; McGrath, Clare] Pfizer Inc, HTA Policy Int Affairs, Surrey KT20 7NS, England; [Camejo, Rodrigo Refoios; Herings, Ron; Rutten, Frans] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Herings, Ron] PHARMO Inst Drug Outcomes Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Meerding, Willem-Jan] Interhealth, Dordrecht, Netherlands",Pfizer; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Camejo, RR (通讯作者)，Pfizer Inc, HTA Policy Int Affairs, IPC 4-1-06,Walton Oaks,Dorking Rd,Walton Hill, Surrey KT20 7NS, England.",rodrigo.refoioscamejo@pfizer.com,"Herings, Ron/AAE-4096-2021","Herings, Ron/0000-0002-2561-8734; Refoios Camejo, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5507-4857",PHARMO Institute,PHARMO Institute,Rodrigo Refoios Camejo and Clare McGrath are employees of Pfizer but ideas expressed in this article are entirely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of Pfizer.

Most of the existing studies use the Banzhaf index (for binary voting) or the Shapley-Shubik index (for distributive politics). We argue in favor of the nucleolus as a power measure in distributive situations and an alternative to the Shapley-Shubik index. We then calculate the nucleolus and compare the results of our calculations with the conventional measures. In the second part, we analyze the power of the European citizens as measured by the nucleolus under the egalitarian criterion proposed by Felsenthal and Machover (1998), and characterize the first best situation. Based on these results we propose a methodology for the design of the optimal (fair) decision rules. We perform the optimization exercise for the earlier stages of the EU within a restricted domain of voting rules, and conclude that Germany should receive more than the other three large countries under the optimal voting rule.

Relative efficiency of each scoring function was examined by using ratios of F statistics. Results: Mean scores for the overall cohort were lowest when using Kind and Macran's FACT UK societal algorithm (0.55, SD 0.09) and highest when using Dobrez et al.'s FACT US patient algorithm (0.83, SD 0.08). Mean difference scores associated with clinical severity, when extrapolated to quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), had a range of 0.18 QALYs gained using FACT (Kind and Macran) to 0.45 QALYs gained using the EQ-5D (Dolan). However, relative efficiencies suggested that FACT (Kind and Macran) scores may provide greater statistical power to detect significant differences based on clinical severity. Conclusions: We found important differences in utilities scores estimated by each algorithm, with FACT-based algorithms tending to underestimate the QALY benefit compared with algorithms based on the EQ-5D. These differences highlight some of the challenges in using disease-specific preference-based measures for decision making despite potentially more relevant disease-specific content.","[Pickard, A.

Our main finding is that bequests do not have substantial effects on health, although improvements in quality-of-life are possible. This absence occurs despite increases in out-of-pocket spending on healthcare and in the utilization of medical services, especially discretionary and non-lifesaving types such as dental care.

In this paper. I exploit variation in an individual's weight over time to determine the age when weight has the largest impact on labor market outcomes. For white men, controlling for weight at younger ages does not eliminate the effect of older adult weight on wage: being overweight as a young adult only adds an additional penalty to adult wages. However, for white women, what they weigh in their early twenties solely determines the existence of an adult wage penalty. The female early-twenties weight penalty has a persistent effect on wages, and differences in marital characteristics, occupation status, or education cannot explain it. It also is not a proxy for intergenerational unobservables. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We use representative data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), combined with five air pollution levels. These data were provided by the Federal Environment Agency and cover the years 2002-2007. Our work makes two important contributions. First, we use European data to replicate and extend an important US study by following the effects of pollution exposure and parental smoking on child health during the first four years of life. Second, we have health measures not only for infants but for toddlers as well. For infants, as well as for two- to three-year-olds, we are able to account for time-invariant and unobserved neighborhood and maternal characteristics. Our results suggest a significantly negative impact of some pollutants on infant health. High exposure to CO prior to birth causes, on average, a 289g lower birth weight. With respect to toddler health, we find that disorders and in particular those as bronchitis and respiratory illnesses are affected particularly by 03 levels. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate that the existence of a balanced growth path implies that it is unique or that there exist two balanced growth paths, depending on the structural parameters of the model. The balanced growth path associated with the higher growth rate is saddle point stable, whereas the path yielding the lower long-run growth rate is either stable or unstable. Further, we show that a Hopf bifurcation may arise, giving rise to persistent limit cycles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores three explanations for this: bias in OLS estimates, limited non-HIV life expectancy and limited knowledge. I find support for the first two. First, using a new instrumental variable strategy I find that OLS estimates of the relationship between risky sex and HIV are biased upwards, and IV estimates indicate reductions in risky behavior in response to the epidemic. Second, I find these reductions are larger for individuals who live in areas with higher life expectancy, suggesting high rates of non-HIV mortality suppress behavioral response; this is consistent with optimizing behavior. Using somewhat limited knowledge proxies, I find no evidence that areas with higher knowledge of the epidemic have greater behavior change. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We adopt a multivariate setting with credit default intensities driven by mutually exciting jump processes, to capture the salient features observed in the data, in particular, the clustering of high default probabilities both in time (over days) and in space (across countries). The feedback between jump events and the intensity of these jumps is the key element of the model. We derive closed-form formulae for CDS prices, and estimate the model by matching theoretical prices to their empirical counterparts. We find evidence of self-excitation and asymmetric cross-excitation. Using impulse-response analysis, we assess the impact of shocks and a potential policy intervention not just on a single country under scrutiny but also, through the effect on cross-excitation risk which generates systemic sovereign risk, on other interconnected countries.

The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) includes a 29-item short-form HRQOL measure, the PROMIS-29. Methods: To value PROMIS-29 responses on a quality-adjusted life year scale, we conducted a national survey (N = 7557) using quota sampling based on the US 2010 Census. Based on 541 paired comparisons with over 350 responses each, pair-specific probabilities were incorporated into a weighted least-squared estimator. Results: All losses in HRQOL influenced choice; however, respondents valued losses in physical function, anxiety, depression, sleep, and pain more than those in fatigue and social functioning. Conclusions: this article introduces a novel approach to valuing HRQOL for economic evaluations using paired comparisons and provides a tool to translate PROMIS-29 responses into quality-adjusted life-years.","[Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL USA; [Reeve, Bryce B.] Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Brown, Paul M.] Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA USA; [Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med Social Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Hays, Ron D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Hlth Serv Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hays, Ron D.] RAND Corp, Hlth Program, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Lipscomb, Joseph] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Policy Management, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Pickard, A.

Methods: A systematic search was conducted for previously published studies that reported preferences for convenience related aspects of health care delivery in a manner that was consistent with either cost-utility analysis or cost-benefit analysis. Data were analyzed in terms of the methodologies used, the aspects of convenience considered, and the values reported. Results: Literature searches generated 4715 records. Following a review of abstracts or full-text articles, 27 were selected for inclusion. Twenty-six studies reported some evidence of convenience related process utility, in the form of either a positive utility or a positive willingness to pay. The aspects of convenience valued most often were mode of administration (n = 11) and location of treatment (n = 6). The most common valuation methodology was a discrete-choice experiment containing a cost component (n = 15). Conclusions: A preference for convenience-related process utility exists, independent of health outcomes. Given the diverse methodologies used to calculate it, and the range of aspects being valued, however, it is difficult to assess how large such a preference might be, or how it may be effectively incorporated into an economic evaluation. Increased consistency in reporting these preferences is required to assess these issues more accurately.","[Higgins, A.; Meads, C.; Singh, J.; Longworth, L.] Brunel Univ London, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Higgins, A.; Barnett, J.; Singh, J.] Brunel Univ London, MATCH, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Barnett, J.] Univ Bath, Dept Psychol, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",Brunel University; Brunel University; University of Bath,"Longworth, L (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",louise.longworth@brunel.ac.uk,,"Meads, Catherine/0000-0002-2368-0665; Barnett, Julie/0000-0001-5740-0863; Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Multidisciplinary Assessment of Technology in Healthcare programme [EP/F063822/1, EP/G012393/1]; Health Economics Research Group within Brunel University",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Multidisciplinary Assessment of Technology in Healthcare programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Health Economics Research Group within Brunel University,We acknowledge support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Multidisciplinary Assessment of Technology in Healthcare programme (EP/F063822/1 and EP/G012393/1) and the Health Economics Research Group within Brunel University.

We apply the proposed methodology to data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which have the following features: (i) the observed bivariate outcomes are a mixture of zeros and continuously measured positives; (ii) both the zero and positive outcomes show state dependence and inter-temporal interdependence; and (iii) the zeros and the positives display contemporaneous association. The point mass at zero is accommodated using a hurdle or a two-part approach. The copula-based approach to generating joint distributions is appealing because the contemporaneous association involves asymmetric dependence. The paper studies samples categorized by four health conditions: arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, and mental illness. There is evidence of greater than dollar-for-dollar cost-offsets of expenditures on prescribed drugs for relatively low levels of spending on drugs and less than dollar-for-dollar cost-offsets at higher levels of drug expenditures.

Recently, an increasing interest in the state-contingent approach has emerged in the literature although such interest has not yet been accompanied by an increase of empirical applications. This is largely due to the fact that empirical models with state-contingent production frontiers are usually ill-posed. In this work, a discussion on the role of the generalized cross-entropy estimator within the state-contingent production framework is presented. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the example provided in this work is the first real-world empirical application on technical efficiency analysis with the state-contingent approach using the generalized cross-entropy estimator.

This paper examines the inference question on the proportions (mixing probability) in a simple mixture model in the presence of nuisance parameters when sample size is large. It is well known that likelihood inference in mixture models is complicated due to (1) lack of point identification, and (2) parameters (for example, mixing probabilities) whose true value may lie on the boundary of the parameter space. These issues cause the profiled likelihood ratio (PLR) statistic to admit asymptotic limits that differ discontinuously depending on how the true density of the data approaches the regions of singularities where there is lack of point identification. This lack of uniformity in the asymptotic distribution suggests that confidence intervals based on pointwise asymptotic approximations might lead to faulty inferences. This paper examines this problem in details in a finite mixture model and provides possible fixes based on the parametric bootstrap. We examine the performance of this parametric bootstrap in Monte Carlo experiments and apply it to data from Beauty Contest experiments. We also examine small sample inferences and projection methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our main identification strategy exploits plausible exogenous assignment of children to hospitals with specialist physicians, while our analysis of health outcomes also allows for an individual level panel data strategy. We find that the behavior of specialist physicians varies considerably across hospitals and that the prescribing behavior does affect the probability that a given child is treated. Results show that children diagnosed with ADHD in pharmacological treatment have fewer hospital contacts if treated and that treatment to some extent protects against criminal behavior.

Such an objective is difficult due to contaminated data with microstructure noises, asynchronous trading records, and increasing data dimensionality. In this paper, we study a quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) approach for estimating an ICM from high frequency financial data. We explore a novel multivariate moving average time series device that is convenient for evaluating the estimator both theoretically for its asymptotic properties and numerically for its practical implementations. We demonstrate that the QML estimator is consistent to the ICM, and is asymptotically normally distributed. Efficiency gain of the QML approach is theoretically quantified, and numerically demonstrated via extensive simulation studies. An application of the QML approach is illustrated through analyzing a high frequency financial trading data set. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Transfers from adult children could partly insure elderly parents against low income and high medical expenditure. There are two main motives for transfers in the literature, namely altruism and exchange. By using data from a new household survey of people aged 45 years and above in China, we estimate the transfer derivatives with the adjustment of medical expenditure in elderly parents' income. We find a large negative impact of adjusted income on transfers at the lower end of income distribution, which is consistent with the altruistic motive. Evidence on the exchange motive is found only for sons, but not for daughters. In addition, there is evidence on the 'exchange-for-service' motive, which interprets transfer as a payment to parents' family services, such as taking care of grandchildren.

The paper contributes to the literature in two ways: it tackles the problems of endogeneity and reverse causation between social capital and health by estimating a simultaneous equation model, and it explicitly accounts for mis-reporting in self-reported trust. The inter-relationship is tested using data from the first four waves of the European Social Survey for 25 European countries, supplemented by regional data from Eurostat. Our estimates show that a causal and positive relationship between self-perceived health and social capital does exist and that it acts in both directions. In addition, the magnitude of the structural coefficients suggests that individual social capital is a strong determinant of health, whereas community level social capital plays a considerably smaller role in determining health.

We consider voting protocols given by two-parameter scoring rules, as introduced by Myerson (2002). For these voting rules, we show that all symmetric Bayes Nash equilibria are sincere, and have a very specific form. These equilibria are unique for a wide range of model parameters, and we can therefore compare the equilibrium performance of different rules. Computational results regarding the effectiveness of different scoring rules (where effectiveness is captured by a modification of the effectiveness measure proposed in Weber, 1978) suggest that those which most effectively represent voters' preferences allow for the expression of preference intensity, in contrast to more commonly used rules such as the plurality rule, and the Borda Count. While approval voting allows for the expression of preference intensity, it does not maximize effectiveness as it fails to unambiguously convey voters' ordinal preference rankings.

The perfectly informed sender can fully certify any private information that is drawn from a continuum set, and the receiver has binary actions. We focus on the situation where both full information disclosure and full information suppression are impossible. We characterize the set of pure strategy equilibria in terms of informativeness measured by the receiver's ex ante expected utility in this environment; there exist continuum equilibria. The set is characterized by the most and the least informative equilibria, and then any value between the bounds can be supported in equilibrium with transparent construction of the associated equilibrium.

Oral health conditions are preventable, but less than half of the US population uses dental services annually. We seek to examine the extent to which limited dental coverage and high out-of-pocket costs reduce dental service use by the nonelderly privately insured and uninsured. Using data from the 2001-2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and an American Dental Association survey of dental procedure prices, we jointly estimate the probability of using preventive and both basic and major restorative services through a correlated random effects specification that controls for endogeneity. We found that dental coverage increased the probability of preventive care use by 19% and the use of restorative services 11% to 16%. Both conditional and unconditional on dental coverage, the use of dental services was not sensitive to out-of-pocket costs. We conclude that dental coverage is an important determinant of preventive dental service use, but other nonprice factors related to consumer preferences, especially education, are equal if not stronger determinants.

Specifically, I analyse the introduction of a remuneration cap (so called practice budgets) for physicians who treat publicly insured patients in 1997. I find evidence that the reform of 1997, did not change the extensive margin of doctor visits but strongly affected the intensive margin. The conditional number of doctor visits among publicly insured decreased while it increased among privately insured. This can be seen as evidence that physicians respond to the change in incentives induced by the reform by altering their patient mix.

A common view is that the threshold should represent the (consumption) value a society attaches to a QALY. So far, individual valuations of personal health gains have mainly been studied rather than potentially relevant social values. In this study, we present the first direct empirical estimates of the willingness to pay for a QALY from a societal perspective. We used the contingent valuation approach, valuing QALYs under uncertainty and correcting for probability weighting. The estimates obtained in a representative sample of the Dutch population (n = 1004) range from euro52,000 to euro83,000, depending on the specification of the societal perspective. The scale sensitivity was weak, however.

Methods: We estimated the 5-year accumulated risk of MI and stroke for 2899 screen-detected people with type 2 diabetes by using the UKPDS outcomes model (version 1.3). We compared the predicted and actual risks by country and by intervention group (routine care; intensive multifactorial treatment). We assessed discrimination and goodness of fit by using area under receiver operating characteristic curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square test. Multiple imputations were used to overcome missing data Results: The UKPDS outcomes model overestimated the risk of MI and stroke. Mean predicted/actual ratios of 5-year accumulated risk were 2.31 for MI in the routine care group and 3.97 in the intensive multifactorial treatment group and 1.59 and 1.48 for stroke, respectively. The differences in absolute risk between the intervention groups were underestimated for MI (observed vs. predicted: 0.0127 vs. 0.0009) and slightly overestimated for stroke (-0.0013 vs. -0.0004). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.79) for MI and 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.64-0.77) for stroke. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistic was nonsignificant in all groups. The model performed better in absolute risk prediction in Denmark and the United Kingdom than in the Netherlands. Conclusions: The UKPDS outcomes model has moderate discriminatory ability in the ADDITION-Europe trial cohort but overestimated absolute risk. The model may need updating for cardiovascular disease risk prediction in contemporary diabetes populations where patients may be diagnosed earlier in the disease trajectory and in whom cardiovascular risk is therefore lower.","[Tao, Libo; Griffin, Simon J.; Simmons, Rebecca K.] Univ Cambridge, MRC Epidemiol Unit, Cambridge, England; [Wilson, Edward C.

We re-examine the income gradient in child general health and its evolution with child age in this country, using a very large sample of British children. We find that there is no correlation between income and child general health at ages 0-1, that the gradient emerges around age 2 and is constant from age 2 to age 17. In addition, we show that the gradient remains large and significant when we reduce the endogeneity of income. Furthermore, our results indicate that the gradient in general health reflects a greater prevalence of chronic conditions among low-income children and a greater severity of these conditions. Taken together, these findings suggest that income does matter for child health in the UK and may play a role in the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

There are many empirical evidences supporting that the data generating process governing dynamics of many economics variables might vary over time because of economic climate changes or time effects. One possible way to explain the time-dependent dynamics of state variables is to model the drift or volatility terms as functions of time t as well as state variables. A way to find closed-form likelihood expansion for a multivariate time-homogeneous diffusion has been developed by Ait-Sahalia (2008). This research is built on his work and extends his results to time-inhomogeneous cases. We conduct Monte Carlo simulation studies to examine performance of the approximate transition density function when it is used to obtain ML estimates. The results reveal that our method yields a very accurate approximate likelihood function, which can be a good candidate when the true likelihood function is unavailable as is often the case.

One of these strategies, termed attribute non-attendance (ANA), consists in ignoring one or more attributes. Using data from a DCE administered to healthcare providers in Ghana to evaluate their potential resistance to changes in clinical guidelines, this study illustrates how latent class models can be used in a step-wise approach to account for all possible ANA strategies used by respondents and explore the consequences of such behaviours. Results show that less than 3% of respondents considered all attributes when choosing between the two hypothetical scenarios proposed, with a majority looking at only one or two attributes. Accounting for ANA strategies improved the goodness-of-fit of the model and affected the magnitude of some of the coefficient and willingness-to-pay estimates. However, there was no difference in the predicted probabilities of the model taking into account ANA and the standard approach. Although the latter result is reassuring about the ability of DCEs to produce unbiased policy guidance, it should be confirmed by other studies.

We derive in a uniform way a family of measures of collective and individual decisiveness in simple games, and show that, as for the Shapley-Shubik index, they extend naturally to measures for TU-games. These individual measures, which we call weighted semivalues, form a class whose intersection with that of the class of weak semivalues yields the class of all semivalues. We single out the simplest measure in this family for more investigation, as it is new to the literature as far as we know. Although it is very different from the Shapley value, it is closely related in several ways, and is the natural analogue of the Shapley value under a nonstandard, but natural, definition of simple game. We illustrate this new measure by calculating its values on some standard examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although some studies have established the clinical effectiveness of heavy menstrual bleeding treatments, few have evaluated their cost-effectiveness. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) compared with other therapies for idiopathic heavy menstrual bleeding. Methods: We developed a model comparing the clinical and economic outcomes (from a US payer perspective) of three broad initial treatment strategies over 5 years: LNG-IUS, oral agents, or surgery. Up to three nonsurgical treatment lines, followed by up to two surgical lines, were allowed; unintended pregnancy was possible, and women could discontinue any time during nonsurgical treatments. Menstrual blood loss of 80 ml or more per cycle determined treatment failure. Results: Initiating treatment with LNG-IUS resulted in the fewest hysterectomies (6 per 1000 women), the most quality-adjusted life-years (3.78), and the lowest costs ($1137) among all the nonsurgical strategies. Initiating treatment with LNG-IUS was also less costly than surgery, resulted in fewer hysterectomies (vs. 9 per 1000 for ablation) but was associated with fewer quality-adjusted life-years gained per patient (vs. 3.80 and 3.88 for ablation and hysterectomy, respectively). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. Conclusions: LNG-IUS resulted in the lowest treatment costs and the fewest number of hysterectomies performed over 5 years compared with all other initial strategies and resulted in the most quality-adjusted life-years gained among nonsurgical options. Initial treatment with LNG-IUS is the least costly and most effective option for women desiring to preserve their fertility.","[Ganz, Michael L.; Shah, Dhvani; Gidwani, Risha] United BioSource Corp, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Su, Wenqing] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD USA; [Filonenko, Anna] Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany; [Pocoski, Jennifer; Law, Amy] Bayer HealthCare, Wayne, NJ USA",United Biosource Corporation; United Biosource Corporation; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals,"Ganz, ML (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, 430 Bedford St, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",michael.ganz@unitedbiosource.com,,"Ganz, Michael/0000-0002-9702-2999; Filonenko, Anna/0000-0003-4553-0534",Bayer HealthCare,Bayer HealthCare(Bayer AGBayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals),This work was sponsored by Bayer HealthCare.,,26,10,11,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2013,16,2.0,,,,,325,333,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.11.011,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,144AC,23538185.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318910400013,0

Although studies have shown that modifying CVD risk factors at the patient level improves patient prognosis, the effect of community-wide interventions at the population level has been uncertain. Objective: To evaluate the resource use and cost consequences of a community-wide Cardiovascular Health Awareness Program (CHAP). Methods: Thirty-nine medium-sized communities in Ontario, Canada, participated in a community cluster randomized controlled trial stratified by population size and geographic location. All community-dwelling elderly residents (>65 years) in each community were included. Family physicians, pharmacists, community nurses, local organizations, and volunteers in the intervention communities implemented the program. Rates and costs of CVD hospitalizations, all hospitalizations, emergency department visits, physician visits, and prescription medication use in the year before and after the intervention were compared for the 19 control and 20 CHAP communities by using province-wide linked administrative databases. The cost of implementing and administrating CHAP in each community was combined with total community health care cost to determine the net cost effect. Results: CHAP was associated with a reduction in CVD hospitalization costs. There were no differences in utilization rates or costs for overall hospitalizations, in visits to emergency rooms, physicians, or specialists, or in the use of prescription medications. Results were robust over a range of cost assumptions. Conclusions: A community-wide CVD awareness program can be implemented and can reduce CVD-related hospitalization costs at the level of the community without a corresponding increase in overall health care costs.","[Goeree, Ron; von Keyserlingk, Camilla; Burke, Natasha; He, Jing] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Programs Assessment Technol, Hlth Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8P 1H1, Canada; [Goeree, Ron; von Keyserlingk, Camilla; Burke, Natasha; He, Jing; Chambers, Larry; Dolovich, Lisa] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Goeree, Ron; Dolovich, Lisa; Paterson, J.

Facility-specific costs of expanded HIV testing and care for newly identified patients, however, are less well defined. To aid in resource allocation decisions, we developed a spreadsheet-based budget-impact tool populated with estimates of facility-specific HIV testing and care costs incurred with an expanded testing program. Methods: We modeled intervention effects on quarterly costs of antiretroviral therapy (ART), outpatient resource utilization, and staff expenditures in the Department of Veterans Affairs over a 2-year period of increasing HIV testing rates. We used HIV prevalence estimates, screening rates, counseling, positive tests, Veterans Affairs treatment, and published sources as inputs. We evaluated a single-facility cohort of 20,000 patients and at baseline assumed a serodiagnostic rate of 0.45%. Results: Expanding testing from 2% to 15% annually identified 21 additional HIV-positive patients over 2 years at a cost of approximately $290,000, more than 60% of which was due to providing ART to newly diagnosed patients. While quarterly testing costs decreased longitudinally as fewer persons required testing, quarterly ART costs increased from $10,000 to more than $60,000 over 2 years as more infected patients were identified and started on ART. In sensitivity analyses, serodiagnostic and annual HIV testing rates had the greatest cost impact. Conclusions: Expanded HIV testing costs are greatest during initial implementation and predominantly due to ART for new patients. Cost determinations of expanded HIV testing provide an important tool for managers charged with allocating resources within integrated systems providing both HIV testing and care.","[Anaya, Henry D.; Asch, Steven M.; Goetz, Matthew Bidwell] VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Syst, Ctr Study Healthcare Provider Behav, VA Greater Los Angeles Hlth Serv, Res & Dev Ctr Excellence, Los Angeles, CA 90073 USA; [Anaya, Henry D.; Asch, Steven M.; Goetz, Matthew Bidwell] Vet Affairs Qual Enhancement Res Initiat HIV Hepa, Los Angeles, CA 90073 USA; [Anaya, Henry D.; Asch, Steven M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Hlth Serv Res GIM & HSR, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Chan, Kee] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Sargent Coll Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Chan, Kee] Edith Nourse Rogers Mem Vet Hosp, Ctr Hlth Qual Outcomes & Econ Res, Bedford, MA USA; [Karmarkar, Uday] UCLA Anderson Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Asch, Steven M.] RAND Hlth, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Goetz, Matthew Bidwell] VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Syst, Dept Med, Sect Infect Dis, Los Angeles, CA 90073 USA",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; Boston University; RAND Corporation; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System,"Anaya, HD (通讯作者)，VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Syst, Ctr Study Healthcare Provider Behav, VA Greater Los Angeles Hlth Serv, Res & Dev Ctr Excellence, 11301 Wilshire Blvd,111G, Los Angeles, CA 90073 USA.",hemy.anaya@va.gov,"Goetz, Matthew Bidwell/GPX-4090-2022","Goetz, Matthew/0000-0003-4542-992X",,,,,17,7,8,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1022,1028,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.08.2205,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244803.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300005,0

I provide characterization of equilibrium bidding strategies in a model with restricted strategy sets and I show that these equilibria converge to an equilibrium of the model with unrestricted strategy sets as the restrictions are relaxed. However, not all equilibria in the unrestricted game can be achieved as limits of the equilibria of the restricted games. I demonstrate that the equilibrium conditions require that the Euler condition characterizing equilibrium in continuously differentiable strategies in the unrestricted model holds on average over the intervals defined by the length of each (price) step of the restricted strategy, where the average is taken with respect to the endogenous distribution of the market clearing price. The characterization from the restricted model also allows for a natural interpretation of the involved trade-offs. Adapting the argument of Chao and Wilson (1987) I also prove that the foregone surplus of a bidder from using K steps rather than a continuous bid is proportional to 1/k(2). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here we estimate the TTD model using macro-level data from the Netherlands consisting of mortality rates and age- and gender-specific per capita health expenditures for the years 1981-2007. Forecasts for the years 2008-2020 of this macro-level TTD model were compared to forecasts that excluded TTD. Results revealed that the effect of TTD on HCE in our macro model was similar to those found in micro-econometric studies. As the inclusion of TTD pushed growth rate estimates from unidentified causes upwards, however, the two models' forecasts of HCE for the 2008-2020 were similar. We argue that including TTD, if modeled correctly, does not lower forecasts of HCE. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In order to improve the small sample properties of standard instrumental variable (IV) estimators, we propose three modified IV estimators based on three different ways of inverting the covariance matrix of the instruments. These inverses involve a regularization or smoothing parameter. It should be stressed that no restriction on the number of instruments is needed and that all the instruments are used in the estimation. We show that the three estimators are asymptotically normal and attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Higher-order analysis of the MSE reveals that the bias of the modified estimators does not depend on the number of instruments. Finally, we suggest a data-driven method for selecting the regularization parameter. Interestingly, our regularization techniques lead to a consistent nonparametric estimation of the optimal instrument. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to a standard regression discontinuity design, identification exploits multiple thresholds that arise from variation across states in income eligibility rules. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its Child Development Study supplement, I find that Medicaid eligibility increases take up by 1013 percentage points on average, rising to 2429 percentage points at lower income eligibility thresholds. There are significant crowding out effects of the same magnitude as those on take up rates. Medicaid eligibility increases the use of preventive health care by 1114 percentage points but only at low income thresholds. Finally, I find that Medicaid eligibility has no significant effects on health outcomes in the short and medium run.

Perceived health risk, however, does not affect the smoking status of young people who hold the opposite beliefs. These results are consistent with predictions of rational addiction models and suggest that young people, who view smoking as more addictive and health effects as more immediate, may have greater incentive to consider long-term health effects in their decision to smoke.

We propose a numerical method which determines uniquely a distribution of seats in the European Parliament which fulfil the requirements of degressive proportionality. More generally, let l(i) 1 <= i <= n, be any non-increasing sequence of real positive numbers. We say that a sequence of positive integers m(i) is degressively proportional with respect to the sequence l(i), if m(i) and l(i)/m(i). are non-increasing sequences. For fixed positive integer M we determine inductively a sequence M-i degressively proportional with respect to l(i), which is smaller, then any other such sequence with the first element >= M. Moreover, for every integer Sigma(n)(i=1) M-i <= Y <= nM we determine a degressively proportional sequence m(i) with respect to Ii, which has the first element m(i) = M and satisfies inequalities Y - (n - 2) Sigma(n)(i=1) m(i) <= Y.

We propose a jackknife model averaging (JMA) estimator which selects the weights by minimizing a cross-validation criterion. This criterion is quadratic in the weights, so computation is a simple application of quadratic programming. We show that our estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest possible expected squared error. Monte Carlo simulations and an illustrative application show that JMA can achieve significant efficiency gains over existing model selection and averaging methods in the presence of heteroskedasticity.

Collective decisions are taken by their representatives, one from each constituency, according to a weighted voting rule. It is assumed that each representative's ideal point perfectly matches that of the respective constituency median and that top-tier decisions are in the voting game's core. The resulting representative-democratic voting outcomes generally differ from those of a direct-democratic, single-tier system. The expected discrepancy varies with the voting weight allocation. It is minimized by weights proportional to constituency population sizes only if citizens differ sufficiently more between than within constituencies. Weights proportional to the square root of population sizes perform better if all citizens have independent and identically distributed ideal points. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper evaluates the Cambridge Compromise's formula in relation to compromises between big and small states that have characterised the EU since its foundation. It also evaluates the formula by the degree to which the Compromise departs from normative standards of equality among citizens and its distribution of seats creates more anxiety about the risks of losses as against hypothetical gains. These political criteria explain the objections to the Cambridge Compromise. However, the pressure to change the allocation of seats is continuing with EU enlargement and the arbitrary ceiling of 751 seats imposed by the Lisbon Treaty. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper gives insights into the complex balance between coalition structures, resource states or dynamics and the agent heterogeneity necessary to avoid bio-economic collapses. A model bringing together coalition games and a viability approach is proposed to focus on the compatibility between bio-economic constraints and exploited common stock dynamics.

The only decomposable indices are strictly monotonic transformations of the weighted average of frequencies in categories. Among the indices proposed in the literature only the absolute value index (Abul Naga and Yalcin, 2008: Apouey, 2007) is decomposable.

Methods: Antibiotic use in acute diarrhea in the community (December 2007-November 2008) was surveyed by using patients' exit interviews at public and private facilities from four residential localities. Data were collected from 10 public sector facilities and 20 private clinics over 1 year. The percentage of patients receiving antibiotics and the prescribing pattern of antibiotics were analyzed by using the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification and the defined daily dose. Results: At public facilities 43% (171 of 398) and at private facilities 69% (76 of 110) of the patients with acute diarrhea were prescribed at least one antibiotic. Diarrhea increased during peak humid summer months, but doctors were fairly consistent in their antibiotic prescribing throughout the year. The main antibiotic class that was prescribed in both public and private sector facilities was fluoroquinolones, J01MA (91.5% and 96%, respectively). Pediatricians working in the private sector prescribed antibiotics to 51.5% (17 of 33) of children with diarrhea, whereas pediatricians working in the public sector prescribed antibiotics to 23% of children with acute diarrhea. At public facilities, the most commonly prescribed fluoroquinolone was norfloxacin, followed by ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At private clinics, it was ofloxacin followed by ciprofloxacin. Conclusions: This study clearly showed the irrational use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children and adults that warrants interventional strategies.","[Kotwani, Anita] Univ Delhi, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Inst, Dept Pharmacol, Delhi 110007, India; [Chaudhury, Ranjit Roy] Apollo Hosp Educ & Res Fdn, New Delhi, India; [Holloway, Kathleen] World Hlth Org, Reg Off SE Asia, New Delhi, India",University of Delhi; World Health Organization,"Kotwani, A (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Inst, Dept Pharmacol, Delhi 110007, India.",anitakotwani@gmail.com,"Kotwani, Anita/ABF-6201-2021","Kotwani, Anita/0000-0003-3182-5155",WHO,WHO(World Health Organization),"This study was funded by WHO.

Methods: By using reported data on the fraction of patients presenting with flu-related symptoms, we developed a transformation that allowed estimation of the state-specific temporal flu wave curve, representing the number of new infections during each week. We also utilized data describing the weekly numbers of vaccine doses delivered and administered. By using a simple difference equations model of flu progression, we developed two influenza wave curves: first, an observable curve that included the beneficial effects of vaccinations, and second, an unobservable curve that depicted how the flu would have progressed with no vaccine administered. We fit the observable curve to match the estimated epidemic curve and early exponential growth associated with R-0, the reproductive number. By comparing the number of infections in each scenario, we estimated the infections averted by the administration of vaccine. Results: Southern states experienced peak infection several weeks before northern states, and most of the vaccine was delivered well after the peak of the southern flu wave. Our models suggest that the vaccine had minimal ameliorative impact in the southern states and measurable positive impact in the northern states. Vaccine delivery after peak also results in a smaller fraction of the population's seeking the vaccine. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention policy of allocating flu vaccine over time in direct proportion to states' populations may not be best in terms of averting nationally the maximum possible number of infections.","[Larson, Richard C.] MIT, CESF, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Larson, Richard C.] MIT, ESD, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Teytelman, Anna] MIT, ORC, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Larson, RC (通讯作者)，MIT, CESF, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Bldg E40-233, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rclarson@mit.edu,,,Sloan Foundation of New York; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [1 PO1 TP000307-01]; Harvard School of Public Health Center for Public Health Preparedness (HSPHCPHP); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Center for Engineering Systems Fundamentals (CESF),Sloan Foundation of New York(Alfred P.

Methods: A face-to-face interview survey was administered to patients with RA recruited at the Rheumatology Clinic of Seoul National University Hospital. Direct costs (medical costs [treatment, drug, private physiotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine, other alternative medicine], nonmedical costs [travel, dietary supplements, auxiliary device, home assistance]), indirect costs (productivity loss due to job loss and sick leave), and deterioration in the HRQOL of patients with RA were measured. Factors associated with the COI and the HRQOL were analyzed by using multiple regression and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 196 patients were enrolled for this study. As RA functional severity worsened, the total costs increased accordingly (class I: 4,230,204 Korean won, class II: 7,250,674 Korean won, class III: 8,046,434 Korean won, class IV: 8,206,215 Korean won). Direct costs also increased with the severity of the functional status, with a sharp decrease in class IV. The average HRQOL score was 0.49, showing an evident impact of RA severity (class I: 0.67, class II: 0.50, class III: 0.29, class IV: 0.23). Functional class and comorbidity were significant determinants of the COI and the HRQOL. Conclusion: Functional severity was a major factor associated with higher COI and lower HRQOL scores. Therefore, preventing the aggravation of functional severity is crucial for decreasing the COI and improving the HRQOL of patients with RA.","[Lee, Tae-Jin; Park, Bo Hyun; Son, Hye Kyung] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea; [Song, Ran; Shin, Ki Chul; Lee, Eun Bong; Song, Yeong-Wook] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Rheumatol, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Song, Yeong-Wook] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, WCU Dept Mol Med & Biopharmaceut Sci, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, TJ (通讯作者)，599 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",tjlee@snu.ac.kr; ysong@snu.ac.kr,"Song, Yeong-Wook/J-2765-2012; Lee, Eun Bong/J-2780-2012","Lee, Eun Bong/0000-0003-0703-1208","Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Korea; Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea [A102065]","Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Korea(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea(Ministry of Health & Welfare (MOHW), Republic of Korea)","These findings are the result of work supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Korea and partly supported by a grant of the Korea Healthcare Technology R&D Project, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea (A102065).",,26,16,18,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S43,S49,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.020,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265066.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000008,0

This is because, in common with the single-auction case, last minute bidding (sniping) is a best response to naive behaviour. However, a modification to the myopic strategy in which all bidders submit an additional bid in the closing stages of the auction - a practice I call 'defensive sniping' - is shown to yield an efficient, belief-free equilibrium of such environments. This equilibrium is essentially unique within the class of belief-free, efficient equilibria. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Over the same period, funding for tobacco control activities significantly increased, resulting in the implementation of a large variety of national and regional interventions. In this paper, I exploit variation over time and across cantons of tobacco control expenditures to examine the impact of these policies on smoking decisions. I use retrospective smoking information from the Swiss Health Survey (2007) and find that tobacco control expenditures decreased the probability of smoking initiation among adolescents and young adults and increased cessation rates in the general population of smokers. I estimate that if funding had been kept at the 1997 level, there would have been 107,000 additional smokers in 2007.

We provide asset-pricing counterparts to impulse response functions and the resulting dynamic value decompositions (DVDs). These methods quantify the exposures of macroeconomic cash flows to shocks over alternative investment horizons and the corresponding prices or investors' compensations. We extend the continuous-time methods developed in Hansen and Scheinkman (2012) and Borovicka et al. (2011) by constructing discrete-time, state-dependent, shock-exposure and shock-price elasticities as functions of the investment horizon. Our methods are applicable to economic models that are nonlinear, including models with stochastic volatility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The default indicator is replaced by an appropriate prediction and the prediction error, that is the default-event surprise, is neglected. Our paper develops an approach to get closed-form expressions for the prices of credit derivatives written on multiple names without neglecting default-event surprises. This approach differs from the standard one, since the default counts necessarily cause the factor process under the risk-neutral probability, even if this is not the case under the historical probability. This implies that the standard exponential pricing formula of default does not apply. Using the US bond data, we show that allowing for the pricing of default events has important implications in terms of both data-fitting and model-implied physical probabilities of default. In particular, it may provide a solution to the credit spread puzzle. Besides, we show how our approach can be used to account for the propagation of defaults on the prices of credit derivatives.

We prove that (i) the marginal benefit of adding one more variety is diminishing in n; (ii) the loss from restricting the number of varieties is of order no more than 1/n(2); (iii) the marginal benefit of adding one more variety is of order no more than 1/n(3); and (iv) offering only two varieties can lead to more than two-thirds of the potential profit from the second best offering. Our analysis suggests that the monopolist would probably offer only a small number of varieties in the menu. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This result does not hold in the presence of large common breaks in the factor loadings, however. In this case, information criteria overestimate the number of breaks. Additionally, estimated factors are no longer consistent estimators of true factors. Hence, various recent research papers in the diffusion index literature focus on testing the constancy of factor loadings. However, forecast failure of factor augmented models can be due to either factor loading instability, regression coefficient instability, or both. To address this issue, we develop a test for the joint hypothesis of structural stability of both factor loadings and factor augmented forecasting model regression coefficients. Our proposed test statistic has a chi-squared limiting distribution, and we are able to establish the first order validity of (block) bootstrap critical values. Empirical evidence is also presented for 11 US macroeconomic indicators. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We derive our results under the assumption that root T/N -> c, where 0 <= c < infinity (N and T are the cross-sectional and the time series dimensions, respectively), thus allowing for the possibility that the factor estimation error enters the limiting distribution of the OLS estimator as an asymptotic bias term (as was recently discussed by Ludvigson and Ng (2011)). We consider general residual-based bootstrap methods and provide a set of high-level conditions on the bootstrap residuals and on the idiosyncratic errors such that the bootstrap distribution of a rotated OLS estimator is consistent. We subsequently verify these conditions for a simple wild bootstrap residual-based procedure. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This analysis of the Dosing Observational Study in Hemophilia examined the impact of acute bleeding episodes on work, school, and family activities. Methods: Patients and caregivers participated in a diary study for 90 or more days or until patients experienced four bleeding episodes. All bleed treatments, interference with daily activities, and quality-of-life assessments were captured in daily records. Patients and caregivers reported planned workdays or school days eligible to be lost so as to differentiate from days lost because of disability or nonworking status, weekends, and vacations. Results: Diaries were completed for 39 patients (18 adults and 21 children). Bleeding episodes that continued for 3 or more days (16.4%) accounted for most of the major changes to family plans. for the 38 patients with bleeding episodes, 47% of 491 bleed days fell on planned workdays or school days; the remainder fell on weekends, holidays, or non-workdays or non-school days and therefore did not count as lost days. Patients reported a loss of productivity on a greater percentage of eligible bleed days than did caregivers (3.9% vs. 0.8%, respectively). Patients and caregivers reported 13.5%/9.3% fully missed and 3.5%/7.6% partially missed days. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that in hemophilia with inhibitors, bleeding episodes interfere with the daily activities of patients and their caregivers. Furthermore, documenting only lost days underestimated the impact of bleeding episodes because of the high percentage of days without planned work or school.","[Recht, Michael] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Hemophilia Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Neufeld, Ellis J.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA USA; [Sharma, Vivek R.] Univ Louisville, James Graham Brown Canc Ctr, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Salem, Caitlyn T.] Pharmerit North Amer, Bethesda, MD USA; [Pickard, A.

The report first addresses the factors that should be considered when selecting a mode or modes of PRO data collection in a clinical trial, which is often when mixing is first considered. Next, a summary of how to faithfully migrate instruments is presented followed by a section on qualitative and quantitative study designs used to evaluate measurement equivalence of the new and original modes of data collection. Finally, the report discusses a number of issues that must be taken into account when mixing modes is deemed necessary or unavoidable within or between trials, including considerations of the risk of mixing at different levels within a clinical trial program and mixing between different types of platforms. In the absence of documented evidence of measurement equivalence, it is strongly recommended that a quantitative equivalence study be conducted before mixing modes in a trial to ensure that sufficient equivalence can be demonstrated to have confidence in pooling PRO data collected by the different modes. However, we also strongly discourage the mixing of paper and electronic field-based instruments and suggest that mixing of electronic modes be considered for clinical trials and only after equivalence has been established. If proceeding with mixing modes, it is important to implement data collection carefully in the trial itself in a planned manner at the country level or higher and minimize ad hoc mixing by sites or individual subjects. Finally, when mixing occurs, it must be addressed in the statistical analysis plan for the trial and the ability to pool the data must be evaluated to then evaluate treatment effects with mixed modes data. A successful mixed modes trial requires a faithful migration, measurement equivalence established between modes, and carefully planned implementation to minimize the risk of increased measurement error impacting the power of the trial to detect a treatment effect.","[Eremenco, Sonya; Coyne, Karin] Evidera Inc, Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Coons, Stephen Joel] Crit Path Inst, Patient Reported Outcome Consortium, Tucson, AZ USA; [Paty, Jean] Quintiles, Endpoint Strategy, Hawthorne, NY USA; [Bennett, Antonia V.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC USA",Evidera; IQVIA; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Eremenco, S (通讯作者)，Evidera Inc, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",sonya.eremenco@evidera.com,"Wee, Hwee Lin/D-4126-2012","Wee, Hwee Lin/0000-0002-7150-1801; Zah, Vladimir/0000-0003-1368-4491",,,,,36,46,48,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2014,17,5.0,,,,,501,516,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.06.005,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1PE,25128043.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341084700004,0

We developed a decision-modeling framework to evaluate its cost-effectiveness to guide the use of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART). Methods: We populated the model using patient-level data and external sources. Patients were classified as intermediate risk or high risk on the basis of Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment-Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) nomogram and then stratified by the ProsVue slope (<= 2 pg/mL/mo; >2 pg/mL/mo) and receipt of ART. In sensitivity analyses, we varied the effect of the ProsVue slope on the use of ART and other model parameters. Results: The cost-effectiveness of the ProsVue-guided strategy varied widely because of small differences in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at 10 years. In the intermediate risk group, when the use of ART decreased from 20% (standard care) to 7.5% among patients with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $25,160/QALY. In the high-risk group, the use of ART would have to den-ease from 40% (standard care) to 11.5% among those with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less to obtain a ratio of $50,000/QALY. The cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to varying benefits of salvage therapy, quality of life, and costs of ART and ProsVue testing. Conclusions: The effect of the ProsVue system on costs will be dependent on the extent to which ART decreases among men identified as having a low risk of recurrence. Its effect on QALYs will remain conditional on uncertain clinical and quality-of-life benefits associated with ART.","[Reed, Shelby D.; Scales, Charles D., Jr.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Reed, Shelby D.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Stewart, Suzanne Biehn; Scales, Charles D., Jr.; Moul, Judd W.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Durham, NC USA",Duke University; Duke University; Duke University,"Reed, SD (通讯作者)，Duke Clin Res Inst, POB 17969, Durham, NC 27715 USA.",shelby.reed@duke.edu,,"Scales, Charles/0000-0002-7887-0204",,,,,36,9,9,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2014,17,5.0,,,,,545,554,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.04.010,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1PE,25128047.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341084700008,0

Thus, it is important to include patient preferences in decision making and policy making. Objective: To contribute to the understanding of patient preferences in relation to the choice of treatment for low back pain. Methods: A discrete choice experiment was conducted with consecutive patients referred to a regional spine center. The respondents (n = 348) were invited to respond to a choice of two hypothetical treatment options and an opt out option. The treatment attributes included the treatment modality, the risk of relapse, the reduction in pain, and the expected increase in the ability to perform activities of daily living. In addition, the wait time to achieve the treatment effect was used as a payment vehicle. Mixed logit models were created to perform analysis. Subgroup analysis, dividing respondents into sociodemographic and disease-related categories, further explored the willingness to wait Results: Respondents assigned positive utilities to positive treatment outcomes and disutility to higher risks and longer waits for effects of treatment and to surgical interventions. The model captured significant heterogeneity within the sample for the outcomes of pain reduction and the ability to pursue activities of daily living and for the treatment modality. The subgroup analysis revealed differences in the willingness to wait, especially with regard to treatment modality, the level of pain experienced at the time of data collection, and the respondents' preferences for surgery. Conclusions: The majority of the respondents prefer nonsurgical interventions, but patients are willing to wait for more ideal outcomes and preferred interventions. The results show that health care professionals have a very important task in communicating clearly about the expected results of treatment and the basis of their treatment decisions, as patients' preferences are highly individual.","[Klojgaard, Mirja Elisabeth; Pedersen, Line Bjornskov; Beth, Mickael] Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE Ctr Hlth Econ Res, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Manniche, Claus] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Reg Hlth Serv Res, Hosp Lillebaelt, Spine Ctr Southern Denmark, Middelfart, Denmark; [Sogaard, Rikke] Dept Hlth Serv Res, Dept Publ Hlth, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; Aarhus University,"Klojgaard, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE Ctr Hlth Econ Res, JB Winslowsvej 9b, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark.",mirk@cast.sdu.dk,"Bech, Mickael/G-2588-2011","Sogaard, Rikke/0000-0003-3557-8550; Bech, Mickael/0000-0003-3084-2068; manniche, claus/0000-0001-5938-1483; Pedersen, Line Bjornskov/0000-0001-6804-2045",Danish Strategic Research Council,Danish Strategic Research Council(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)),This study has been financed by the Danish Strategic Research Council as part of the CeSpine-project (http://www.cespine.dk/).,,54,34,39,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,390,396,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.01.005,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24968999.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900012,0

Single-dipped and single-basined preferences have played an important role in areas such as voting, strategy-proofness and matching problems. We examine the notion of single-basinedness in a choice-theoretic setting, with the set of all compact convex subsets of R-n as the domain of choice sets. In conjunction with independence of irrelevant alternatives, single-basined choice implies a structure that conforms to the motivation underlying our definition. We establish the consequences of requiring single-basined choice correspondences to be upper semicontinuous. Moreover, we extend our results to larger domains of non-convex sets.

Our study controls for individual unobserved heterogeneity by using child fixed effects, and it accounts for potential misreporting of self-reported health by employing several, more precise, health indicators. Results show that co-living children of ill mothers, but not of ill fathers, are significantly less likely to be enrolled in education at ages 15-24. Moreover, there is some evidence that mother's negative health shocks are likely to raise the employment probability of children due to the need to cover higher health expenditures.

During the last two decades, the dramatic rise in the number of dengue infections has been particularly evident in Latin American and the Caribbean countries. This paper examines the experimental evidence of the effectiveness of mobile phone technology in improving households' health preventive behavior in dengue-endemic areas. The main results suggest that repeated exposure to health information encourages households' uptake of preventive measures against dengue. As a result, the Breteau Index in treatment households, an objective measure of dengue risk transmission, is 0.10 standard deviations below the mean of the control group, which shows a reduction in the number of containers per household that test positive for dengue larvae. The estimates also show marginally significant effects of the intervention on self-reported dengue symptoms. Moreover, we use a multiple treatment framework that randomly assigns households to one of the four treatment groups in order to analyze the impacts of framing on health behavior. Different variants emphasized information on monetary and non-monetary benefits and costs. The main results show no statistical differences among treatment groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With data from the pilot survey of the new China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, this paper applies the vignette method to control for differences in individual response scales and examines regional differences in self-reported health among the elderly in China. The results show that people in different provinces seem to use different criteria when assessing their health conditions. Regional health disparities are underestimated if differentials in response scales are not accounted for. A substantial share of the disparities cannot be explained by the observed differences in respondents' chronic health condition, demographic characteristics, and household wealth, a finding confirmed by a test based on inpatient-care information.

The paper shows that a large class of investment criteria, including 'fractional Kelly', also suffer from the same shortcoming and adapts ideas from the literature on price discrimination and surplus extraction to explain why this is so. The paper also presents a new criterion, dubbed the doubly conservative criterion, that is immune to the problem identified above. Immunity stems from the investor's attitudes toward capital preservation and from him becoming rapidly pessimistic about his chances of winning the better odds he is offered. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We use Austrian birth register data covering all births between 1984 and 2007 and find that a mother's marriage is associated with a higher birth weight of the newborn, in the range of 40 to 60 g. The significant impact is retained if we include mother fixed effects or use an instrumental variable approach to account for unobserved mother heterogeneity. However, the magnitude of the causal effect (37 g) clearly indicates the importance of selection into marriage. Divorce around pregnancy results in significantly lower birth weights than the birth weights of babies born to single mothers. Family status effects in the 2000s are stronger than they were in the 1980s, and quantile regressions suggest that family effects are more pronounced at the lower quantiles of the birth weight distribution and less pronounced at higher quantiles. We conclude that the life situation of expectant mothers has an important influence on the birth weight of newborns, especially at the lower tail of the birth weight distribution.

Methods: Our cohort study included 139 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who were treated outside of a clinical study; 72 received bortezomib and 67 did not receive bortezomib. Detailed data were retrospectively collected from medical records in 38% of Dutch hospitals. Results: All patients received second-line treatment; 65%, 40%, and 14%, received three, four, or five or more lines of therapy. Neither a specific treatment sequence nor an appropriate comparator could be identified because of large variation in regimes. Kaplan-Meier curves showed an increased overall survival (mean [median] 29.5 [33.2] vs. 28.0 [21.6] months) for patients treated with bortezomib (Wilcoxon P = 0.01). Total mean costs were (sic)81,626 (range (sic)17,793-(sic)229,783) and (sic)52,760 (range (sic)748-(sic)179,571) for patients receiving bortezomib and patients not receiving bortezomib, respectively. Patients treated with bortezomib, however, were not comparable to other patients despite attempts to correct for confounding. Therefore, it was impossible to develop a feasible model to obtain a valid incremental cost-effectiveness estimate. Conclusions: It was possible to develop evidence on bortezomib's use, effects, and costs in everyday practice. Much uncertainty, however, remained regarding its cost-effectiveness. Policymakers should carefully consider whether outcomes research sufficiently decreases uncertainty or whether other options (e g, finance- and/or outcomes-based risk-sharing arrangements) are more appropriate to ensure sufficient value for money of expensive drugs.","[Franken, Margreet G.; Gaultney, Jennifer G.; Blommestein, Hedwig M.; Redekop, William K.; Uyl-de Groot, Carin A.] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Huijgens, Peter C.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Dept Haematol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sonneveld, Pieter] Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Haematol, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Franken, MG (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",franken@bmg.eur.nl,"Redekop, Ken/AAA-2423-2020; Franken, Margreet MG/H-3200-2013","Franken, Margreet/0000-0003-4207-510X; Blommestein, Hedwig/0000-0002-5846-0531; Redekop, Ken/0000-0001-9538-4083",Dutch Health Care Insurance Board,Dutch Health Care Insurance Board,"This study was supported by the Dutch Health Care Insurance Board.

The objective here was to project long-term graft- and survival-related outcomes occurring among renal transplant recipients based on short-term outcomes including acute rejection and estimated glomerular filtration rates observed in randomized trials. Methods: We developed a two-phase decision model including a trial phase and a Markov state transition phase to project long-term outcomes over the lifetimes of hypothetical renal graft recipients who survived the trial period with a functioning graft Health states included functioning graft stratified by level of renal function, failed graft, functioning regraft, and death. Transitions between health states were predicted using statistical models that accounted for renal function, acute rejection, and new-onset diabetes after transplant and for donor and recipient predictors of long-term graft and patient survival. Models were estimated using data from 38,015 renal transplant recipients from the United States Renal Data System. The model was populated with data from a 3-year, randomized phase III trial comparing belatacept to cyclosporine. Results: The decision model was well calibrated with data from the United States Renal Data System. Long-term extrapolation of Belatacept Evaluation of Nephroprotection and Efficacy as Firstline Immunosuppression Trial was projected to yield a 1.9 year increase in time alive with a functioning graft and a 1.2 life-year increase over a 20-year time horizon. Conclusions: This is the first long-term follow-up model of renal transplant patients to be based on renal function, acute rejection, and new-onset diabetes. It is a useful tool for undertaking comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies of immunosuppressive medications.","[Levy, Adrian R.] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS B3H 1V7, Canada; [Levy, Adrian R.; Briggs, Andrew H.; Johnston, Karissa] Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Briggs, Andrew H.] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [MacLean, J.

Methods: By using 2006-2007 Medicare administrative data, we examined 7583 beneficiaries with PD who filled two or more APD prescriptions during 19 months (June 1, 2006, to December 31, 2007) in the Part D program. Two adherence measures-duration of therapy (DOT) and medication possession ratio (MPR)-were assessed. Negative binomial and gamma generalized linear models were used to estimate the rate ratios (RRs) of all cause health care utilization and expenditures, respectively, conditional upon adherence, adjusting for survival risk, sample selection, and health-seeking behavior. Results: Approximately one-fourth of patients with PD had low adherence (MPR < 0.80, 28.7%) or had a short DOT (<400 days, 23.9%). Increasing adherence to APll therapy was associated with decreased health care utilization and expenditures. For example, compared with patients with low adherence, those with high adherence (MPR = 0.90-1.00) had significantly lower rates of hospitalization (RR = 0.86), emergency room visits (RR = 0.91), skilled nursing facility episodes (RR = 0.67), home health agency episodes (RR = 0.83), physician visits (RR = 0.93), as well as lower total health care expenditures (-$2242), measured over 19 months. Similarly, lower total expenditure (-$6308) was observed in patients with a long DOT versus those with a short DOT. Conclusions: In this nationally representative sample, higher adherence to APDs and longer duration of use of APDs were associated with lower all-cause health care utilization and total health care expenditures. Our findings suggest the need for improving medication-taking behaviors among patients with PD to reduce the use of and expenditures for medical resources.","[Wei, Yu-Jung; Palumbo, Francis B.; Simoni-Wastila, Linda; Stuart, Bruce; Beardsley, Robert] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Palumbo, Francis B.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Ctr Drugs & Publ Policy, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Simoni-Wastila, Linda; Stuart, Bruce] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Peter Lamy Ctr Drug Therapy & Aging, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Shulman, Lisa M.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Brown, Clayton H.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore,"Wei, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, Saratoga Bldg,12th Floor,220 Arch St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",ywei@rx.umaryland.edu,,"Wei, YU-Jung Jenny/0000-0001-8861-6907",,,,,58,26,29,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2014,17,2.0,,,,,196,204,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.12.003,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AD6EB,24636377.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333346600006,0

Objective: To describe the processes in drug reimbursement decision-making systems currently used in national publicly funded outpatient prescription drug insurance plans. Methods: By using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations as the sampling frame, a search was done in the published literature, followed by the gray literature. Collected data were verified by a system expert within the prescription drug insurance plan in each country to ensure the accuracy of key data elements across countries. Results: All but one country provided at least one publicly funded prescription drug formulary. Many systems have adopted similar processes of drug reimbursement decision making. All but three systems required additional consideration of clinical evidence within the decision making process. Transparency of recommendations varied between systems, from having no information publicly available (three systems) to all information available and accessible to the public (16 systems). Only four countries did not consider cost within the drug reimbursement decision-making process. Conclusions: There were similarities in the decision-making process for drug reimbursement across the systems; however, only five countries met the highest standard of transparency, requirement of evidence, and ability to appeal. Future work should focus on examining how these processes may affect formulary listing decisions for drugs between countries.","[Barnieh, Lianne; Manns, Braden] Univ Calgary, Dept Med, Calgary, AB T2N 2T9, Canada; [Harris, Anthony] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Blom, Marja] Univ Helsinki, Div Social Pharm, Helsinki, Finland; [Donaldson, Cam] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Yunus Ctr Social Business & Hlth, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [Klarenbach, Scott] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Ottawa, Dept Epidemiol & Community Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lorenzetti, Diane; Clement, Fiona] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary; Monash University; University of Helsinki; Glasgow Caledonian University; University of Alberta; University of Ottawa; University of Calgary,"Barnieh, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Med, 1403 29th St NW, Calgary, AB T2N 2T9, Canada.",lbarnieh@gmail.com,"Husereau, Don/AAJ-7722-2021; Manns, Braden J/I-8942-2012; harris, anthony h/A-2551-2009; Klarenbach, Scott/E-7731-2013","Husereau, Don/0000-0002-4416-6876; Harris, Anthony/0000-0003-1641-3320; Donaldson, Cam/0000-0003-4670-5340; Lorenzetti, Diane L./0000-0001-8423-3458; Klarenbach, Scott/0000-0002-8611-1056",,,,,35,48,51,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN,2014,17,1.0,,,,,98,108,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.10.008,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,291RS,24438723.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329847500014,0

We use the natural experiment of assigned college roommates to estimate peer effects for several measures of health risks: binge drinking, smoking, illicit drug use, gambling, having multiple sex partners, suicidal ideation, and non-suicidal self-injury. We find significant peer effects for binge drinking but little evidence of effects for other outcomes, although there is tentative evidence that peer effects for smoking may be positive among men and negative among women. In contrast to prior research, the peer effects for binge drinking are significant for all subgroups defined by sex and prior drinking status. We also find that pre-existing risky behaviors predict the closeness of friendships, which underscores the significance of addressing selection biases in studies of peer effects.

I show that for any level of uncertainty there exists a pure deviation strategy arbitrarily close to the equilibrium strategy such that for some valuations the equilibrium strategy has a selective disadvantage against the deviation if the population mainly plays the deviation strategy. I show that agents with those valuations would prefer to deviate even farther from the equilibrium strategy, if the population collectively uses the deviation strategy. I argue that in the Bayesian game studied here, a mass deviation can be caused by the entry of a small group of agents. The results provided in this paper imply that the equilibrium strategy is indeed unstable if one considers rare and independent mutations on the space of valuations. Numeric calculations indicate that the closer the deviation strategy to the equilibrium strategy, the more valuations are destabilizing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A common practice in the Bayesian literature for linear regression and other semi-parametric models is to use flexible families of distributions for the errors and to assume that the errors are independent from covariates. However, a model with flexible covariate dependent error distributions should be preferred for the following reason. Assuming that the error distribution is independent of predictors might lead to inconsistent estimation of the parameters of interest when errors and covariates are dependent. To address this issue, we develop a Bayesian regression model with a parametric mean function defined by a conditional moment condition and flexible predictor dependent error densities. Sufficient conditions to achieve posterior consistency of the regression parameters and conditional error densities are provided. In experiments, the proposed method compares favorably with classical and alternative Bayesian estimation methods for the estimation of the regression coefficients and conditional densities.
