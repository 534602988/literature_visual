This article discusses a kind of network very peculiar to Chinese communities' way of life: the Guanxi. Ever more emigrating to countries of occidental culture, the Chinese bring with them their way of being and doing business to which the Guanxi is a significant cultural trait. Knowing this type of relationship increases the possibilities of success for those who intend to do business with the Chinese, both in Brazil and in China. The article encompasses a theoretical framework, exposing Chinese and Occidental theories about relationship networks, allowing a broad understanding of how Guanxi works.

Despite the fact that most evaluations of the process fail to find significant adverse efficiency and welfare effects, there has been a strong surge in public discontent with such policy in the region. This paper performs a systematic empirical analysis of the determinants of such dissatisfaction, using survey data from Latinobarometro covering 17 countries over the period 19982008, complemented by country level data on macroeconomic, political, and institutional aspects as well as data on privatization. Dissatisfaction appears to respond to absolute and relative welfare effects, and we find a robust U-shaped effect in term of education and income levels, with individuals in the middle of such distributions being more critical with the outcome of privatizations.","[Straub, Stephane] Toulouse Sch Econ ARQADE & IDEI, Toulouse, France; [Dubois, Pierre] INRA, GREMAQ, Toulouse Sch Econ, IDEI, Toulouse, France; [Martimort, David] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Paris School of Economics,"Straub, S (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ ARQADE & IDEI, Toulouse, France.",celine.bonnet@tse-fr.eu; pierre.dubois@tse-fr.eu; martimor@parisschoolofeconomics.eu; stephane.straub@univ-tlse1.fr,"Dubois, Pierre/R-8768-2019; Quinn, Patrick/B-5489-2010","Dubois, Pierre/0000-0002-9077-6843;",,,,,36,11,13,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

This paper explores the skill premium and its correlation with exports in Latin America, thus linking the skill premium to the emerging literature on the structure of trade and development. Using data on employment and wages for over seven million workers from sixteen Latin American economies, the authors estimate national and industry-specific returns to schooling and skill premiums and study some of their determinants. The evidence suggests that both country and industry characteristics are important in explaining returns to schooling and skill premiums. The analyses also suggest that the incidence of exports within industries, the average income per capita within countries, and the relative abundance of skilled workers are related to the underlying industry and country characteristics that explain these parameters. In particular, sectoral exports are positively correlated with the skill premium at the industry level, a result that supports recent trade models linking exports with wages and the demand for skills.","[Brambilla, Irene; Porto, Guido] Univ Nacl La Plata, La Plata, Argentina; [Dix-Carneiro, Rafael] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Lederman, Daniel] World Bank, DEC TI, Washington, DC USA",National University of La Plata; Princeton University; The World Bank,"Brambilla, I (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl La Plata, La Plata, Argentina.",irene.brambilla@econo.unlp.edu.ar; rdc@princeton.edu; dlederman@worldbank.org; guido.porto@depeco.econo.unlp.edu.ar,,,,,,,35,10,11,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

The main properties of tested fuels (density, kinematic viscosity, oxidation stability, acid value, peroxide number, coke content, water content and cetane number) has been determined. The tractor diesel engine subjected to experiment has four cylinders, 51.5 kW and 4760 cc. The engine was loaded at wide open accelerator position, and run at different speeds between 1200 and 1950 rpm and different engine loads: 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%, 70% and 65%. The speed and engine load were recorded from digital indicator of the test ring. The load on the dynamometer was measured by using a strain gauge load sensor. The rotation sensor was used to measure the speed of the engine. The high values of smoke emissions for tested fuels can be found for diesel fuel on the engine load of 75% at 1400 rpm (2.61 m(-1)). The most important increase of smoke emissions for pure rapeseed oil is on the engine load 70% at 1300 rpm (1.86 m(-1)). For the blend RO20 the maximum value of smoke emissions is on the engine load 75% at 1400 rpm (2.42 m(-1)).

We propose an indirect methodology to overcome the lack of data on consumption choices of dynasties, i.e., parents and their adult offspring. This new approach is based on the analysis of the correlation between the geographical distributions of surnames and consumption choices.

These industries tend, therefore, to export excess production, resorting to aggressive practices to take over the market. One of these strategies is to throw this products surplus on external markets at a price that covers only the marginal cost, while fixed costs are covered from the sales on the internal market. This way, the export price can be smaller than the total production costs or than the sale cost on the internal market. Such a sale at small prices may place the producers of similar products in the importing state in a disadvantageous position.

We outline the context of this mutation in relation to the ideas of Montesquieu, Gournay and Forbonnais. The actors of this change will then be considered: the promoters throughout these years of 'philosophie economique' i.e. Quesnay, the Physiocrats and Turgot. An analysis of these authors, together with a founder of this perspective, Boisguilbert, will show how the status and role of money was modified and illuminate the issues involved.

The international demand for palm oil is increasing because of increased demand for use of biodiesel and lowering of tariffs under the new WTO rules. The global demand is estimated to increase by 4 million tonnes of palm oil per year in the next 20 years. Expansion of oil palm in Malaysia is a concern due to loss of tropical forests, biodiversity, pollution due to fertilizer and pesticides and waste generation specially mill effluent polluting waterways. Malaysia had a forest loss of about 5 million hectares (20% reduction of forrest land) and the projected expansion for palm oil in Malaysis is 0.06 -5 million by 2020. Indonesia clears nearly 200000 hectares of forest per year for palm oil. The Oil pam industry both in Malaysia and Indonesia has introduced legislation to reduce the environmental impacts of the oil palm sector. Malaysia introduced provisions on (a) open burning (b) industrial waste (c) environmentally benign technologies and (d) Environmental Impact assessment (EIA) and adoption of ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standards Certification by the Malaysian Palm Oil Promotion Council (MPOPC). Both Malaysia and Indonesia are members of the RSPO and should adhere to RSPO regulations. In spite of these measures, progress towards sustainable palm oil production is slow. Many companies provided only brief narartive accounts of adoption of zero burning, planting legume covers, biological control and adoption of ISO 14001 environmental standards. Indonesia still violates the zero burning concept. Innovative utilization of oil palm biomass, green energy development, improved governance and monitoring of land use, protection of forest land are evident in both countries but there is scope for further improvement.","[Herath, Gamini] Monash Univ, Sch Business, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,,,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,44,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,51,62,,,,,,12,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600006,0

Trade liberalization has resulted in a significant tariff reduction in most of the countries including ASEAN countries. This has forced ASEAN countries to shift their focus of trade policy towards trade facilitation in order to reduce trade cost and remain as a highly competitive region. Trade facilitation is considered to be a tool that reduces transaction costs and the complexity of international trade and enhances the trading environment. Therefore, with the absence of direct policy barriers, other components of trade cost such as transportation costs and border related trade cost must be reduced. The development of trade-related infrastructure, which is one of the forms of trade facilitation, is therefore very important for ASEAN to capitalize the benefits of international trade. The present study examines the impact of hard infrastructure on bilateral trade flows in selected ASEAN countries over the period 1995-2010 using fixed effect estimator. Some alternative measures for hard infrastructure from transport and ICT sectors are included in this study. Results from a gravity model and bilateral trade data suggest that bilateral trade in ASEAN countries is significantly influence by hard infrastructure.","[Mahyideen, Jamilah Mohd] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ismail, Normaz Wana; Hook, Law Siong] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Mahyideen, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.",,"Ismail, Normaz Wana/F-7528-2017; Mahyideen, Jamilah Mohd/AAK-4470-2020; Law, Siong Hook/AAF-6672-2020","Law, Siong Hook/0000-0002-6058-4883",,,,,22,0,1,0,4,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,793,+,,,,,,3,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600070,0

Nevertheless, they are often not taken into account in cost-benefit analyses (CBA), or only in very rough ways. This paper aims at providing simple rules to predict variability, based on travel time data from Dutch highways. Two different concepts of travel time variability are used, which differ in their assumptions on information availability to drivers. The first measure is based on the assumption that, for a given road link and given time of day, the expected travel time is constant across all working days (rough information: RI). In the second case, expected travel times are assumed to reflect day-specific factors such as weather conditions or weekdays (fine information: FI). For both definitions of variability, we find that the mean travel time is a good predictor. On average, longer delays are associated with higher variability. However, the derivative of variability with respect to delays is decreasing in delays. It can be shown that this result relates to differences in the relative shares of observed traffic 'regimes' (free-flow, congested, hyper-congested) in the mean delay. For most CBAs, no information on the relative shares of the traffic regimes is available. A non-linear model based on mean travel times can then be used as an approximation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This algorithm generates at the beginning the first generation, chooses five thousand parents by the roulette method, crosses these pairs and determines the next generation. This process continues with next generations until stabilization. The algorithm is demonstrated on two examples. At the final part extremal algebras, max-plus algebra and max-min algebra, are defined and illustrated by examples. Monge matrices and some their properties are described in these algebras. The optimization of the traveling salesman problem, which leads to a reduction of the computation complexity, is described for these matrices. The optimization is solved at first for the classical case and then for the matrices that satisfy the strict Monge property.

However, most empirical studies of food deserts have been small scale, focusing on limited geographies and a narrow range of products. Standard retail location models, which often assume that consumers have identical preferences and are uniformly distributed through space, provide little insight into the relationship between local income and retail patterns. In this paper, we examine the relationship between neighborhood income and retail density for several types of goods and services in 58 large U.S metropolitan areas. We combine detailed data from the National Establishment Time-Series database on retail establishments and employment, by industry category and firm type, with Census data on ZCTA income, poverty and demographics. Results indicate that retail patterns do vary by neighborhood income, along many dimensions. High poverty neighborhoods have lower employment density for retail overall, supermarkets, drugstores, food service and laundry facilities, driven largely by reduced employment in chain establishments. Average establishment size increases with median income for all retail types. Neither income levels nor poverty rates consistently predict retail employment growth, but neighborhoods that experience income upgrading do see larger gains in retail employment.

The study exploited the main data of the decentralization fund by using a panel data of eight regencies and municipals, particularly the regional autonomy fund, direct and indirect government expenditure, and economic growth. The paper used the path analysis to explore the relationships of the observed variables. The results revealed that the decentralization fund influenced significantly on government's direct expenditure and economic growth. The special local autonomy's fund has influenced considerably on government's indirect expenditure. Its effect has increased, through economic growth as the intermediating variable, meaningfully on employment, poverty, and welfare. The results are in line with the prior studies, which explore the consequences, of decentralization and specific autonomy to spur the economic growth in certain regions.

Comparing the North Korean situation with the experiences of Yugoslavia, China and Vietnam, it concludes that a certain degree of political liberalisation, the successful normalisation of P'yongyang's relations with the US, South Korea and Japan, and the decoupling of foreign economic assistance from military negotiations are essential preconditions of a successful reform process in North Korea. In the absence of these preconditions, economic crises alone are insufficient to stimulate a comprehensive reform programme, although they might inspire certain superficial corrective measures.","[Szalontai, Balazs] E China Normal Univ, Ctr Cold War Int Hist Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",East China Normal University; Syracuse University,"Szalontai, B (通讯作者)，E China Normal Univ, Ctr Cold War Int Hist Studies, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",aoverl@yahoo.co.uk; cychoi@kdischool.ac.kr,,,,,,,49,8,9,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,2,,,,,227,246,,10.1080/09668136.2011.642584,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,912DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301775700002,0

The government expenditure functions are procyclical in most PIIGS countries (68% cases in the sample). Output and government expenditure are cointegrated for at least six of the expenditure categories in every country and it implies a long-term relationship between government expenditure and output consistent with Wagner's law. Average value of long-run elasticity coefficients is 1.30 for all expenditure functions, 1.17 for total government expenditure. The values of the coefficients for the short-run relationship between expenditure and output confirm the voracity hypothesis, as they suggest that in response to a given shock to real GDP, government expenditure rises by even more in percentage points.","[Szarowska, Irena] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,szarowska@opf.slu.cz,"Szarowská, Irena/J-6391-2012","Szarowská, Irena/0000-0002-5197-6455",,,,,20,0,0,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,854,859,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900146,0

'Authoritarian at Heart and Expansionist by Habit'?,EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Scholars disagree on how to interpret Russia's assertive foreign policy. According to some observers, Russia's authoritarian culture and political system have historically required the Kremlin to depend on the Western threat image at home and to engage in revisionist behaviour abroad. These observers recommend that Western nations abstain from engaging Russia as an equal contributor to shaping the global system. This article assesses the validity of the authoritarian expansionism theory by comparing it to other prominent perspectives on foreign policy, realism and constructivism. The article argues that, by perceiving Russia's historical and institutional distinctness as fundamentally threatening to the West, the theory overlooks important sources of foreign policy contestation at home and potentially varying directions abroad. The article selects the historically important cases of the Crimean War, the Cold War and the Russia-Georgia War to demonstrate the theory's flaws and to highlight the role of factors other than Russia's authoritarianism in the nation's foreign policy.","San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Tsygankov, AP (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, 1600 Holloway Ave,HSS 336, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",andrei@sfsu.edu,,"Tsygankov, Andrei/0000-0002-4314-1116",,,,,93,25,30,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,4,,,,,695,713,,10.1080/09668136.2012.671568,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,943ZX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304168500004,0

We examine cruising for parking using a nation-wide random sample of car trips. We exclude employer-provided and residential parking. We focus on the Netherlands, where levels of on-street and off-street parking prices are locally the same. We demonstrate then that due to this price setting the average cruising time in the Netherlands is only 36 s per car trip. Furthermore, we show that cruising is not random. It is more common in (large) cities that receive more car trips, particularly for shopping and leisure activities. Cruising time increases with travel duration as well as with parking duration. Cruising has a distinctive pattern over the day with a peak in the morning, so the order of arrival is essential to parking. Because cruising has a spatial and time component, policies may be considered that reduce cruising time through flexible pricing of parking or improved information about vacant parking spaces.

In order to encourage the development of the market, this paper addresses filling the existing research gap concerning the following issues of the Czech venture capital market: How the current Czech legislation regulates the legal fund structures for VC investments? What is the tax treatment of VC funds and individual investors in the Czech Republic? What are the legal and tax regulations on the main European markets for venture capital? What are the key requirements for improvements of the current situation on the Czech venture capital market? The nature of this study is explorative and it relies on primary and secondary data. Results of the study stress that as compared to economies boasting developed financial markets, the non-existence of the Limited Partnership legal form in particular is a weak spot of the current Czech legislation.

However, most existing studies focus on the impact of ecommerce on freight system. Its impact on personal trips is relatively less studied. It is reasonable to argue that online shopping reduces the need of shopping trips by making goods accessible via door-to-door deliveries. On the other hand, online shopping may also create more shopping trips as online shoppers travel to stores to experience, compare or pick up the goods. Understanding the connections between online shopping and shopping trips is critical for transportation planners to prepare for changes that information technology will continue to bring to this nation in the future. Using the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data and a structural equation model (SEM), this paper disentangles the bidirectional connections between online shopping and shopping trips. Results show that online shopping encourages shopping trips while shopping trips tend to suppress the online shopping propensity. Besides, both online shopping and shopping trips are influenced by exogenous factors such as shoppers' demographic features, regional specific factors and household attributes. A closer examination at the state level further confirms model validity while disclosing spatial variation in their relationship. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, capture theories cannot explain the prominence of financial consumer protection in post-crisis reform agendas. By contrast, this article argues that, despite their collective action disadvantage, a polymorphous network of civil society organizations was able to gain momentum after the financial crisis and to influence the financial reform process. In this policy window, where decision-makers were looking out for an alternative source of expertise, a transnationally connected civil society (TCS) network successfully mobilized to place consumer protection on reform agendas in tandem with public entrepreneurs and on the back of a popular backlash against big finance. This argument will be explored through a comparative study of the impact of transnational pressures on policy-makers in Europe and the US in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. In the conclusion, the article shortly discusses the substance of the financial reforms that have been undertaken.","[Kastner, Lisa] Max Planck Sci Po Ctr, Paris, France; [Kastner, Lisa] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Kastner, L (通讯作者)，Max Planck Sci Po Ctr, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,55,39,42,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Whereas new regionalism emphasizes the embeddedness of city-level decisions in a regional context, political market theories and the empirical study of local growth decisions treat city decisions as being shaped by local conditions, institutions, and processes. Hierarchical general linear modeling provides a statistical method to examine influences on policy decisions at multiple levels. This article estimates a hierarchical general linear model that captures the impact of political market forces and control variables on the enactment or continuation of impact fees. The likelihood of using impact fees varies across metropolitan areas, and intergovernmental revenue facilitates local innovation, but larger council size is a barrier to application of this policy innovation.

For this purpose we use the monocentric model. As the basic model does not have direct implications for this distribution, we survey the extensions of the model that have been used in empirical literature. One of the most promising ways is to introduce externalities in the decision process; they can result directly from exogenous amenities (given traits of urban area) or be created by other agents' decisions. We first test the simple model relating income to distance. Then we introduce and test the model with exogenous amenities; recreational areas, transportation systems, health, educational and cultural infrastructure. In the third stage we test the model with spatial effects.

Through the revenue side, wages tend to rise after a currency depreciation and the effect is more pronounced the higher is the firm's exposure to sales from exports. Through the expenditure side, a depreciation induces a cut in the firm's wages, and the effect is larger the higher is the incidence of imported inputs in total production costs. For a given degree of external orientation, both these effects are larger for firms with a lower market power.

Drawing on Bourdieu, we argue that sacrifice and distinction help us understand some of the meanings men attach to dirty, manual work - forming part of a working-class 'habitus'.

In this regard, our key conclusions are that (i) there is a contagion effect from subprime defaults to prime defaults due to the negative impact of subprime defaults and (ii) monetary policy is the most effective tool for decreasing mortgage defaults and increasing aggregate home prices in contrast to alternative government fiscal policies designed to loosen mortgage credit.","[Ascheberg, Marius; Kraft, Holger] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Finance, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Jarrow, Robert A.] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Yildirim, Yildiray] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Goethe University Frankfurt; Cornell University; Syracuse University,"Ascheberg, M (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Finance, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",Marius.Ascheberg@hof.uni-frankfurt.de; raj15@cornell.edu; holgerkraft@finance.uni-frankfurt.de; yildiray@syr.edu,,,,,,,26,3,4,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2014,42.0,3,,,,,627,661,,10.1111/1540-6229.12041,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,AU5FM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345632600004,0

We show that identifying and estimating program impact on dispersion of potential outcomes in an endogenous-switching model is possible, without using the identification-at-infinity argument, if we impose semi-parametric conditions or shape restrictions on the error structure. In the presence of a multi-valued or continuously distributed instrument, we recommend the pairwise-matching method under a set of symmetry conditions. Simulations and an empirical example show that the matching method is much more precise than the instrumental-variable approach.

Based on a survey of 400 olive growers in Andalusia, the leading olive producing region in the world, this paper investigates 1) the factors related to characteristics of olive farmers and farms, which have conditioned the adoption of PDO, and 2) the environmental, economic and agronomic goodness of PDO farming practices. A further diffusion of PDO would require highlighting PDO as a medium- to long-term quality strategy especially for non-highly productive farmers, promoting membership of agricultural associations and the use of external sources of information about innovations, and making growers aware of the importance of respect for the environment when producing. PDO farmers seem to be targeting quality whereas other attributes, such as respect for the environment, are neglected to some extent. Therefore, most practices could be improved. A further greening of PDO practices would represent added value in the eyes of local but also international consumers and Would be in line with CAP 2014-2020 trends. The role of public administrations in promoting the adoption of PDO and training in the use of more sustainable fanning practices should be further strengthened.","[Hinojosa-Rodriguez, Ascension; Parra-Lopez, Carlos; Carmona-Torres, Carmen; Sayadi, Samir] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res & Training IFAPA, Agroecosost Group, Dept Agr Econ & Sociol, Granada, Spain",,"Hinojosa-Rodríguez, A (通讯作者)，Inst Agr & Fisheries Res & Training IFAPA, Agroecosost Group, Dept Agr Econ & Sociol, Granada, Spain.",,"Sayadi, Samir/C-2954-2016; Sayadi, Sami/K-8031-2017; Parra-López, Carlos/A-7730-2008; CARMONA-TORRES, CARMEN/ABA-1471-2020","Parra-López, Carlos/0000-0003-4923-4169;","Spanish Institute for Agricultural Research and Technology (INIA); European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) [RTA2008-00024]; Andalusian Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise [PAIDI P07-SEJ-03121]","Spanish Institute for Agricultural Research and Technology (INIA)(Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)); European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)(European Union (EU)); Andalusian Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise","The authors would like to thank the following entities for their financial support in this research: the Spanish Institute for Agricultural Research and Technology (INIA) and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through the ECOINNOLI project (RTA2008-00024), and the Andalusian Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise through the MULTIOLI project (PAIDI P07-SEJ-03121).",,40,19,19,0,13,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2014,13.0,3,,,,,2,12,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AU4UC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345605800001,0

Particularly, more than 75 % of the homes in our sample are associated with a round or just below round asking price. This study provides a theoretical and empirical examination of how the thousands digit in a home's asking price is related to the final transaction price relative to its true underlying value. Our findings suggest that, on average, homes listed using a just below pricing strategy are associated with the greatest discount negotiated relative to the asking price. However, the higher initial degree of list overpricing reflected in just below pricing compared with other strategies more than offsets the greater discount. Therefore, just below is the most effective pricing strategy for the seller in terms of a greater dollar yield relative to value. These empirical findings have economic significance and are robust across both buyer and seller housing markets, new versus existing homes, and across multiple home price ranges.","[Beracha, Eli] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Seiler, Michael J.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",University of Wyoming; William & Mary,"Seiler, MJ (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",eberacha@uwyo.edu; Michael.Seiler@mason.wm.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,27,25,27,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Drawing on the distinction between market and behavioural experimentation, this article assesses the compatibility of the most influential experimental research with the neoliberal understanding of the political and moral preconditions for markets to develop. A politically relevant asymmetry at the core of this research programme will be signalled: while issues of political economy are eschewed by market experimenters (for example, whose interests are favoured and whose groups have power in economic processes), topics of moral economy are recognised and dealt with by behavioural experimenters (for example, the interactions between economic institutions and individuals' motivations and moral make-up). It is argued that experimental research has thereby contributed to a depoliticised and moralised view of markets, one that tends to present markets as a civilising institution once their technical and moral failures are recognised and adequately dealt with.","[Santos, Ana Cordeiro; Rodrigues, Joao] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Colegio S Jeronimo, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Santos, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Colegio S Jeronimo, Ap 3087, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal.",anacsantos@ces.uc.pt; joaorodrigues@ces.uc.pt,"Rodrigues, João/ISB-6671-2023; RODRIGUES, JOÃO/AAC-6993-2019; Rodrigues, João/GVU-7735-2022","Santos, Ana Cordeiro/0000-0002-3654-2544; Rodrigues, Joao/0000-0001-7595-3162",,,,,83,5,5,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In this study we investigate whether macroeconomic conditions are associated with variation in mean sleep time in the United States, and if so, whether the effect is procyclical or countercyclical. We merge state unemployment rates from 2003 through 2012 with the American Time Use Survey, a nationally representative sample of adults with 24 h time diaries. We find that higher aggregate unemployment is associated with longer mean sleep duration, with each additional point of state unemployment associated with an additional average 0.83 min of sleep (p < 0.001), after adjusting for a secular trend of increasing sleep over the time period. Despite a national poll in 2009 that found one-third of Americans reporting losing sleep over the economy, we do not find that higher state unemployment is associated with more sleeplessness. Instead, we find that higher state unemployment is associated with less frequent time use described as sleeplessness (marginal effect = 0.05 at 4% unemployment and 0.034 at 14% unemployment, p <0.001), after controlling for a secular trend.

Afterwards, we further develop the surcharges up to a flat rate employee contribution and ascertain their financial consequences and their employment and growth effects. The allocative effects of such a further development are positive. They will be more considerable if the introduction begins earlier and ends quickly. A moderate expenditure increase and a smaller shape of the compensation scheme will intensify these effects.","[Kallweit, Manuel; Kohlmeier, Anabell] Sachverstandigenrat Begutachtung Gesamtwirtschaft, Wiesbaden, Germany",,"Kallweit, M (通讯作者)，Stat Bundesamt, Sachverstandigenrat Begutachtung Gesamtwirtschaft, Gustav Stresemann Ring 11, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany.",manuel.kallweit@svr-wirtschaft.de; anabell.kohlmeier@svr-wirtschaft.de,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,9,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Municipalities are responsible for maintaining their green spaces in order to preserve these potentials. This paper supports municipalities in planning the transportation and disposal logistics of the green waste that is produced by the maintenance activities. The approach combines ecological issues like the seasonality of green waste generation and different types of biomass with economically driven decision making. We show how to determine cost efficient transportation plans for the disposal logistics and how to capture the seasonality of green waste generation when booking capacities at disposal facilities.

This empirical study rejects this thesis for German panel data, however, and finds that individual unemployment is even more hurtful when regional unemployment is higher. On the other hand, an extended model that separately considers individuals who feel stigmatised from living off public funds yields strong evidence that this group of people does in fact suffer less when the normative pressure to earn one's own living is lower. A comprehensive discussion reconciles these findings with the existing research and concludes that to find evidence for the often described social-norm effect it is worthwhile to analyse disutility associated with benefit receipts.","Univ Trier, IAAEU, Inst Labour Law & Ind Relat European Union, D-54286 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Chadi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, IAAEU, Inst Labour Law & Ind Relat European Union, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",chadi@iaaeu.de,,,,,,,38,21,23,0,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Two models are overlapping when the true model contains just a subset of variables common to the larger sets of variables included in the competing forecasting models. We consider an out-of-sample version of the two-step testing procedure recommended by Vuong but also show that an exact one-step procedure is sometimes applicable. When the models are overlapping, we provide a simple-to-use fixed-regressor wild bootstrap that can be used to conduct valid inference. Monte Carlo simulations generally support the theoretical results: the two-step procedure is conservative, while the one-step procedure can be accurately sized when appropriate. We conclude with an empirical application comparing the predictive content of credit spreads to growth in real stock prices for forecasting US real gross domestic product growth.

The aim is to measure each constructor's performance, comparing its efficiency relative to all other competing constructors. The study uses financial and performance data to assess the proximity of the constructors to the best practices frontier. The analysis has been made considering the results of the 2003, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2011 F1 seasons. In order to create a parsimonious DEA model, a variable screening method for dimensionality reduction is considered. The results indicate that, generally, a substantial reduction should be made to the constructors' budget over the seasons in order to be efficient as compared to the identified benchmarks. In addition, scale efficiency reveals that most constructors operate below their most productive scale size.","[Gutierrez, Ester; Lozano, Sebastian] Univ Seville, Dept Ind Management, Seville 41092, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Gutiérrez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Ind Management, Camino Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",egm@esi.us.es,"Gutiérrez, Ester/F-8258-2010; Lozano, Sebastian/E-7807-2010","Gutiérrez, Ester/0000-0001-9642-3195; Lozano, Sebastian/0000-0002-0401-3584",,,,,37,8,8,2,39,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Allowing for higher-than-usual frequencies strongly mitigates the problems of small-sample bias and structural breaks. Applying a daily frequency allows us to obtain estimates for the Calvo parameter of nominal rigidity over a very short period-for instance for the recent financial and economic crisis-which can then be easily transformed into their low-frequency equivalences. With Argentine data from the end of 2007 to the beginning of 2011 we estimate the daily Calvo parameter and find that on average prices remain fixed for approximately two to three months which is in line with recent microeconomic evidence.,"[Ahrens, Steffen; Sacht, Stephen] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Ahrens, Steffen; Sacht, Stephen] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Sacht, S (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",steffen.ahrens@ifw-kiel.de; stephen.sacht@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,61,4,4,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

I show that the effect of PHI coverage on inpatient and outpatient care utilization is not trivial even in countries with generous public health funding. The main finding is that supplementary PHI coverage increases dental care utilization, but decreases the visits to general practitioners. Private insurance is estimated to have little and insignificant influence on the utilization of inpatient care and outpatient specialist care.

We find that controversial proposals are introduced by countries with a blemished human rights record, and that in the votes on these proposals the council members belonging to the European Union (EU) vote very distinctly from the remaining members and have preferences quite different from those member states that violate human rights. Extending an empirical approach frequently used in parliamentary research we can also show that in votes in the UNHRC preferences of member states dominate over their membership to particular blocs. As controversial votes also heavily polarize the UNHRC we argue that the problems faced by the UNHRC's predecessor, namely the Commission on Human Rights, have reappeared.","[Hug, Simon; Lukacs, Richard] Univ Geneva, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, Dept Sci Polit & Relat Int, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",University of Geneva,"Hug, S (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, Dept Sci Polit & Relat Int, 40 Bd Pont Arve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",simon.hug@unige.ch; richard.lukacs@gmail.com,"Lukacs, Richard/AAG-8956-2019","Hug, Simon/0000-0002-7741-2201",,,,,81,52,58,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

William; Hartley, Daniel A.",,,The long term employment impacts of gentrification in the 1990s,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gentrification; Urban labor markets; Industrial displacement; Central city economic restructuring,DISPLACEMENT,"In the ongoing debate over the social benefits and costs of gentrification, one of the key questions left largely unaddressed by the empirical literature is the degree to which gentrification impacts local labor markets. This paper begins by exploring the nature of employment change in one archetypical gentrifying neighborhood-Chicago's Wicker Park to motivate the central hypothesis that gentrification is associated with industrial restructuring. Next, a detailed analysis is presented on the long-term employment changes in neighborhoods that have experienced gentrification during the 1990s across a sample of 20 large central cities. Specifically, this paper uses Freeman's (2005) definition to define tracts that experienced gentrification and compares employment outcomes in such tracts and those within a 1/4 mile buffer to comparable non-gentrified tracts. This analysis shows that employment grew slightly faster in gentrifying neighborhoods than other portions of the central city. However, jobs in restaurants and retail services tended to replace those lost in goods producing industries. This process of industrial restructuring occurred at a faster rate in gentrifying areas. Thus gentrification can be considered a contributory and catalytic factor in accelerating the shift away from manufacturing within urban labor markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how results can be biased if researchers select genetic variants on the basis of their association with the exposure in their own dataset, as often happens in candidate gene analyses. This can lead to estimates that indicate apparent causal relationships, despite there being no true effect of the exposure. In addition, we discuss the potential bias in estimates of magnitudes of effect from Mendelian randomization analyses when the measured exposure is a poor proxy for the true underlying exposure. We illustrate these points with specific reference to tobacco research. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The need for public intervention in this field comes from the economic characteristics of landscape that is a pure public good and an externality of the economic activities. The landscape policies in Italy are currently essentially based on landscape transformation control and on the payment of subsidies to farmers. Since the landscape policies have a cost for the citizens, in both cases it is necessary to evaluate the benefits coming from public intervention. There are several approaches that could be useful for this but they have to be tailored to the policy instrument adopted. With reference to the Italian experience the paper reviews the researches carried out in Italy in the last fifteen years highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the studies.","Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry Agripolis, Legnaro, PD, Italy",University of Padua,"Tempesta, T (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry Agripolis, Legnaro, PD, Italy.",,"Tempesta, Tiziano/B-2507-2015",,,,,,60,19,20,2,24,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2014,13.0,1,,,,,50,59,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AG2VW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335276200007,0

Yet, there is internal inconsistency with a downward mean shifting in the second responses. Using data from a community-based health insurance survey, this paper aims at testing whether double certainty calibration reduces internal inconsistency in a double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation survey.

Betting houses set betting lines conditional on bettors ex ante beliefs about game outcomes, which implies that the predictive power of the sports betting market could be an unintended consequence of betting house profit maximization. Using this insight, the authors propose a new test of the predictive power of the sports betting market, which incorporates a seldom-used piece of complementary betting information: the over/underthe predicted sum of scores for a game. Since the over/under has the same market properties as the betting line, it should be similarly predictive about the actual outcome, while if bettors have different beliefs about this game feature it need not be predictive. Using the universe of betting lines and over/unders on National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college football, and NCAA college basketball games from 2004 to 2010, the authors test the predictive power of the sports betting market in a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) structure that allows us to characterize both features of the betting market simultaneously. The joint test reveals that while the betting line is an accurate predictor of the margin of victory, the over/under is a poor predictor of the sum of scores. The authors consistently reject the hypothesis that the sports betting market overall functions well as a prediction market.","[Kain, Kyle J.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Logan, Trevon D.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Logan, Trevon D.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kain, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, 424 Hill St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.",kylekain@umich.edu,,,,,,,32,13,14,2,54,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Conceptual issues and extant findings regarding elite militarization,POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS,,,English,Article,,,,,,siloviki; militocracy; FSB state; elite militarization; methodology of elite analysis,SILOVIKI; PUTIN,"The dominant paradigm for understanding contemporary Russia holds that Vladimir Putin's tenure in office has been accompanied by a massive influx of former KGB and military personnel - so-called siloviki - into positions of power and authority throughout the polity and economy. Claims of extensive elite militarization, however, are largely based on the analyses of only one research program and, moreover, the validity of the estimates produced by that research program is open to question on numerous grounds. In this article, we review existing research on elite militarization in Russia; discuss a series of conceptual and empirical issues that need to be resolved if valid and meaningful estimation of military-security representation is to be achieved; introduce new findings; and evaluate the totality of existing evidence regarding whether the Russian state under Putin deserves to be labeled a militocracy. We find that the most straightforward reading of existing data indicates that the percentage of siloviki in the political elite during Putin's first two terms as president was approximately half of that which has been widely reported in both scholarship and the media, and also declined during the Medvedev presidency. In addition, our analysis of a broader cross section of the elite estimates military-security representation during the Putin presidency to have been lower still. Overall, existing data paint a less alarming picture of the depths to which siloviki have penetrated the corridors of power since 2000 than has been commonly portrayed and thereby cast doubt on Russia's status as an FSB state. On the other hand, past trends also provide some basis for expecting that the numbers of siloviki will once again rise during Putin's current presidential term.","[Rivera, David W.; Rivera, Sharon Werning] Hamilton Coll, Dept Govt, Clinton, NY USA",Hamilton College,"Rivera, DW (通讯作者)，Hamilton Coll, Dept Govt, Clinton, NY USA.",drivera@hamilton.edu,,"Rivera, Sharon/0000-0003-1092-8665",,,,,66,25,27,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

This paper shows that so far no radical break with the neoliberal type of competition regulation is heaving into sight. It sets out to explain this from the vantage point of a critical political economy perspective, which identifies the circumstances under which a crisis can result in a regulatory paradigm shift. Contrasting the current situation with the shift in EC/EU competition regulation after the crisis in the 1970s, the paper argues that the preconditions for a fundamental shift in this issue area are not present this time around. Several reasons account for this: the current crisis has been construed by economic and political elites as a crisis within and not of neoliberal capitalism; the social power configuration underpinning the neoliberal order remains unaltered; no clear counter-project has surfaced; the European Commission has been (and remains) in a position to oppose radical changes; and finally, there are no signs of a wider paradigm shift in the EU's regulatory architecture.","[Wigger, Angela] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Buch-Hansen, Hubert] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark",Radboud University Nijmegen; Copenhagen Business School,"Wigger, A (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Thomas van Aquinostr 5-1-34,POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",a.wigger@fm.ru.nl; hb.dbp@cbs.dk,"Wigger, Angela/GZB-9371-2022","Buch-Hansen, Hubert/0000-0002-8279-4179",,,,,94,28,30,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This study investigates how variations in route/haul, carrier and vehicle characteristics affect the optimal vehicle size choice and the associated choice of shipment size. We show that the two choices are derived from the same optimization problem. There can be a continuum of shipment sizes, but decision-makers in freight transport have to choose from a limited number of vehicle alternatives. Therefore, we use a discrete-continuous econometric model where shipment size is modeled as a continuous variable, and vehicle size/type choice as a discrete variable. The results indicate that when faced with higher demand, and during longer trips firms are more likely to use heavier vehicles and ship in larger quantities which suggest that firms are realizing economies of scale and economies of distance. The study also discusses the effect of vehicle operating cost on the vehicle selection process and its policy implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

While their effects on home values have been examined extensively, very few studies have considered an important potential relationship with the price of undeveloped land. This study uses a 16 year panel of Florida property sales and impact fee rates to investigate the effects of various types of impact fee programs on the value of undeveloped residentially and commercially zoned parcels. Three main findings are obtained. First, school impact fee programs decrease the value of residentially zoned land but increase the value of commercially zoned parcels. Second, fees for water and sewer reduce the price of residentially zoned parcels but have no significant effect on commercially zoned land values. Finally, fees for other traditional categories like roads, police, and fire, seem to have stronger negative effects on commercially zoned land than on residentially zoned parcels.

Further, the paper contains empirical results from a survey among 81 managers of Austrian and German manufacturing companies. The paper shows the correlational dependencies of product innovation outcomes on organizational values and analyses perceptions of practitioners on the topic. Further, a condensed value profile necessary for product innovations consisting of trust, performance, pioneering spirit, and market-driven debate and discussion is suggested. Most of all, the paper reveals that manufacturing companies in the sample lack a fit between what they find important for innovation and what they judge their companies to be characteristic of today.

The aim of the research is to analyse the factors affecting the formation of regional clusters in Latvia. First, clusters emerge in the regions where overall economic activity is sufficiently high, so that enterprises have possibilities to interact. The second important factor is the availability of support institutions in the region to secure the availability of both funds and consultancy services, and a faster transfer of innovations and technologies. Third, an essential factor is the availability of population and qualified labour in the region. An important factor is also the attraction of industries to regions, as regional clusters emerge in the industries that develop fast in the region. An analysis of these factors suggests that the situation in Latvia's regions is diversified. A concentration of economically active population, which forms the necessary critical mass for cluster development, is explicitly observed in Riga region. Entrepreneurial activity is also higher in Riga region; yet, it tends to increase in all the regions, and entrepreneurship support institutions are also established in all the regions. An analysis of industries points to region-specific industries whose growth is stronger; thus, the potential for cluster development is higher in service sectors in Riga, Pieriga, Vidzeme and Kurzeme, and manufacturing in Zemgale and Latgale regions.","[Garanti, Zanete; Zvirbule-Berzina, Andra] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,zhanette@gmail.com,"Zvirbule, Andra/AAN-8223-2020; Garanti, Zanete/D-7696-2018; Garanti, Zanete/AAD-7201-2021; Zvirbule, Andra/AAF-5649-2019","Garanti, Zanete/0000-0001-9990-8788; Zvirbule, Andra/0000-0001-7206-7608",,,,,56,1,1,0,7,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9934-8466-3-2,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2014,,36,,,,,33,42,,,,,,10,Economics; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography; Public Administration,BB8OR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347134600003,0

To do that, they need to have a deep understanding of the main factors that drive the decision to buy green food. Considering a high growth potential of Eastern Croatia in terms of production and distribution of green food products, this topic is of the utmost importance for all stakeholders interested in sustainable food industries. This isfurtheremphasizedby the fact that consuming locally grown and processed food is particularly important issue when green food is concerned. The main purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between personal attitudes and intentions to buy green food products. Personal attitudes are widely acknowledged as an influential factor in explaining the reasons for green food purchasing decision. This paper moves a step forward from previous research and investigates specific types of attitudes that facilitate green food purchases. The study is based on the outcomes of a questionnaire completed by a sample of 181 undergraduate and graduate students at the Faculty of Economics in Osijek. Results from regression analysis reveal significant positive relationship between green food purchase intention and personal attitudes related to health consciousness, environmental protection and green food origins. Finally, implications for policy makers, green food producers as well as companies and marketers engaged in the promotion and commercialization of green food products are discussed.","[Jeger, Marina; Ham, Marija; Leko, Vjekoslav] Josip JurajStrossmayer Univ, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Jeger, M (通讯作者)，Josip JurajStrossmayer Univ, Fac Econ Osijek, Gajevtrg 7, Osijek, Croatia.",mjeger@gmail.com; mjeger@gmail.com; leko.vjekoslav@gmail.com,"Stanić, Marina/ABG-1001-2021; Ham, Marija/AAC-3577-2022","Stanić, Marina/0000-0002-3835-6358; Ham, Marija/0000-0003-4390-2218",,,,,29,5,5,1,9,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,354,363,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600033,0

We compare the educational impact of the 1999 violence with the impact of other periods of high-intensity violence during the 25 years of Indonesian occupation. The short-term effects of the conflict are mixed. In the longer term, we find evidence of a substantial loss of human capital among boys in Timor Leste who were exposed to peaks of violence during the 25-year long conflict.

This paper researches effects of religion and religious background (Christianity) on a day-to-day consumer behavior among consumers in a CEE country Slovakia. The study is based on results of interviewing more than 500 participants. The results show, that, although Slovakia is considered a Catholic country (with more than 62% of Catholics according to Census in 2011) the consumer behavior is less and less under the influence of the religion. The strongest projection of religion into consumer behavior is found among senior citizens. The younger the consumer, the less noticeable difference the religion makes. The results show that majority of consumers do not see their consumption anyhow influenced by their religious beliefs. The Christian beliefs and values are more noticeable in their attitudes towards food purchase (mainly during lent) but do not seem to influence the attitude towards Sunday shopping. The results may be found useful for enlarging the theory of consumer behavior trends and perspectives as well as for the practical implications in marketing management.","[Kopanicova, Janka; Klepochova, Dagmar] Univ Econ, Fac Commerce, Dept Mkt, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Kopanicová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Commerce, Dept Mkt, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",jkopanicova@gmail.com; dklepochova@gmail.com,"Kopanicova, Janka/ABD-7049-2021; Kopanicova, Janka/AAC-9447-2021",,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3995-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,261,270,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BF6XQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383767900029,0

Environmental development is a trend that is only in its infancy in Russia, and has the potential for encompassing all industries of the economy, both manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors for which new technology and innovation are vital. The existing environmental situation requires the use of technological innovations in the housing construction and reconstruction to protect the environment. An important problem is that environmental development almost entirely lacks specialists in this field as only a narrow circle of scientists and experts pays attention to this issue. It is necessary to achieve some consistency in the implementation of environmental development in Russia: environmental development should be regulated by environmental law making processes, based on environmental planning of space and environmental design of structures, and use environmental marketing as a tool. There are several international standards applied in the construction in different countries. At the moment, developers are guided by two applicable standards - LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and the oldest one - the British BREEAM regulations (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) that appeared in 1990.

Imported swine are mainly distributed in the eastern China with an expansion tendency from east to west and south to north; cattle are mainly in the northern China; broilers are mainly in the areas with geographical and technical advantages, and layers are shrinking gradually. Econometric analysis of the imports of swine shows that domestic consumption demand, technological progress and supportive policy have positive impacts while import price and domestic supply of improved livestock breeds have negative impacts.

The analysis is performed for three sub-periods in order to capture potential changes in the reactions in time. Our main finding is that though commodity prices are indeed related to real and financial processes in the euro area macroeconomy, the relations have not been stable in time:energy prices and interest rates have departed from the real processes in the precrisis period, whereas the relative importance of real and financial factors have changed for non-energy prices.

The literature highlights the existence of a close relationship between education of executives and their innovation awareness. Few studies conducted in SMEs confirm the link and the impact of competence development on their competitiveness. Innovation plays a key role in building the competitiveness of SMEs, which is conditioned by the competence, especially the competences of management staff. The purpose of the research was to identify relationship between managerial competencies and innovation processes in SMEs. Research methods were theoretical analysis of scientific literature and a direct survey (the instrument of data collection was questionnaires). The quantitative sample of analysing contains 174 managers - representatives of companies (SMEs) located in the Province of Silesia in Poland. A questionnaire consisting of 19 questions with a mixture of Likert-scale and closed-ended questions with one answer was developed. The data was collected in April and May 2014. Data analysis was accomplished using IBM SPSS Statistics 21. In the paper, a theoretical model of managerial competences was built, covering selected areas of knowledge, skills, traits, attitudes and behaviours significant to company innovation. Then, in the empirical research, using this model of managerial competences, it was tested whether the level of company innovation is correlated with the level of managers' competence. Studies on the competences are conducted primarily in large organizations. However, the researchers argue that it is necessary to look at the development of competencies of SMEs differently than in large organizations. In SMEs, it takes a different form and conditions. The presented research filled the gap in knowledge of the importance of managerial competences in the innovation processes in SMEs.","[Szczepanska-Woszczyna, Katarzyna; Dacko-Pikiewicz, Zdzislawa] Acad Business Dabrowa Gornicza, Gornicza, Poland",,"Szczepanska-Woszczyna, K (通讯作者)，Acad Business Dabrowa Gornicza, Gornicza, Poland.",,"Dacko-Pikiewicz, Zdzisława/G-5562-2018",,,,,,13,0,0,0,8,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,333,340,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900043,0

We also find that the odds of obesity and overweight status vary less across neighborhoods for undocumented women than for legal immigrant women. These patterns are not found among immigrant men: undocumented men have lower rates of obesity (by about 6 percentage points in terms of relative odds) and overweight (by about 12 percentage points) than do legal immigrant men, and there is little variation in the impact of neighborhood context across groups of men.

External factors are related to global market dynamics (supply, demand and trade) and new provisions for market liberalization (Common Market Organization for olive oil and table olives, WTO negotiations and bilateral and regional agreements). Internal factors are related to production and export system in Tunisia. Based on this hypothesis, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overall assessment of these factors by analyzing the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, related to their current and future developments. The research uses two methods. The first called SWOT is a diagnostic framework and strategic thinking and a universal, simple and popular decision support tool. The second called Delphi provides the most reliable consensus of a panel of experts using a systematic approach involving several steps to gather views.

This particular concept of labour then combines with a bio-physical definition of production.

While the Oresund trains are subsidized by regional authorities, SJ runs interregional services on a commercial basis in parallel. How do passengers' valuations affect demand? This paper presents the findings of a study conducted to examine the newly deregulated market for train journeys and travelers' preferences as regards two different train operators and several service levels. A stated choice study was conducted among existing train travelers, and a multinomial logit model structure was applied in the study to examine the benefits derived from choosing a specific train. The models are estimated on segments of the train travelers in order to investigate how the preferences differ among different categories of travelers. In addition, more questions were asked on the supply to provide better understanding of the effects. The findings show that fares and short travel times are important factors for interregional passengers (more than 100 km) when they choose an operator on the WCL. Frequency of departures is also important but seems to be less significant when respondents are asked about suitable departure times. However, the importance of traveling time and comfort increases with longer journeys, which gives advantages for the commercial operator (SJ) over Oresund trains. Moreover, well-known SJ was ranked higher than Oresund trains by all passengers except a group of particularly price-sensitive travelers. This case shows that operators together have achieved a better supply and a widened travel market for interregional journeys and also that segmentation has occurred between price-sensitive and time-sensitive passengers.

This means that productive assets are weighted according to their user costs. The user costs of the individual asset classes are estimated based on data from the national accounts and other sources. The results show that, in the observation period between 1991 and 2011, enterprises' capital services expand faster than the officially published capital stock. For the economy as a whole, this applies only to phases of cyclical expansion. As the capital stock is aggregated using asset prices, the differences can be explained by the different weighting methods in conjunction with the varying speeds at which the individual asset types have accumulated over time. In growth accounting, different estimates of total factor productivity emerge. The methodological difference, however, does not significantly affect the estimates of parametric production function specifications.","Deutsch Bundesbank, Zentralbereich Volkswirtschaft, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Knetsch, TA (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Zentralbereich Volkswirtschaft, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",thomas.knetsch@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We examine the adoption of this contract from the 1880s to the 1930s by building and loan (B&L) associations, the nation's most important institutional home mortgage lenders at the time. A chain of complementary innovations by B&Ls gradually reduced the costs of adopting amortization, supporting moderate use by the 1920s. During the crisis of the 1930s, the poor performance of the traditional B&L loan contract radically increased the benefit of adoption, as borrowers demanded the new contract. The adoption examined here occurred primarily in the conventional loan market because B&Ls, unlike other lenders, generally avoided the use of the new Federal Housing Administration insurance program. The New Deal may have had more impact through new federal savings and loan charters, which incorporated many of the complementary innovations that supported the new form of lending.

This finding leads to a discussion of whether one of the major constraints on elite-mass mobilization in Russia is the authoritarian direction such mobilization might entail.","[Chaisty, Paul; Whitefield, Stephen] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Chaisty, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England.",paul.chaisty@politics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,21,34,40,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

While low quotas are politically popular on the mass level, this article argues that low quotas are also a tool of the government to distribute patronage resources to regional political and economic elites. For several years after quotas were instituted, they remained quite controversial, and during this time decisions about them were firmly in the hands of Vladimir Putin, first as president and then as prime minister, giving him a powerful tool to control the immigration process and labour market manually.

Long-run results indicate that the extent of convergence among the regional housing markets substantially increased over time and more so after the housing bubble burst in the latter part of 2006. Common stochastic trend analysis reveals that the housing regions of New England, Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific were the primary regional drivers that led the regions toward long-run equilibrium during the 1975 to 2006 subperiod. Further analysis indicates that the relationships among the regions cannot be attributed to trends in two important macroeconomic fundamentals: regional per capita income and regional GDP. Finally, short-run analysis reveals substantial lead lag relationships among all the markets.","[Yunus, Nafeesa] Univ Baltimore, Dept Finance & Econ, Merrick Sch Business, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Swanson, Peggy E.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Baltimore; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Yunus, N (通讯作者)，Univ Baltimore, Dept Finance & Econ, Merrick Sch Business, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",nafeesa.yunus@gmail.com; swason@uta.edu,,,,,,,54,27,27,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SEP,2013,41.0,3,,,,,542,568,,10.1111/reec.12012,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,217AZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324330200004,0

All existing econometric forecasting models of vehicle type choice in the literature have so far considered objective measures as determinants of vehicle type choice. The proposed choice model considers 12 car-type alternatives and is successively extended to allow for choice probability distortions resulting from individual heterogeneity across a set of 30 variables, related to objective, behavioural and psychographic consumer characteristics. The results provide clear evidence that variables such as purpose of car use, prepurchase information source used, consumer's proneness towards buying an ecological car, consumer's involvement with cars, and consumer's attachment to cars, significantly affect car type choice. The results yield important implications for manufacturers, transportation planners and researchers. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Going back to the Brundtland Report, we redefine the concept of 'sustainable passenger transport' and suggest an assessment method based on four equally important, main dimensions: safeguarding long-term ecological sustainability, satisfying basic transport needs, and promoting intra- and intergenerational equity. We also define indicators and threshold values that have to be met for each of these dimensions and then illustrate how to achieve sustainable passenger transport. (C) 2013 The Authors.

However, to date, the burgeoning literature on activation has tended to overlook its link with the highly gendered nature of welfare. This article presents the first comparative analysis of activation approaches for partnered women in the UK, Australia and Denmark. Three core arguments are put forward that emphasize how the ideas (causal claims, beliefs and assumptions) articulated by key policy actors were crucial to both the construction and delivery of activation policies. First, women's differentiated access to benefits directly conflicted with the focus on the individual within activation policies. Second, activation was premised upon paid labour, embodying ideational assumptions about the meaning of (paid) work, in turn devaluing caring labour. Third, the problematization' of women outside the labour market resulted in their gendered processing' through the social security and activation systems.","[Ingold, Jo] Univ Leeds, Ctr Employment Relat Innovat & Change, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Etherington, David] Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London N17 8HR, England",University of Leeds; Middlesex University,"Ingold, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Ctr Employment Relat Innovat & Change, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",j.ingold@leeds.ac.uk,,"Ingold, Jo/0000-0001-8088-8262",,,,,53,25,27,0,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In this article we explore this relationship at the international level instead. We examine the way in which the two phenomena in the form of the ILO and the EU relate to one another. Adopting a discursive institutionalist approach and focusing on flexicurity, we investigate whether, how and under what conditions the discourse on flexicurity provides a point of convergence or divergence between globalisation and Europeanisation. Our empirical data reveals attempts by the European Commission to use globalisation as a legitimating device for a market-accommodating programme for labour market reform. The ILO remains more sceptical, both about the overall effects of globalisation and the more concrete uses of flexicurity. Meanwhile, the concept of flexicurity is subject to change and rearticulation in line with the evolving policy agenda endorsed by the Commission and/or the member states. The relationship between Europe and globalisation is thus far from neutral. Europe' is active in shaping globalisation; translated into the work undertaken here, Europeanisation could be conceived as a facet of globalisation rather than as a bulwark to it, or merely as a process running parallel to it.","[Tsarouhas, Dimitris] Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Ladi, Stella] Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London E1 4NS, England",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; University of London,"Tsarouhas, D (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey.",dimitris@bilkent.edu.tr,"Tsarouhas, Dimitris/H-6131-2019","Tsarouhas, Dimitris/0000-0002-3370-3867",,,,,64,8,9,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Instead, we find that behavioral factors such as consumer sentiments contribute to the mispricing of REIT prices.","[Hong, Gwangheon] Sogang Univ, Coll Business, Seoul 121742, South Korea; [Lee, Bong Soo] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Sogang University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Lee, BS (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",ghong@sogang.ac.kr; blee2@cob.fsu.edu,"Lee, BongSoo/AAP-3262-2020",,,,,,66,6,10,2,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we find that ethnic Chinese FDI firms in China in fact underperform nonethnic Chinese FDI firms. We also find that the performance of ethnic Chinese firms deteriorates over time. We present evidence consistent with the hypothesis that ethnic Chinese firms underinvest in those firm attributes that may contribute to long-term performance, such as human capital and technology.

In this paper we see that this negative effect could also be the result of other access restrictions, like load factor restrictions, and may be related to factors other than the number of vehicles and total distance travelled. Such as if the distribution center is in the outskirts of the City and customers are situated outside the city center. In this study a common urban distribution network scenario is presented - the milk run - where only the load factor is changed. Increasing the load factor is usually regarded as a way of improving efficiency, but we observe that under certain conditions improving the load factor affects economic and environmental sustainability, by increasing total costs and emissions. Following insights from this study, policy makers and companies should be careful when using single key performance indicators in urban freight distribution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To address the imperfect substitutability between immigrant and native labor, we use information on the occupational distribution of immigrants and natives of similar educational attainment to learn about the equivalency of skilled immigrants to skilled and unskilled natives.

The evidence suggests that Brazilian governments institutionalized a hybrid policy regime that layers economically liberal priorities originating in the Washington Consensus and more interventionist ones associated with neo-developmentalist thinking. To capture this hybridity, the study calls this regime liberal neo-developmentalism'. While defending the goal of macroeconomic stability and sidelining full employment, Brazilian governments also reduced reliance on foreign savings and employed a largely off-the-books stimulus package during the crisis. Brazil experienced important privatization, liberalization and deregulation reforms, but at the same time the state consolidated its role as owner and investor in industry and banking while using an open economy industrial policy and a cautious approach to the free movement of capital. Finally, while conditional cash transfers fit the Washington Consensus, Brazil's steady increases in the minimum wage, industrial policies targeted at high employment sectors and the use of state-owned firms to expand welfare and employment programs better fit a neo-developmentalist policy regime. In sum, while the main goals of the Washington Consensus were not replaced with neo-developmentalist ones, Brazil's policy regime saw an extensive transformation of policy orthodoxy that reflects Brazil's status as an emerging power.","Boston Univ, Dept Int Relat, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Ban, C (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Int Relat, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,"Ban, Cornel/P-4757-2019",,,,,,129,110,124,0,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The study explores the experiences of 134 women union leaders, the majority of whom are long-term union participants. The findings reveal that commitment is strengthened by women's experience of both expressive and intrinsic rewards but that such rewards are offset by costs, some of which are universal to union leadership, but others are particularly gendered. It was found that while a gendered collective identity may inform union collective identity, it is the union collective identity and associated solidarity that remains dominant in contemporary British and American women's union leadership.","[Kirton, Gill] Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Ctr Res Equal & Divers, London E1 4NS, England; [Healy, Geraldine] Univ London, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; University of London,"Kirton, G (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Ctr Res Equal & Divers, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",G.Kirton@qmul.ac.uk,"Healy, Geraldine/ABB-9892-2020","Kirton, Gill/0000-0002-9280-991X",,,,,45,26,28,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

For this, we construct a unique panel data-set and formulate a spatial panel econometric model with fixed country effects for the period of 19802009. A special feature of the proposed empirical model is that cross-country interdependence in energy prices surfaces through two channels, a metric of similarity towards energy policy and a metric of trade in energy goods. We estimate the parameters of that model and conduct several comparative static experiments. We find that higher income per capita and lower efficiency in energy distribution tend to raise energy prices whereas higher net imports of energy and more abundant energy resource endowments reduce them. We also find that bilateral trade in energy goods is an important channel of transmission of shocks in energy prices across countries. The estimation results suggest that countries that use the same types of resources to generate energy are likely to transmit energy price shocks to each other through competition effects.","[Egger, Peter H.; Kesina, Michaela; Nigai, Sergey] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Egger, PH (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.",,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207; Kesina, Michaela/0000-0002-3223-0973",,,,,28,2,2,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2013,36.0,3,,,SI,,349,362,,10.1111/twec.12055,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,107OY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316229000006,0

The model can facilitate the availability of various pedestrian flows and a range of operating times. With some efforts of computer programming, the situations where multiple booths are available were simulated to identify pedestrian movement. The developed simulation model captures important details, such as travel time, wait time, queue length and the number of waiting pedestrians with the different number of pedestrian flows and booths.

This paper studies the optimal design of groups to maximize racial and ethnic integration. We show that the group composition that maximizes integration of associations depends critically on the strength of homophily in an intuitive way. We use data on associations among high school students to measure actual integration. We find that non-Hispanics and Hispanics integrate even in groups that are heavily mixed, but that non-blacks do not integrate with blacks until most of a group is black. Consequently, schools with even mixes of Hispanics and non-Hispanics maximize ethnic integration, whereas integration of non-blacks and blacks is maximized with relatively uneven distributions of blacks and non-blacks (i.e. in groups that appear not to be very integrated at all).

Ensuring a certain level of regulations can increase port efficiency, while an excess of the level may result in the reverse of these gains. Addressing seaport-related issues is not a simple undertaking because a seaport is regarded as a system-of-system, which is both difficult to understand and to model. Therefore, studies that adequately analyze the overall dynamic of a port complex in terms of security concerns have been seen insufficient, leaving a significant research gap to fill in. To analyze the relationship between seaport security levels and container volumes, this study adopts the method of System Dynamics (SD). Use of the SD can demonstrate the benefits of simulations, such as suggesting the visual causal loops among evaluation factors, representing the several sub-models, and enabling various forms of analysis, such as the base model, optimistic scenario model, and pessimistic scenario model. As a result of simulation, the impacts on handling container cargo volumes in Korea due to the increasing level of security is estimated at 2,770,000 TEUs by the year 2015 and 3,050,000 TEUs by 2020. Appropriate tailor of the proposed SD based methodology can stimulate security-economic quantitative analysis in a wider range of port context, thus promoting effective implementation of security measures.

Alternatively, it could be that, in the long run, lower-educated men adapt better to continued unemployment or downward mobility. Fixed effects regression analyses show that job loss increases distress, but over time the effect wears off and is limited to non-employed men. We find that higher-educated men experience less distress following job loss.

Instead, his research provides a targeted critique of specific management practices and of those social transformations that share the same ethos. More constructively, Sennett's sociology articulates a unique concept of workplace insecurity and raises pressing issues in contemporary experiences of work and citizenship, rather than - as critics presuppose - in workers' contractual conditions as such.","[Tweedie, Dale] Macquarie Univ, Dept Philosophy, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Tweedie, D (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",dale.tweedie@mq.edu.au,,"Tweedie, Dale/0000-0001-7887-1680",,,,,33,22,24,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

European elections have provided Eurosceptic parties with an opportunity to get parliamentary representation. While there is a burgeoning literature on the Eurosceptic stances of these parties, there remains relatively little research on their strategies once inside the European Parliament. This article analyzes how Eurosceptic MEPs from the untidy right conceive and carry out their representative mandate in an institution they despise. First, it takes an historical perspective to show that despite the persistence of Euroscepticism in the European Union's elected chamber, the body of research remains comparatively limited. Second, it examines the institutional constraints faced by Eurosceptic representatives resulting from the institutional environment and the ideological heterogeneity of these actors. The final part proposes a typology of parliamentary roles to account for their attitudes and behaviours inside the chamber.","Univ Libre Bruxelles, CEVIPOL, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Brack, N (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, CEVIPOL, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,CP 124, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",Nathalie.Brack@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,,41,17,24,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

First, we report various correlations among labour market variables at different leads and lags and at various frequencies (growth rates and cycles), and compare them across countries. Second, we investigate the time-varying nature of these features paying attention to times of financial distress. We conclude that there are robust relations among the variables across countries and times at business cycle frequency, that the cyclical comovement between real output and selected labor market indicators is strong. On the other hand, correlations in growth rates are not similar across countries and times. The paper concludes with our assessment of what these findings imply for dynamic general-equilibrium macroeconomic models with labour market.","[Bruha, Jan; Polansky, Jiri] Czech Natl Bank, Macroecon Forecasting Div, Prague 1, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank,,Jan.Bruha@cnb.cz; Jiri.Polansky@cnb.cz,"Bruha, Jan/E-7147-2016",,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,95,100,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000017,0

The Kalman filter provides an effective solution to the linear Gaussian filtering problem. However, when state/measurement functions are highly non-linear, and posterior probability distribution of the state is non-Gaussian, the optimal linear filter and its modifications do not provide satisfactory results. We propose the Sequential Monte Carlo method, known generically as particle filter, which combines importance sampling and resampling schemes. In particular, we present a construction of an auxiliary particle filter algorithm using the Pearson curves technique for approximation of importance weights of simulated particles. The effectiveness of the method is discussed and illustrated by numerical results based on the simulated stochastic volatility process SV.","[Brzozowska-Rup, Katarzyna] Kielce Univ Technol, Fac Math, PL-25314 Kielce, Poland",Kielce University of Technology,"Brzozowska-Rup, K (通讯作者)，Kielce Univ Technol, Fac Math, Al Tysiaclecia Panstwa Polskiego 7, PL-25314 Kielce, Poland.",brzozows@poczta.fm,,"Brzozowska-Rup, Katarzyna/0000-0003-1231-8027",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-52-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,33,40,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367243900004,0

Evidence shows that central banks respond linearly to deviations of expected inflation from the target (the inflation gap) in Brazil and Chile. As the inflation gap widens, policy responses become weaker in Colombia and Mexico, a finding that most probably reflects a history of adverse supply shocks rather than a lack of resolve from the monetary authorities.

Okun observed the negative correlation between the two variables. The relation shows persistency in results over the long-term period. Now, students of economics learn that for 1 % excess of the natural unemployment rate, 2-3 % gross domestic product gap occurs. However, these numbers are based on empirical analysis from the data of the US economy. The main aim of this article is to ascertain validity of the Okun's Law regarding the selected Newly Industrialized Countries - Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in 1990 - 2010. The analysis is based on two versions of Okun's law - the difference and the gap version of the Okun's law.

In contrast, the role and importance of firms that switch activities from one sector to another is not well understood. Firm switchers are likely to be unique, differing from both newly established entrants and exiting firms that are closing down operations. In this study, we develop an empirical model that examines switching behavior using data from Vietnamese manufacturing firms during the 20012008 period. The diagnostic shows that switching firms exhibit different characteristics and behavior than do entry and exit firms. Switchers tend to be labor intensive and to seek competitive opportunities in labor-intensive sectors in response to changes in market environments. Moreover, resource reallocation resulting from switching forms an important component of productivity growth. The topic of switching merits attention in the future design of firm surveys across developing countries and in associated analytical studies.","[Newman, Carol] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Rand, John; Tarp, Finn] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",Trinity College Dublin; University of Copenhagen,,cnewman@tcd.ie; jra@foi.ku.dk; Finn.Tarp@econ.ku.dk,"Tarp, Finn/T-9651-2017; Newman, Carol/J-6421-2012","Tarp, Finn/0000-0002-6247-4370; Newman, Carol/0000-0002-1785-0891; Rand, John/0000-0001-7028-4772",,,,,30,13,14,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

To achieve this goal it is necessary to take several steps. Athletic track cadastre for the region should be developed with reference to the existing tracks in Croatia, illustrate the possibility of constructing athletic tracks and venues in combination with other sports fields, focus on the size of land for construction and the cost in relation to the number of running lanes at the track and sports fields. Next step would be to explore the possibility of constructing sixty, two hundred, three hundred thirty three and four hundred meters athletic tracks with an emphasis on construction of unified compact two hundred meters athletic tracks with basic venues and multifunctional sports fields situated on outer areas of elementary and high schools. It is necessary to emphasize the importance of obtaining certificate or consent for the project solution by the Croatian athletics federation, Olympic committee, line ministry and Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb, to analyze the cost-effectiveness (validity) of constructing athletic tracks with venues and sports fields at regional level. By implementing the above steps it is possible to positively influence the sport culture in elementary and high school, and the development of basic sports (athletics) which is a predisposition for all other sports.

Research methodology is based on descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of financial reports of the studied companies to warn about the influence. Empirical research of financial reports of large companies in Slavonia and Baranja in the period from 1999 to 2008 and statistical analysis of results led to the conclusion that only some of the analysed liquidity ratios are of key importance in warning about business decline.

To the extent that the social stigma of obesity is a risk factor and family instability represents the potential compromise of important protective factors, their convergence may disrupt socioemotional health, especially during periods of heightened social uncertainty. Drawing on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study found that obese youth at the start of high school had higher levels of internalizing symptoms and lower levels of perceived social integration in school only when they had also experienced multiple family transitions since birth. This pattern, however, did not hold for boys, and it did not extend to overweight (as opposed to obese) adolescents of either gender. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, a concave Pareto Frontier is numerically approximated. The concavity of the Pareto Frontier is a consequence of the information asymmetry between the Principal and the Agent. The underlying Multi-Objective framework allows us to consider more powerful assumptions than those used in the traditional Single-Objective optimization approach. As contracts move in the Pareto Frontier (trade-off surface) towards those that are more advantageous to the Agent, the prevalence of compensation plans in which the Principal assumes most of the risk of the productive activity are observed. When the Principal and the Agent are more patient, both obtain higher values of their discounted expected utilities, which generates a higher level of economic surplus. The Agent faces lower variability in future compensation when it is costlier for him to exert an additional effort unit.

We show that the public provision of health investments and the existence of a private system of old-age insurance (i.e., transfers from children to parents) may cause the birth and death of multiple (three) steady states, deterministic chaos and bubbling phenomena when individuals have perfect foresight. Interestingly, however, we show that periodic dynamics (cycles) or complex dynamics (chaos) and global stability of the economy can endogenously be reconciled in the model, because the rise either in public health investments or transfers from young to old people can have the potential to smooth and ultimately suppress endogenous fluctuations in the cases of existence of both a single steady state or multiple steady states.","[Gori, Luca] Univ Genoa, Dept Law, I-16126 Genoa, Italy; [Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Genoa; University of Pisa,"Gori, L (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Law, Via Balbi 30-19, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.",lfanti@ec.unipi.it; luca.gori@unige.it,,"Gori, Luca/0000-0003-1967-0840",,,,,87,1,1,4,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Using unobserved components (UC) time series models, univariate time series analysis suggests that recorded burglary (theft) data is subject to stochastic cycle processes with typical business cycle frequencies of approximately 5 and 10 years. In the multivariate UC time series framework, recorded burglary (theft) is simultaneously modelled in a trivariate model, together with unemployment and real GDP time series. We also estimate a five-variate model, where we simultaneously model burglary, theft, unemployment, real GDP, and police variables. Some interesting findings in these analyses are: (i) observed cyclical behaviour in recorded property crime is almost fully determined by the economic business cycles; (ii) explanatory variables such as sentence length, imprisonment and conviction rates affect the short-term dynamics more than the long-term dynamics; (iii) motivational and opportunity effects between macroeconomic and crime time series can be distinguished in our modelling framework.","[Vujic, Suncica] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Koopman, Siem Jan; Commandeur, Jacques J.

Does self-employment facilitate more equal gender divisions of labour? This article uses the Australian Time Use Survey to identify associations between self-employment and mothers' and fathers' time in paid work, domestic labour and childcare and when during the day they perform these activities. The time self-employed mothers devote to each activity differs substantially from that of employee mothers, while fathers' time is relatively constant across employment types. Working from home is highly correlated with self-employment for mothers, implying the opportunity to be home-based is a pull factor in mothers becoming self-employed. Results suggest mothers use self-employment to combine earning and childcare whereas fathers prioritize paid work regardless of employment type.

For Canada and the United States, we found that more pronounced anti-herding leads to lower forecast accuracy.","[Ruelke, Jan-Christoph] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Dept Econ, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany; [Pierdzioch, Christian] Univ Saarland, Dept Econ, D-66041 Saarbrucken, Germany; [Stadtmann, Georg] Europa Univ Viadrina Frankfurt Oder, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany; [Stadtmann, Georg] Univ So Denmark SDU, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; Saarland University; European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder,"Rülke, JC (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Dept Econ, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany.",jan-c.ruelke@whu.edu,,,,,,,19,8,8,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

They have been introduced into the economic domain for both theoretical and empirical reasons. Among the few scholars who have proposed formal approaches to illustrate how we-thinking arises, Bacharach offers one of the most developed theories from the game theoretic point of view. He presents a number of intuitions, not always mutually consistent and not fully developed. In this article, I propose a way to complete Bacharach's theory, generalizing the interdependence hypothesis and building on his intuition about vacillation. It is a simple model of vacillation between the I and we-modes of reasoning, as a way in which we-thinking can come to mind in the face of a decision problem. The vacillation model makes we-reasoning more easily usable in game theory.","[Smerilli, Alessandra] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Smerilli, Alessandra] PFSE Auxilium, Rome, Italy",University of East Anglia,"Smerilli, A (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",alessandra.smerilli@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,17,17,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2012,73.0,4,,,,,539,560,,10.1007/s11238-012-9294-7,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,989EP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307543400004,0

Regression analysis based on bootstrapping shows that surprises in the target federal funds rate (the target factor) have a significantly positive impact on the 1-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rate within the week of the Federal Open Market Committee announcements and the positive impact lasts up to 1 week after the announcements. Surprises in the future direction of the Federal Reserve monetary policy (the path factor) have significantly positive impacts on both the 1-year ARM rate and the 30-year fixed mortgage rates in the first week after the announcement. Furthermore, the responses of mortgage rates are asymmetric and affected by the size of monetary policy surprises, the stage of the business cycle and whether the monetary policy is tightening or loosening. There also exists heterogeneity in the mortgage rate pass-through process across regions and monetary policy surprises have differential impacts on the regional mortgage rates. The cross-region variations are mainly correlated with the regional housing market conditions, such as home vacancy and rental vacancy rates.","[Xu, Pisun] Univ Denver, Reiman Sch Finance, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Han, Yufeng; Yang, Jian] Univ Denver, Sch Business, Denver, CO 80217 USA",University of Denver; University of Denver,"Xu, PS (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Reiman Sch Finance, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",pxu@du.edu; Yufeng.Han@ucdenver.edu; Jian.Yang@ucdenver.edu,"Yang, Jian/J-5089-2013","Yang, Jian/0000-0002-4073-9796",,,,,29,4,4,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2012,40.0,3,,,,,461,507,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2011.00325.x,0.0,,,47,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,996KV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308086900003,0

In terms of seasonality, almost all previous studies have analysed tourism demand from the point of view either of total arrivals or the number of tourists lodged in a single accommodation type (hotels, rural accommodation, etc). However, there are no studies focusing on price seasonality or comparing seasonality among different accommodation types. By using seasonality indicators and a price index constructed by means of hedonic methods, this paper aims to shed some light on seasonal pricing patterns among second home rentals and hotels. The paper relies on a 2004 database of 144 hotels and 1,002 apartments on the Costa Brava (northeast Spain). The results show that prices for second home rentals display a smoother seasonal pattern than hotels due to reduced price differences between shoulder (May and October) and peak periods (August).","[Salo, Albert] Res Grp Tourism Management GRUGET, ESADE, E-08172 Sant Cugat Del Valles, Spain; [Garriga, Anna; Rigall-I-Torrent, Ricard] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Fac Ciencies Econ & Empresarials, Girona 17071, Spain; [Vila, Mar; Sayeras, Josep M.] Res Grp Tourism Management GRUGET, ESADE, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE); Universitat de Girona; Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE),"Saló, A (通讯作者)，Res Grp Tourism Management GRUGET, ESADE, Av Torre Blanca 59, E-08172 Sant Cugat Del Valles, Spain.",albert.salo@esade.edu; anna.garriga@udg.edu; ricard.rigall@udg.edu; mar.vila@esade.edu; josepm.sayeras@esade.edu,"Garriga-Ripoll, Anna/ABF-8226-2021; VILA, MAR/I-1141-2015; Rigall-I-Torrent, Ricard/G-1494-2010","Rigall-I-Torrent, Ricard/0000-0002-6498-6580",,,,,40,17,21,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Labor market recoveries have long been thought of as lagging recoveries in broad economic activity. In particular, the unemployment rate peaks several months after official business cycle troughs and the average duration of unemployment lags further behind. Using estimates from Markov switching models of the unemployment rate, average duration of unemployment, jobless claims, and the exhaustion rate of regular unemployment insurance, this paper dates contractionary and expansionary phases of various aspects of the labor market and their relationship to the official phases of the business cycle. Evidence from these models suggests that inflows into unemployment recover almost contemporaneously with broad economic activity, while outflows recover almost a year after the end of official recessions. The differential timing in the recoveries of unemployment inflows and outflows, which is not a characteristic of most macro models of the labor market, accounts for the observed pattern between the unemployment rate and average duration of unemployment. Finally, when comparing the phases of the labor market to periods where Congress extends unemployment insurance benefits, it appears that policymakers target periods where the job finding rate is low, rather than periods where the stock of unemployed workers is high.","Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA",Loyola University Maryland,"Schwartz, J (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 4501 N Charles St,Sellinger 315, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA.",jsschwartz1@loyola.edu,"Campos Quispe, Andres/B-4247-2014",,,,,,30,6,6,0,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Although these models differ in terms of structure, estimation method, sample period, and data vintage, we find surprisingly similar economic impacts of unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate.

One purpose behind introducing the copper standard was to use its monopoly position at the European markets to manipulate the international copper prices, implementing a kind of copper mercantilism. This paper presents a model of an early modern copper monopolist that could price discriminate between two different uses for copper: copper for export and copper for minting. The paper concludes that authorities did not completely conform to this rent-seeking model, since there were also other considerations behind minting policy, such as providing a stable monetary system. The model shows that under profit-maximisation minting should have been even higher and the price of copper money lower, but at periods minting and prices approached the optimal state. In the 17th century, the market for copper money was probably too small relative the huge copper production, but by the 17205 and 1730s, when copper production had declined, the copper standard functioned more smoothly.

Our model results show that forward transactions in the housing market are probably not due to house sellers' and buyers' heterogeneity, but to their demand for hedging against house price risk. When the imperfections of real estate markets and the risk preferences of market participants are taken into consideration, we are able to show that the idiosyncratic risk premium, which mainly depends on the participants' risk preferences and the correlation between the traded asset and the real estate, is a remarkable determinant of house sellers' and buyers' forward reservation prices. In addition, we also find that the market clearing forward price usually will not converge toward the expected risk-neutral forward price. The sellers' or buyers' risk aversion degrees and market powers are also identified to play crucial roles in determining the clearing forward price.","[Fan, Gang-Zhi] Konkuk Univ, Dept Real Estate, Seoul 143701, South Korea; [Pu, Ming] SW Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Chengdu 610074, Peoples R China; [Ong, Seow Eng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore",Konkuk University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; National University of Singapore,"Fan, GZ (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Real Estate, 1 Hwayang Dong, Seoul 143701, South Korea.",fan10@konkuk.ac.kr; puming@swufe.edu.cn; seong@nus.edu.sg,"Ong, Seow Eng/ABB-9098-2020",,,,,,38,8,9,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Tourism supply is defined in terms of the lodging capacity of hotel establishments in about 250 tourist destinations. The paper shows that the empirical distribution of tourism supply in Portugal is heavy-tailed and consistent with a power law behaviour in its upper tail. Such behaviour seems to be stable over the years, provided that, for the time horizon covered by the data sets, the scaling parameter is always close to the value of two. The power law hypothesis is tested positively through the use of graphical and analytical methods. Cooperation among stakeholders and the enlargement of the base for tourism supply are the main policy implications drawn from the power law analysis to avoid the threat of a fall in tourist arrivals in Portugal.","Univ Palermo, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Sci Stat & Matemat Silvio Vianelli D, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Provenzano, D (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Sci Stat & Matemat Silvio Vianelli D, Ed 13,Via Sci,Parco DOrleans, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",davide.provenzano@unipa.it,"Provenzano, Davide/I-4147-2019","Provenzano, Davide/0000-0003-0674-0387",,,,,30,7,8,3,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In this article, we tackle the issue by providing a positive analysis to the ongoing discussion about the future of publicly financed ECEC services. We present a model of a subject-based financing system for ECEC services with tradable vouchers. On the basis of this model, it is shown that by introducing tradable vouchers a more efficient allocation of resources is possible.

Using pre- and post-migration earnings and their earnings in the US from the American Community Survey (ACS), we characterise the selection of migrants on observable and non-observable characteristics. Merging the data with US ACS data, we can also measure the expected earnings premium of migration to the US and the earnings premium for those that returned to Mexico. We find that migrants respond to the expected earnings premium to migration, once we control for migration costs. Also, the structure of the premium across skill groups generates negative selection on average and it can explain selection on observable and unobservables. We also find that returnees are more positively selected over skills than migrants to the US. Initial poverty, old age and family ties are strong deterrents of migration to the US, once we account for the skill-specific migration premium. We also find a strong under-representation of college educated among migrants to the US, possibly a consequence of the fact that undocumented migration is not an attractive option for those individuals.","[Ambrosini, J.

First, we argue for the output-gap view that the business cycle corresponds to transitory deviations in economic activity away from a permanent, or trend, level. Then we investigate the extent to which a general model-based approach to estimating trend and cycle for the U.S. economy leads to measures of the business cycle that reflect models versus the data. We find empirical support for a nonlinear time series model that produces a business cycle measure with an asymmetric shape across NBER expansion and recession phases. Specifically, this business cycle measure suggests that recessions are periods of relatively large and negative transitory fluctuations in output. However, several close competitors to the nonlinear model produce business cycle measures of widely differing shapes and magnitudes. Given this model-based uncertainty, we construct a model-averaged measure of the business cycle. This measure also displays an asymmetric shape and is closely related to other measures of economic slack such as the unemployment rate and capacity utilization.","[Morley, James] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Piger, Jeremy] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Oregon,"Morley, J (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,"Morley, James C/J-9166-2012; Piger, Jeremy/I-7643-2012","Piger, Jeremy/0000-0001-6592-9986; Morley, James/0000-0003-2380-6747",,,,,37,112,123,1,28,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

A tool that could be used to ensure high-quality offerings and the sustainability of festivals as tourist attractions is described and demonstrated in this article. The three largest arts festivals in South Africa (Potchefstroom, Grahamstown and Oudtshoorn) were studied. Five different attributes - festival brands, ticket prices, entertainment activities, food and beverages and transport to venues - were developed to describe arts festivals. Conjoint analysis was used in a linear regression model with individual ratings for each festival product. The average of the r-squares was 0.83. Game theory was applied as a tool to determine the different combinations of attributes that gave each of the three festival scenarios an optimum position in its niche market. Similarly, the tool can be applied to festivals in various contexts to ensure that optimal quality is achieved.","Univ S Africa, Dept Transport Econ Logist & Tourism Management, ZA-0003 Unisa, South Africa",University of South Africa,"van Zyl, C (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Transport Econ Logist & Tourism Management, POB 392, ZA-0003 Unisa, South Africa.",vzylc@unisa.ac.za,,"Van Zyl, Cina/0000-0002-9302-6677",,,,,41,11,14,5,39,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

However, m-banking has still not been extended to rural Bangladesh. To fill the gap this research surveyed 550 SMEs owners/managers in four rural villages. The result indicates that poor banking facilities, cost, credibility, gender, education and SME category are the main factors that significantly influence the intention to adopt m-banking. The analysis introduces three factors which have been largely overlooked in prior literature. The study broadens our understanding of m-banking and provides insights into developing m-banking strategies in Bangladesh.

From this study, it was found that intellectual property rights policy pertaining patents should become part of firm's business strategy. Implementing IPR will safeguard firm's new invention, innovation or processes in the long run. Furthermore, firm may gain benefits in creating new business opportunity during various patenting stages. Strict enforcement of IPR could yield better incentives on innovation. In the long run, revenue obtained from IPR can be used to finance innovation and R&D activities. Implementation of IPR has tendencies to stimulate more research, innovation and have potential to reduce manufacturing employment. Applying innovative and creative ideas by protecting it through intellectual property rights is able to help firm's long term success. We discuss that IPR can become as firm's business strategy, which can contribute for benefits of the innovation and creativity, improvement in products that will increase profit margins and gain royalty revenue through patented inventions from companies who commercialize the product.","[Anuar, Herman Shah; Zulhumadi, Faisal; Udin, Zulkifli Mohamed] Univ Utara Malaysia, UUM Coll Business, Sch Technol Management & Logist, Sintok, Kedah, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,,herman@uum.edu.my; faisal@uum.edu.my; zulkifli@uum.edu.my,"Udin, Zulkifli Mohamed/AAY-4983-2021; Zulhumadi, Faisal/F-5059-2010","Udin, Zulkifli Mohamed/0000-0003-2211-0326; Zulhumadi, Faisal/0000-0002-2545-7002",,,,,11,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,706,715,,,,,,10,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700072,0

A game of chicken is played considering two types of agents: 'unconditional cooperators', who always cooperate, and 'strategic cooperators', who do not cooperate unless it is in their interest to do so. Overall, our data show a much higher propensity to cooperate than predicted by theory. They also suggest that agent heterogeneity matters: the higher the proportion of 'strategic cooperators' in the population, the higher their probability to cooperate. Finally, our data confirm that higher rewards to cooperation (embedded in the payoff structure) tend to lower defection.

The objective of the paper is not to claim that there has been no such structural mutation, but that the studies which allegedly demonstrate this mutation are compromised by the anaemic geographies that structure and animate them. Such studies, the paper argues, fetishise the national scale and, in doing so, offer a restricted and potentially misleading reading of trends such as, most notably, historic growth in the share of corporate profits accruing to 'finance' within individual countries. Examining empirical data for the UK, but explicitly incorporating the international perspective typically missing from existing studies of financialisation, the paper points to the vital role of international expansion by UK financial institutions in growing the financial sector's share of profits. Whether so-called 'financialisation' has also contributed to this growth remains, the paper submits, open to question.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Christophers, B (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Box 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",ebrett.christophers@kultgeog.uu.se,,,,,,,61,75,84,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

(Econometrica 60:1171-1186, 1992) introduced the Ordinal Nash Bargaining Solution. They prove that Pareto optimality, ordinal invariance, ordinal symmetry, and IIA characterize this solution. A feature of their work is that attention is restricted to a domain of social choice problems with an infinite set of basic allocations. We introduce an alternative approach to solving finite social choice problems using a new notion called the Ordinal Egalitarian (OE) bargaining solution. This suggests the middle ranked allocation (or a lottery over the two middle ranked allocations) of the Pareto set as an outcome. We show that the OE solution is characterized by weak credible optimality, ordinal symmetry and independence of redundant alternatives. We conclude by arguing that what allows us to make progress on this problem is that with finite choice sets, the counting metric is a natural and fully ordinal way to measure gains and losses to agents seeking to solve bargaining problems.","[Conley, John P.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Wilkie, Simon] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Vanderbilt University; University of Southern California,"Conley, JP (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",j.p.conley@vanderbilt.edu; swilkie@usc.edu,,,,,,,31,5,5,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2012,38.0,1,,,,,23,42,,10.1007/s00355-010-0516-z,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,859AM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297846100003,0

A detailed review of the evidence suggests that the weakness of competition from the 1930s to the 1970s undermined productivity growth but since the 1970s stronger competition has been a key ingredient in ending relative economic decline. The productivity implications of the retreat from competition resulted in large part from interactions with idiosyncratic British institutional structures in terms of corporate governance and industrial relations.

The optimality criterion for estimating the selling price is the maximization of net present value (NPV) of the production, from which the machine is phased out. The mutually acceptable price is the price that will improve the economic balance of the operation not only to the seller but to the buyer as well (in comparison with the acquisition and operation of new machinery in production). Solution of this issue is primarily based on the assumption of the replacement with the same type of machine, of which the investment price and annual operating costs accruing during its physical life, is known. The contribution states the original calculation procedure of the interval limits, in which the mutually advantageous price has to lie.

Efficiency, regulation and equality in the OECD",REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inequality; embeddedness; trade-offs; efficiency; regulation,WELFARE-STATE; INEQUALITY; POLITICS; GLOBALIZATION; ECONOMY,"Arthur Okun famously argued that effciency is bought at the cost of inequalities in income and wealth. Okun's trade-off represents the antithesis to Karl Polanyi's view of the relationship that the more embedded markets are in society, the better the social and economic outcomes they produce. This paper refines both these views. We argue that not all forms of market embeddedness are created equal, and that the relationship between equality and efficiency can be both positive and negative. We show this by examining how different ways of embedding economic activity in society through market regulation produce different combinations of efficiency and equality. We identify empirically three broad patterns: market liberal regulatory frameworks that promote competitive markets without decommodifying institutions; embedded liberal regulations that allow markets to work efficiently, but within the framework of decommodification and equality; and embedded illiberalism, where regulations hinder markets in favor of powerful social groups and where decommodification undermines both efficiency and equality. Okun's trade-off emerges as a special case limited to the English-speaking democracies: other OECD countries tend to exhibit either efficiency and equality together, or inefficiency and inequality together. These findings suggest a corrective to both naive market liberal views of the incompatibility of efficiency and equality, but also to the more sophisticated Varieties of Capitalism framework, which pays insufficient attention to the ways in which markets can be embedded in stable but apparently dysfunctional institutional arrangements.","[Hopkin, Jonathan] London Sch Econ, Dept Govt, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Blyth, Mark] Brown Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Blyth, Mark] Brown Univ, Watson Inst Int Affairs, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Brown University; Brown University,"Hopkin, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Govt, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,"Hopkin, Jonathan/C-4396-2017",,,,,,87,19,20,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The particular contribution of this paper is to combine regional and individual characteristics and analyze if entrepreneurship in the region affects entry into self-employment. A particular attention is paid to individual background with effects depending on the regional context in Tunisia such as entrepreneurial human capital and labour force characteristics. Even though some of these factors have been the subject of several entrepreneurship studies, it is still difficult to identify which one impact significantly the decision to create a new enterprise. As an illustration, the model is estimated using a data provided by the National Tunisian Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2010 Project, based on the analysis of a sample of 1966 cases. The main findings of the study show that knowing someone personally who started a business in the past 2 years and presence of good opportunities for starting a business increase significantly the probability to create a new venture. In addition, we have found that the interaction between these two factors has a positive influence. However, fear of failure influences negatively the decision to start up.

We estimate (1) the cost to develop competitively priced direct CO2 air capture technology, a possible climate backstop and (2) the effect of this technology on the value of liquid fuel reserves by country and fuel. Under most assumptions, development costs exceed individual benefits. A particularly robust result is that carbon prices generate large benefits for conventional oil producers making a climate backstop unappealing for them. Unilateral investment does become more likely under: stringent carbon policy, social discount rates, improved technical outcomes, and high price elasticity of demand for liquid fuels. Early stage investment is inexpensive and could provide a hedge against such developments, particularly for fuels on the margin, such as tar sands and gas-to-liquids.

This paper focuses on equilibrium exchange rates for Greece and Ireland since their entrance into the euro area until the end of the year 2011. To examine the real exchange rate misalignment for Greece and Ireland towards the rest of the euro area, the concepts of Behavioral Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER) and Permanent Equilibrium Exchange Rate (PEER) are applied. We find that the real exchange rate of both Greece and Ireland was undervalued towards the euro around the time, when these countries entered the euro area.

By ignoring the limitation on the frequencies of the forcing function, in the process of fitting a conventional ARMA model, one is liable to derive estimates that are severely biased. If the maximum frequency in the sampled data is less than the Nyquist value, then the underlying continuous function can be reconstituted by sinc function or Fourier interpolation. The estimation biases can be avoided by re-sampling the continuous process at a rate corresponding to the maximum frequency of the forcing function. Then, there is a direct correspondence between the parameters of the band-limited ARMA model and those of an equivalent continuous-time process.","Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Pollock, DSG (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",stephen_pollock@sigmapi.u-net.com,,,,,,,8,3,3,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The efficient markets hypothesis suggests that unexpected earnings should be fully incorporated into asset prices soon after being publicly announced. We hypothesize that publicly announced earnings signals may be more certain for REITs due to the presence of a parallel (private) asset market, suggesting less drift for REIT stocks. However, we find a large REIT drift component that is both statistically and economically significant. Furthermore, while the initial earnings surprise response is more muted for REITs, we find that the magnitude of the drift is significantly larger for REITs than for ordinary common stocks (NonREITs). Thus, information does not appear to move between the private and public asset markets in such a way as to render REIT earnings signals more certain than NonREIT earnings signals.","[Price, S.

Devaluation or depreciation of a currency worsens the trade balance before improving it, resulting in a J-curve pattern. This paper investigates J-curve phenomenon using quarterly time series data over the period 1997:1 to 2010:4. In this paper is applied the Johansen cointegration test to analyse the long run relationship between exchange rate and trade balance. Short term effects and the related J-curve effect is explored by estimating error correction model and by assessing the impulse response function of the trade balance on the exchange rate shock. The results reveal that the trade balance between Slovakia and its trading partners does not support the J-curve phenomenon in all cases. The J-curve phenomenon was revealed in case of Hungary and partially in Czech Republic, in case of Austria S-curve pattern was found, in other cases, the coefficient estimates follow any specific pattern in response to currency depreciation.","[Simakova, Jana] Silesian Univ Opava, Dept Finance, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,,simakova@opf.slu.cz,"Šimáková, Jana/ABF-8573-2020","Šimáková, Jana/0000-0002-4194-9971",,,,,16,0,0,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,864,869,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900148,0

Policy reforms undertaken with the support of the Bretton Woods institutions since the mid-1990s have made Georgia one of the most market-friendly economies among the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the reforms have so far failed to transform the lopsided export structure inherited from the Soviet era in line with emerging opportunities for global economic integration. The orthodox liberalisation reforms are unlikely to improve export performance unless accompanied by concrete measures to redress supply-side constraints faced by export producers and to sustain their international competitiveness.","[Athukorala, Prema-chandra] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Wagle, Swarnim] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Australian National University; The World Bank,"Athukorala, PC (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,45,0,2,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2014,37.0,12,,,SI,,1669,1691,,10.1111/twec.12207,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AW4KC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346249000002,0

A privatization and appropriation dynamic was launched with the involvement of national and foreign private players, an example of the land grabbing phenomenon. This dynamic falls within a liberal strategy of agricultural development called Green Morocco Plan adopted in April 2008 whose implementation relies on the acquisition of agricultural land (700 000 ha) which is made available for private actors in order to develop agricultural projects. Its philosophy and implementation reinforce the agricultural dualism privileging capitalist agriculture at the expense of family farming. This study deals with the future of land tenure in Mordcco in the framework of a liberal agricultural policy. Attempts are made to demonstrate that the current dynamic of land privatization deepens its roots in the Moroccan land history with the primary role played by the pre-colonial Makhzen State first, by the French colonization after and by the post-independence State.","Ecole Natl Agr, Meknes, Morocco",Moulay Ismail University of Meknes,"Mahdi, M (通讯作者)，Ecole Natl Agr, Meknes, Morocco.",,"Mahdi, Mohamed/AAH-6423-2021",,,,,,19,18,21,0,12,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2014,13.0,4,,,,,2,10,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CD5HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351118700001,0

Hypothetical payoffs are not incentive compatible and are, therefore, not considered to be reliable. Behavioral differences between the evaluation of hypothetical and real payoffs can be attributed to this incentive effect. Because real payoff mechanisms are not always applicable in the field, it is necessary to know in which way both types of payoffs affect evaluation processes. In order to delineate the cognitive processes related to hypothetical bias, we conducted a within-subject EEG experiment with hypothetical and real payoffs. A certainty equivalent elicitation method for measuring risk attitudes was performed in which subjects had to indicate whether they preferred playing a lottery or receiving a sure payoff instead. At the behavioral level, subjects were more risk averse for real payoff choices, confirming a hypothetical bias. EEG-derived event-related potentials provide evidence that the processes underlying these differences in evaluations differ. A higher N2 component for hypothetical payoffs revealed increased cognitive control for hypothetical decisions. These neuronal underpinnings indicate additional evaluation processes in hypothetical choice paradigms, which can explain the shift in risk attitude toward the expected value of a lottery.","[Morgenstern, Ralf; Vogt, Bodo] Otto Von Guericke Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Magdeburg, Germany; [Heldmann, Marcus] Med Univ Lubeck, Dept Neurol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany",Otto von Guericke University; University of Lubeck,"Morgenstern, R (通讯作者)，Otto Von Guericke Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Magdeburg, Germany.",ralf.morgenstern@ovgu.de,,,,,,,23,6,6,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,DEC,2014,77.0,4,,,SI,,557,582,,10.1007/s11238-013-9408-x,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AU0AP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345285800006,0

Formulating innovative financing approaches is one of the challenges faced by policymakers to address the ever growing need for restoring the failing civil infrastructure in the U.S. Public support/opposition is one of the major drivers/disruptors of innovative financing. Assessment of public perceptions is a major component towards gaining public support and developing sustainable infrastructure financing policies. The objective of this study is to investigate the determinants of public perceptions of innovative financing. Data obtained from public survey of 616 individuals from 50 states in the U.S. is analyzed to investigate the effects of: (a) economic factors, (b) infrastructure conditions, and (c) personal characteristics of the public on the knowledge, awareness, perceptions, and attitudes of the public towards innovative financing. The findings reveal that the likelihood of public support of innovative financing is insensitive to economic conditions and is affected by the factors related to infrastructure condition such as the level of need for infrastructure renewal, the ability to protect the public against natural disasters, and the history of using innovative financing for infrastructure renewal. The findings also show that 57% of the sample population in the U.S. were not knowledgeable about different methods for financing infrastructure projects and 77% of the sample population in the U.S. were not aware of the activities of public organizations for finding innovative financing solutions for infrastructure projects. Based on the findings, two main strategies have been proposed for infrastructure agencies to enhance their efforts towards gaining public acceptance of innovative financing: (i) enhance strategies to facilitate learning for the public about innovative financing in infrastructure projects and (ii) improve marketing and citizen involvement strategies to get the public to buy-in to innovative financing methods. The findings can enhance the current efforts of public agencies related to educating the public and citizen involvement strategies by incorporating public preferences in policy development to enhance the likelihood of public support of innovative financing methods. Potential improvements can be made in changing the key messages in educating the public, using more effective strategies for communicating complicated financing concepts, and highlighting the success stories and benefits of innovative financing in other states and countries.

Long and inflexible working hours presume a male model of the worker unconstrained by caring responsibilities. Yet the experiences of the minority of women who work in these sectors are of interest to those concerned with reducing occupational gender segregation. Sexuality is often overlooked in differentiating women's experience of male-dominated work, and gender conflated with heterosexuality. Through examining the interaction of domestic circumstances and work arrangements of heterosexual women and lesbians, this article finds that atypical domestic circumstances may be required to support male-dominated work. Heterosexual breadwinner' norms were challenged by women's capacity for higher earnings from male-dominated work, but often required strategies to manage associated emotions. Evidence from lesbian relationships indicates a possible shift from prioritization of financial self-sufficiency in the context of legal status for same-sex partnerships.","[Wright, Tessa] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Ctr Res Equal & Divers, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Wright, T (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",t.wright@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,18,26,2,61,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

It argues that the dominant rural production profile dictated whether farmers did exert a significant impact on socio-economic institution and policy formation outside the rural sector. By applying the method of parallel demonstration of theory, we illustrate the plausibility of these theoretical considerations through juxtaposing the historical record of Germany, Denmark, New Zealand and the USA. The article highlights the limits of a dichotomous view on the origins of capitalism because the coordination effect of rural economies varies within the later coordinated and the later liberal cluster of market economies.","[Trampusch, Christine; Spies, Dennis C.] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, D-50931 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Trampusch, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Herbert Lewin Str 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",christine.trampusch@uni-koeln.de; spies@wiso.uni-koeln.de,"Trampusch, Christine/ABC-7216-2021; Trampusch, Christine/AAD-9670-2019","Trampusch, Christine/0000-0003-1024-2065;",,,,,91,7,8,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Our measure of policies favoring FDI is an event count of changes made by a country in a given year in the arena of approval procedures, sectoral restrictions, operational conditions, incentives, investment guarantees, foreign exchange, and corporate regulations to attract FDI. Using spatial econometric estimations on panel data for 148 countries over the 1992-2009 period, we find that favorable policy changes to attract FDI in one country are positively correlated with FIN policy changes elsewhere (i.e., policy changes favorable to FDI from other countries, increase the likelihood of liberalizing policies favoring FDI in the country in question). Developing countries compete more intensively among themselves for investment via liberalization of policies favoring FDI.

First, we find that when two competitive regional governments play the first stage to maximize their tax revenue, they both propose lower tax levels to firms with more direct partners. Second, when the central government plays the game to maximize social welfare, it offers a tax incentive to concentrate firms in the advantageous region. In addition, this tax incentive is greater for firms that have a higher Katz-Bonacich centrality. Furthermore, when a uniform tax is the only practical option for the central government, the level of the uniform tax depends on the average value and variance of the Katz-Bonacich centrality of the network.

Our goal is to analyze whether the pressures for cost containment may affect hospital performance in terms of population health status. Unlike previous work in this area, we analyze hospitals at the ward level so comparisons can be made across more homogeneous treatments. We focus on two different health outcomes: mortality and readmission rates. We find that there is a trade-off between mortality rates and efficiency, as more efficient hospitals have higher mortality rates. We also find, however, that more efficient hospitals have lower readmission rates. Moreover, we show that focusing the analysis at the ward level is essential, since there is evidence of higher mortality rates in general medicine and surgery, while in oncology mortality is lower in more efficient hospitals. Furthermore, we find that consideration of spatial processes is important since mortality rates are higher for hospitals subject to high degree of horizontal competition, but lower for those hospitals having strong competition but high efficiency. This implies that the interplay of efficient resource allocation and hospital competition is important for the sustainability and effectiveness of regional health care systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, designing effective promotion campaigns for the adoption of e-bikes requires detailed knowledge on user characteristics and motivations. In order to explain e-bike use on work, shopping and leisure trips, the present study combines concepts from technology adoption with factors derived from research on mobility behaviour. The study employs structural equation modeling to survey data from 1398 Austrian early adopters who purchased an e-bike between 2009 and 2011. Results show that early adopters are predominantly comprised of persons aged 60 years or older who mainly use the e-bike for leisure trips. Carbon-intensive travel modes on commuting trips are barely substituted. Early adopters typically hold pro-environmental and technophile attitudes. E-bike use is most driven by perceived usefulness, which in turn depends on an easy use, appropriate infrastructure, also user's norms and attitudes towards environment and physical activity. Comparison by trip purpose shows that a supportive social environment and personal ecological norms influence e-bike use on work and shopping trips, whereas leisure use of e-bikes is driven by attitudes towards physical activity. Comparison by age groups underlines that older e-bike users are more dependent on practical usefulness of the technology and facilitating road infrastructure. Therefore, e-bike promotion strategies should differentiate between trip purpose and age segments when selecting target groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data compiled from SeatGeek.com on more than 46,000 ticket postings in the two weeks prior to the 2013 Super Bowl and more than 18,000 ticket postings prior to the 2012 NCAA Final Four, we find that average prices decreased in the last few days prior to these events, reaching their lowest levels on the mornings before kickoff and first tipoff. This evidence seems to support Lehren's recommendation that savvy fans should wait until the last minute to buy their tickets. But, we also show that savvy fans can often find similar or better bargains much earlier in the week by searching the available inventory. The greater variation in posted prices earlier in the week implies that fans can often find better bargains by searching than by being patient, especially for super-premium seats. We discuss how changes in technology have made it easier to search for bargains, while also insuring against being left ticketless if fans decide to patiently wait until the day of the game. Both strategiespatiently waiting until close to game time versus searching early and oftencan produce bargains, although we suspect that changes in technology have increased the relative rewards to searching.","[Harrington, David E.] Kenyon Coll, Gambier, OH 43022 USA; [Treber, Jaret] Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, Gambier, OH 43022 USA",University System of Ohio; Kenyon College; University System of Ohio; Kenyon College,"Treber, J (通讯作者)，Kenyon Coll, 202 Coll Pk St, Gambier, OH 43022 USA.",treberj@kenyon.edu,,,,,,,11,2,4,2,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

We test whether capitalization of the MID into house prices offsets the positive effect on homeownership. We find that the MID boosts homeownership attainment only of higher-income households in less tightly regulated housing markets. In more restrictive places, an adverse effect exists. The MID is an ineffective policy to promote homeownership and improve social welfare.","[Hilber, Christian A.

Relying on standard economic theory, the paper explores a simple though neglected mechanism linking land inequality and inefficiency: market power. In underdeveloped economies with serious constraints on labor mobility, high ownership concentration will endow landowners with market power in local labor markets. The resulting equilibrium explains many of the often criticized features of latifundia, without the need to factor in irrational behavior (the preferred explanation of Italian traditional historians) or social institutions and capital market imperfections (explanations advanced by economists in different contexts). According to the model here explored the main effects of inequality are of a distributive rather than of a productive nature. The market power hypothesis is strongly supported by the available quantitative evidence provided by an unexploited dataset on all local labor markets of Italy at the end of the 1930s.

Yet the answers to critical questions have eluded researchers and practitioners: is franchising in the lodging industry profitable and a value-creating strategy? Moreover, what is the optimal proportion of franchising to attain certain financial outcomes? This study evaluates franchising in the lodging industry, and poses two key financial questions. Are franchised lodging firms more profitable and value-generating than non-franchised operations? And what is the optimal proportion of franchised and non-franchised units for a lodging firm to maximize its financial performance and value creation? The results of the two-way, random-effect regression model suggest that franchised lodging firms are more profitable than non-franchised firms. The study also finds that franchised firms create more intangible value than non-franchised firms. In addition, the authors identify optimal proportions of franchised and non-franchised properties that allow lodging firms to maximize profitability and intangible value. The results provide a critical perspective on the discussion of whether or not lodging firms should franchise and, if so, to what extent.","[Moon, Joonho; Sharma, Amit] Penn State Univ, Sch Hospitality Management HRIM, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Sharma, Amit] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Kyung Hee University,"Sharma, A (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Sch Hospitality Management HRIM, 216 Mateer Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jzm244@psu.edu; aus22@psu.edu,,,,,,,86,14,18,1,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The theoretical literature on wage spillovers, as well as the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis, suggests that the internationally traded sector should be the leader in wage setting, with sheltered and public sector wages adjusting. Using a cointegrated VAR approach we show that a large heterogeneity across countries is present, and non-traded and public sector wages are often leaders in wage determination or at least affect traded sector wages in the short run. This result is relevant from a policy perspective since wage spillovers, leading to costs growing faster than productivity, may affect the international cost competitiveness of the traded sector and thus the catching-up process may be accompanied by accumulation of large international imbalances.","Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"D'Adamo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Valencia, Spain.",gaetano.dadamo@uv.es,,,,,,,32,4,4,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The (Extreme) Case of Poland,EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,The article concentrates on recent successes of non-partisans (independents) in Polish local government. A majority of mayors and councillors remains unaffiliated with any party-in this respect Poland is an outlier among European countries. The article examines both the factors determining the cross-national variation in the level of local government partyness and those causing the differences between the municipalities. The analyses of local elections held in 2006 and 2010 demonstrate that non-partisans' successes are primarily due to the previous election results (the advantage of incumbency); a possible 'partisan offensive' to colonise new resources in local politics is sluggish.,"[Gendzwill, Adam] Univ Warsaw, Fac Geog & Reg Studies, Warsaw, Poland; [Zoltak, Tomasz] Educ Res Inst, PL-01180 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw; Educational Research Institute (IBE),"Gendzwill, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Geog & Reg Studies, Warsaw, Poland.",a.gendzwill@gmail.com; t.zoltak@ibe.edu.pl,"Gendzwill, Adam/AAU-4446-2020; Żółtak, Tomasz/GOE-4348-2022; Gendzwill, Adam/GYQ-7835-2022","Gendzwill, Adam/0000-0001-8079-3378; Żółtak, Tomasz/0000-0003-1354-4472; Gendzwill, Adam/0000-0001-8079-3378",,,,,69,27,30,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,SEP,2014,66.0,7,,,,,1122,1145,,10.1080/09668136.2014.927644,0.0,,,24,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AO7ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341525500005,0

We show that the autocovariance and the spectral density of the discretized process are asymptotically rescaled by a factor smaller than one, and we compute exactly this scaling factor. Consequently, we find that the discretized process is also long memory with the same Hurst exponent as the original process. We consider the properties of two estimators of the Hurst exponent, namely the local Whittle (LW) estimator and the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). By using analytical considerations and numerical simulations we show that, in presence of round-off error, both estimators are severely negatively biased in finite samples. Under regularity conditions we prove that the LW estimator applied to discretized processes is consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, we compute the asymptotic properties of the DFA for a generic (i.e., non-Gaussian) long memory process and we apply the result to discretized processes.","[La Spada, Gabriele] Princeton Univ Econ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Lillo, Fabrizio] Scuola Normale Super Pisa Math, Pisa, Italy; [Lillo, Fabrizio] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Fis & Chim, Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"La Spada, G (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ Econ, Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",gla@princeton.edu,,,,,,,49,1,2,3,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

To better understand how peer effects operate and how best to estimate their effects, this paper investigates how the reciprocation of friendship mediates peer effects. We begin by characterizing how reciprocated and unreciprocated friendships compare in terms of the amount of interaction and social distance. We then use a higher order spatial autoregressive (SAR) model to investigate the differential effects of reciprocated friends, unreciprocated friends, and unchosen friends (i.e. an incoming friendship nomination that is not reciprocated) on adolescents' behaviors and outcomes using data from the Add Health study. We find that adolescents experience heterogenous influences from friends, with the greatest effect from reciprocated friends, intermediate effects from unreciprocated friends, and the smallest, but positive effects from unchosen friends. Our results indicate that it is misleading to assign equal weight to all friends or to impose symmetry on unreciprocated friendship nominations, as is often done. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the commission, representatives from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania condemned the Soviet annexation of the Baltic States, prompting heated arguments regarding the invalidity of the related secret protocol of the pact with other members who continued to hold the traditional Soviet ideological view of the pact as something positive. The debate over the secret protocol had the further potential to extend to disputes over 'recovery of lost territory' amongst the Baltic States, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Russia. This article analyses the arguments used by commission members, considering the interplay of national interests, how they balanced arguments between restoration of 'state sovereignty' and maintenance of borders, and how they finally compromised and concluded the commission's report.","Consulate Gen Japan Yuzhno Sakhalinsk, London, England",,"Sato, K (通讯作者)，Consulate Gen Japan Yuzhno Sakhalinsk, London, England.",katurazawa@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,SEP,2014,66.0,7,,,,,1146,1164,,10.1080/09668136.2014.934143,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AO7ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341525500006,0

What is the effect of these networks? Do they lead to regulatory convergence around EU standards in the eastern neighbourhood? Using original survey data, as well as data on regional enterprise-related regulations, this article argues that the density of interaction among private actors and between private actors and regional governments in such networks create conditions for private actors to lobby for regulatory change, resulting in approximations to EU standards. By testing the transnational mechanisms of policy change, the article points to the possibility of integration, even in the absence of membership prospects. However, the findings also indicate that the extent of regulatory change is conditioned by cross-border network structure as well as the institutional distance between the partnering regions.","[Turkina, Ekaterina] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Postnikov, Evgeny] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Turkina, E (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Int Business, Edifice Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",ekaterina.turkina@hec.ca,,"Postnikov, Evgeny/0000-0002-4366-8401",,,,,59,5,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using an hours of the week panel, the program's operation is associated with an approximately 14% reduction in crime. The program being open appears to have roughly similar influences on different categories of crime. Moreover, increases in rides (the intensity of the program) are also associated with reductions in crime. Such increases in program intensity are also associated with notably greater reductions in crime occurring on weekends. The cost of the safe ride program suggests that it is a relatively efficient means of reducing crime. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that the mainstream literature suffers from significant weaknesses; that empirical claims concerning convergence and decoupling have been exaggerated, and that flying geese-type strategies are severely limited.

The contrast effect is driven almost entirely by male evaluators. Additional evidence documents the effect's linearity with respect to prior partner attractiveness, its amplification for partners of moderate attractiveness, and its partial attenuation with accumulated experience.","[Bhargava, Saurabh] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Fisman, Ray] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Columbia University,"Bhargava, S (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,,,,,,,48,34,37,2,24,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

While previous research mostly focuses on a linear nexus or allows for a piecewise linear relationship with a single threshold, this study takes account of a more complex relationship. The empirical estimates for the full EU sample confirm the hypothesis that the relationship between inflation and growth is positive for very low inflation rates (that is, below an estimate of 1.6 per cent), insignificant thereafter and negative for high, two-digit inflation levels. The estimate of the inflation level that divides the insignificant from the negative effect is found to be higher in the group of traditional cohesion countries than for the rest of the sample.","[Cuaresma, Jesus Crespo] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Silgoner, Maria] Oesterreich Natl Bank, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Cuaresma, JC (通讯作者)，Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",jcrespo@wu.ac.at,,"Crespo Cuaresma, Jesus/0000-0003-3244-6560",,,,,50,1,2,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Frequency of intake of high energy-dense and low energy-dense food items may vary across care settings, affecting weight outcomes. We find that increased use of paid and regulated care settings, such as center care and Head Start, is associated with higher consumption of fruits and vegetables. Among children from single-mother households, the probability of obesity increases by 15 percentage point with an increase in intake of soft drinks from four to six times a week to daily consumption and by 25 percentage point with an increase in intake of fast food from one to three times a week to four to six times a week. Among children from two-parent households, eating vegetables one additional time a day is associated with 10 percentage point decreased probability of obesity, while one additional drink of juice a day is associated with 10 percentage point increased probability of obesity. Second, variation across care types could be manifested through differences in the structure of the physical environment not captured by differences in food intake alone. This type of effect is found to be marginal and is statistically significant among children from two-parent households only. Data are used from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Birth Cohort surveys (N = 10,700; years = 2001-2008). Children's age ranged from four to six years in the sample. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Recent comparative work on this topic has yielded some insight into the causes and consequences of segregation patterns, but much of this comparison is indirect. An explicitly spatial version of the entropy index has recently been developed that facilitates comparison, as it allows for the disaggregation of segregation levels by scale and income (Reardon and O'Sullivan, 2004; Reardon, 2009; Reardon and Bischoff, 2011). This paper applies these new measurement techniques to two metropolises; Hong Kong and San Francisco. Although overall segregation levels are similar, the shape of the segregation profile across geographic scales and the income distribution is quite different. The paper also includes a script for calculating spatial ordinal segregation indices in ArcGIS. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A detailed study of initial conditions enable the selection of functional units of study and the identification of homogenous units within the region, playing a relevant role into the process. Ranking is based on the achievement of both efficiency and cohesion objectives at a regional level. The model is tested by analyzing the Spanish Transport Infrastructure Master Plan (PEIT) for the non-central area of Northwest Spain. Application of impact assessment shows that the construction of infrastructures has selective effects in the area according to the homogenous groups. Potential development was boosted in one of the zone groups, whereas in others, at best, there was a reduction in their regressive tendency. Finally, the model is a dynamic support tool that could be adapted to several planning policies only when the ranking criterion is well-justified. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Statistical evidence from Norway,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cost overrun; Road sector; Reforms; Reorganizations; Norway,INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS,"Although governments often respond to the prevalent cost overruns of transportation projects by reforming the agencies charged with overseeing the construction of projects, the transportation research literature has not provided statistical evidence as to whether such reforms assist in reducing cost overruns. This paper provides such evidence using the Norwegian road sector as a case study. The agency in question was reformed twice, from a monopolistic to a semi-monopolistic organization, and finally, to a fully competitive organization in which road construction was divided out into a separate company and privatized. In this work, we use statistical inferences to explore the related issues. The data set is composed of 1045 projects evenly distributed across the three organizational forms. The results demonstrate that the impact of the reforms has not been equal. The most important impact occurred in the final reform of full competition in which both the cost overruns and delays in construction among larger projects were greatly reduced. The second reform appears to have had a contrasting impact. For transportation research in general, we call for additional studies that will reveal the extent to which efforts carried out by governments (such as reforms) improve the efficiency of these sectors.

To uncover these links, the article first demonstrates how the EU has started to address various chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security risks through adopting an approach conceptualized as transnational security governance'. The article subsequently argues that this approach can be convincingly explained by drawing on the insights from the study of the sociology of bureaucracy and bureaucratic behaviour in international relations. In this story, the EU's approach to international security is an example of normal bureaucratic practice, stemming in particular from the bureaucracy's moral and expert authority. Importantly, the engagement with the broader social science scholarship will benefit EU studies as much as other sub-disciplines.","[Zwolski, Kamil] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Zwolski, K (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",k.m.zwolski@soton.ac.uk,,"Zwolski, Kamil/0000-0001-6043-8790",,,,,67,5,5,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using a unique dataset comprising of detailed schedules of services commitments disaggregated by sub-sectors and covering almost all countries that are members of a services RTA, we are able to quantify the extent to which geographical, systemic as well as economic and institutional factors correlate with a country's pattern of RTA commitments that go further than commitments made at the WTO. Strong explanatory variables are asymmetries between negotiating partners and market size, together with endowments in mid-skilled labor and institutional governance. Whereas some of these forces are strongly positively associated with commitments made beyond GATS, others are significant determinants that correlate negatively with a country's commitment patterns in RTAs. We also find strong differences between services industries providing evidence that not all economic and political economy factors are of equal importance for all services. For instance, financial and construction services often diverge significantly from our general pattern of explanations.","[van der Marel, Erik] ECIPE, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium; [Miroudot, Sebastien] OECD, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"van der Marel, E (通讯作者)，ECIPE, 4-6 Rue Belliard, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",erik.vandermarel@ecipe.org; sebastien.miroudot@oecd.org,,"Miroudot, Sebastien/0000-0003-3850-2754",,,,,55,6,6,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

With the recent collapse of housing prices and the resulting increase in foreclosures that followed the Great Recession, many observers have speculated that the local governments would suffer significant revenue losses, either immediately or in the near future. However, to our knowledge there is no existing work that examines the impacts of these recent foreclosures on property values and the subsequent impacts on property tax revenues and other dimensions of the property tax system. We use proprietary information from RealtyTrac on annual foreclosure activity (e.g., the flow of newly foreclosed properties into foreclosure filings), for the period 2006 through 2011, merged with information on local government revenues and economic data, to estimate the impacts of foreclosures on local government property tax revenues, as well as on market values and property tax levies. We focus on school districts in the State of Georgia, and address the question: How have recent foreclosures stemming from the Great Recession affected the property tax system of local governments?

Imports will be more expensive, which is often seen as an inflationary side-effect of the export stimulus. Results from a computable general equilibrium model of Fiji indicate that, while devaluation will increase tourism consumption, the overall effect on the economy will be contractionary, as household consumption, investment and domestic production will all decrease.

This is exemplified by Aesop's fable of the fox and the sour grapes. This phenomenon of adaptive preference formation poses a vexing problem for normative economics: preferences which constitute the measuring rod for welfare are in turn shaped by the (economic) situation of the individual, leading to problems epitomized by Amartya Sen's hopeless beggar dilemma: The beggar, enduring objectively miserable circumstances, nonetheless claims to have all his preferences satisfied, which would lead orthodox welfare economics to establish a high level of well-being. For those who find this counterintuitive, different solutions for the adaptation problem have been proposed in the literature, typically centering on highly demanding rationality and information requirements. We argue that, in order to cope with this and related problems of preference endogeneity, welfare economics rather needs to account for recent psychological insights into the mechanisms that drive preference formation and change. We then use these insights to suggest and apply a procedural criterion of autonomous preference formation.","[Schubert, Christian] BTU Cottbus Senftenberg, Fak 3, Lehrstuhl VWL Mikrookon, D-03013 Cottbus, Germany; [Binder, Martin] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Binder, Martin] Univ Kassel, Lehrstuhl Wirtschafts & Unternehmenseth, Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissensch, D-34127 Kassel, Germany",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; University of Sussex; Universitat Kassel,"Schubert, C (通讯作者)，BTU Cottbus Senftenberg, Fak 3, Lehrstuhl VWL Mikrookon, Postfach 101344, D-03013 Cottbus, Germany.",c.schubert@tu-cottbus.de; M.Binder@sussex.ac.uk,"Binder, Martin/AAF-6448-2020","Binder, Martin/0000-0002-5053-3804",,,,,59,1,1,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We demonstrate that, though robust to misspecifications of the data-generating process, this method suffers from a hitherto unnoticed bias which increases with the forecast horizon. We propose a correction to this bias and show through simulations that it works well. Applying our corrected local projections estimator to the data from a panel of 99 countries observed between 1974 and 2001, we find that an average banking crisis yields a GDP loss of just under 10% in 10 years, with little sign of recovery.

Using cross-sectional data and controlling for the overall bilateral stock of migrants, the share of migrants employed in managerial/business-related occupations has a strong additional effect on trade. Those immigrants should be the ones directly involved in the diffusion and transmission of information relevant for companies trading with other countries. Their presence is found to increase the volume of trade, especially of imports, beyond the already known effect of immigrants or highly educated immigrants. When we control for the presence of highly educated immigrants, the share of immigrants in business network occupations shows a particularly large effect on trade in differentiated goods. We also find that highly educated individuals in business-related occupations are those contributing to stimulate import and export by the largest margin. Business network effects seem particularly important in stimulating exports to culturally different countries, such as those with different language and legal origin.","[Aleksynska, Mariya] CEPII, Paris, France; [Peri, Giovanni] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Aleksynska, M (通讯作者)，CEPII, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,35,45,49,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2014,37.0,3,,,,,434,455,,10.1111/twec.12079,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AD7LK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333445200004,0

Arguably, the rising inequalities in unhealthy lifestyles might underpin these inequality patterns, yet supportive empirical evidence is scarce. We examine the patterns of inequality in unhealthy lifestyles in England and Spain, two countries that exhibit rising obesity levels with a high prevalence of smoking and alcohol use. This study is unique in that it draws from health survey data spanning over a period in which major contextual and policy changes have taken place. We document persistent income-related inequalities in obesity and smoking; both unhealthy lifestyles appear to be disproportionately concentrated among the relatively poor in recent decades. In contrast, alcohol use appears to be concentrated among richer individuals in both periods and countries examined. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The authors utilize criminal law statistics of Russian regional courts for 2006-2010 to determine the alignment between chairpersons and prosecutors by measuring the length of their mutual career paths. The informal ties have a strong impact on trial outcome, which, however, changes over time. During periods of high bureaucratic risks and uncertainty, regions with a higher extent of informal ties between judges and prosecutors exhibit more repressive law enforcement. If external risks decrease, informal coalitions seem to increase the independence of the courts, insulating them from bureaucratic pressures and limiting their repressiveness.","[Schultz, Andre; Libman, Alexander] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Dept Econ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Kozlov, Vladimir] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Dept Demog, Moscow, Russia; [Libman, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Moscow V71, Russia","Frankfurt School Finance & Management; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences","Libman, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Dept Econ, Frankfurt, Germany.",a.libman@fs.de,"Kozlov, Vladimir A/J-6059-2015","Libman, Alexander/0000-0001-8504-3007; Kozlov, Vladimir/0000-0003-1788-1484",,,,,58,12,13,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

However, housing development has been distorted by speculation, income inequality and lack of government support for low-cost houses. In recent years, house prices become so high, making the vast majority of urban residents unable to afford, whereas rich families are able to buy many and leave them vacant. Income inequality is a major cause for rising house prices, which, in turn, exaggerates income inequality further. This vicious relationship has caused social tension between the rich and the poor and unhappiness among the middle- and low-income groups.

Grouping the three sectors together masks opposing effects in individual sectors. Where significant, the effect of foreign presence on domestic firms tends to be negative, this is mainly the case in wholesale and retail trade. Despite it being of lesser importance than foreign presence in these sectors, import competition from abroad is negatively associated with domestic firms' productivity in wholesale and retail trade, but positively in transport, storage and communication. There is no significant effect of foreign presence or import competition in real estate, rental and business activities. Using capital-labour ratios as an input-based indicator related to productivity suggests that domestic firms adapt to increased foreign competition by adjusting their inputs.","Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Haller, SA (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,40,6,6,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2014,37.0,2,,,,,219,243,,10.1111/twec.12120,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AA0OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330793500003,0

For measurement the changes of intra-industry trade development in the paper two approaches are adopted. The Grubel-Lloyd index was used to calculate the intensity of intra-industry trade and thus to determine its relative importance compared to inter-industry trade. Secondly, the index of marginal intra-industry trade was used to examine changes in trade flows over time. Using these methods of measurement and standard international made classification (SITC) was established the importance of intra-industry trade in the development of trade structure between Lithuania and the EU. It was found that trading in food, drink, tobacco, raw materials, machines and means of transport, chemical products, and other manufactured goods dominate between Lithuania and the ELT.

First of all, the acquired heritage has to be recognized, truly valued, protected and presented in a successful way. This work brings a review on Slavonian traditional music, on the historical segment, but also the cultural identity of east Croatia. Traditional music certainly represents a significant form of historical legacy. In this context the role of authentic Slavonian folk music should be observed. This work will especially try to emphasize the compatibility of Slavonian traditional music with the classical music creation. The works' goal is to present compositions of classical music composers, whose origin lies on the Slavonian traditional music elements. Under these compositions we mean vocal, vocal-instrumental, instrumental, chamber and orchestra compositions. This works' subject will present specific pieces from the Croatian musical literature, but also compositions of foreign authors, who found their creation impulse in the Slavonian folk music expression. The basic methodological approach in working on the mentioned theme will imply the collecting of existing materials, composers and compositions listing and cataloguing. The mentioned approach will be performed by gathering materials through several sources: different legal subjects, whose activities are closely connected to the music-art field (like HDS- Croatian society of composers, HRSK- Croatian parliament of culture and etc.), archives and individual libraries of amateur societies. This work will contain a paragraph which brings the most important characteristics of Slavonian traditional music which were used during the composing process. Finally, from this work it will be possible to conclude that the classical music expression, implemented with Slavonian traditional music, without any doubts has a significant place in the field of art. With a well conceived, planned and directed affirmation of this kind of cultural wealth, there are truly significant possibilities in the economy development of east Croatia. Of course, it is up to us to fulfil it.","Acad Arts Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia",,"Drenjancevic, Z (通讯作者)，Acad Arts Osijek, Kralja Petra Svacica 1-F, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",zdravko.drenjancevic@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2014,,,,,,,531,537,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BC3YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352079600052,0

An assortment of vegetables, fruits, flowers and also herbal and medicinal plants is delivered directly to urban consumers, rich and poor, with little or no official oversight with respect to quality or safety. However, the surge in world population from 2 to 7 billion during the past 70 years, and especially a well-documented rural-to-urban migration, have profoundly influenced both the practicality of traditional peri-urban agriculture and the numbers of the urban poor. Cities have expanded and displaced farmers from their land. Competition for water resources can be fierce and modern food quality and safety expectations increasingly demand better compliance and oversight. One might argue that these various factors constraining peri-urban horticulture, as well as the burgeoning population of the urban poor, have heightened the interest in producing horticultural crops within urban centers, or in other words, in urban horticulture. The research needed to inform public policy about how urban and peri-urban horticulture is valued, practiced and utilized to benefit the poor must involve social geographers, demographers, nutritionists, epidemiologists, horticulturists and many other professionals. However, the horticultural science and industry sector can also address some key problems and constraints. It can inform issues about what to grow and where to grow it. This sector knows about marketing - delivering safe and attractive products to consumers. Perhaps most importantly, horticulturists can credibly address issues about land, labour, water and the crop production/protection inputs needed for successful and sustainable production. Examples include developing and introducing varieties and cultivars better suited for urban and periurban production and direct marketing, e. g., cultivars resilient to climate change or resistant to key pests and diseases which thus require fewer pesticides; introduction of plant materials and technologies that maximize water use efficiency; and improving crop harvesting, handling and storage practices to permit reliable delivery of safe and nutritious produce.","Pacific Agrifood Res Ctr, Global Hort Initiat, Summerland, BC V0H 1Z0, Canada",,"Looney, NE (通讯作者)，Pacific Agrifood Res Ctr, Global Hort Initiat, Summerland, BC V0H 1Z0, Canada.",,,,,,,,1,2,2,2,19,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-08-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1021.0,,,,,,21,25,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB5GQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343861400001,0

The soil fertility, spatial properties, and other features of plots have been considered for calculation of the complex value index for Jogeva County in Estonia. All tasks were made in an ArcGIS environment and different digital maps were used as data sources.

Slovak economy, as well as other European Countries, was affected by the financial and economic crisis, not only by increasing unemployment, a loss of performance but also by a decrease of capability to create new jobs. Defining demand at a national level is problematic in terms of the total volume of the structure, as to the performance of transnational corporations. Reviving of unemployment can not only be assessed at the national level, but an important aspect affecting national labor market is the revival of global economy, which leads to the growth of the global labor needs. Currently, the focus of new jobs is shifting from partial professions towards cross-cutting and systemic professions, which must give a comprehensive response to developments in a particular industry. Slovakia is a small market economy significantly tied to major European economies, dominated by linkage to the German economy. Due to the high openness of the economy, the crisis has significantly affected the rate of growth of country's performance and caused a drop in demand and a decrease in both production and unemployment. High unemployment rate in this period was related to revenue shortfalls in the state budget and deepening of the budget deficit.","Univ Econ, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Martincová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-28-5,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2014,,,,,,,325,331,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359614900042,0

At the level of the constituents of the Russian Federation were formed their legal frameworks, which should be the rules of relations in the state - the business community. A program to support small innovative entrepreneurship in universities and research organizations was developed. However, if we turn to official Russian statistics, the regions have a sharp contrast from each other based on the results of innovative entrepreneurship. Thus, for example, possible to isolate whole regions where under the existing regulatory framework, entrepreneurs do not strive to implement innovative projects or invest of ones. This problem and determine the relevance of the study. The study was conducted on the basis of the expert survey of entrepreneurs of Innovation business. Information was collected on the basis of the expert survey, in which respondents were offered questions regarding the structure of uncertainties. There were presented of their description: handling, time of occurrence and existence of nature (in the external and internal environment), predictability and control. Furthermore, as additional conditions to determine the uncertainties and their impact on innovative entrepreneurship are defined as follows: the causes that give rise to uncertainties in the sources of information used by entrepreneurs in decision-making, the role of government in the development of innovative entrepreneurship institute, the structure of relations between the agents, appraisal systems support entrepreneurs and authorities types of assistance that obtained by ones. The sample size was 6700 expert survey respondents of small, medium, large and very large businesses of Russia. In examining the problem of uncertainties and their impact on innovative entrepreneurship tested the following hypotheses: 1. Causes of existence and uncertainties are determined by Russian regional peculiarities. 2. Among the uncertainties in each federal district there are those arising solely under the influence relations with the bodies of executive power of the Federal Districts of Russia. The result is obtained points of contact which allow building harmonious relations in the system state - business community and followed by uncertainty avoidance too.

The correct measurement of economic development requires the selection of adequate diagnostic variables as well as the construction of the taxonomic measure of development. The implementation of taxonomic measure of development allows for the division of regions into homogenous classes, however, reduces the possibility of statistical tests usage for quantitative data, which decide about the occurrence of spatial dependence. The objective of the article is to identify spatial dependence of regions covered by classes characterized by the defined economic development level having applied the joint-count test. This test allows detecting the spatial autocorrelation for quantitative data. The test application allows detecting whether the regions, within the framework of each specified class, are grouped based on the existing spatial dependence and create clusters featuring similar economic development level.","[Pietrzak, Michal B.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Wilk, Justyna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Comp Sci, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland; [Kossowski, Tomasz] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Spatial Econometr, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Bivand, Roger] Norwegian Sch Econ NHH, Dept Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Adam Mickiewicz University; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Pietrzak, MB (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Gagarina 13A, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",Pietrzak@umk.pl; Justyna.Wilk@ue.wroc.pl; tkoss@amu.edu.pl; Roger.Bivand@nhh.no,"Kossowski, Tomasz/ABC-4143-2020; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014; Kossowski, Tomasz/ABD-3808-2020","Kossowski, Tomasz/0000-0002-9976-4398; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478;",,,,,15,22,22,0,5,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-62511-43-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,135,144,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE0XB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367244900014,0

The efficient estimation of a bilateral variable from its mirror data, for example when compiling consistent international trade statistics, requires information about the accuracy of the reporters. This can be obtained from the simultaneous estimation of the accuracy of multiple reporters, from all mirror data. This estimation requires an identifying restriction. For example, in one of the proposed models this restriction prevents the model to be indifferent between (a) all reporters reporting correctly and (b) all reporters over-reporting with the same percentage. Two models are presented. First, a model with country-specific mean reporting errors is discussed shortly. This model has been discussed elsewhere without a convincing solution of the identification problem. Such a solution is presented here, assuming symmetry. Second, a model is presented with country specific reporting error variances, in the form of a generalized linear model (GLM). This model supplies the weights for the traditional method of optimally combining inconsistent data: weighted with the reciprocal of their error variance. Here also a symmetrical identifying restriction is used. In this way, this paper paves the road for the production of harmonized statistics by international agencies. A small data set on international trade is used as an illustration.","CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"ten Cate, A (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",a.ten.cate@cpb.nl,,,,,,,17,1,1,2,6,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

These patterns are produced by cumulative changes in land use and land cover as human and natural environments are influenced by market forces, policy, and changes in the natural landscape. To understand the mechanisms underlying these complex patterns, it is important to develop models that can capture the complexity of the underlying economic process. This includes spatiotemporal variation in the variables as well as spatiotemporal heterogeneity or non-stationarity in the model. The objective of this paper is to build on previous work in spatial nonparametric modeling and propose a spatiotemporal technique for nonlinear panel data models. Using a series of Monte Carlo experiments, we demonstrate how extending a geographically weighted likelihood regression (GWLR) model to account for temporal heterogeneity can improve the performance of the model when heterogeneity exists in the spatial and temporal dimensions. We also show how the technique can be used in modeling real world land use changes by applying our proposed technique to a panel of historical subdivision development from an urbanizing county in the Baltimore/Towson Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Our results demonstrate that the method provides better performance than a standard parametric model. We also demonstrate how the spatiotemporal marginal effects from the model can be used to conduct policy analysis at multiple spatial and temporal scales, which is not possible using the standard global parameter estimates. Our proposed technique is simple to execute and can be implemented using any statistical software package. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The study assesses whether the Eurochocolate festival, held every October in Perugia, Italy, contributes to the development of local tourism, thereby enhancing economic growth in the city. A trend analysis was undertaken, based on data relating to arrivals and presences over a period of several years, the application of a statistical regression model dealing with arrivals, and the results of a visitor survey. The authors conclude that, while the event is privately owned with most profits going to the organizing firm, it also generates considerable benefits for the local economy.

This paper examines associations between household, school, and neighbourhood SES measures with body composition outcomes in 16 year old South African Black urban adolescents from the 1990 born Birth to Twenty (Bt20) cohort. Multivariable regression analyses were applied to data from a sub-sample of the Bt20 cohort (n = 346, 53% male) with measures taken at birth and 16 years of age to establish socio-economic, biological, and demographic predictors of fat mass, lean mass, and body mass index (BMI). Results were compared with earlier published evidence of health inequality at ages 9-10 years in Bt20. Consistent predictors of higher fat mass and BMI in fully adjusted models were being female, born post term, having a mother with post secondary school education, and having an obese mother. Most measures of SES were only weakly associated with body composition, with an inconsistent direction of association. This is in contrast to earlier findings with Bt20 9-10 year olds where SES inequalities in body composition were observed. Findings suggest targeting obesity interventions at females in households where a mother has a high BMI. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The study of international institutions and global governance is part of this larger inquiry. With China's rising importance in the global economic system, it might be expected that IPE scholarship in China would give rise to uniquely Chinese' approaches to this area of inquiry, approaches informed by China's position in the world and China's rich cultural and intellectual traditions. However, our examination of Chinese scholarship shows that thus far, it has produced little new knowledge and theoretical innovation. Why has this been the case? We argue that it is because (1) as a new field of study, IPE in China - including the study of international institutions and global governance - is still under the strong socialization effect of Western scholarship; and (2) the institutional environment in China constrains the kind of research that promises new insights and innovative perspectives. We also discuss how scholarship in China could contribute to the positive evolution of IPE globally in the future, and the obstacles that may hinder this development.","[Pang Zhongying] Renmin Univ, Sch Int Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongying] Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Renmin University of China; University of Waterloo,"Pang, ZY (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ, Sch Int Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,120,10,11,0,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In this context, the gradual integration/membership concept could be an interesting option for both parties. The depreciation of full membership in the case of Turkey has weakened the EU conditionality policy in general.

The proposed model involves four types of agents: local authorities, property developers, households and household workers (i.e. commuters). The local authorities aim to maximize the total social welfare of the urban system by determining the optimal density of radial major roads in the city. The property developers seek to determine the intensity of their capital investment in the land market to maximize the net profit generated from the housing supply. The households choose residential locations that maximize their utility within a budget constraint, and the commuters choose the radial major roads that minimize their individual costs of travel between home and workplace. A heuristic solution procedure is developed to find the urban system equilibrium solution. A system optimum model is also proposed to optimize the density of radial major roads that maximizes the social welfare of the urban system. The proposed model can endogenously determine household residential distribution and land values across the city, along with the housing market structure in terms of housing prices and space. Numerical comparative static analyses of congestion pricing and road infrastructure investment (adding a new radial major road) are carried out together with evaluation of the effects of the service level of radial major roads, urban population size, and household income level on the urban economy.

The central claim is that objective violence, the very real experience of the collectivisation drive, becomes subjective violence as it is internalised over time. In the context of the process of collectivisation violence, the lines between victims and perpetrators were blurred in important ways. The end of the Soviet Union triggered a re-evaluation of the meaning of that violence which is still in a state of flux today.","McMaster Univ, Dept Hist, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada",McMaster University,"McDonald, T (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Hist, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",tmcdon@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,NOV 1,2013,65.0,9,,,SI,,1827,1847,,10.1080/09668136.2013.842361,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,293PA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329983700009,0

There is the view that a small or declining volume of trading implies less information and lower quality information, and that a lower level of price informativeness will lead analysts to put more weight on their private information at the time of forecasting. We add to this view the notion that when uncertainty is high there might be a positive option value of waiting. In this case, it appears reasonable to conclude that analysts may actually lack consensus when uncertainty is high. If this hypothesis is correct, then one would expect the level of price informativeness to override the Keynesian incentive to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally or at least reduce its magnitude in periods of declining trading volume and low price discovery. Tests of this hypothesis produce favorable results.","[Shilling, James D.] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60606 USA; [Sirmans, C.

Using interviews with personal home care clients in Toronto, this article extends discussions of emotion management. Both management and recipients expect the worker to respectfully meet and anticipate clients' individual needs but this is relational service, not emotional labour, because it is motivated by relationship building. Most clients also want caring work but it is unclear if and when this is part of the job. This preferred emotion management stems neither from explicit organizational rules nor implicit social rules, but from organizational signals informally communicated to workers by recipients. Some recipients send social signals for care beyond the job, which can take the form of unpaid labour or friendship. The article offers an extended typology of emotion management that can incorporate clients, managers and workers as actors in service work.","[Cranford, Cynthia J.] Univ Toronto, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Miller, Diana] Univ Toronto, Dept Sociol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Cranford, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, 3359 Mississauga Rd North, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",c.cranford@utoronto.ca,"Miller, Diana/JVN-1005-2024","Miller, Diana/0000-0003-2508-344X",,,,,22,24,25,2,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This study examines the effect of the World Health Organization''s prenatal care recommendations for developing countries. It accounts for the endogenous nature of prenatal care decisions by using an instrumental variables approach based on the opportunity cost and accessibility of prenatal services. Using the urban sample of the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, I construct a measure of prenatal care based on the WHO recommendations. This measure involves both timing and intensity. The instrumental variable used is shown to be strong and valid. The results show that adequate care has a positive impact on birth weight and decreases the probability of poor birth outcomes. The results are robust to seasonality and time effects and are not driven by the potential influence of rainfall shocks on maternal health. I also test the effectiveness of the WHO methodology by modifying the definition of adequate care in terms of both its timing and frequency.

This article examines the influence of extrinsic job characteristics (e.g. wages and benefits) versus intrinsic characteristics (e.g. meaningful tasks) on job satisfaction and intent to stay with one's current employer. This article uses a mixed-methods approach, drawing on survey data collected from frontline workers and organizations in a variety of healthcare settings, as well as interview and focus group data from frontline workers to contextualize and interpret the findings in the multi-level models.

In this paper we analyze the impacts of speed limit policies, i.e. restricting the maximum permissible road traffic speed, on an urban economy. While most existing studies do only focus on the effects of speed limits on frequency and severity of accidents, we provide a more general assessment of speed limit policies by employing a spatial computable general equilibrium model calibrated to an 'average' German metropolitan area. It is shown that besides transport related effects additional economic effects may influence the overall performance of speed limit policies significantly. Driven by spatial economic effects, tightening speed limits on all roads, i.e. setting a general urban speed limit of, e.g. 30 km/h, lowers aggregate social welfare, although aggregate environmental and accident costs decline. However, setting speed limits around the city center only and not in suburban areas with access to beltways curtails negative effects on the urban economy and, in the end, may result in overall welfare gains. Therefore, our results suggest that implementing a general speed limit uniformly in the entire urban area, thus paying no attention to the spatial shape of the city and its road network, is likely to be an inadequate measure to enhance social welfare. However, restricting speed limits locally, thus focusing on the design of a 'slow zone', is essential and, in the end, is a more promising speed regulation policy having more likely the chance to enhance social welfare.

Of note, I characterize each of the uncovered sets in terms of a decomposition into choices from externally stable sets, and I define the minimal generalized covering solution, a nonempty refinement of the deep uncovered set that employs both of the new relations.","[Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester; University of Rochester,"Duggan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",dugg@troi.cc.rochester.edu,,"duggan, john/0000-0002-3890-6786; Duggan, John/0000-0001-8554-2594",,,,,33,30,30,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2013,41.0,3,,,,,489,535,,10.1007/s00355-012-0696-9,0.0,,,47,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,202XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323254900003,0

The main results of the article show that, between 2000 and 2007, an increasing number of European jobs were dependent on extra-EU exports and on the strengthening of the trade linkages across the internal market. During the period considered, the EU employment supported by extra-EU exports grew from 22 to 25 million jobs, out of which 9 million jobs (in 2007) were due to spillover and feedback effects associated with the single market. Between 2000 and 2007 the EU also became a more vertically integrated economy, and reduced the labour intensity of the extra-EU exports.","[Manuel Rueda-Cantuche, Jose] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Rueda-Cantuche, JM (通讯作者)，Pablo de Olavide Univ, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",jmruecan@upo.es,"ARTO, IÑAKI/D-6807-2014",,,,,,26,8,8,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The mechanism to update the parameters over time is the scaled score of the likelihood function. This new approach provides a unified and consistent framework for introducing time-varying parameters in a wide class of nonlinear models. The GAS model encompasses other well-known models such as the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, autoregressive conditional duration, autoregressive conditional intensity, and Poisson count models with time-varying mean. In addition, our approach can lead to new formulations of observation-driven models. We illustrate our framework by introducing new model specifications for time-varying copula functions and for multivariate point processes with time-varying parameters. We study the models in detail and provide simulation and empirical evidence.

This article rectifies this deficiency by providing an account of the genesis of the Bank's program of structural adjustment. Drawing on documents from the Bank's archives as well as interviews with former Bank officials, the paper argues that the creation of structural adjustment lending in 1980 resulted from frustration among the Bank's senior management at the slow disbursement of the organization's regular project loans. Rather than a reaction to demands from powerful states, as many observers have assumed, structural adjustment was an internally driven response to flaws in the Bank's operations. In emphasizing the Bank's autonomy, this article supplements approaches that emphasize the importance of budget maximization and mission creep as determinants of international organization behavior.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Bancroft Lib, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Sharma, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Bancroft Lib, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,38,22,25,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Error correction model estimates indicate that a different mix of shocks drives international price deviations at the microeconomic level and that dynamic adjustment works through arbitrage in the goods market rather than the foreign exchange market. When half-lives are estimated conditional on a common set of estimated macro shocks, we find that micro relative prices exhibit every bit as much persistence as aggregate real exchange rates.

For the spatial error model, we propose a new methodology for estimation of spatial weights under the assumption of symmetric spatial weights, with extensions to other important spatial models. The methodology is applied to regional housing markets in the UK, providing an estimated spatial weights matrix that generates several new hypotheses about the economic and socio-cultural drivers of spatial diffusion in housing demand.

The countries' relative sizes as well as the intensity of negative environmental externality affect potential welfare gains of trade liberalisation. In line with Lambertini (1997a) we show that, as long as no trade policy is undertaken by the government of the larger country, trade liberalisation is not feasible since the latter always loses from opening to trade. A subsidy policy in favour of the firm producing the clean good is, on the contrary, shown to give both countries the right incentives to liberalise trade. Allowing for redistributive transfers between countries further extends the parametric range for which trade liberalisation is feasible under the subsidy scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A bottom-up methodology is developed to estimate the emissions based upon passenger travel behaviors in cities, which is notably different from popular existing approaches that calculate emissions from vehicular population. This methodology enables policy analysts to (1) quantify how different urban development strategies and patterns would affect about CO2 emissions; (2) directly link behavioral changes with urban development patterns and policies; and (3) analyze and understand the sensitivities of the urban passenger transportation sector in responding to both national- and city-level policies for carbon mitigation, thus helping the policy evaluation and development. Detailed information regarding urban passenger travels are collected in grouped Chinese cities of six categories. With the newly developed methodology, total carbon emissions from China's urban passenger transportation sector under three scenarios are considered. The results showed that mode choice changes are the most sensitive to policies. Promoting public transportation and limiting car usage can contribute 21% of the total energy reduction of China's transportation sector in 2030. Enhancing the above by optimizing street network and urban form, this contribution can be doubled in size. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The US upstream (respectively downstream) firm is technologically more advanced than the Chinese upstream (respectively downstream) firm. The locations of the upstream firms and the US downstream firm are fixed, and the Chinese downstream firm chooses its product location. The downstream firms compete with each other in US market. We aim to explore the conditions under which an international vertical merger between the Chinese downstream firm and the US upstream firm occurs and its welfare implications. We show that the incentive for the Chinese downstream firm to initiate a technology-acquiring international vertical merger crucially depends on the market conditions of the United States. As compared to exporting or domestic vertical merger, international vertical merger is by no means an optimal choice for the Chinese downstream firm when there is no negative demand shocks to US market. This result remains to hold when the US downstream firm also has the option of initiating a merger with the US upstream firm. Nevertheless, in the case of a negative demand shock, a profitable international vertical merger may occur. However, such mergers worsen the social welfare of the United States.","[Li, Jie] Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xianhai] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Zhejiang University,"Huang, XH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",hxhhz@126.com,"Li, Jie/AAE-6389-2019",,,,,,20,1,1,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2013,36.0,7,,,SI,,843,860,,10.1111/twec.12087,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,182NN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321750400002,0

The analysis is restricted to end-to-end competition. The effect on the incentives to innovate of letter volume, public ownership and other control variables is also tested. Data on liberalisation, competition and innovation in the postal sector is collected for seventeen European countries over eleven years. Three measures are used as proxies for innovation: (1) an innovation index based on a survey conducted for this purpose; (2) the accumulated number of innovations (based on the same survey); and (3) labour productivity. We also develop a liberalisation index to measure the percentage of market liberalised (in terms of letter volume). Several models are estimated by GLS. In general, the models estimated have a high explanatory power. We find evidence that market liberalisation has a positive effect on innovation and that an increase in the market share of the competitors stimulates the investment in innovation, at least until the market share of the competitors reaches a certain threshold. Letter volume is also significant and has a positive impact on innovation. GDP per capita turns out to be significant and has a positive relationship with innovation in all the models estimated.","Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, EPFL CDM MIR, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Felisberto, C (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, EPFL CDM MIR, Bassenges Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",catia.felisberto@gmail.com,,"Felisberto, Catia/0000-0002-5894-3779",,,,,30,3,3,1,20,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Adopting a neo-Polanyian economic sociology approach, this article asks what conditions European governance capacity to respond to these challenges, at either national or regional levels, using biofuels as a case study. It asks if the complexity of its political institutions, and the heterogeneity of interests and economic organisations, present the biggest obstacle of all' (Cohen 2007) to reduce fossil fuel dependency. By examining the European Commission level and comparing five countries, evidence is produced for a political failure in terms of continued fossil fuel dependency. Incumbent interests in the agricultural sector and a distinctively European legacy of a transport fleet dependent on fossil diesel, have led to a marriage of convenience between rapeseed farmers and vehicle manufacturers. As a consequence, rather than escaping from the path dependency on fossil fuels (Unruh 2000), Europe has gone down a cul-de-sac of rapeseed biodiesel inherently limited in scope, and with the low levels of greenhouse gas emissions savings. Ironically this outcome is in part an unintended consequence of opposition to biofuels from environmentalist groups and politics.","[Harvey, Mark] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Pilgrim, Sarah] Univ Essex, Dept Biol, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex; University of Essex,"Harvey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",MHarvey@essex.ac.uk,,"Harvey, Mark/0000-0001-5486-7257",,,,,60,12,12,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Existing approaches, however, presume that those variables affecting the coefficients are continuous in nature (or that there exists at least one such continuous variable) which is often not the case. Furthermore, when all variables affecting the coefficients are categorical/discrete, theoretical underpinnings cannot be obtained as a special case of existing approaches and, as such, requires a separate treatment. In this paper we use kernel-based methods that place minimal structure on the underlying mechanism governing parameter variation across categorical variables while providing a consistent and efficient approach that may be of interest to practitioners. One area where such models could be particularly useful is in settings where interactions among the categorical and real-valued predictors consume many (or even exhaust) degrees of freedom for fully parametric models (which is frequently the case in applied settings). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach behaves optimally when in fact there is no variation in a model's coefficients across one or more of the categorical variables (i.e. the approach pools over such variables with a high probability). An illustrative application demonstrates potential benefits for applied researchers.

Some of these are familiar: the Chinese economy, while large, remains poor; China's financial markets lack depth and liquidity; encouraging international use of the renminbi will require substantial capital account liberalisation, in the course of which things can go wrong. In addition, I highlight a less familiar challenge: China's political system may be an obstacle to renminbi internationalisation. Since the early nineteenth century, the leading international currency or currencies have been those of countries with democratic political systems where there are constraints on the executive, which have built durable alliances, and where creditors are well represented. This is not a prediction that China must have a Democratic Spring before the renminbi becomes a leading international and reserve currency.

Advocates of historic districts assume that such districts augment, or at least, protect property values for homes within these districts. The existing economic literature supports this conclusion, but most studies seem to fall victim to an endogeneity bias since higher value homes are, all else equal, more likely to be included in districts. This study uses repeat-sales fixed effects (difference-in-differences) analysis to look at homes before and after the creation of districts in the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy MSA between 2000 and 2007, and thus control for this endogeneity bias. Secondarily, we re-examine the effects of a Massachusetts preservation policy, the Community Preservation Act (CPA) which, in part, supports historic preservation. We find evidence that the creation of a local historic district, on average, reduces home prices for homes in that district between 11.6 and 15.5%. This indicates that any restrictions implied by the creation of a district outweigh any benefits to homeowners within the district. If, instead, census block fixed effects are employed, the analysis shows a statistically insignificant impact, the sign and magnitude of which depends on the specification. Taken together with the repeat sales result, this confirms our intuition about the importance of controlling for omitted variables and endogeneity biases.

Pricing and taxation of vehicle ownership plays a major role, as it affects purchasing behavior, overall ownership and use of vehicles. There is a lack in robust assessments of the life cycle energy and environmental effects of a number of key car pricing and taxation instruments, including graded purchase taxes, vehicle excise duties and vehicle scrappage incentives. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring which type of vehicle taxation accelerates fuel, technology and purchasing behavioral transitions the fastest with (i) most tailpipe and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions savings, (ii) potential revenue neutrality for the Treasury and (iii) no adverse effects on car ownership and use. The UK Transport Carbon Model was developed further and used to assess long term scenarios of low carbon fiscal policies and their effects on transport demand, vehicle stock evolution, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. The modeling results suggest that policy choice, design and timing can play crucial roles in meeting multiple policy goals. Both CO2 grading and tightening of CO2 limits over time are crucial in achieving the transition to low carbon mobility. Of the policy scenarios investigated here the more ambitious and complex car purchase tax and feebate policies are most effective in accelerating low carbon technology uptake, reducing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and, if designed carefully, can avoid overburdening consumers with ever more taxation whilst ensuring revenue neutrality. Highly graduated road taxes (or VED) can also be successful in reducing emissions; but while they can provide handy revenue streams to governments that could be recycled in accompanying low carbon measures they are likely to face opposition by the driving population and car lobby groups. Scrappage schemes are found to save little carbon and may even increase emissions on a life cycle basis. The main policy implication of this work is that in order to reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from transport governments should focus on designing incentive schemes with strong up-front price signals that reward 'low carbon' and penalize 'high carbon'. Policy instruments should also be subject to early scrutiny of the longer term impacts on government revenue and pay attention to the need for flanking policies to boost these revenues and maintain the marginal cost of driving.

However, the use of hybrid discrete choice models constitutes an innovative alternative for integrating subjective attitudes and perceptions deriving from the survey of attitudes with the more objective variables from the stated choice experiment. This paper analyzes the results of applying these models to measure the acceptability of interurban road pricing among different groups of stakeholders (road freight and passenger operators, highway concessionaires, and associations of private car users) with qualitatively significant opinions on road pricing measures. Our results show that hybrid models are better suited to explaining the acceptability of a road pricing scheme by different groups of stakeholders than a separate analysis of the survey of attitudes and a discrete-choice model applied on a stated choice experiment. A particular finding was that the strong psycho-social latent variable of the perception of fairness explains the rejection or acceptance of a toll scheme by road stakeholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

By replacing the traditional fuel source, petrol, with electricity, PEVs will increase the demand for electric power in a region and change emission profiles. Overall, the impacts depend on the eventual penetration of PEV ownership, but the true market share of PEVs in the future is highly unclear and radically different scenarios are possible. This added forecasting volatility makes long-term transport models that explicitly consider travel demand uncertainty even more critical. This work Utilizes transport modeling tools in order to quantify the relationship between the travel patterns of PEV drivers and PEV energy consumption rates, as well as the corresponding environmental impact (measured by emissions savings relative to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles). Furthermore, this research explicitly addresses the relationship between long term travel demand uncertainty and system level energy consumption variability, an essential issue for regional energy providers and planners. Results and implications are discussed on both a small demonstration network and the Sioux Falls network. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

From being relatively unpopular and very much on the sidelines, the idea of macroprudential regulation (MPR) moved to the centre of the policy agenda and came to represent a new Basel consensus, as the principal interpretative frame, for financial technocrats and regulators seeking to diagnose and understand the financial crisis and to advance institutional blueprints for regulatory reform. This article sets out to explain how and why that ideational shift occurred. It identifies four scoping conditions of presence, position, promotion, and plausibility, that account for the successful rise to prominence of macroprudential ideas through an insiders' coup d'etat. The final section of the article argues that this macroprudential shift is an example of a gestalt flip' or third order change in Peter Hall's terms, but it is not yet a paradigm shift, because the development of first order policy settings and second order policy instruments is still ongoing, giving the macroprudential ideational shift a highly contested and contingent character.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Studies & Philosophy, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Baker, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Studies & Philosophy, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",a.baker@qub.ac.uk,,"Baker, Andrew/0000-0001-6677-930X",,,,,101,202,210,0,74,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We find that homeowners are responsive to the upfront costs of the renovation projects, government-offered rebates, savings in energy expenses, time horizon over which such savings would be realized, and thermal comfort improvement. The implicit discount rate is low, ranging from 1.5 to 3%, depending on model specification. This is consistent with Hassett and Metcalf (1993) and Metcalf and Rosenthal (1995), and with the fact that our scenarios contain no uncertainty. Respondents who feel completely uncertain about future energy prices are more likely to select the status quo (no renovations) in any given choice task and weight the costs of the investments more heavily than the financial gains (subsidies and savings on the energy bills).

For private goods economies, we use a weaker condition than Maskin monotonicity that we call unilateral monotonicity.

We introduce and discuss various classical single-peaked preference domains and show which of the domain conditions they satisfy (see Propositions 1 and 2 and an overview in Table 1).

The correct determination of economic capital appropriate level depends on the goodness of it's fitting to the distribution. The distribution fitting study to empirical data will be conducted using the following tools: graphical analysis, testing empirical distribution fitting quality with goodness of fitting test to the theoretical distribution.

The inventors of this theory came to the conclusion that international trade was good for the individual economies involved, and that it had positive consequences for world economy as well. To explain this theory we can use two approaches through Possibility Production Frontier curves (Heckscher-Ohlin model) or through Edgeworth-box-diagram (factor-price equalization model). The second one is more comprehensive and conclusive because it includes a conception of factor production inputs (PPF curves) and a conception of production output and utilization (IC curves) as well.

Prices, profits and welfare are compared under welfare maximisation, network monopoly and a scenario with competition over one part of the network. Given that inducing actual competition may bring disbenefits such as cost duplication and co-ordination costs, we also explore the possibility of a regulator using the threat of entry on a section of the monopoly network in order to bring about the socially preferred level of interconnectivity.

Robust matrix is a matrix for which the orbit reaches an eigenvector with any nontrivial starting vector. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the robustness of a matrix in max-drast fuzzy algebra. However, in practice we deal often with inexact input data.

However, both aestheticism culture and samurai culture are an epitome of the development of Japanese culture. The attribute hidden in the connotation of Japanese culture lies in the cultural sport vigor with various specialties shown in the process of accepting culture, developing culture and innovating culture. From this perspective, the most concentrated reflection of Japanese culture derives from its variation in culture traits. Aiming at this question, we carry out profound researches and analyses. As a result, we easily find that the variability of Japanese culture is reflected by using literature as a carrier to a large extent. In this process, literature is a part of culture, culture is a part of literature and social culture is a part of era culture so that they also show obvious feature with variability during their development. Therefore, it is easy to find researches on Japanese culture traits should begin with the study on Japanese literature. According to this practical situation, this thesis focuses on researches on Japanese culture traits. Based on analyses of Japanese literature, it not only starts from analyses of basic features of Japanese literature and Japanese culture traits based on Japanese literature but also concentrates on the central issue, i.e., researches on Japanese culture traits based on Japanese literature, to develop detailed analyses and statement.

Using analysis of contingency tables we will evaluate interesting dependence between frequency of organic food purchases and other indicators. Furthermore we will identify the target group for marketing strategies. Correspondence analysis is a multivariate statistical technique. It is conceptually similar to principal component analysis, but applies to categorical rather than continuous data. In a similar way as a principal component analysis, it provides means of displaying or summarizing a set of data in two-dimensional graphical form. The graphical representation of results from correspondence analysis is commonly done with so-called symmetric maps. Using correspondence analysis of observed data we will identify what the respondents most often link various organic labeling with and we will propose a better flow of information.","[Zamkova, Martina; Prokop, Martin] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Math, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava,,martina.zamkova@centrum.cz; martin.prokop@vspj.cz,"Zámková, Martina/AGI-7972-2022","Zámková, Martina/0000-0001-9713-5435",,,,,12,1,1,0,3,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1035,1040,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000175,0

To investigate this issue we analyze a large sample of appraisal data at the individual property level from the Investment Property Databank. We find that commonly used unsmoothing estimates at the index level overstate the extent of smoothing that takes place at the individual property level.

The inflexible supply and volatile demand of the hotel industry offer an ideal case study to confirm Tisdell's theory. This paper provides an empirical test of Tisdell's model, and the authors find that price instability has a statistically significant and negative effect on hotel profitability.

An analytical formula, using risk assessment technique, explicitly expresses the cost of travel time unreliability as the sum of the products of the consequences (i.e. variability) and the corresponding probabilities of breakdown. It provides a novel measure of travel time reliability and is applicable in network performance evaluations. An empirical example based on a large dataset of freeway traffic flow data from loop detectors shows that the developed travel time reliability measure is both intuitively logical and consistent.

We propose a new procedure for the construction of choice sets from weak tournaments, based on dynamic stability criteria. The idea is to analyze dynamic versions of tournament games. The exploration of a specific class of Markov perfect equilibria in these dynamic tournament games yields a new solution concept for weak tournaments-the A-stable set. The alternatives in an A-stable set constitute persistent, long-run policy outcomes in the corresponding dynamic tournament games. We find that, in any weak tournament, the class of A-stable sets coincides with that of von Neumann-Morgenstern stable sets.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Anesi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk,Room B18,Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",vincent.anesi@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Anesi, Vincent/0000-0003-4424-2581",,,,,26,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2012,39.0,4,,,,,919,930,,10.1007/s00355-011-0561-2,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,015VE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309473700013,0

This market can thus be viewed as largely local, and it is therefore not clear whether there should be any linkage between price movements for Canadian art and those for the mainstream international market in old master, impressionist, and modern art. This article investigates the presence and nature of such time series dependence econometrically, both in terms of long-term trends as reflected in the co-integrating relationship between Canadian and the international market, and in terms of short-run co-movements as represented in correlations. The possibility that the local market follows the international one is also considered through an analysis of Granger causality. For Canadian art prices, we use a new hedonic index that has been computed using an updated version of the dataset of Hodgson and Vorkink (Can J Econ 37:629-655, 2004), while for the international prices, we use an index provided by Mei and Moses (Am Econ Rev 92:1656-1668, 2002).","[Hodgson, Douglas J.] Univ Quebec, Dept Econ, Downtown Stn, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Seckin, Aylin] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Istanbul Bilgi University,"Hodgson, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Econ, Downtown Stn, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",hodgson.douglas@uqam.ca; aseckin@bilgi.edu.tr,,"SECKIN, ZENNUBE AYLIN/0000-0003-4139-2728",,,,,34,11,11,0,24,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The Euro-Mediterranean strategy embraces this point of view even though local policies (national and regional) continue to protect local labour market not considering that recent research works assure that foreign manpower doesn't spoil local resident wages and actually contribute to local economies (Longhi, Nijkamp and Poot, 2005). Considering the gap between theoretical assumptions and real behaviors, the paper reports a field survey in the South-East Sicily Horticultural District, one of the major migration-attractive zones in southern Italy agriculture. The paper aims at giving some insights into the District benefit firm immigrants' work-force in internationalizing its patterns. Fifteen key informants have been selected and interviewed performing face-to-face interviews for a total of 20 hours during the year 2011. The research allows us to affirm that the local communities and local governments substantially use migrants manpower to lower production costs, actually profiting of illegal conditions to control the local market.

Yet, although much less documented, migrant networks may well have a great influence on remittances to their home country and particularly to their origin households. Given all the services provided by the network, the fear of being ostracized by network members and being left with no support could provide incentives for migrants to commit to prevailing redistribution norms. In this perspective, remittances may be a fee that migrants pay to get access to network services. In this paper, we thus analyze to what extent migrant networks in the destination country influence the degree to which migrants meet the claims of those left behind. We first review existing models of remitting behavior and investigate how the potential role of networks could affect their main predictions. We then provide a simple illustrative theoretical framework to account for the double impact networks may have on remitting behavior, through the provision of services to migrants and the spread of information flows between home and host countries. We finally use an original dataset of 602 Senegalese migrants residing in France and Italy to explore the main predictions of our model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

On the one hand, this extension is rooted in a comprehensive consideration of theoretical aspects that, so far, have been neglected in the literature on football teams: Team composition and institutionalization processes. The empirical results indicate that teams that are heterogeneous on several relevant traits perform significantly worse than more homogeneous teams. Moreover, even though the Flat Back lineup (Abwehrkette) became tremendously popular within the 1992-2003 observation period-thereby representing a prime example of an institutionalized practice-substantial regression analyses do not indicate any performance advantages of this innovative defense system. Thus, we are unable to reject the new institutionalism's view that novel organizational procedures might successfully diffuse without possessing any practical added value for the adopting organizations! On the other hand, we provide a novel suggestion to control for regression-to-the-mean-phenomena in statistical models of football match results: Team ranking covariates prove as elegant and powerful controls for regression-to-the-mean effects within the fixed effects regression setup.","[Meyer, Mark] GWS mbH, Inst Econ Struct Res, D-49080 Osnabruck, Germany; [Beck, Nikolaus] Univ Lugano, Fac Econ, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland",Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Meyer, M (通讯作者)，GWS mbH, Inst Econ Struct Res, Heinrichstr 30, D-49080 Osnabruck, Germany.",nikolaus.beck@usi.ch; m.meyer@gws-os.de,,,,,,,38,4,4,2,28,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper analyses the economic effects of potential entry of Argentine lemons into the United States under alternative geographic and seasonal restrictions. One challenge to assessing the economic effect of entry is determining the post-entry quantity of Argentine exports. Using a homothetic trans-log expenditure function, we calibrate a set of reservation prices for US demand for Argentine lemons based on observed prices and quantities of other lemon varieties. These are compared with a set of projected entry prices to determine whether entry will occur and post-entry export levels. Across the policy scenarios, Argentine lemon exports to the United States range from 8.0 to 14.9 million kg. Higher prices for Argentine lemons reduce its exports to the European Union and other markets, while lemon exports from Chile and Mexico are adversely affected. Broader applications of regional and/or seasonal restrictions may be effective policies for achieving pest risk mitigation goals in a manner consistent with WTO obligations to minimise distortions to trade.","[Cororaton, Caesar B.] Virginia Tech, Inst Soc Culture & Environm, Arlington, VA USA; [Peterson, Everett B.] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Cororaton, CB (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Inst Soc Culture & Environm, Arlington, VA USA.",,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2012,35.0,8,,,SI,,1022,1036,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01460.x,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,986IZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307336600005,0

Discussions of the positive and negative impacts of such standards on farmers in developing countries are associated with the way they are implemented and enforced, with particular emphasis being placed on how these standards introduce prescriptive controls at the farm level backed up by audit and third-party certification. Enactment in the United States of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) in January 2011 adds a new element to the discussion of private standards. The Act mandates the introduction of risk-based controls on domestic farms for fruits and vegetables deemed high risk. It also places an obligation on food importers to ensure that their suppliers observe equivalent levels of safety controls. The FSMA is likely to lead to farm-level controls and certification as seen with private food safety standards as they have developed in Europe.","Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",,"Humphrey, J (通讯作者)，Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,,,,,,,31,8,9,0,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2012,35.0,8,,,SI,,994,1005,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01458.x,0.0,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,986IZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307336600003,0

In general, the aggregate elasticity is not equal to the mean of individual elasticities. The difference depends on the heterogeneity of the population and is quantified by a covariance term. Sign and magnitude of this term are determined by an empirical analysis based on the UK Family Expenditure Survey. It is shown that the relevant quantities can be identified from cross-sectional data and, without imposing restrictive structural assumptions, can be estimated by nonparametric techniques. It turns out that the aggregate elasticity significantly overestimates the mean of individual elasticities for many commodity groups.

The article extends this literature by investigating the relationship between individual-level housework conflict and country-level measures of divorce and women's bargaining power. Using European Social Survey data (n = 18,560), it tests the multi-level relationship between individual-level housework conflict and country-level rates of the following four measures: marriage, divorce, full-time female labour force participation and the female-male wage gap. The multi-level results demonstrate that both men and women report more housework conflict in countries with higher rates of women's full-time labour force participation and divorce, and women report less conflict in countries with higher rates of marriage.","Univ Hawaii, Hilo, HI 96743 USA",University of Hawaii System; University Hawaii Hilo,"Ruppanner, L (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, 200 W Kawili St, Hilo, HI 96743 USA.",lruppann@hawaii.edu,,"Ruppanner, Leah/0000-0002-6111-1914",,,,,50,15,16,3,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Dramatic social and economic transitions during this 33 year period provide a unique opportunity to understand changes in growth within this historic context. We analyzed the changes in height of boys, aged 7-18 years, from surveys conducted in 1955, 1966, 1978 and 1988. Data for height were converted to Z-scores using the LMS method and the 2000 National Center for Health Statistics reference. In each consecutive survey year, boys at all ages were significantly taller than the same aged boys from the previous survey year, with mean height increases of a 2.35 cm, 3.43 cm and 1.47 cm between 1955 and 1966, 1966 and 1978 and 1978 and 1988, respectively. There were significant declines with age in height Z-scores from 7 to 14 years of age, followed by improvements relative to the reference between 14 and 18 years of age. The decline in Z-scores may be partially explained by an effect of delayed maturation. However, historic context also supports that some birth cohorts likely experienced a more adverse environment during early childhood than did other birth cohorts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It is generally believed that the market risks of the assets, often denoted by a beta coefficient, should change over time. In this paper, we model timevarying market betas in CAPM by a smooth transition regime switching CAPM with heteroscedasticity, which provides flexible nonlinear representation of market betas as well as flexible asymmetry and clustering in volatility. We also employ the quantile regression to investigate the nonlinear behavior in the market betas and volatility under various market conditions represented by different quantile levels. Parameter estimation is done by a Bayesian approach. Finally, we analyze some Dow Jones Industrial stocks to demonstrate our proposed models. The model selection method shows that the proposed smooth transition quantile CAPM-GARCH model is strongly preferred over a sharp threshold transition and a symmetric CAPM-GARCH model.","[Chen, Cathy W.

The basic idea is that from this measure of regional concentration of different activities within a country we can identify industries where there appears to be regional trade, and hence also a potential for international trade. Based on our method, we find that: (i) the number of employed in tradable service appears to be at least as large as in the manufacturing sector, (ii) tradable service is much more skill intensive than manufacturing, and (iii) lately, the employment in tradable service has increased substantially. We argue that the last mentioned result is consistent with the substantial growth of skilled labour in Sweden since the mid-1990s (Rybczynski effect) and factors leading to increased relative demand for skilled labour. Particularly, increased competition from and offshoring to low-wage countries seem recently to have had a considerable impact on the creation of skilled jobs and the displacement of less skilled jobs in the tradable sector in Sweden. Furthermore, we apply a similar method as for industries to identify tradable occupations. Using our classification of tradable industries and tradable occupations in a Mincer type wage equation, we find that workers in such industries and occupations receive a wage premia of 1213 per cent.","[Eliasson, Kent; Hansson, Par; Lindvert, Markus] Swedish Agcy Growth Policy Anal, Stockholm, Sweden; [Eliasson, Kent; Hansson, Par; Lindvert, Markus] Swedish Agcy Growth Policy Anal, Ostersund, Sweden; [Eliasson, Kent] Umea Univ, Umea, Sweden; [Hansson, Par] Univ Orebro, Orebro, Sweden",Umea University; Orebro University,"Eliasson, K (通讯作者)，Swedish Agcy Growth Policy Anal, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,,16,5,5,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2012,35.0,5,,,,,578,608,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01413.x,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,936NV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303598200003,0

Price-to-rent ratios in Beijing and seven other large markets across the country have increased by 30% to 70% since the beginning of 2007. Current price-to-rent ratios imply very low user costs of no more than 2%-3% of house value. Very high expected capital gains appear necessary to justify such low user costs of owning. Our calculations suggest that even modest declines in expected appreciation would lead to large price declines of over 40% in markets such as Beijing, absent offsetting rent increases or other countervailing factors. Price-to-income ratios also are at their highest levels ever in Beijing and select other markets, but urban income growth has outpaced price appreciation in major markets off the coast. Much of the increase in prices is occurring in land values. Using data from the local land auction market in Beijing, we are able to produce a constant quality land price index for that city. Real, constant quality land values have increased by nearly 800% since the first quarter of 2003, with half that rise occurring over the past two years. State-owned enterprises controlled by the central government have played an important role in this increase, as our analysis shows they paid 27% more than other bidders for an otherwise equivalent land parcel.

This paper assesses the functional form of the impact of migration on trade flows in a quasi-experimental setting. We provide evidence that the relationship is not log-linear. In particular, at small levels of immigration (stocks) the elasticity of trade to migration is quite high, and it declines to zero at about 4,000 immigrants. If immigration stocks exceed such a level, the evidence suggests that trade will not increase anymore. This suggests that for cross-country network and other effects flowing from immigration to materialise at a significant level for trade, a high-enough level of immigrant stocks is necessary. But there appears to be satiation as immigrant numbers increase.","[Egger, Peter H.; von Ehrlich, Maximilian] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland; [Nelson, Douglas R.] Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Tulane University,"Egger, PH (通讯作者)，ETH, Zurich, Switzerland.",,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207; Nelson, Douglas/0000-0003-0464-0745",,,,,91,59,62,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2012,35.0,2,,,SI,,216,241,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01429.x,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,897VL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300687100006,0

They interpreted their performance measures in information theoretic terms and provided new generalizations of Shannon entropy and Kullback-Leibler relative entropy and called them U-entropy and U-relative entropy. In this article, a utility-based criterion for independence of two random variables is defined. Then, Markov's inequality for probabilities is extended from the U-entropy viewpoint. Moreover, a lower bound for the U-relative entropy is obtained. Finally, a link between conditional U-entropy and conditional Renyi entropy is derived.","[Borzadaran, G. R.

ARDL bound test is employed to determine long run association, while standard Granger causality test is utilised to check the flow of causations in the variables. The findings illustrate the presence of long run connection. The paper further observes two-way causation between electricity consumption and economic growth. Similarly, two-way causation is also established for urbanization and economic growth; and between urbanization and electricity consumption. Premised on these findings, Angola is an energy (electricity) dependent country.

It is therefore not surprising that resource sharing, virtualization, cross-site scripting, malware, and similar concepts may result in increased risk and security vulnerabilities. Some of these vulnerabilities arise from the distributed nature of cloud computing. From this category, we will discuss insecure APIs, distributed denial of service attacks. To provide confidentiality and authentication services, the public key infrastructure is extensively used by the cloud servers and clients. In this work, we will discuss their potential flaws that may be inherited by the cloud environments. To facilitate a systemic approach to addressing the challenges in securing the cloud computing environments, we categorize their vulnerabilities and the threats they face. We then focus on issues in achieving data confidentiality through symmetric key cryptography. Illustrating the inefficiencies of this approach, we argue that data-centric and homomorphic encryption methodologies can provide solutions that are more suitable for cloud computing paradigms.","[Ahamed, Farhad; Shahrestani, Seyed; Ginige, Athula] Univ Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",Western Sydney University,,17368113@student.uws.edu.au; S.Shahrestani@uws.edu.au; a.ginige@uws.edu.au,"Ginige, Athula/AAV-2129-2020; Shahrestani, Seyed/L-3911-2017","Ginige, Athula/0000-0002-7445-588X; Ahamed, Farhad/0000-0002-3400-6799; Shahrestani, Seyed/0000-0002-8786-9213",,,,,58,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1467,1476,,,,,,10,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549701027,0

The first argument alleges that emissions trading is morally objectionable, because it 'commodifies' the atmosphere. The second argument involves various objections to attaching prices to units of emissions - loosely speaking, the objection is to pricing that which is priceless or should not be priced. The third argument turns on the idea that if a large cut in emissions is to be made by society overall, everyone should 'do their bit' by making a particular kind of sacrifice rather than paying others to do it instead. Some general conclusions concern the limitations of confining the analysis to idealised emissions trading, the difficulty in separating 'economistic' thinking about policy delivery from policy choice and the need to focus questions of justice on consumers rather than on producers.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Emmanuel Coll, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University of Cambridge,"Aldred, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Emmanuel Coll, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",jsa1001@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,17,20,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

GDP per worker and capital per worker in 1985 US dollars were estimated for 1820, 1850, 1880, 1913, and 1939 by using historical national accounts to back cast Penn World Table data for 1965 and 1990. Frontier and econometric production functions are used to measure neutral technical change and local technical change. The latter includes concurrent increases in capital per worker and output per worker beyond the highest values achieved. These increases were pioneered by the rich countries of the day. An increase in the capital-labor ratio was usually followed by a half century in which rich countries raised output per worker at that higher ratio. Then the rich countries moved on to a higher capital-ratio, and technical progress ceased at the lower ratio they abandoned. Most of the benefits of technical progress accrued to the rich countries that pioneered it. It is remarkable that countries in 1990 with low capital labor ratios achieved an output per worker that was no higher than countries with the same capital labor ratio in 1820. In the course of the last two hundred years, the rich countries created the production function of the world that defines the growth possibilities of poor countries today. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Its theoretical stance developed in the context of the economic crisis and political turmoil of the Weimar Republic in the late 1920s. It is premised on the strong state as the locus of liberal governance, and holds that economic freedom derives from political authority. In the context of the crisis of neoliberal political economy and austerity, and debates about the resurgence of the state vis-a-vis the economy, the article introduces the ordoliberal argument that the free economy presupposes the exercise of strong state authority, and that economic liberty is a practice of liberal governance. This practice is fundamentally one of social policy to secure the sociological and ethical preconditions of free markets. The study of ordoliberalism brings to the fore a tradition of a state-centric neoliberalism, one that says that economic freedom is ordered freedom, one that argues that the strong state is the political form of free markets, and one that conceives of competition and enterprise as a political task.","Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Bonefeld, W (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",werner.bonefeld@york.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H035974/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H035974/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,94,144,158,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This setting is called ordinal (consensus) ranking problem (OCRP). Many methods were proposed for the solution of OCRP with an important class of the so called permutation methods such as the consensus ranking model (CRM) or hybrid distance-based ideal-seeking consensus ranking model (DCM), which seek the consensus in the space of all permutations of the order n. The main limitation of these methods is that the number of permutations of order n grows as n!, making solving this problem virtually impossible for n larger than 10. The aim of the article is to propose a new technique which can reduce the number of permutations the methods' need to process, lowering their computational complexity and enabling them to deal with permutations of higher orders. The technique is based on the 'distance theorem' derived in the theoretical part of the paper. This theorem postulates the upper limit on the distance between one of the initial preferences (called median) and the consensus. In the empirical part of the paper, Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to examine the technique's behaviour, applicability and efficiency.","[Fiedor, Jan] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Dept Intelligent Syst, DITS FIT BUT, Brno 61266, Czech Republic; [Mazurek, Jiri] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm, Dept Math Methods Econ, Opava 73340, Slovakia",Brno University of Technology,"Fiedor, J (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Dept Intelligent Syst, DITS FIT BUT, Brno 61266, Czech Republic.",ifiedor@fit.vutbr.cz; mazurek@opf.slu.cz,"Mazurek, Jiri/Z-1303-2019",,Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [402090405],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),One of authors (Jifi Mazurek) was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (no. 402090405).,,13,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-779-0,,,,2012,,,,,,,160,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BEI57,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316715900028,0

Though in both cities these sites were important channels for transmitting information and organising and coordinating the campaigns, their role was clearly limited in terms of impartial, democratic discussion of the issue of common concern: the sites were rather used to build and reinforce emerging collective identities and to create consensus within the movement. In contrast to the situation in Helsinki, Vkontakte also had a central role in creating and maintaining ties between formerly isolated campaigns against building projects elsewhere in St Petersburg, thereby helping to build a 'network of grassroots resistance' in the city.","[Gladarev, Boris] Ctr Independent Social Res, St Petersburg 191040, Russia; [Lonkila, Markku] Univ Tampere, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Gladarev, B (通讯作者)，Ctr Independent Social Res, Ligovskii Prospekt 87,Off 301,POB 193, St Petersburg 191040, Russia.",gladarevb@mail.ru; markku.lonkila@helsinki.fi,"Lonkila, Markku/D-3276-2015","Lonkila, Markku/0000-0003-0312-6963",,,,,32,16,19,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,8,,,SI,,1375,1394,,10.1080/09668136.2012.712272,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,008TA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308978300003,0

Such research led to formulate a few paradoxes of rationality. These paradoxes emphasize the incompatibility between the theory and reality in decision making process. One of these paradoxes was presented in the 50th years in the previous century by French economist Maurice Allais. In this article the Allais paradox is presented.

Organizational innovation diagnosis is the first step in building a culture that supports and applies innovation as a key driver of competitive advantage. The aim of this research is to diagnose the current situation of organizational innovation in a domestic production organization from the chemical industry. The method is based on organizational innovation diagnosis model, which assumes the existence of four key factors needed for successful innovation implementation: Strategy, Process, Ideas and Climate. The model was customized for use in a specific company for the purpose of conducting structured interviews on a sample of 33 mid-level managers. The main problems of this research are to examine whether there is a difference in the prevalence of particular innovation factors within the organization and whether there is a difference in the perception of the indicated (key) factors between functional units of the organization. Qualitative data analysis showed that the factors of Ideas and Climate are more developed in the organization than the Strategy and Processes factors. The results also showed no statistically significant differences in the perception of organizational innovation factors between functional units which are directly involved and responsible for the development of new technologies, products and processes in relation to the perception of these factors in the remaining organizational units. The results of this qualitative research might be useful in focusing management efforts in overcoming the crucial organizational innovation weaknesses using the recognized organizational innovation strengths.","[Jakopec, Ana] Fac Philosophy Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Susanj, Zoran] Fac Human & Social Sci Rijeka, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of Rijeka,"Jakopec, A (通讯作者)，Fac Philosophy Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",ajakopec1@ffos.hr; zsusanj@ffri.hr,"Susanj, Zoran/S-8209-2018","Susanj, Zoran/0000-0002-2679-0261",,,,,19,0,0,1,10,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,978-953-253-106-0,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2012,,,,,,,71,78,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEX13,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318478600008,0

Determinations were done on samples from the internodes sections with the height of 30 mm and with a diameter in the range phi 4.26 - 8.91 mm. From the processing of the force-deformation curves gathered with the help of Qmat program, we collected data regarding the force and deformation in the rupture point, crushing stress applied, contact area in the rupture point. We found that the break force of miscanthus stalks was about 104 - 233N for the internodes located on the base of the stalks and about 55 - 149 N for the upper internodes of plants stalk. Corresponsive, the plants deformation up to the point of rupture was between the limits of 0.9 - 1. mm for the lower internodes of plants and between the boarders of 1.0 - 1.2 mm for the upper internodes. The elasticity module for miscanthus stalks were determined to be between 69.3 - 218.8 Mpa for the ground internodes and between 25.1 - 122.3 Mpa for the plants upper internodes. Also we determined the compression strain of all the samples and based on the strain - stress curves we calculated the elasticity module of the energetic plant Miscanthus.

This paper analyzes the cross-border trade problem through a set of models that represent different degrees of coordination both between the energy and the transmission markets and among national Transmission System Operators (TSOs). We first present a nodal price-like organization of the system, where Power Exchanges (PXs) and Transmission System Operators are integrated to operate the energy and transmission markets. This system is not implemented in Europe but its success elsewhere makes it the natural reference for the study.

We consider different degrees of coordination of the national TSOs' activities to assess the range of inefficiencies that the lack of integration can lead to.

To date, the literature on how crime influences property values has focused solely within a single metropolitan area and has been limited primarily to cross-sectional analysis. In this study we exploit the dramatic, nationwide decrease in crime that occurred in the 1990s to examine the relationship between changes in crime rates and property values. To do this, we compile information on changes in property values and crime during the 1990s in nearly 3000 urban zip codes throughout the U.S. Using a fixed-effects framework as well as an instrumental variables strategy, our analysis implies a large and statistically significant association between crime and property values. The estimated elasticities of property values with respect to crime range from -0.15 to -0.35. Furthermore, zip codes in the top decile in terms of crime reduction saw property value increases of 7-19% during the 19905. Both the empirical analysis and a graphical analysis are suggestive that decreasing crime leads to increasing property values. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These difficulties are exacerbated when, for example, for the long-term development scenarios, the design of entire sets of forecasts' trajectories is required and they have to reach numerous time horizons. Such a problem occurred during the implementation of the energy foresight for Poland, which required the construction of renewable energy production forecasts for the years 2010-2050. Possible solutions to this problem are the main aspects of this article. The paper presents methods of formal prediction models' construction in the absence of the past data. Subjective opinions of experts on the development of a projected phenomenon were used to evaluate the parameters of such models. Thus, those models are called subjective. There are considered four subjective prediction models: a development trend model, Rogers's diffusion model and Bass's diffusion model, ADBUDG model. On the basis of each of the models, as an illustration of theoretical considerations, were built predictions of energy production from renewable energy sources in Poland in the years 2010-2050. In the conclusions part, the individual models are evaluated from the standpoint of their usefulness as well as their advantages and disadvantages in building long-term forecasts of new technologies' development are discussed.","[Poradowska, Konstancja] Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",,,konstancja.poradowska@ue.wroc.pl,"Poradowska, Konstancja/P-5161-2018",,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,1202,1211,,,,,,10,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549701004,0

This phenomenon is most evident in urban transport infrastructure, where vehicles concentrations are highest. Typical examples are light-controlled intersections, which are often heavily loaded, which is reflected in the congested area in front of intersections. Solving of this problem is very difficult but very necessary, because the elimination of this undesirable phenomenon in traffic has resulted in reducing of economic losses by congestion, more efficient using of transport and last but not least improving the quality of life in the city. In the past has been shown that using linear programming methods can be designed signal plans, which can effectively control the intersections. But it was at intersections which are not congested. This paper deals the possibilities of designing of signal plans using linear programming in a situation where the intersections are congested. Congestion is reflected by the fact that is not ensured that all vehicles that came to the intersection in one cycle, it leaves during the same cycle. In the beginning of this article are described the possible ways of solving depending on the requirements of traffic flows, followed by a description of mathematical models which can solve this problem.

The Dynamic Panel System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM) was employed on an Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) to analyze the effect of gender on the economic growth, which is the best method given the short time period and large cross sectional characteristic. Control variables such as gross capital formation, export volume, population and year effects were also decoded in order to obtain a more accurate and robust result trend. The data relating to economic variables of interest was extracted from the World Development Index 2007 and the data relating to human capital was taken from the study done by Barro and Lee (2000). The indicators for human capital include number of secondary school graduates and high school graduates according to gender. Findings reveal that females with high school as their highest education level, significantly contributed towards the economic growth, contributing approximately 3.35%. However the results also point out that the male secondary school graduates contributed to the countries' development more significantly as compared to the female, whereby the formers' contribution towards the economic development is approximately 5%, ceteris paribus. These results further strengthens the ideology that human capital is indeed an important component, at different levels, and it is this vital component which drives economic growth. An adequate and efficient form of funding or investment is required in order to improve the education industry, which will consequently benefit every other industry thus strengthening the economy.","[Shalini, N.; Baharom, A.

Analysis of the income elasticities of micronutrients and their changes during food price crises can shed light on the potential effectiveness of cash transfer and nutrition supplement programs. This article examines these issues using data from two cross-sectional household surveys in Indonesia, taken before (1996) and soon after (1999) the 199798 economic crisis, which led to a sharp increase in food prices. First, using nonparametric and regression methods, the article examines how the income elasticity of calories from starchy staples as a share of total calories differs between the two survey rounds. Second, the article estimates income elasticities of important nutrients in Indonesia. The analysis finds that, although summary measures such as the income elasticity of the starchy staple ratio might not change during crises, this stability masks important differences across individual nutrients. In particular, income elasticities of some key micronutrients, such as iron, calcium, and vitamin B1, are significantly higher in a crisis year than in a normal year, yet the income elasticities of otherssuch as vitamin Cremain close to zero. These results suggest that cash transfer programs might be even more effective during crises to ensure the consumption of essential micronutrients. But to ensure that all key micronutrients are consumed, nutrition supplement programs are also likely required.","[Skoufias, Emmanuel; Zaman, Hassan] World Bank, Poverty Reduct & Equ Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Tiwari, Sailesh] World Bank, Young Profess Program, Washington, DC USA; [Tiwari, Sailesh] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; Brown University,"Skoufias, E (通讯作者)，World Bank, Poverty Reduct & Equ Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",eskoufias@worldbank.org; stiwari@worldbank.org; hzaman@worldbank.org,,,,,,,37,16,19,3,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

This essay provides a comprehensive content analysis of all governors' blogs and, subsequently, fleshes out a typology of three characteristic types. It is argued that politicians' blogs are playing a far greater role in generating legitimacy for the Russian political system than they do in democracies, because the semi-authoritarian Russian system lacks other mechanisms which generate (input) legitimacy in developed democracies, such as highly competitive elections.","[Toepfl, Florian] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Toepfl, Florian] LMU Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Munich,"Toepfl, F (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",florian@toepfl.de,"Toepfl, Florian/AAR-4184-2021","Toepfl, Florian/0000-0001-5773-779X",,,,,88,22,23,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2012,64.0,8,,,SI,,1435,1459,,10.1080/09668136.2012.712261,0.0,,,25,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,008TA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308978300006,0

The asymptotic distribution of the proposed test is derived, and the asymptotic critical values are tabulated. Simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate that for both small and moderate sample sizes found in applications, the new test can exhibit an excellent control over the empirical sizes, and most importantly, it delivers larger power gains from inclusion of correlated covariates, as compared to the counterpart without covariates. An application to real exchange rates for 18 Asian countries suggests that our proposed test is able to unveil stronger evidence in favour of mean reversion in real exchange rates than the counterpart without covariates does. Moreover, several real exchange rates are tested to display asymmetries in the adjustment process towards their equilibrium values.","Natl Chi Nan Univ, Puli, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University,"Tsong, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Puli, Taiwan.",tcc126@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

How do states choose organizations for cooperation? We develop a theory of agency choice for development projects, emphasizing the importance of domestic institutions, the scope of cooperation, and the resources of the implementing agency. If states are to cooperate with funding agencies that have abundant resources, such as the World Bank, they must accept more stringent conditions on project implementation. We argue states accept the stringent conditions that resourceful organizations demand if the public goods from project implementation are highly valuable. Empirically, this is the case for democratic states, large projects, and projects that produce national instead of global public goods. We test this theory using data on 2,882 Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects, 1991-2011. The GEF offers an ideal case because various implementing agencies are responsible for the actual projects. States implement projects in collaboration with the World Bank, which has the most expertise and resources among the GEF's implementing agencies, if their regime type is democracy, the project size is large, and the benefits are primarily national.

Retail leases with these and other common characteristics are shown to support second-best investments by landlords in their stores both inside and outside shopping centers.

Catastrophic failure would result in lengthy outage of barge traffic. The displaced volume of coal shipments from mines to power plants is estimated using Energy Information Administration survey data. The resilience of the impacted facilities, the viability of their shipping alternatives, and their ability to re-organize into new markets is assessed. Lost revenues are estimated for facilities that close due to an inability to adapt, as well as the replacement cost of towboats and barges trapped by a catastrophic and sudden failure. The aggregate costs to these facilities as a result of a year-long closure are estimated at $0.56-1.7 billion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[DiPietro, Gwen Shepherd; Matthews, H.

Since the beginning of the euro crisis, however, even the most inattentive citizen of the EU realizes that integration entails serious normative costs as well as some economic benefits. As the crisis intensifies, all proposed ad hoc solutions tend to aggravate the democratic deficit of the Union. It is not only the citizens that are being excluded from the debate about the future of the eurozone; most national governments are forced to accept solutions proposed by a few leaders representing the major stockholders of the European Central Bank. Thus, the risk of a total normative loss - a default rather than a simple deficit of democracy at the European level - is now quite concrete.","European Univ Inst, I-50012 Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Majone, G (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Via Lappeggi 26, I-50012 Florence, Italy.",giand.majone@tin.it,,,,,,,11,47,51,0,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

J,"Postigo, A",,,,"Postigo, Antonio",,,Liberalisation and Protection under Overlapping Free Trade Agreements: Dynamic Interplay between Free Trade Agreements and Investment,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; INTERESTS; IMPACT; POLICY,"Two decades into the most recent wave of regionalism many of its implications remain to be fully understood. A vast literature has explored the impacts of free trade agreements (FTAs) on investment flows, but less attention has been given to how existing patterns of investment alter FTA liberalisation. It is contended here that the dynamic interplay between overlapping FTA areas and the investment sunk in them shapes governments' and firms' positions regarding further FTA liberalisation. During trade negotiations, a country may decide to exclude a sector from FTA liberalisation to prevent (concession prevention) future FTA partners from making similar demands. Concession prevention could also occur when a foreign firm, holding a dominant market position in a host country, relinquishes liberalisation demands in an FTA between host and home countries to prevent its current position being eroded if the host country grants similar (or better) concessions to competing firms from other countries in future FTAs. Conversely, investment sunk into a country's sensitive sector in the territory of partners from previous FTAs could pre-empt (concession pre-emption) the protectionist position of that country when it subsequently negotiates FTAs with the investment-source countries. These arguments were tested in the negotiations around the liberalisation of the automotive industry that Thailand and Malaysia had with Japan in their respective bilateral FTAs. The distinct interaction between investment and the FTAs in which these countries participate resulted either in entrenchment of protectionism in the sector or its liberalisation across subsequent FTAs.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Postigo, A (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,,,,,,45,3,4,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2014,37.0,11,,,,,1612,1633,,10.1111/twec.12234,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AU3JX,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345510100007,0

However, it is an under researched area, even though in major cities, where transport networks are most congested, it forms a higher proportion of trips. The paper presents the findings of a study of changing business travel practices and policies affecting the briefcase traveller. The findings are drawn from semi-structured interviews with key actors in stakeholder and private sector organisations based predominately in London and a survey of 150 business travellers. The study was designed to understand the motivations and attitudes towards reducing business travel and the compromises that needed to be made to balance reducing carbon emissions and cost, whilst maintaining or improving productivity and meeting the requirements of the business. The main findings show the approaches and implications of these approaches to reduce carbon emissions and costs, improve productivity and the impact of ICT. The findings show the importance of external reporting through the Carbon Reduction Commitment, the Carbon Disclosure Project and corporate responsibility reports as a motivator to develop new policies. The paper goes on to outline how some factors can be both barriers and motivations for change, such as customers insisting on meeting their suppliers face-to-face, but also requiring information on carbon emissions as part of the Carbon Disclosure Project. Individuals can also be both a barrier and a motivator to change. The role of existing travel and meeting habits and the view of some that travelling is a perk linked to status symbols have proved to be a hard barriers to overcome. However, a technically literate younger generation used to communicating virtually have challenged these practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, despite their popularity, the specification and estimation of these type of models is computationally complex and it is far from being a univocally solved issue. This paper aims at contributing to this debate. In particular, we use Monte Carlo experiments to assess whether employing the standard trick of 'concentrating the sum of squares' by Leybourne et al. (Journal of Time Series Analysis, 19(1): 83-97, 1998) in the application of nonlinear least squares to smooth transition models yields estimates with desirable asymptotic properties. Our results confirm that this procedure needs to be used with caution as it may yield biased and inconsistent estimates, especially when faced with small samples.","European Univ Inst, RSCAS, Fiesole, FI, Italy",European University Institute,"Maugeri, N (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, RSCAS, Fiesole, FI, Italy.",novella.maugeri@eui.eu,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This struggle makes environmental policy integration difficult, especially in the legislative process.

The European Parliament's rapporteur is identified as central for resolving differences between the actors.

Various authors have already stated that the project of European integration requires development of a stronger sense of European identity among citizens of the European Union Member States. Using insights from social identity theory, it is demonstrated in the paper that salient social identities are being transmitted within families.

While smoothing is used for the regularization of the non-specified parts of the null hypothesis and omnibus alternatives, the resampling serves for determining the critical value. Several of the existing selection methods are discussed, implemented, and compared. This has been done for cross-sectional data along the example of additivity testing. Doubtless, all problems considered here carry over to specification testing with dependent data. Intensive simulations illustrate that this is still an open problem that easily corrupts these tests in practice. Possible ways out of the dilemma are proposed.","[Sperlich, Stefan] Univ Geneva, Dept Sci Econ, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Sperlich, Stefan] Univ Geneva, Res Ctr Stat, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",University of Geneva; University of Geneva,"Sperlich, S (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Dept Sci Econ, Bd Pont Arve 40, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",stefan.sperlich@unige.ch,,"sperlich, stefan/0000-0001-5366-2612",,,,,55,8,9,1,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Although many studies have considered vertical cooperation within a supply chain, less attention has been given to the benefits of logistics cooperation with other companies outside the same supply chain but providing similar services. For instance, empty returns can be avoided if a company can profit from cooperating with a partner to meet their complementary transport needs. In this paper we introduce a model to assess savings when planning connected deliveries. The model is solved with the GRASP metaheuristic, which is used to analyse the model's performance, as well as to assess the cost savings that can be obtained by this linking of deliveries. Extensive computational experiments confirm that benefits of this type of cooperation are marginally decreasing with the size of the partnership and that, for any number of companies, the gains to be expected increase with the percentage saving from route lengthening and decrease with the cost of linking any two deliveries.

This issue has become a matter of concern that is receiving increasing attention from politicians, scientists and researchers. Furthermore, greenhouse gases emitted as a result of production processes have a marked impact on the environment and are also the foremost culprit of global warming and climate change. This paper assesses convergence in eco-efficiency in greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. Eco-efficiency is assessed at both country and greenhouse-gas-specific levels using Data Envelopment Analysis techniques and directional distance functions, as recently proposed by Picazo-Tadeo et al. (Eur J Oper Res, 220:798-809, 2012). Convergence is then evaluated using the Phillips and Sul (Econometrica, 75:1771-1855, 2007) approach that allows testing for the existence of convergence groups. Although the results point to the existence of different convergence clubs depending on the specific pollutant considered, they signal the existence of at least four clear groups of countries. The first two groups are core European Union high-income countries (Benelux, Germany, Italy, Austria, the United Kingdom and Scandinavian countries). A third club is made up of peripheral countries (Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece) together with some Eastern countries (Latvia and Slovenia), while the remaining clubs consist of groups containing Eastern European countries.","[Camarero, Mariam] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Castillo-Gimenez, Juana; Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J.; Tamarit, Cecilio] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Valencia 46022, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; University of Valencia,"Tamarit, C (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Campus Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain.",cecilio.tamarit@uv.es,"Tamarit, Cecilio/N-2017-2019; Tamarit, Cecilio/A-8178-2010; Camarero, Mariam/A-5047-2008; Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J/C-2545-2011; Castillo-Gimenez, Juana/L-7558-2014","Tamarit, Cecilio/0000-0002-0538-9882; Tamarit, Cecilio/0000-0002-0538-9882; Camarero, Mariam/0000-0003-4525-5181; Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J/0000-0002-7129-5606; Castillo-Gimenez, Juana/0000-0002-7084-7026",,,,,46,49,50,0,37,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Two challenges remain to researchers aiming to explain these differences: on the one hand, TFP growth is hard to measure empirically; on the other hand, model uncertainty hampers consensus on its key determinants. This paper combines a non-parametric measure of TFP growth with Bayesian model averaging techniques in order to address both issues. Our empirical findings suggest that the most robust TFP growth determinants are time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity and trade openness. We also investigate the main determinants of two TFP components: efficiency change (i.e., catching up) and technological progress.","[Danquah, Michael] GIMPA, Accra, Ghana; [Moral-Benito, Enrique] Banco Espana, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Ouattara, Bazoumana] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Banco de Espana; Swansea University,"Moral-Benito, E (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Calle Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",enrique.moral@gmail.com,,,,,,,56,23,24,0,35,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

It is concluded that HCT and associated skills policy orthodoxy are problematic because supply of particular skills did not create demand from employers. Ex-AA workers faced a paradox of being highly skilled but underemployed. Some workers re-trained but there were insufficient (quality) job opportunities.

In recent years a school of thought has been consolidating that there is no automatic relationship between the two, but that certain circumstances must occur in the structural foundations of a country for such a link to be made. The investment climate plays a decisive role in the economic development of a society. The aim of this paper is to identify, through a country-level empirical analysis, which specific factors related to the investment climate promote or hinder the transformation of tourism growth into an improvement of the living conditions of the population. The end result is that, in those countries with lower levels of development, the lack of an appropriate investment climate complicates this relationship (unlike in developed countries). Thus, continuing to invest in tourism in these countries without first solving the issues affecting the investment climate will lead to a failure of such investment.","[Juan Cardenas-Garcia, Pablo; Ignacio Pulido-Fernandez, Juan] Univ Jaen, Dept Econ, Jaen 23071, Spain",Universidad de Jaen,"Pulido-Fernández, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Jaen, Dept Econ, Campus Lagunillas S-N, Jaen 23071, Spain.",pcgarcia@ujaen.es; jipulido@ujaen.es,"Cárdenas-García, Pablo Juan/GMW-9902-2022","Cárdenas-García, Pablo Juan/0000-0002-1779-392X; Pulido-Fernandez, Juan Ignacio/0000-0002-9019-726X",,,,,49,7,7,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This is a novel approach providing the first attempt in the literature to estimate demand elasticity using individual demand bid data in the Italian Power Exchange (IPEX). Econometric estimation allows us to identify robust results, showing that elasticity varies significantly with: time of the day; day of the week; season of the year; pattern of line congestion; as well as according to the level of equilibrium price. This has meaningful policy implications: fostering more competition on the supply side could yield lower equilibrium prices and proportionately much higher quantities, for a lower offer curve shifted to the right would intersect a flatter portion of the demand curve.","[Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea] Univ Perugia I, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Bollino, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia I, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",bollino@unipg.it,,"Bollino, Carlo Andrea/0000-0002-7751-7089; Bigerna, Simona/0000-0003-4880-6305",,,,,27,20,20,0,11,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2014,35.0,3,,,,,25,46,,10.5547/01956574.35.3.2,0.0,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AJ4PC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337657300002,0

The Ambivalent Behaviour of Brazil and South Africa in Regional Economic Integration,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MERCOSUR; EU; NEGOTIATIONS; HEGEMONY; STRATEGIES; AGREEMENTS; FOLLOWERS; COUNTRIES; POLICY; GOODS,"The behaviour of regional powers towards their own regions is often volatile in the developing world, which leads to unstable integration processes. This article argues that this volatility is due to limited intra-regional gains from regional integration in developing regions, which implies that the behaviour of regional powers is constrained by extra-regional economic interests. When regional integration is not in conflict with extra-regional interests, regional powers provide regional leadership. However, when extra-regional interests are in conflict with regional integration, regional powers become regional Rambos. This argument is illustrated with the two examples of Brazil's behaviour in Mercosur and South Africa's behaviour in SADC. Both regional powers provided leadership during some periods of the regional integration processes, but became Rambos when important extra-regional interests were at stake. This damaged regional integration processes in South America and Southern Africa considerably.","[Krapohl, Sebastian] Univ Bamberg, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany; [Meissner, Katharina L.] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Muntschick, Johannes] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; European University Institute; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Krapohl, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany.",sebastian.krapohl@uni-bamberg.de,"Krapohl, Sebastian/AAB-1091-2021","Meissner, Katharina L./0000-0003-3834-1778; Krapohl, Sebastian/0000-0001-7990-5416",,,,,71,32,39,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Seminal interpretations of the process of economic growth before the Industrial Revolution have pointed to the strategic importance of the rise of the Atlantic economy and the growth of cities linked to this, but have not really explained why Europeans were so efficient in organizing large international networks of shipping and trade. Most studies concerning early modem shipping have focused on changes in ship design (capital investments) in explaining long-term performance of European shipping in the pre-1800 period; in this paper we argue that this is only part of the explanation. Human capital the quality of the labour force employed on ships mattered as well. We firstly demonstrate that levels of human capital on board European ships were relatively high, and secondly that there were powerful links between the level of labour productivity in shipping and the quality of the workforce. This suggests strongly that shipping was a 'high tech' industry not only employing high quality capital goods, but also, as a complementary input, high quality labour, which was required to operate the increasingly complex ships and their equipment.

We study in a laboratory experiment how heterogeneity in returns and uncertainty about the own return affects unconditional and conditional contribution behavior in a linear public goods game. The elicitation of conditional contributions in combination with a within subject design allows us to investigate belief-independent and type-specific reactions to heterogeneity. We find that, on average, heterogeneity in returns decreases unconditional contributions but affects contributions only weakly. Uncertainty in addition to heterogeneity reduces conditional contributions slightly. Individual reactions to heterogeneity differ systematically. Selfish subjects and one third of conditional cooperators do not react to heterogeneity whereas the reactions of the remaining conditional cooperators vary. A substantial part of heterogeneity in reactions can be explained by inequity aversion with respect to different reference groups.","[Fischbacher, Urs; Schudy, Simeon] Univ Konstanz, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Fischbacher, Urs; Schudy, Simeon] Thurgau Inst Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Teyssier, Sabrina] UR1303 ALISS, INRA, F-94200 Ivry, France",University of Konstanz; INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay,"Teyssier, S (通讯作者)，UR1303 ALISS, INRA, F-94200 Ivry, France.",Urs.Fischbacher@uni-konstanz.de; Simeon.Schudy@uni-konstanz.de; Sabrina.Teyssier@ivry.inra.fr,"Etile, Fabrice/AAA-9193-2022","Etile, Fabrice/0000-0003-3388-5848; Schudy, Simeon/0000-0002-4409-0576",,,,,37,45,48,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2014,43.0,1,,,,,195,217,,10.1007/s00355-013-0763-x,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AI7RS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337094300011,0

The reduction in agency costs and improvement in information dissemination reduce the cost of funds, and investment at more competitive cost of capital enhances firm value. For REITs, because of the mandated high dividend distribution, growth depends on the availability of external capital at competitive rates, such that mitigation of agency costs is critical to sustain growth. We examine the relation between dividends and growth with a sample of U.S. equity REITs. Our data reveal a significantly positive relation between externally financed growth and dividend payments. The relation is stronger among REITs with more growth opportunities, and REITs that issue new equity and debt. We interpret this evidence as consistent with the notion that by reducing agency costs and facilitating capital raising, dividends enhance growth.","[Ghosh, Chinmoy] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Sun, Le] AllianceBernstein LP, New York, NY 10105 USA",University of Connecticut,"Sun, L (通讯作者)，AllianceBernstein LP, 1345 Ave Americas, New York, NY 10105 USA.",chinmoy.ghosh@business.uconn.edu; le.sun@alliancebernstein.com,"ghosh, chinmoy/AAE-2935-2022",,,,,,54,18,23,2,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

These regulations provide a means of stimulating the production of mixed-income housing at a minimal cost to the public sector, but have been hypothesized to slow development and put upward pressure on housing prices. The results of the theoretical models presented in this paper suggest that inclusionary housing policies need not increase housing prices in all situations. However, any observed impact on housing prices may be mitigated by density effects and stigma effects that decrease demand for market-rate units. The results additionally suggest real estate developers are likely to respond to inclusionary housing policies by strategically altering production decisions.","[Hughen, W.

Before 1999, the European Union's influence on corruption was close to zero, and between 1999 and 2004, its influence was strong and positive.

The paper reviews recent evidence from a wide range of studies, recognising that a multiplicity of approaches is needed to learn what works and what does not. The review concludes that there is some support for the emphasis on reducing trade costs through investments in hard infrastructure (like ports and roads) and soft infrastructure (like customs). But failure to implement complementary reform - especially the introduction of competition in transport services - may erode the benefits of these investments. Direct support to exporters does seem to lead to diversification across products and destinations, but it is not yet clear that these benefits are durable. In general, it is difficult to rely on cross-country studies to direct AFT. More rigorous impact evaluation is an under-utilised alternative, but situations of 'clinical interventions' in trade are rare and adverse incentives (due to agency problems) and costs (due to the small size of project) are a hurdle in implementation.","[Cadot, Olivier] Univ Lausanne, Dorigny, Switzerland; [Cadot, Olivier; de Melo, Jaime] FERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Cadot, Olivier; de Melo, Jaime] CEPR, London, England; [Fernandes, Ana; Mattoo, Aaditya] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Gourdon, Julien] CEPII, Paris, France",University of Lausanne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; The World Bank,"Cadot, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Dorigny, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,43,28,30,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2014,37.0,4,,,SI,,516,529,,10.1111/twec.12138,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AE7RT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000334197100002,0

For projects generating additional oil exports, this risk premium quantifies the cost of increased dependence on oil revenues. For projects transforming oil into products whose prices are less correlated with the Saudi economy, it quantifies the benefit from reducing the aggregate risk. The value of this risk premium depends on expectations about future consumption and oil price. By considering alternative assumptions, we show that over a one-year horizon this risk premium could range between 1.3% and 5% of the expected oil-related cash flow, with higher premia for longer planning horizons. We discuss the implications of these calculations for energy-related public projects in Saudi Arabia and, more generally, for public decision-making in resource-rich countries.","[Pierru, Axel; Matar, Walid] King Abdullah Petr Studies & Res Ctr KAPSARC, Riyadh 11672, Saudi Arabia",,"Pierru, A (通讯作者)，King Abdullah Petr Studies & Res Ctr KAPSARC, POB 88550, Riyadh 11672, Saudi Arabia.",axel.pierru@kapsarc.org; walid.matar@kapsarc.org,,"Matar, Walid/0000-0003-4459-347X",,,,,17,10,10,0,15,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2014,35.0,2,,,,,97,116,,10.5547/01956574.35.2.5,0.0,,,20,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AD8WG,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333545800005,0

Our model can identify several crucial determinants for reverse mortgage loan limits, such as initial housing price, expected housing price growth, house price volatility, mortality distribution, and interest rates. We also pay special attention to the important implication of mortgage lenders' informational advantage over reverse mortgage borrowers concerning housing market risk. In reverse mortgage markets, the elderly borrowers typically hold far less, relative to the lenders, or no information about the lenders' underlying mortgage pools. Such information asymmetry leads these two categories of market participants to generate different perspectives on the risk of the collateralized properties, which can be identified to be important in determining the maximum loan amounts of reverse mortgages. We further find that the maximum loan amount of a reverse mortgage decreases in the correlation between the returns on the pooled underlying housing properties but increases with the number of the pooled mortgages.","[Pu, Ming] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Fan, Gang-Zhi] Konkuk Univ, Dept Real Estate Studies, Seoul 143701, South Korea; [Deng, Yongheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore 119613, Singapore",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Konkuk University; National University of Singapore,"Fan, GZ (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Real Estate Studies, 120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 143701, South Korea.",puming@swufe.edu.cn; fan10@konkuk.ac.kr; ydeng@nus.edu.sg,"Deng, Yongheng/A-4272-2010","Deng, Yongheng/0000-0002-4438-5171",,,,,50,11,13,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Cost sharing should also be done in these two steps. We also use some common properties: core selection, piecewise linearity and an independence property. The solutions are differentiated by properties that apply when the cheapest edge to the source gets cheaper.

The data used comes from a stated preference survey containing travelers' airline preferences for international trips from Taiwan to Japan. Two latent dimensions comprised of service attributes that were not considered in the stated choice design are identified, namely amenities and ground service and reputation and credibility. The choice map identifies two highly competing groups based on similarities on latent attributes and shared error components. The factor-analytic generalized logit model statistically outperforms the factor-analytic multinomial logit and offers important behavioral and managerial suggestions for airlines and policy-makers.

Yet, the form that this environmentalism takes is often overlooked. This is especially the case with international trade unions. Based on an empirical study of international trade unions' engagement with the climate change issue, this article argues that international trade unions follow three different (and partially conflicting) strategies. I label these strategies as 'deliberative', 'collaborative growth' and 'socialist', and I examine each in turn. I argue that such analysis is important if we want to identify the potential for transforming the social relations of production that are at the root of the current climate crisis, and for identifying an alternative socio-ecological strategy.","Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Felli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,67,53,53,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Temporary migrants from eastern Europe are less well educated than non-migrants. While the least educated migrants head for Russia, the higher educated move to the EU and the best educated to overseas destinations. According to unique information on pre-migration training courses, a non-negligible fraction of eastern European migrants to the EU is well-equipped with language skills and qualifications.

Second, we generalize both digraph games as well as games with a permission structure into a model called games with a local permission structure, where every player needs permission from its predecessors only to generate worth, but does not need its predecessors to give permission to its own successors. We introduce and axiomatize a Shapley value-type solution for these games, generalizing the conjunctive permission value for games with a permission structure and the -measure for weighted digraphs.","[van den Brink, Rene; Dietz, Chris] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van den Brink, Rene; Dietz, Chris] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"van den Brink, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jrbrink@feweb.vu.nl; cdietz@feweb.vu.nl,,"van den Brink, Rene/0000-0001-8570-3706",,,,,34,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2014,76.0,3,,,,,343,361,,10.1007/s11238-013-9372-5,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AC4US,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332517200004,0

There is a direct relationship postulated between lustration, transitional justice, and social trust building. This paper tests this assumption by examining the impact of both targeted lustration and broader transitional justice programmes on social trust. The study finds there is a divergent impact of lustration on trust, both building particularised trust in social institutions and undermining generalised interpersonal trust.","Western Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA",Western Washington University,"Horne, CM (通讯作者)，Western Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 516 High St, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",Cynthia.Horne@wwu.edu,,,,,,,87,14,15,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,FEB 7,2014,66.0,2,,,,,225,254,,10.1080/09668136.2014.882620,0.0,,,30,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AB7TW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000331994600003,0

Theoretical and experimental research has tested the influence of a reserve price in an independent private values auction, but little focus has been given to the influence of a reserve price in a first-price common-value auction. We establish an agent-based first-price common-value auction to determine the impact of the reserve price with two buyers and with three buyers. An agent-based approach to this problem is both a unique contribution to the literature and appropriate since finding analytical solutions with common-value auctions is difficult. The agent-based model approach also allows us to consider buyers that have non-symmetric bid functions. Furthermore, we introduce a combination of numerical integration techniques with a new particle swarm learning algorithm. The buyers in the model choose their expected-net-revenue-maximizing bid price, and sellers choose their expected-revenue-maximizing reserve price. In the two-buyer and three-buyer auction, a reserve price increases the equilibrium winning bid price, decreases the probability that the item is sold, and increases the seller's expected revenue. A reserve price in a two-buyer auction increases the winning bid price more than including an additional buyer in the auction with no reserve price. However, due to only receiving a salvage value when the item does not sell in the auction, the seller's expected revenue is higher in the three-buyer first-price common-value auction without a reserve price than in the two-buyer auction with a reserve price.","[Boyer, Christopher N.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Brorsen, B.

We use alternative treatment-comparison pairs; in addition to BRAC''s own classification, we exploit type 1 errors in assignment in BRAC''s selection process to create a second treatment-comparison pair. This allows us to estimate the program effects on the target group, not contaminated by mistargeting. To address selection on unobservables, we implement heteroskedasticity-based identification and two recent estimators based on matching and propensity score reweighting. The results show that participation had significant positive effects on food security, clothing, shoes, livestock, and cash savings, but there is weak or no evidence of an impact on the number of household durables and assets and indicators of health and women''s empowerment. The effects on the poorest of the poor ((the target group)) may be different from the effects on an average participant in the TUP program. When one takes into account the differences in initial conditions, the effects of the TUP program on the poorest of the poor are much larger ((as measured by the program effect normalized by the initial mean value of an outcome)), which suggests that the TUP program would have had a larger impact with better targeting.","[Emran, M.

The security department is responsible for the fabrication, installation and management of all kinds of underground safety signs. The safety signs management is standardized, including the management agencies and the management objectives etc. In view of the standardization management of safety signs, the methods to appraise it are designed, namely the coal mines decompose safety sign management step by step and carry out inspection from the top to the bottom, forming the vertical management chain that the higher authorities are responsible for the subordinate ones.

The value of index is determined by: potential and operating results, accumulated goodwill of four previous periods as well as economic disturbances (shocks) of three previous periods.

In the Republic of Croatia tourism is one of the most important economic activities. Tourism is an extremely labor intensive and dynamic activity, which means that tourism services are based on the quality of human resources. In each knowledge-based economy, the knowledge and the human resources are becoming the key factors of development. Namely, the ability of economy depends on human resources and their permanent development to keep the level of success and to advance further. The development is based on the principle of sustainability, which provides development based on protection of existing resources. Achieving sustainable development in tourism strongly depends on the acceptance of global tourism trends and the creation of knowledge. In order better quality to respond the increasingly complex and diverse demands of competition in the European tourism market, in front of Croatia is set a need of creating more innovative tourism products to attract the potential foreign tourists. However, in front of tourism activities of Republic of Croatia, there are numerous and complex development problems that must be tackled faster in order to achieve a satisfactory level of competitiveness in the European Union market. Croatia needs to keep up with upcoming trends in order to survive in the market by constantly increasing its competitiveness. Touristic significance of eastern Croatia is an extremely large because of its geographical and ecological factors. It also has a great potential for tourism development that could significantly contribute to the economic development of the country and improve the image of the Republic of Croatia in the European Union. The subject of this research is aimed at two major areas: human resources management as a decisive factor of tourism development success, and the institutional support of the European Union, with special emphasis on the counties of eastern Croatia.

A potential solution for food-deficit countries is to hold strategic reserves that can be called on when international prices spike. But how large should strategic stockpiles be, and what rules should govern their release? In this paper, we develop a dynamic competitive storage model for wheat in the Middle East and North Africa region, where imported wheat is the most significant component of the average diet. We analyze a strategy that sets aside wheat stockpiles, which can be used to keep domestic prices below a targeted price. Our analysis shows that if the target price is set high and reserves are adequate, the strategy can be effective and robust. Contrary to most interventions, strategic storage policies are counter-cyclical, and when the importing region is sufficiently large, a regional policy can smooth global prices. Simulations indicate that this is the case for the Middle East and North Africa region. Nevertheless, the policy is more costly than a procyclical policy similar to food stamps that uses targeted transfers to directly offset high prices with a subsidy.","[Larson, Donald F.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Lampietti, Julian] World Bank, Sustainable Dev Dept Latin Amer, Washington, DC USA; [Gouel, Christophe] INRA, Econ Publ, Paris, France; [Roberts, John] Univ Maryland, Agr & Resource Econ Dept, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Larson, DF (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dlarson@worldbank.org; jlampietti@worldbank.org; cgouel@grignon.inra.fr; carlo.cafiero@fao.org; jroberts@arec.umd.edu,"Gouel, Christophe/G-9859-2011; Larson, Donald/L-3918-2016","Gouel, Christophe/0000-0002-3946-5222; Larson, Donald/0000-0002-1318-3243; Cafiero, Carlo/0000-0003-3652-9910",,,,,59,24,25,1,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Then this paper comes up with that Chinese commercial banks can also provide project financing, lease financing, investment, financial management, financial advisory and carbon trading account management for fund, fund custody and trading consulting business to the enterprise, and puts forward related suggestions on the construction of commercial bank's carbon finance business support system. Carbon finance refers to the financial activities which is service to limit greenhouse gas emissions and technology projects, such as direct investment and financing, carbon trading and financial activities, bank loans. Financial support can promote the formation of a carbon trading market. The World Bank's carbon finance activities promote the development of the international carbon trading market based on project and the formation of EU emissions trading system. At present, China has set up three exchanges in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, which are related to carbon emissions. Chinese commercial banks have also started to participate in carbon finance business. Promoting the innovation of Chinese commercial banks on carbon finance business model, can not only support the implementation of the energy saving and emission reduction project, but also put a significant guarantee to the development of the carbon trading market in China. Given the condition that carbon trading market in China is still in its early growth, and the market liquidity is lower, and different market segmentation also occurs in the difficult market, commercial banks should enter into the market, and gradually become the important participants.","Baoshang Bank Co Ltd, Baotou 014030, Peoples R China",,"Li, PF (通讯作者)，Baoshang Bank Co Ltd, Baotou 014030, Peoples R China.",l_pf@163.com,"Li, Pengfei/HLG-4495-2023",,,,,,5,1,1,2,12,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-200-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,6,11,,,,,,6,Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BC2LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351060400002,0

By means of a content analysis of 106 scientific papers, this paper aims to identify and compare the detailed set of implementation factors for the four implemented road pricing cases of Singapore, London, Stockholm and the Norwegian cities, and the two not implemented cases of Hong Kong and Edinburgh. Policy implementation lessons are formulated to aid local and national authorities considering the implementation of road pricing. In contrast to other studies, this paper identifies a broad set of implementation factors for each empirical case (an average of 36). The cases have six generic implementation factors in common, the most prominent being political and public support. However, the generic factors only account for on average 27% of all the implementation factors listed. Consequently, authorities aiming to implement road pricing also need to take many case specific factors into account in the implementation process. Furthermore, the six cases show that policy implementation will only be successful when many factors positively contribute to the process which explains why it is such a precarious endeavour.

While industrialization of the cities is still low, tertiarization of the economy has gradually replaced the traditional major occupation of farming. However, since the end of the 1990s a new trend has emerged in which urban residents seek complementary employment in relatively small agricultural activities within and around the urban centres. Economic necessity, scarce urban land resources and the large urban market associated with increasing urbanization have, among other factors, encouraged investment in horticulture. Horticulture is being practiced on residential plots, within neighborhoods and on the flood plains, but the attention of this study has focused on the flood plains at the peripheral areas of Minna, the capital of Niger State. These plains are found everywhere around the city and make both dry season and rainy season horticultural activities possible. The objectives of the study were to examine the flood plains as a resource for urban farming, to assess the livelihood activities associated with urban horticultural practices, to explore how the Niger State agricultural policy affects urban agriculture, to evaluate threats to urban agriculture as well as adaptation to these threats, and to make recommendations for sustainable urban horticulture practice in Nigeria.","Fed Univ Technol, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Minna, Nigeria",,"Sanusi, YA (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Technol, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Minna, Nigeria.",grandspace@yahoo.com,"Sanusi, Yekeen/AHE-1489-2022",,,,,,35,1,1,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-08-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2014,1021.0,,,,,,77,90,,,,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB5GQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343861400007,0

This article intends to interpret both discourses in a unified way from the viewpoint of romanticism. While his economic theory is famously summarized in a thesis No Wealth but Life, the art theory he worked on can be formalized as a thesis `No Beauty but Life'. Thus we have a unified thesis 'Neither Wealth nor Beauty but Life', which may be called 'Ruskin's triangle'. I argue that the concept of Life is vital for Ruskin's unified knowledge; it is identified with its three aspects (Capability Composition, and Labour) and linked with its six symbolic determinants (Admiration, Hope and Love; Air, Water and Earth).","Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Shionoya, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",y.shionoya@blue.ocn.ne.jp,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Therefore, the objective of this paper is to analyse the main differences in the level of environmental responsibility of Slovak and Czech award-winning green companies, and to compare the nature of their environmental commitment.

An acceleration in the expansion of savannah grasslands in Africa from 1.6 Ma to 1.2 Ma witnessed concomitant increases in physical stature (150-170 cm), weight (50-70 kg), and brain size (750-900 cm(3)). With the onset of 100,000 year Middle Pleistocene glacial cycles (ice ages) some 780,000 years ago, large-bodied Homo groups had reached modern size and had successfully dispersed from equatorial Africa, Central, and Southeast Asia to high-latitude localities in Atlantic Europe and North East Asia. While there is support for incursions of multiple Homo lineages to West Asia and Continental Europe at this time, data does not favour a persistence of Homo erectus beyond 400,000 years ago in Africa, west and Central Asia, and Europe. Novel Middle Pleistocene Homo forms (780,000-400,000 years) may not have been substantially taller (150170 cm) than earlier Homo (1.6 Ma-800,000 years), yet brain size exceeded 1000 cm3 and body mass approached 80 kg in some males. Later Pleistocene Homo (400,000138,000 years) were 'massive' in their height (160-190 cm) and mass (70-90 kg) and consistently exceed recent humans. Relative brain size exceeds earlier Homo, yet is substantially lower than in final glacial H. sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis. A final leap in absolute and relative brain size in Homo (300,000-138,000 years) occurred independent of any observed increase in body mass and implies a different selective mediator to that operating on brain size increases observed in earlier Homo.

We analyze the phenomenon of dual burden households in Indonesia, using 15-year panel data. Currently, 16 percent of Indonesian households are classified as dual burden. In these households, children are often underweight, whereas adults are overweight. The nutrition transition seems to have differential impacts on the body mass index of different age cohorts. Dual burden households are a transitory phenomenon. This phenomenon started in the richer segments, but now the prevalence of dual burden households is highest in the poorest population groups. Most households that move out of the dual burden category end up as overweight. We also develop a continuous Theil index of intra-household nutritional inequality. While the overall prevalence of dual burden households has hardly changed over the last 10 years, the Theil index increased steadily. This underlines that the dual burden classification has limitations in terms of capturing nutritional dynamics. Socioeconomic determinants of dual burden and nutritional inequality are analyzed with regression models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using premerger data, we estimate several demand systems and use a static Bertrand model to simulate the price effects of two mergers. Using pre- and postmerger data, we directly estimate the price effects. The direct estimates imply that one merger resulted in moderate price increases, while the second left prices essentially unchanged. While some simulations are similar to the directly estimated price effects, overall simulations overstate the price effects in one case and understate them in the other.

Labour productivity growth has been mostly driven by capital accumulation. New Member States have significantly reduced their inefficiency and their technology gap. Disparities in the levels of labour productivity are still substantial and, to a considerable extent, they can be attributed to technology gap differences.

We compare estimates of this model to a model using more aggregated measures of wages and locations from CPS.

Three main reasons are identified for the hesitancy to use email as a source of data. Firstly, the confused role of email as formal and informal archival data as well as concerns regarding the immediate often non-deliberated exchanges; secondly, issues with access to and confidentiality of email data; finally, the challenges of triangulation of a data set which includes email data. The analysis of emails between virtual team members, alongside observational and interview methods, demonstrates how interactions between colleagues via email are subtly different to the way in which organizational members describe relationships in an interview situation and reveals how access to email data provides an additional resource in understanding behaviours within the workplace.","[Au, Yee Wei (Carol); Marks, Abigail] Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Marks, A (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, Ctr Res Work & Wellbeing, Dept Business Management, Sch Management & Languages, Mary Burton Bldg, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",a.marks@hw.ac.uk,,"Marks, Abigail/0000-0002-5307-8923",,,,,26,0,1,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The degree of pass-through for goods imported from EEs is also significantly lower than for those from DEs.

The theory generates observable hypotheses regarding the reasons for and the patterns of support and opposition to multilateralism. To focus our study, we analyze support for bilateral and multilateral foreign aid giving in the US. Using new survey data, we provide evidence about the correlates of public and elite support for multilateral engagement. We find weak support for multilateralism and deep partisan divisions. Reflecting elite discourse, public opinion divides over two competing rationales-burden sharing and control-when faced with the choice between multilateral and bilateral aid channels. As domestic groups' preferences over aid policy diverge from those of the multilateral institution, maintaining control over aid policy becomes more salient and support for multilateralism falls.","[Milner, Helen V.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Tingley, Dustin] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Princeton University; Harvard University,"Milner, HV (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",hmilner@princeton.edu; dtingley@gov.harvard.edu,"Tingley, Dustin/C-8495-2011",,,,,,80,90,104,2,55,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The vast majority of these studies analyse countries in which tourism is one of the most important sectors of the national economy and, in most cases, the TLGH is validated.

Five different explanations of a bank liquidity crisis have been provided by different authors, since John Law and up to Walter Bagehot. First, according to Law (1703) and Steuart ([1767] [1998]), the distinction between money of account (the pound sterling) and money of payment (the guinea) may induce a bank run. Second, according to Cantillon (1730), Hume ([1752] 1972), Ricardo (1810-1823) and the Currency School (1837-1858), the bank reserve becomes insufficient as a consequence of a diminishing value of money allied with over issues. Third, according to Thornton ([1802] 1939, 1991) and the Banking School (1840-1857), it can occur as a consequence of a falling exchange rate that is not linked with over issues. Fourth, according to Smith (1776) and the Banking School, discounting of fictitious bills, by decreasing the shareholders' funds, leads to bank illiquidity. Lastly, according to Thornton ([1802] 1939, 1991) and Bagehot (1873), the liquidity crisis is a consequence of bank panics: a flight to money for Thornton, a flight to credit for Bagehot. The analysis of these five different explanations sheds new light on classical monetary controversies.","Univ Paris Dauphine LEDa, F-75015 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"des Roches, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Dauphine LEDa, 7 Ter,Rue Gen Larminat, F-75015 Paris, France.",jdbdr@free.fr,,,,,,,84,2,4,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

In this paper, we analyze the productivity of public and private capital in Russia with parametric and non-parametric regression methods utilizing a unique regional level panel data from 2003 to 2007. More specifically, we assess public capital's spillover effects, i.e., the productivity of public capital on private output, as well as the productivity of different capital ownership types on total output. We find that public capital has a clear positive effect on private output. However, our estimates and test statistics show that parametric methods are not able to grasp vast non-linearities and heterogeneity present among Russian regions, while the non-parametric approach can capture these important features of the data better. Furthermore, we find that multicollinearity is an important methodological problem which should be accounted for in analysis concerning capital data. Our results also suggest that the impact of public capital in Russia is heterogeneous in the sense that for some regions its contribution to private output is insignificant or even negative while it has a considerable positive role for most regions. Concerning the capital elasticities of total output, we find that public capital is less productive than private capital and roughly as productive as joint private-public capital.","[Kortelainen, Mika] Govt Inst Econ Res, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Kortelainen, Mika] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Leppanen, Simo] Aalto Univ Sch Econ, Ctr Markets Transit CEMAT, Aalto 00076, Finland",University of Manchester; Aalto University,"Kortelainen, M (通讯作者)，Govt Inst Econ Res, POB 1279, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",mika.kortelainen@vatt.fi; simo.leppanen@aalto.fi,,,,,,,62,0,1,0,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The important progressive' features of manufacturing that can be found in Marx's writings and which are discussed here include: division of labour; socialisation of labour; mechanisation; increasing returns to scale; learning-by-doing; technological advancement; and overall, superior potential for cumulative productivity increases. These insights anticipate some of the thinking around the specificity of manufacturing found in twentieth-century structuralist development economics and some heterodox schools of thought such as Kaldorian approaches. This article suggests an interpretation of Marx as having a two-dimensional conceptualisation of activity specificity, with not only sectoral but also technological-organisational' dimensions, where these two dimensions are not fully independent of each other.","Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Tregenna, F (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa.",ftregenna@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,9,10,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

We hand-collect from archival sources transaction prices and other house attribute information from the 498 surviving house sale contracts for Beijing during the first two centuries of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1840), a long period without major wars, political turmoil, or significant institutional change in the Chinese capital. We use hedonic methods to construct a real estate price index for Beijing for the period. The regression analysis explains a major proportion of the variance of housing prices. We find that house prices grew steadily for the first half-century of the Qing Dynasty and declined afterwards in both nominal and real terms through the late eighteenth century. Nominal prices grew starting in the late eighteenth century and declined from the early nineteenth century through 1840. But these price changes occurred with contemporaneous price changes in basic measures of the cost of living: there was little change in real terms to the end of our period. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Many empirical studies attempt estimation by assuming the data correspond to the interval midpoints and then use OLS or maximum likelihood assuming normality. Stata performs maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) under the assumption of normality, allowing for intra-group variation. In the presence of heteroskedasticity or distributional misspecification, these estimates are inconsistent. In this paper we focus on an estimation procedure that helps prevent distributional misspecification for interval censored data. We explore the application of partially adaptive estimation, which builds on the MLE framework with families of flexible parametric probability density functions which include the normal as a limiting case. These methods are used to estimate determinants associated with household expenditures based on US Census data. Monte Carlo Simulations are performed to compare the relative efficiency of the different methods of estimation. We find that the flexible nature of our proposed partially adaptive estimation technique significantly reduces estimator bias and improves efficiency in the presence of distributional misspecification.","[Cook, Jason] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [McDonald, James] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Cornell University; Brigham Young University,"McDonald, J (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",james_mcdonald@byu.edu,,"Cook, Jason/0000-0002-3807-9688",,,,,35,13,13,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In this research, the direct and indirect effects of transportation infrastructure and policies on house prices and rents are studied. Since real estate transaction data are not available, a web-scraping tool was developed to parse house prices and attributes from publicly available resources. Econometric models of two categories were then estimated: (1) hedonic price models, based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and (2) spatial econometric models, such as the spatial regression model (SAR), spatial error (SEM), Durbin (SDM) and autocorrelation (SAC) model and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), which are increasingly used by econometricians in order to capture the effect of the - usually unobserved - spatial factors on house valuation. The results of this research indicate that proximity to transportation infrastructure has a direct impact on house and apartment purchase prices and rents, which is either positive or negative depending on the type of the transportation system. Metro, tram, suburban railway and bus stations affect the prices positively, while ISAP (the old urban railway of Attica) and national rail stations, airports and ports, have a negative effect, due to a number of externalities associated with them, such as noise. The obtained results are consistent with expectations and the literature. While these results cannot be assumed directly transferable to other locations and areas, they could be cautiously used as indications for planning applications (where dedicated models have not been developed).

These results suggest that, on average, foreclosure does not impose an economic burden large enough to severely reduce housing consumption.","[Molloy, Raven] Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Shan, Hui] Goldman Sachs, New York, NY 10282 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Molloy, R (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",raven.s.molloy@frb.gov; huishan79@gmail.com,,"Molloy, Raven/0000-0002-5041-803X",,,,,32,26,31,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2013,41.0,2,,,,,225,254,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2012.00344.x,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,165HD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320473300001,0

This study seeks to find an economic explanation for spatially correlated real estate prices. We posit spatial dependence as a process to discover price information from neighboring property transactions. Weaker spatial dependence is expected when price information in the immediate vicinity of a subject property is abundant. In the context of apartment buildings, in addition to the more commonly known horizontal dependence, there is also spatial dependence in the vertical dimension within the same building. Based on more than 18,000 transactions of highly homogeneous apartment units in Hong Kong, we found that the trading volume of a building depresses horizontal spatial dependence, but raises vertical spatial dependence. This not only confirmed the role of trading volume in the real estate price discovery process, but also questioned the validity of constant spatial autocorrelation assumption adopted in many studies.","[Wong, S.

The empirical test results show that both demand and supply shocks do affect US hospitality index returns and that the significant effects of both shocks vary across sectors. This paper identifies the critical role of changes in the corporate tax rate (demand shock and fiscal policy variable), the oil price growth rate (supply shock) and the labour wage growth rate (supply shock) in affecting hospitality index returns. Consistent with previous studies, the author finds that monetary policy (demand shock) still has a strong influence on hospitality index returns. However, hospitality index returns are not significantly related to the fiscal policy variable of changes in budget deficits. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results and their managerial implications for the guidance of hospitality business managers and investors interested in hospitality sectors.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, MH (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan.",finmhc@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,35,5,6,0,15,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The model incorporates both exhibitor-visitor interactions and the multi-level functions of trade fairs and has attracted considerable scholarly attention. It is based on the case of Western market-oriented trade fairs in which material objects are displayed. However, the model is unable to explain certain aspects of China's travel marts, which are strongly controlled by the government and where the only exhibits are intangible services. Another of the model's shortcomings is that it is limited to two-dimensional exhibitor-visitor interactions. This study tests, complements and amends the Rosson Seringhaus network model for the special case of China. The authors investigate the differences between travel marts and traditional trade fairs, and amend several parts of the model, taking the China International Travel Mart (CITM) and China National Travel Mart (CNTM) as case studies. In light of their analysis, they propose an important amendment to the Rosson Seringhaus model, revising the relationship network, the network boundaries and the multiple participant identities. In addition, they find that the relationship network in a travel mart is much wider and more complex than that in a traditional trade fair, leading to greater complexity and diversification in the functions of a travel mart. Finally, they find that, in a three-dimensional exhibitor visitor organizer network, the overlap between identities and network expansion results in a highly complex interaction among stakeholders. Consequently, it is difficult for organizers and exhibitors to handle a travel mart successfully and improve the effectiveness of their trade fair participation.","[Luo, Qiu-Ju] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Tourism Planning & Res, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Luo, QJ (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Tourism Management, 135 Xingang West Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",bettyluoqiuju@126.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,2,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

To explore data on twins and decompose the variation is a classical method to determine whether variation in outcomes, e.g. IQ or schooling, originate from genetic endowments or environmental factors. Despite some criticism, the model is still widely used. The critique is generally related to how estimates of heritability may encompass environmental mediation. This aspect is sometimes left implicit by authors even though its relevance for the interpretation is potentially profound. This short note is an appeal for clarity from authors when interpreting the magnitude of heritability estimates. It is demonstrated how disregarding existing theoretical contributions can easily lead to unnecessary misinterpretations and/or controversies. The key arguments are relevant also for estimates based on data of adopted children or from modern molecular genetics research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is based on a stylised multiregion, multisector CGE model that includes the four modes of international transport (air, water, road and rail) and where choices regarding the energy mix and transport modes have been endogeneised. A separate decomposition of emission changes into the well-known scale, composition and technique effects is provided. Scale effects turn out to be roughly double in international transport than in exports, while technique effects are weaker due to less substitutability between energy inputs. As a result, international transport represents half of the world increase in global emissions when trade liberalisation is considered in isolation. When trade liberalisation is coupled with a carbon tax limited to rich countries, the change in international transport emissions represents roughly one-eighth of the carbon leakage effect.","[Voehringer, Frank] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Bern, Switzerland; [Grether, Jean-Marie; Mathys, Nicole A.] Univ Neuchatel, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Mathys, Nicole A.] Swiss Fed Off Energy, Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Neuchatel,"Vöhringer, F (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Bern, Switzerland.",,,"Mathys, Nicole/0000-0002-4981-0333; Grether, Jean-Marie/0000-0002-2601-3585",,,,,40,7,7,3,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2013,36.0,3,,,SI,,280,302,,10.1111/twec.12052,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,107OY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316229000003,0

We collected annual data from 350 non-pregnant women and 385 men >= 20 years of age from all 311 households in 13 villages during five consecutive years (2002-2006). We used three indicators to measure obesity: body-mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and body fat using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BF-BIA). We ran separate individual random-effect panel multiple regressions for women and men with wealth, acculturation, health, and household food availability as key covariates, and controlled for village and year fixed effects and village x year interaction effects. Although BMI increases by a statistically significant annual growth rate of 0.64% among women and 0.37% among men over the five years, the increase does not yield significant biological meanings. Neither do we find consistent and biologically meaningful covariates associated with adult obesity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Because storage implies a nonnegativity constraint on stocks, the solution methods must be considered carefully. The model is solved using value function iteration and several projection approaches, including parameterised expectations and decision rules approximation. In considering a storage model with convenience yield, in which the inequality constraint is smoothed, perturbation methods are also applied. Parameterised expectations approximation proves to be the most accurate method, whereas perturbation techniques are shown inadequate for solving this highly nonlinear model. The endogenous grid method allows rapid solution if supply is assumed to be inelastic.","[Gouel, Christophe] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Agr & Rural Dev, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Gouel, Christophe] CEPII, Paris, France",The World Bank,"Gouel, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Agr & Rural Dev, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cgouel@worldbank.org,"Gouel, Christophe/G-9859-2011","Gouel, Christophe/0000-0002-3946-5222",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The author is grateful to Jean-Marc Bourgeon, Benjamin Carton, Sebastien Jean, Michel Juillard, and an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments and suggestions.

Using logit regression, this article makes a scholarly contribution by testing the relationship between spin-off success-defined here as technology commercialization-and multiple factors derived from the extant literature. Several significant variables are found to enable commercialization success within the sample, including venture capital, multiple and external licenses, outside management, joint ventures with other companies, previous faculty consulting experience, and-surprisingly-a negative relationship to post-spin-off services provided by universities. The results have important implications for public policy and management, supporting an overall open innovation approach to spin-off success.","[Hayter, Christopher S.] New York Acad Sci, Policy Evaluat & Transformat Grp, New York, NY 10007 USA",,"Hayter, CS (通讯作者)，New York Acad Sci, World Trade Ctr 7, 250 Greenwich St,40th Floor, New York, NY 10007 USA.",chayter@nyas.org,,,,,,,83,64,69,4,174,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This paper investigates the empirical robustness of this claim. I use out-of-sample methods to test whether the HDPO model is capable of estimating ultimately recoverable reserves. HDPO model estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves, based on data available 30 years or more in the past, are found to be less than current observed cumulative production and discoveries. This result is robust to different specifications of the HDPO model, to applications to production and discoveries data, and to various levels of geographical aggregation. These problems stem from an attempt by the HDPO model to force a linear relationship onto data which are inherently non-linear This characteristic of the data is present in a wide variety of natural resources. I also show that the HDPO model is incapable of distinguishing between processes for which cumulative production is truly finite and processes for which cumulative production is unbounded. These findings undermine claims that the HDPO model is capable of yielding meaningful measures of ultimately recoverable reserves or of predicting when world oil production might peak.","Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Boyce, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",boyce@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,58,1,1,0,31,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2013,34.0,2,,,,,91,144,,10.5547/01956574.34.2.4,0.0,,,54,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,109KV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316368300004,0

Other requirements like those arising from legislation, requirements of local communities and environment also require organizations to adapt. To help organizations meet all these requirements they can use existing tools such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 27001 and other standards. By integrating multiple ISO standards into one integrated system it's possible to meet a wider range of requirements. The paper analyzes the possibility to integrate the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system with ISO 27001:2010 Information Security Management System and application possibilities of the integrated system in practice. Organization with implemented quality management system proves that its quality management system complies with the requirements of ISO 9001:2008. Thus the risk of uncertainty in customers towards the quality of products or services is reduced, so organizations are increasingly seeking to obtain this certification. As some organizations require not only the quality of products and services, but also the safety of these, ISO 9001:2008 is a great start for organizations towards implementation of other ISO standards, in this case the ISO 27001:2010. The purpose of ISO 27001:2010 is to show customers that information security in the organization is carried out in the best possible way and to gain their trust. Therefore we can say that the ISO 27001:2010 means for information security the same thing as ISO 9001:2008 means for quality management system. In this paper will be shown how to implement the standards individually and whether there is the possibility of integrating these standards.","[Britvic, Josip; Kovacevic, Anita Prelas; Cingel, Monika] Virovitica Coll, Virovitica 33000, Croatia",,,josip.britvic@vsmti.hr; anita.prelas.kovacevic@vsmti.hr; monikacingel@gmail.com,"Britvic, Josip/AGO-2173-2022; Britvic, Josip JB/E-4111-2018; Prelas Kovačević, Anita/GQY-6646-2022",,,,,,7,1,1,0,8,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,368,373,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400042,0

The aim of the paper is to illustrate the influence of subsidies from public financial sources on economic efficiency of investment and development projects. The behaviour of the model is demonstrated by the investment curve which is a summarizing expression of functional dependency of net present value of the project's cash-flows on the project's discount rate, represented by a polynomial function. The degree of the polynomial corresponds to the usual six year period of investment project implementation, the constant term of the polynomial will reflect the share of the subsidy of investment costs from the European funds in the project budget and the coefficients of the polynomial will correspond to the polarity and amount of cash-flows issuing from the project implementation. The model should solve the amount of subsidy from the European funds on the internal return rate of the project, represented in the model by a non-negative root of the polynomial. The sensitivity analysis of the drawn up model will examine the stability of the optimal solution of return on investment in relation to the changes of the anticipated amount of projected cash-flows. The outputs of the model programmed in MAPLE software will be analysed by graphs and complemented with explanatory economic commentary.","[Dvorakova, Stanislava] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Math, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava,,stanislava.dvorakova@vspj.cz; jiricek@vspj.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87035-76-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,147,152,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BA4FE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335578000026,0

These changes can include structural breaks as well as price, output or real exchange shocks. We use robust control to denote the degree of uncertainty aversion of the policy maker and a Markov chain to capture the time-varying nature of the uncertainty aversion. We find that in general a more aggressive interest rate policy is the optimal response to: (i) more uncertainty aversion and (ii) higher likelihood that the uncertainty aversion may appear in the future. Moreover, we find that the policy maker's welfare decreases when there is an increase in uncertainty aversion. However, the transition probabilities in the Markov-chain have ambiguous effects on the policy maker expected losses.","[Gonzalez, Fidel] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Huntsville, TX 77382 USA; [Rodriguez, Arnulfo] Banamex, Dept Econ Res, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico",Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University,"Gonzalez, F (通讯作者)，Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, 232 Smith Hutson Bldg,1821 Ave 1, Huntsville, TX 77382 USA.",fxg001@shsu.edu,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

First of all, the reform which started led to significant changes in the basic outline of the vocational education. Traditional educational profiles are being cancelled, and new, so called experimental educational profiles, are being introduced, primarily being aimed at training students for the labour market, or for performing specific tasks that are being placed before them in business practice. The main purpose of the reform is adapting the education system to the labour market demands, i.e. making the education system support the economy. Successful implementation and completion of this reform is conditioned by the amount of funds directed toward this purpose. This paper will consider the financial aspects of the vocational education reform, a comparative analysis of the funds spent and the effects of the vocational education reform will be carried out. We will give a detailed analysis of the major financial problems encountered in the vocational education reform, the ways of solving them and the possibility of providing additional funding.

In the discussion section of the paper, the field research investigates students. learning through experience in communities of practice at the Department of Economics in Osijek. Purpose of the field research is to explore the impact of communities of practice on students learning in order to understand the extent to which such activities stimulate entrepreneurial learning. This initial study is qualitative in nature and involves semi-structured interviews with students and student feedback by e-mail as forms of data collection. The collected data is coded by using character counts. In the second phase of coding, the responses areexplored in more detail. The paper concludes that social learning is important, and that community of practice approach ( COPA) provides enhanced opportunities for learning through action and experience. Engagement in some form of communities of practice improves student confidence. Additionally, it contributes effectively to students. professional development outside of the formal classroom setting. Despite the limitations, communities of practice provide a valuable and useful alternative to more traditional teaching methods which tend to focus on transfer of explicit and codified knowledge and place less emphasis on tacit knowledge which is less teachable and transferrable between teachers and students. Therefore, community of practice approach presentsan excellent value to the modern HEI.","[Konig, Ljerka Sedlan] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Croatia Dept Econ, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,,sedlan@efos.hr,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2013,,,,,,,346,356,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BA3ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335219400040,0

Besides, they can easily be used as alternative media for traditional course requirements. A few years ago, the social media platform, Facebook, that has been used mostly for entertainment purposes, was integrated into my classroom. Having created Facebook groups for both English and German courses, some great results were yielded. Communication between the students and myself as a teacher has greatly improved. Not only that some course material has been included, but my students were also encouraged to find Facebook pages and groups regarding various field of agriculture (horticulture, agricultural machinery, fruit and grape growing, animal production, apiculture, ecology, agricultural economics, gardening, etc.). In this way, students' interest and participation have been enhanced. Finally, they discovered a new source of information regarding their field of professional interest. Three generations of students of the Faculty of Agriculture Osijek were given a simple on-line questionnaire for the purpose of gathering first hand information on their views regarding the implementation of social media into the classroom in their post-secondary education.

In contrast to standard models, the union fully takes into account the international mobility of firms. If international differences in labour productivity and market size are small, lower foreign wages or lower trade costs necessarily lead to lower union wage demands. Otherwise, lower foreign wages or trade costs may reduce the sensitivity of the remaining firms in the home country to wage changes, leading to higher union wage demands. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

But even though studies examining Euroscepticism in the EU are plentiful, the lack of insight into different types of Euroscepticism in non-Member States is striking: there is very little research which considers the extent to which there are different varieties of Euroscepticism in the European states that have chosen non-membership of the Union. What is Euroscepticism in these countries, and why are the Icelanders, Norwegians and Swiss so Eurosceptic? The article looks at how Euroscepticism plays out in Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. It examines what Euroscepticism is and why it occurs in these countries, using a framework for analyzing Euroscepticism based on the concepts of economic, political, post-materialist value-based, right-wing value-based, cultural and rural society Euroscepticism.","eFaktor AS, N-2615 Lillehammer, Norway",,"Skinner, MS (通讯作者)，eFaktor AS, Brubakken 2, N-2615 Lillehammer, Norway.",mss@efaktor.no,"Skinner, Marianne/GVT-8893-2022","Skinner, Marianne/0000-0001-6940-4060",,,,,39,16,17,1,52,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In general, while there does seem to be a moderating effect of government participation on a party's Euroscepticism, there are notable cases of Eurosceptic party participation in government having some discernible impact on policy, but under somewhat specific conditions. The impact is clearly different for major and minor parties and, in the case of the latter, moderating their Euroscepticism is often a signifier of a wider process of party mainstreaming. In some cases, while parties continue to use Eurosceptic rhetoric when in office, this does not appear to translate into substantial policy change.","[Taggart, Paul] Univ Sussex, Dept Polit, Brighton BN1 9SP, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Taggart, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Polit, Brighton BN1 9SP, E Sussex, England.",p.a.taggart@sussex.ac.uk,"Taggart, Paul/AFP-3173-2022","Taggart, Paul/0000-0002-1535-3015",,,,,34,69,78,1,54,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The analysis is focused on the domestic production and its use because the value of imported goods and services is not directly connected with hours worked in the Czech Republic. The emphasis is put on the labor intensity development and the comparison with the development of capital endowment of labour. Besides, the development of real gross value added is taken into account. The labor intensity is the time spent by the production of the product according to product classification CZ-CPA.

Recently, it has been found to be favorable for optimizing agents who want to engage in risky sexual behavior as they can select partners outside their own network and that of their spouse. This paper augments the literature by arguing that the effect of ethno-linguistic heterogeneity on risky sexual behavior is gender related. In contexts where women have more economic benefits (or losses) from sexual partners, they better internalize the cost of detection. This study shows that, with respect to men, ethno-linguistic heterogeneity significantly affects women's HIV status and their risky sexual behavior. Accordingly, it also affects positively the probability of being in a discordant couple where the wife is HIV positive.","Univ Namur, CRED, B-5000 Namur, Belgium",University of Namur,"Tequame, M (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, CRED, Rue Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium.",miron.tequame@fundp.ac.be,,,,,,,34,1,1,1,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Information asymmetry, as measured by analyst forecast error and dispersion, is negatively related to the use of lines of credit. Specifically, firms with more severe information asymmetry are less likely to have access to bank credit lines. Concurrently, more transparent firms are more likely to utilize bank credit lines as opposed to cash for liquidity management. The results are robust to alternative information asymmetry proxies and specifications. These findings suggest that information asymmetry plays an important role in corporate liquidity management.","[An, Heng] Univ S Dakota, Beacom Sch Business, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA; [Hardin, William, III; Wu, Zhonghua] Florida Int Univ, Coll Business Adm, Miami, FL 33199 USA",University of South Dakota; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"An, H (通讯作者)，Univ S Dakota, Beacom Sch Business, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA.",hunter.an@usd.edu,,,,,,,48,21,25,1,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We demonstrate how mortgage loan portfolios can be optimised using geographical differences in the risk characteristics of mortgage loans in the UK. Our empirical results show that credit risk can be reduced by a third when the LDT method is used instead of the benchmark portfolios that we calculate with regional-gross-value-added weights and equal weights. More importantly, the difference in the expected loss between these portfolios increases further during bearish housing markets. To see that such numbers matter, in an extreme scenario, the UK mortgage lenders could lose more than 2% a year as the consequence of mortgage defaults, which is equivalent to an annual loss of approximately 20 billion pounds in the UK. Although this extreme state would not continue for a long time, it nevertheless represents a huge potential loss for mortgage lenders and investors.","[Hwang, Soosung] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea; [Cho, Youngha] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Satchell, Steve] Fac Econ & Polit, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Oxford Brookes University,"Hwang, S (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, 53 Myeongnyun Dong,3 Ga, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",ycho@brookes.ac.uk; shwang@skku.edu; ses11@econ.cam.ac.uk,"Hwang, Soosung/C-3842-2013; CHO, YOUNGHA/AAL-2058-2020","Hwang, Soosung/0000-0003-3953-0829; Cho, Youngha/0000-0002-6914-1798",,,,,55,4,5,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We apply the procedure to the mistaken decision to impose excessively lax banking sector risk regulation in Ireland during the period 200308. We measure the differences in banking sector stability and national income that would have occurred if the stricter regulatory approach enforced in Ireland in 2009 had been put in place six years earlier. We find that a few simple, reasonably prudent regulatory controls on the Irish banking sector would have greatly limited the vulnerability of the domestic sector to the 2008 global credit freeze and almost certainly prevented the 200809 collapse of the domestic banking sector and the consequent deep Irish recession of 200910. On the other hand, the risky and unsustainable inflow of foreign capital mediated by the domestic banks accounts for a substantial part of Irish economic growth during the 200307 period. Without this net foreign borrowing inflow, cumulative gross domestic product over the early period would have been substantially lower.","[Connor, Gregory] Natl Univ Ireland, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [O'Kelly, Brian] Dublin City Univ, Dublin 9, Ireland",Maynooth University; Dublin City University,"Connor, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",,,"Connor, Gregory/0000-0001-5911-4983",,,,,26,1,1,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2012,35.0,10,,,SI,,1256,1276,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01482.x,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,021MY,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309890100004,0

The proposed model structure draws on two earlier models developed for Lisbon and Seattle which show significant effects of land use patterns on travel behavior. The travel behavior variables included here are multifaceted including commuting distance, car ownership, the amount of mobility by mode (car, transit and non-motorized modes), both in terms of total kilometers travelled and number of trips. The model also includes a travel scheduling variable, which is the total time spent between the first and last trips to reflect daily constraints in time allocation and travel. The modeled land use variables measure the levels of urban concentration and density, diversity, both in terms of types of uses and the mix between jobs and inhabitants/residents, the transport supply levels, transit and road infrastructure, and accessibility indicators. The land use patterns are described both at the residence and employment zones of each individual included in the model by using a factor analysis technique as a data reduction and multicollinearity elimination technique. In order to explicitly account for self selection bias the land use variables are explicitly modeled as functions of socioeconomic attributes of individuals and their households. The results obtained show that people with different socioeconomic characteristics tend to work and live in places of substantially different urban environments. But besides these socioeconomic self-selection effects, land use variables significantly affect travel behavior. More precisely the effects of land use are in great part passed thru variables describing long term decisions like commuting distance, and car ownership. These results point to similar conclusions from the models developed for Lisbon and Seattle and thus give weight to the use of land use policies as tools for changing travel behavior.

We propose various indicators of firm employee training. We build a count data panel with a long time-data series to deal with the issue of firms' heterogeneity. We propose a dynamic analysis. Using dynamic count data models on French industrial firms over the period 1986-1992, we find positive and significant effects of R&D intensity and training on patenting activity.

This unique account enhances understandings of the twin challenges for managers in attempting to accommodate work-life balance for their staff and themselves personally. Despite these workplace pressures, the narrative is peppered with instances of practical and emotional concern and support.","[Smith, Andrew] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England",University of Bradford,"Smith, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Emm Lane, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England.",a.smith14@bradford.ac.uk,,"Smith, Andrew/0000-0002-7524-9359",,,,,19,14,17,2,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We find that a large part of the effect of height on well-being is driven by a positive correlation between height and economic and health conditions. However, for young men the effect of height on happiness persists even after controlling for these variables, implying that height is associated with some psycho-social direct effects on well-being. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that men care not only about their own height but also about the height of others in their reference group. Well-being is greater for individuals who are taller than other men in their reference group.

In this model, workers are either employed and commute frequently to a central business district (CBD) or unemployed and commute less frequently to the CBD in search of jobs. When an unemployed worker succeeds in off-the-job search, the quality of the job match is determined stochastically: a good match yields high productivity whereas a bad match yields low productivity. While a high-productivity worker does not seek a new job, a low-productivity worker decides whether to conduct on-the-job search, which would require additional commuting to the CBD. Analysis of this model demonstrates that in equilibrium, the relocation path of workers corresponds to their career path. Furthermore, welfare analysis demonstrates that such a spatial structure distorts firms' decision regarding the posting of vacancies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Many firms therefore aim to form deeper and stronger relationships with their customers in order to increase loyalty and repeat purchases. A central concept in this regard is customer relationship management (CRM). However, while previous research shows there are benefits attached to forging closer ties with customers, there are also some costs involved. Yet, very little research has investigated the central question of whether CRM endeavours are an efficient use of a firm's resources. In this paper, the authors address this gap and investigate the effect of CRM implementation on the cost and technical efficiency of hotels. They find support for the hypothesis that while CRM increases technical efficiency, it decreases cost efficiency. The authors discuss the managerial implications of their findings and provide directions for future research.","[Josiassen, Alexander] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Mkt, DK-2000 Copenhagen C, Denmark; [Assaf, A.

The key result is that instead of deriving optimal policy using the original VAR equations as the constraint, when no restriction is placed on the correlation structure of the VAR disturbances, the constraint should be formed from a transformation of the VAR. This method is applied to the USA, 1964-2009. Significant welfare gains are found compared with actual policy and using a Taylor rule.

It argues that at the centre of Norwegian Euroscepticism is a concern for post-materialist values, political culture and rural society, and that values (the desire to make Norway and the world a better place) is a much more potent explanation for Norwegian Euroscepticism than economic interest (the desire to make Norway a richer place) or perceived threat to Norwegian national identity. The VCR theory finds support in the empirical study conducted: a thematic analysis of newspaper debates in a major Norwegian newspaper from the 1960s, 1970s and 1990s. The findings also indicate that the Euroscepticism found in Norway in the 1990s is extremely similar to that which was formed during the first membership debates in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to contributing towards the literature on Norway and the EU, the article makes a contribution to the general study of Euroscepticism by putting forward a new approach to studying and comparing the subject across time and across countries.","[Skinner, Marianne Sundlisaeter] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,,mss@efaktor.no,"Skinner, Marianne/GVT-8893-2022","Skinner, Marianne/0000-0001-6940-4060",,,,,33,4,5,1,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The authors estimate that having the same race as the coach increased playing time by between 45 and 55 seconds per game on average. One possible explanation for this result is an own-race bias on the part of NBA coaches, in which they subconsciously exhibit a preference for players whose race matches their own. The estimates reveal that the impact of race on playing time was relatively strong in the late 1990s but that it has declined over time since then. The authors hypothesize that racial bias may emerge more strongly in decisions made under pressure, such as substitution patterns during the flow of the game, than in decisions made after careful consideration, such as the choice of which player to start. Empirical tests provide little evidence, however, that deliberation completely removes the own-race bias since coaches both gave more playing time and were more likely to start players of their own race.","[Magee, Christopher S.

During the decade before the crisis, the European Union tried to develop a cross-border bank resolution regime relying on voluntary agreements and complex governance networks. However, these arrangements failed to commit national authorities to multilateral resolution as was exemplified by the case of Fortis. The crisis experience provided the Commission with an opportunity to propose legislation that would either deepen the pre-crisis co-ordinated regime, or replace it with an integrated resolution regime for systemically important cross-border banks. The Commission considered the more ambitious reforms, but after the experience with negotiations over the powers of European Supervisory Authorities, postponed the proposals for an integrated regime until after 2014. The initial round of post-crisis reforms thus remained limited to minimal improvements of the pre-crisis status quo.","Austrian Acad Sci, Inst European Integrat Res, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",Austrian Academy of Sciences,"Kudrna, Z (通讯作者)，Austrian Acad Sci, Inst European Integrat Res, Strohgasse 45, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",zdenek.kudrna@oeaw.ac.at,"Kudrna, Zdenek/J-5828-2012",,,,,,44,26,28,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Instead of presenting rival theoretical approaches competing for explanatory superiority, the article shows that a more comprehensive picture of the EP's empowerment can be obtained by distinguishing between three types of institutional choice and associated explanations. Institutional creation, institutional change and institutional use are introduced as different types of institutional choice, and it is argued that each type gives primacy to particular explanatory mechanisms and dynamics to analyze the EP's empowerment.","Univ Munich, Geschwister Scholl Inst, Chair Int Polit, D-80538 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Rittberger, B (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Geschwister Scholl Inst, Chair Int Polit, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",Berthold.Rittberger@gsi.lmu.de,,"Rittberger, Berthold/0000-0002-8806-6455",,,,,49,63,65,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The analysis focuses on the historic interaction between ruggedness and Africa's slave trades. Although rugged terrain hinders trade and most productive activities, negatively affecting income globally, rugged terrain within Africa afforded protection to those being raided during the slave trades. Since the slave trades retarded subsequent economic development, ruggedness within Africa has also had a historic indirect positive effect on income. Studying all countries worldwide, we estimate the differential effect of ruggedness on income for Africa. We show that the differential effect of ruggedness is statistically significant and economically meaningful, it is found in Africa only, it cannot be explained by other factors like Africa's unique geographic environment, and it is fully accounted for by the history of the slave trades.","[Nunn, Nathan] Harvard Univ, NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Nunn, N (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Puga, Diego/A-9184-2008","Puga, Diego/0000-0003-2640-1534; Nunn, Nathan/0000-0002-5101-9866",,,,,64,447,536,8,66,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The results can be utilized by researchers and practitioners to improve the use of SNS for knowledge sharing and to raise professional societies and individuals' awareness of SNS use.","[Al-Busaidi, Kamla Ali] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Al Khoud, Oman; [Ragsdell, Gillian; Dawson, Ray] Univ Loughborough, Loughborough, Leics, England",Sultan Qaboos University; Loughborough University,"Al-Busaidi, KA (通讯作者)，Sultan Qaboos Univ, Al Khoud, Oman.",kamlaa@squ.edu.om; G.Ragsdell@lboro.ac.uk; R.J.Dawson@lboro.ac.uk,"Al-Busaidi, Kamla Ali/R-6435-2017","Ragsdell, Gillian/0000-0002-7100-0329",,,,,38,0,0,1,19,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,237,+,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700026,0

Open innovation is a fundamental process for understanding, defining and developing new technologies between organizations, and it has attracted much attention from researchers in recent years in many disciplines. The paper first discusses the notion of outbound open innovation and briefly examines the relevant literature. A more detailed review of specific aspects of the current research on open innovation identifies three different core processes (inside-out, coupled and outside-in). In this early stage, more attention has been devoted to research on inbound open innovation than outbound open innovation. In addition, potential disadvantages and barriers to open innovation have been relatively neglected. In response, we classified the barriers to open innovation into six broad categories including: internal, external, governance, technical, management, and employees. Based on our literature review we propose shifting the research focus towards an investigation of barriers towards achievement of open innovation.","[Bagherzadeh, Gholamreza; Baghizadeh, Zeinab; O'Donnell, Loretta] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,,g.bagherzadeh@student.unsw.edu.au; z.baghizadeh@student.unsw.edu.au; l.odonnell@unsw.edu.au,"Kadi, Alaa J./C-5045-2017",,,,,,42,0,0,6,36,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,366,375,,,,,,10,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700040,0

Our analyzing of earlier studies in this research area has proved that all the authors worked with three parameters of the credit market. As the first, interest rate on loans that means risk payment of the loan contract. Second, the creditworthiness or the bonity that means the quality of the credit client. And third, the credit collateral which is sometimes given to secure the loan contract. The aim of this study is to construct new credit market model with all these three parameters. All functions in this model are mathematically described. In addition, we modify our basic model due to asymmetric information problematic. Even if the mathematical confirmation of the potential performance of the model is included in this paper, we have highlighted some theoretical barriers why the credit market model could not work in the real economy. Despite the fact we argue that the type of our theoretical model can be ceteris paribus very close to the practical functioning of the credit market in the real economy.

This is because, inter alia, the successful production of commodities requires knowledge of their constituent materials and their potential transformations and the ways in which these can be managed through the production process to allow the creation of surplus value and profits. Using the steel and automobile industries as an example, I show how a wide range of materials can be produced with a variety of desirable properties through careful control of the production process. Sophisticated management of the production process depends upon the knowledge of the properties of the materials and of the ways in which these can be combined and transformed to give types of steels with particular desired combination of properties. Capitalist interests have increasingly shaped the processes of R&D through which knowledge about the materials, their properties and their transformations has been developed and deployed to produce profits via producing steel and - inter alia - automobiles.","Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3LE, England",Durham University,"Hudson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sci Site, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",ray.hudson@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,91,17,18,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The ability of leaders to have stable trait psychoticism not only provides many benefits to the self-esteem of employees, but also helps to calm them and their emotionsso that they can work together with more happiness and peace.","[Johar, Siti Sarawati Hj.] Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Fac Sci, Parit Raja, Malaysia",University of Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia,,,"JOHAR, SITI SARAWATI/K-6725-2018","JOHAR, SITI SARAWATI/0000-0003-2372-3749",,,,,16,0,0,0,3,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,505,513,,,,,,9,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600044,0

However, despite all efforts in this matter, the statistics show a persisting gender pay gap, of 17,6 % on average for the 27 EU Member States in 2008. The causes of the gender pay gap are much more complex and include indirect discrimination, greater difficulties for women in balancing work and private life, and stereotypes that influence the evaluation and classification of occupations or the choice of education undertaken by men and women. Even if the Europen Union has been taking action in the field for more than 50 years, the process of closing the gender pay gap appears to be very slow.

Should we regard as good evaluated edges with good assessments by both evaluations or is it sufficient to be good according to one evaluation only? Or should we take rating by average? The answer may help in right setting of genetic algorithms. The chromosomes in genetic algorithms are also edge evaluations. If we know the answer to the question put above, we can e.g. decide whether it is more suitable to define a vocation to be a good edge as dominant or recessive, or select individuals for next solution breeding in a better way.

In the absence of currency devaluations, eurozone governments are faced with the painful social process of wage devaluations. This paper examines the strategic choices facing the government and organised labour in how they respond to this problem. It will argue that the European Monetary Union contains an implicit neoclassical assumption that labour markets will automatically adjust to downward wage flexibility. This ignores the politics of collective bargaining. Labour relations systems are the most regulated of all markets. Based on this institutional embeddedness, the paper will outline a typology of political choices facing national governments: neoliberal market adjustment, national or sectoral concertation and euro-coordination. Institutional pre-conditions of collective bargaining mediate what strategy governments adopt. It will subsequently examine the case of Ireland that tried and failed to negotiate a national pact in 2009. Social partnership was a central institution of Ireland's political economy for 20 years but could not internalise the adjustment constraints of the current crisis. The voluntary and exclusive nature of Ireland's corporatist wage pacts weakened the power resources of labour and enabled the government to pursue a neoliberal strategy of adjustment. As an institution, it was dependent upon the political executive of the state.","Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Regan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.",aidan.regan@gmail.com,,"Regan, Aidan/0000-0001-7558-730X",,,,,60,25,28,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The result of this approach will be the set of weights of all viewpoints included into the frames.

The approach presented in this paper can be easily extended and applied to other OWL profiles or RDF entailment regimes.","[Salah, A.] Univ Quebec Montreal, UQAM, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [El Koutbi, M.] Souissi Univ, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco; [Khriss, I.] Univ Quebec Rimouski, UQAR, Rimouski, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Mohammed V University in Rabat; University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski,"Salah, A (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal, UQAM, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",salah.aziz@uqam.ca; elkoutbi@ensias.ma; ismail.khriss@uqar.ca,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-8-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,314,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BEO25,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317549700035,0

The targeted key performance indicators (KPI) for the Core Strategic V of National Cooperative Policy 2011 - 2020 stated that, at least 90% of the co-operatives have audited annual financial report and 90% of the co-operatives conduct the annual general meeting. This study addresses a question, does educational background and training attained has a relationship with the competency of the BOD in ensuring the effectiveness of financial reporting? Based on previous literature, competency is believed to be influenced by individual educational background and training attended. 42 cooperatives on agriculture based in the whole state of Perak were selected in this study, however only 258 questionnaires were returned. Hierarchical regression analysis technique was used, and the result shows that there is a significant relationship between education background and training attained by the BOD member with their competency in managing the agriculture cooperative society activities in state of Perak.

Some countries even over-subsidise certain renewable energy (RE)-technologies due to a lack of reliable economic data, with the consequence of market distortions and with the danger of impeding economically better-suited RE-technologies After a brief sketch of the recent impressive development of worldwide RE-investments and the state of discussion on economic and financial issues in literature, different levels of effects of RE-projects are being examined using some real life examples. These examples will show that the financial engineering of an environmental project is not just an accounting exercise, but also an important prerequisite for its feasibility, its chances for realisation and, at the end, its sustainability. A special problem of RE projects is the existence of benefits (results'), which are difficult to quantify, like the cost-benefit ratio for an avoided ton of CO2 or the achievement of technological leadership. But even if such effects cannot be quantified, it will be discussed how to include them into an evaluation, without mixing quantifiable with non-quantifiable results and wishful thinking with reality.","[Stocker, Klaus] Georg Simon Ohm Univ, Fac Business, Nurnberg, Germany",,,,,,,,,,45,0,0,1,7,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,299,319,,,,,,21,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600027,0

Compared to the Asian websites, European websites are more experienced in practising green and most of their websites have been well-developed for disseminating information and communicating with the public (Ho, 2007). In order to identify the significant criteria for a green NGO's website, a coding sheet was developed based on the literature review and the Chi Square test has been used to analyse the differences between the green NGOs' websites from the two different regions. This study reveals there are significant differences between Asian and European green NGOs' websites based on the core content, webpage presence, interactivity with users, Web accessibility and navigation. The study's finding can be used as a reference for developing or designing a green NGO's website to be more effective in disseminating green information to the public.","[Yee, Aaron Pook Sow; Gan, Gerald Goh Guan; Ling, Lee Su] Multimedia Univ, Fac Business & Law, Ayer Keroh, Melaka, Malaysia",Multimedia University,,,"Gan, Gerald GOH Guan/M-8278-2019; Goh, Gerald Guan Gan/G-7818-2016","Gan, Gerald GOH Guan/0000-0001-7718-4686; Goh, Gerald Guan Gan/0000-0001-7718-4686",,,,,70,0,0,0,3,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-115-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,357,370,,,,,,14,"Business; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA4ID,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335764600031,0

The height data of 82,039 conscripts constitute the principal source for this analysis. The study area comprises the current Valencian region, located in central Mediterranean Spain. During the period under study, the average height of conscripts increased by 7.5 cm, while the coefficient of variation decreased by 0.6 between the 1870s and 1930 indicating that height inequality declined, although it increased by 0.2 among the cohorts born during the period of Francoist regime. Our results show that, in the long run, the height and biological well-being of the populations conscripted in Mediterranean Spain were determined by socioeconomic status and environmental contexts: that there was a close correlation among education, occupation, income, and stature. Literate conscripts were always taller than illiterate ones (by nearly 1 cm), and agricultural workers, with fewer economic resources, were significantly shorter (by 3.6 cm) than highly qualified non-manual workers.

The analysis relies on theory-consistent bilateral trade costs for 55 countries for 1999-2009 and an analysis of services commitments in 66 regional trade agreements to which these countries are parties. Despite the recent proliferation of services regional trade agreements (RTAs), we find that trade costs are only slightly lower due to these agreements. In addition, we find that the trade cost reductions that do take place tend to happen before the agreement is signed. This is consistent with countries using RTAs as a way of locking in' reforms. Finally, we find that the preferential margin of services RTAs is thin: members and non-members both see slightly lower trade costs when an RTA is signed. However, the difference between the member and non-member trade cost effects is 28 per cent for services and 40 per cent for goods, indicating a slimmer margin of preference in the former case. We discuss the possible explanations for these findings in terms of the nature of services RTAs and their relationship with regulatory reform. Based on these results, we argue that regionalism in the case of services seems relatively non-discriminatory and does not lead to substantial trade preferences.","[Miroudot, Sebastien] OECD, Paris, France; [Shepherd, Ben] Developing Trade Consultants Ltd, New York, NY USA",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Miroudot, S (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",,,"Miroudot, Sebastien/0000-0003-3850-2754",,,,,32,27,27,2,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2014,37.0,12,,,SI,,1751,1772,,10.1111/twec.12178,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AW4KC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346249000006,0

Economists usually rely on random explorations, such as Monte Carlo simulations, and basic econometric modeling to approximate the properties of computational models. This paper aims to provide guidelines for the use of a much more efficient method that combines a parsimonious sampling of the parameter space using a specific design of experiments (DoE), with a well-suited metamodeling method first developed in geostatistics: kriging. We illustrate these guidelines by following them in the analysis of two simple and well known economic models: Nelson and Winter's industrial dynamics model, and Cournot oligopoly with learning firms. In each case, we show that our DoE experiments can catch the main effects of the parameters on the models' dynamics with a much lower number of simulations than the Monte-Carlo sampling (e.g. 85 simulations instead of 2,000 in the first case). In the analysis of the second model, we also introduce supplementary numerical tools that may be combined with this method, for characterizing configurations complying with a specific criterion (social optimal, replication of stylized facts, etc.). Our appendix gives an example of the R-project code that can be used to apply this method on other models, in order to encourage other researchers to quickly test this approach on their models.","[Salle, Isabelle] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, CeNDEF, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Salle, Isabelle] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Yildizoglu, Murat] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, F-33608 Pessac, France",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Yildizoglu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",I.L.Salle@uva.nl; yildi@u-bordeaux4.fr,"Salle, Isabelle/GOP-1243-2022",,,,,,36,42,44,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The costs of such systems are clear, but the quantification of the benefits still generates debate. This paper analyzes the value of highway travel time information systems. This is achieved by modeling the departure time selection and route choice with and without the guidance of an information system. The behavioral model supporting these choices is grounded on the expected utility theory, where drivers try to maximize the expected value of their perceived utility. The value of information is derived from the reduction of the unreliability costs as a consequence of the wiser decisions made with information. This includes the reduction of travel times, scheduling costs and stress. This modeling approach allows assessing the effects of the precision of the information system in the value of the information. Different scenarios are simulated in a generic but realistic context, using empirical data measured on a highway corridor accessing the city of Barcelona, Spain. Results show that travel time information only has a significant value in three situations: (1) when there is an important scheduled activity at the destination (e.g. morning commute trips), (2) in case of total uncertainty about the conditions of the trip (e.g. sporadic trips), and (3) when more than one route is possible. Information systems with very high precision do not produce better results. However, an acceptable level of precision is completely required, as information systems with very poor precision may even be detrimental. The paper also highlights the difference between the user value and the social value of the information. The value of the information may not benefit only the user. For instance, massive dissemination of travel time information contributes to the reduction of day-to-day travel time variance. This favors all drivers, even those without information. In these situations travel time information has the property that its social benefits exceed private benefits (i.e. information has positive externalities). Of course, drivers are only willing to cover costs equal or smaller than their private benefits, which in turn may justify subsidies for information provision. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We evaluate the effects of breastfeeding on child disability using data from the National Survey of Family Growth merged to the National Health Interview Survey for a large nationally representative sample of children aged 1-18 years from the U.S. including over 3000 siblings who are discordant on breastfeeding status/duration. We focus on a mother fixed effect model that compares siblings in order to account for family-level unobservable confounders and employ multiple specifications including a dynamic model that accounts for disability status of the prior child. Breastfeeding the child for a longer duration is associated with a lower risk of child disability, by about 0.2 percentage-points per month of breastfeeding. This effect is only observed on the intensive margin among breastfed children, as any breastfeeding has no effect on the extensive margin. We conclude that very short breastfeeding durations are unlikely to have an effect on reducing disability risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates public acceptance of such a scheme in Australia. Surveys were conducted in Brisbane and Melbourne, the two fastest growing Australian cities. Using an ordered logit modeling approach, the survey data including stated preferences were analyzed to pinpoint the important factors influencing people's attitudes to a congestion charge and, in turn, to their transport mode choices. To accommodate the nature of, and to account for the resulting heterogeneity of the panel data, random effects were considered in the models. As expected, this study found that the amount of the congestion charge and the financial benefits of implementing it have a significant influence on respondents' support for the charge and on the likelihood of their taking a bus to city areas. However, respondents' current primary transport mode for travelling to the city areas has a more pronounced impact. Meanwhile, respondents' perceptions of the congestion charge's role in protecting the environment by reducing vehicle emissions, and of the extent to which the charge would mean that they travelled less frequently to the city for shopping or entertainment, also have a significant impact on their level of support for its implementation. We also found and explained notable differences across two cities. Finally, findings from this study have been fully discussed in relation to the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that mechanical removal or modeling of simple low-frequency movements in the data may yield poor predictive results which depend on the model specification used. Basic NKPC models are extended to include structural time series models that describe typical time-varying patterns in levels and volatilities. Forward- and backward-looking expectation components for inflation are incorporated and their relative importance is evaluated. Survey data on expected inflation are introduced to strengthen the information in the likelihood. Use is made of simulation-based Bayesian techniques for the empirical analysis. No credible evidence is found on endogeneity and long-run stability between inflation and marginal costs. Backward-looking inflation appears stronger than forward-looking inflation. Levels and volatilities of inflation are estimated more precisely using rich NKPC models.

Using detailed data on imports and exports at the firm-product-market level, we document substantial churning in both imports and exports for Slovenian manufacturing firms in the period 1994-2008. On average, a firm changes about one-quarter of imported and exported product-markets every year, while gross churning in terms of added and dropped product-markets is almost three times higher. A substantial share of this product churning is due to simultaneous imports and exports of firms in identical varieties within the same CN-8 product code (so called pass-on-trade). We find that churning in imported varieties is far more important than reduction in tariffs or declines in import prices for firms' productivity growth and increased export product scope. We also find gross churning has a bigger impact on firm productivity improvements by a factor of more than 10 in comparison with net churning. Both adding and dropping of imported input varieties thus seem to be of utmost importance for firms aiming to optimise their input mix towards their most valuable inputs. These effects are further enhanced when excluding simultaneous trade in identical varieties, suggesting that pass-on-trade has less favourable effects on firms' long-run performance than regular trade.","[Damijan, Joze P.; Konings, Jozef; Polanec, Saso] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze P.; Konings, Jozef] Vives, Leuven, Belgium; [Konings, Jozef] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",University of Ljubljana; KU Leuven,"Damijan, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",,,"Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174",,,,,37,18,18,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2014,37.0,11,,,,,1483,1506,,10.1111/twec.12196,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AU3JX,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000345510100001,0

For the German and Italian datasets, we show that the size distribution of tourism industry is heavy-tailed and consistent with a power-law behavior in its upper tail. Such a behavior seems quite persistent over the time horizon covered by our study, provided that during the period 2004-2009, the shape parameter is always in the vicinity of 2.5 for Germany and 2.6 for Italy. Size of the tourism industry has been proxied by the lodging capacity of hotel establishments: hotels, boarding houses, inns, lodging houses, motels, apartment hotels, tourist villages, and tourist apartments. Data belonging to the EUROSTAT and ISTAT databases have been used for Germany and Italy, respectively. Our aim is not to provide the best fit to the data but simply to focus our attention on the right tail of the size distribution of tourism industry. Understanding the behavior of the upper tail is indeed fundamental to capture the structure of the market.

Because list price affects broker effort required to sell the property, brokers respond to seller overpricing by increasing the negotiated listing contract length. At the same time, sellers respond to longer listing contracts by adjusting their list price strategy. Both list price and length of marketing time affect broker sales effort and therefore a property's realized selling price and liquidity. Analysis of house transaction data from Virginia indicates that greater over-pricing by sellers prompts brokers to pursue longer listing contracts, which subsequently lengthen marketing time but increase selling price. The results reveal a novel transmission mechanism from higher list price (which induces longer contracts) to selling price and liquidity.","[Anderson, Randy I.; Turnbull, Geoffrey K.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Finance, Dr P Phillips Sch Real Estate, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Brastow, Raymond T.; Waller, Bennie D.] Longwood Univ, Dept Finance, Farmville, VA 23909 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Longwood University,"Waller, BD (通讯作者)，Longwood Univ, Dept Finance, 201 High St, Farmville, VA 23909 USA.",randerson@bus.ucf.edu; brastowrt@longwood.edu; gturnbull@bus.ucf.edu; wallerbd@longwood.edu,"Waller, Bennie D./AAF-6043-2021; Waller, Bennie D/HKM-9179-2023",,,,,,24,7,7,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Unilateral action involves the risk of relocating emissions to regions without climate regulations, i.e., emission leakage. A major channel for leakage are price changes in the international oil market. Previous studies on leakage have assumed competitive behavior in this market. Here, we consider alternative assumptions about OPEC's behavior in order to assess how these affect leakage and costs of unilateral climate policies. Our results based on simulations with a large-scale computable general equilibrium model of the global economy suggest that assumptions on OPEC's behavior are crucial to the impact assessment of unilateral climate policy measures. We find that leakage through the oil market may become negative when OPEC is perceived as a dominant producer, thereby reducing overall leakage drastically compared to a setting where the oil market is perceived competitive.","[Boehringer, Christoph; Schneider, Jan] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Rosendahl, Knut Einar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, UMB Sch Econ & Business, Oslo, Norway; [Rosendahl, Knut Einar] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Statistics Norway,"Rosendahl, KE (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, UMB Sch Econ & Business, Oslo, Norway.",christoph.boehringer@uni-oldenburg.de; knut.einar.rosendahl@umb.no; jan.schneider@uni-oldenburg.de,,"Rosendahl, Knut Einar/0000-0002-8066-6261",Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),We are grateful for valuable comments from two anonymous referees.

Much success in the labour market is therefore predicated on employees possessing the right verbal characteristics. In this article empirical research with men who stammer is used to extend our understanding of the issues which surround aesthetic labour. Findings demonstrate routine discrimination - by employers and the men themselves - with reference to a perceived speech-role fit. For the men, aesthetic labour is an embodied emotional labour: representing the effort between what is said and how it is said. Their sometime inability to sound right saw the men seek to enhance their knowledge or emphasize other communication attributes, such as listening.

Under normal market conditions, but departing from typical mutual fund performance, real estate mutual fund returns generally exceed relevant benchmarks on a before expenses basis and match benchmark returns after expenses. The ability to meet and exceed benchmark returns, however, does not hold during the financial crisis period.

We find evidence of convergence among the Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese and UK prices. The North American price displays behaviour that is distinct from this group of prices. We conclude that there is not a fully integrated international natural gas market. The integration between European (represented by NBP) and Asian geographic regions appears to be due primarily to underlying contractual mechanisms specifically linking natural gas prices to oil prices rather than the result of market supply and demand interactions.

It applies stochastic frontier models for employed persons and the approach from Kiefer and Neumann (1979b) for unemployed persons. Furthermore, the question of whether or not reservation wages decrease over the unemployment period is addressed. This is done by a simulated panel with known reservation wages which uses data from the Socio-Economic Panel as a basis. The comparison of the estimators is carried out by a Monte Carlo simulation. In case of employed persons, the cross-sectional stochastic frontier model shows the best performance. The Kiefer-Neumann approach for unemployed persons is able to predict decreasing reservation wages but the rise of the mean reservation wage in case of a constant simulated reservation wage went undetected. In general, the Kiefer-Neumann approach overestimates the reservation wage.","[Leppin, Julian S.] Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Leppin, Julian S.] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Leppin, JS (通讯作者)，Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Heimhuder Str 71, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",leppin@hwwi.org,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,4,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Building on new pooled time-series data, the empirical findings reveal the presence of a convergence process among the most advanced economies regarding passive labour market policy efforts, with the EES fostering this trend even further. Furthermore, the findings support the argument that the EES creates pressure on governments to reform domestic labour market policies, but this pressure varies across countries and over time.

Multivariate statistical analyses were used to examine the relationships between overall satisfaction and travel experience variables, trip complexity, subjective well-being indices, travel-related attitudes as well as individual- and trip-specific attributes. The results indicate that for certain traveler groups, such as women, young and low-income or unemployed travelers, there are distinctive determinants of satisfaction with trip stages for various travel modes. The results also indicate that satisfaction with the primary trip stage is strongly linked to overall trip satisfaction, while satisfaction levels with access and egress trip stages are strongly related to satisfaction with the primary trip stage. Past experience, traveler expectations and attitudes, and the emotional state of travelers are also significant explanatory variables for travel satisfaction. The results indicate that when an individual consciously chooses a particular travel mode, they will report a higher level of satisfaction with that chosen mode. Notwithstanding, while past experience highly influences an individual's current travel satisfaction, the more they travel with the current mode, the less satisfied they are with their choice. The results of this study highlight the importance of gaining a better understanding of the interaction between instrumental variables and non-instrumental variables at different trip stages and the influence on user preferences, satisfaction and decision-making processes.

Most trade explanations such as the Heckscher-Ohlin, new trade theory, gravity models, and Ricardo and Sraffa focus on how bilateral import and export volumes and intermediate input goods are driven by decreased financial and information transaction costs. Extending work on trade flows and economic development, we derive several network measures of degree, betweenness and eigenvector centrality from dyadic trade flows from 1960 to 2009. We then empirically explore the interactive effects of trade connectivity, economic production and stages of development on income convergence and trade equalisation. We empirically find clear patterns towards a new phenomenon, both sigma levels and beta rates trade convergence and equalisation for our entire sample. Visualising sigma and beta convergence for seven major trading nations from 1920 to 2010, we believe offers new insights into economic development theory if only beginning to loosen the knot of trade, growth and globalisation.","[Abdollahian, Mark; Yang, Zining] Claremont Grad Univ, Sch Polit & Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School,"Abdollahian, M (通讯作者)，Claremont Grad Univ, Sch Polit & Econ, 170 E Tenth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",mark.abdollahian@cgu.edu; Zining.Yang@cgu.edu,,,,,,,52,2,5,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Bounded rationality: the adaptive toolbox, 2001) spirit of using empirical evidence on heuristics. The priority heuristic predicts actual human choices between risky gambles well. It implies violations of expected utility theory such as common consequence effects, common ratio effects, the fourfold pattern of risk taking and the reflection effect. We present an axiomatization of a parameterized version of the heuristic which generalizes the heuristic in order to account for individual differences and inconsistencies. The axiomatization uses semiorders (Luce, Econometrica 24:178-191, 1956), which have an intransitive indifference part and a transitive strict preference component. The axiomatization suggests new testable predictions of the priority heuristic and makes it easier for theorists to study the relation between heuristics and other axiomatic theories such as cumulative prospect theory.","[Drechsler, Mareile] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Katsikopoulos, Konstantinos; Gigerenzer, Gerd] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Behav & Cognit, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Max Planck Society,"Drechsler, M (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.drechsler@lse.ac.uk; katsikop@mpib-berlin.mpg.de; gigerenzer@mpib-berlin.mpg.de,"Gigerenzer, Gerd/M-5595-2013; Gigerenzer, Gerd/A-6250-2012","Gigerenzer, Gerd/0000-0002-6163-5419",,,,,40,16,17,2,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2014,77.0,2,,,,,183,196,,10.1007/s11238-013-9393-0,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AL2ZX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338995800002,0

In contrast to market-level and route-level elasticities reported in the literature, flight-level elasticities can forecast responses in demand due to day-to-day price fluctuations. Knowing how elasticities vary by flight and booking characteristics and in response to competitors' pricing actions allows airlines to design better promotions. It also allows policy makers the ability to evaluate the impacts of proposed tax increases or time-of-day congestion pricing policies. Our elasticity results show how airlines can design optimal promotions by considering not only which departure dates should be targeted, but also which days of the week customers should be allowed to purchase. Additionally, we show how elasticities can be used by carriers to strategically match a subset of their competitors' sale fares. Methodologically, we use an approach that corrects for price endogeneity; failure to do so results in biased estimates and incorrect pricing recommendations. Using an instrumental variable approach to address this problem we find a set of valid instruments that can be used in future studies of air travel demand. We conclude by describing how our approach contributes to the literature, by offering an approach to estimate flight-level demand elasticities that the research community needs as an input to more advanced optimization models that integrate demand forecasting, price optimization, and revenue optimization models.

This is not only useful to understand nonresponse in this particular survey but to increase knowledge about nonresponse in business surveys overall. Therefore a theoretical framework is presented which helps to explain these processes in establishment surveys. To test this theory additional data from the federal employment agency about the establishments and data about the conducting interviewers is used. Empirical results mainly confirm the theoretical framework. If the respondent has the authority to provide relevant information and is able to give reliable answers to the questions with a justifiable amount of effort, participation is less frequently refused. Both aspects are highly correlated with establishment size and the complexity of the firm. It can also be shown that experienced and professional interviewers are more successful in recruiting firms to take part in the survey.

In seeking to account for the crisis, most official international institutions and non-governmental organisations have focused on the dynamics of the coffee market, its volatility and unpredictability, in the wake of the decline of the International Coffee Agreements in 1989. The result has been a dominant consensus around the 'market' as the cause of underdevelopment and its potential solution, with the 'state' receding ever further into the background. As an alternative to this consensus, this paper argues that the state and the market are inseparable and, more specifically, that coffee statecraft, both good and bad, has been and continues to be central to the everyday operations of the coffee industry. Drawing specifically on the role of the Vietnamese state, it argues that coffee statecraft played a key role in the crisis - typically portrayed as primarily market-driven - and proposes greater attention be paid to the geopolitical actions of southern states, the role of the state during times when it seems most benign or invisible, and the centrality of coffee statecraft in steering development outcomes.","St Marys Univ, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Fridell, G (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",gavin.fridell@smu.ca,,,,,,,49,5,5,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Using German microlevel data for the years 1991, 1992, 1998, and 2008, we show that a positive assessment of the economy significantly improves government popularity, while negative evaluations decrease satisfaction with the government. Voters take the (current and expected) national and personal economic situation into account. We find no evidence for a grievance asymmetry, i.e., voters not only punish the government for a bad economy but also reward them in good times. Finally, we show that popularity functions are only very crude proxies for vote functions, with the latter being mostly driven by party identification.","Leuphana Univ, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Enkelmann, S (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",enkelmann@leuphana.de,,,,,,,49,3,3,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Evidence in India,ENERGY JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rural electrification; Electrification impacts; Distributional impacts; India,,"This paper applies an econometric analysis to estimate the average and distribution benefits of rural electrification using rich household survey data from India. The results support that rural electrification helps reduce time allocated to fuel wood collection by household members and increases time allocated to studying by boys and girls. Rural electrification also increases labor supply of men and women, schooling of boys and girls, household per capita income and expenditure. Electrification also helps reduce poverty. But the larger share of benefits accrues to wealthier rural households, with poorer ones having a more limited use of electricity. The analysis also shows that restricted supply of electricity, due to frequent power outages, negatively affects both household electricity connection and its consumption, thereby reducing the expected benefits of rural electrification.","[Khandker, Shahidur R.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Samad, Hussain A.; Barnes, Douglas F.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Ali, Rubaba] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Khandker, SR (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",skhandker@worldbank.org; hsamad@worldbank.org; rali@arec.umd.edu; barnesdf@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,73,84,1,35,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2014,35.0,2,,,,,75,96,,10.5547/01956574.35.2.4,0.0,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AD8WG,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333545800004,0

Based on a sample of seven high-growth firms (Cisco, GM, IBM, Microsoft, Sears, Starbucks, and US Steel), we find that 162% is the maximum sales growth rate in any one year that an established company can grow without mergers and acquisitions, while the maximum rate of employee growth is approximately 115% even including some mergers and acquisitions. All of the companies in our sample attained a maximum sales growth rate of above 50%, with most hovering around 75%. Furthermore, the firms' growth rates exhibit similar patterns. No company experienced its maximum sales growth rate toward the latter part of its history. Every company experienced its slowest employee growth rate after attaining its maximum employee growth rate, usually within a decade of one another. Most importantly, all firms show an average sales growth that exceeds the average employee growth. This finding is an indication that successful growing firms have a superior capability to continuously improve employment efficiency and adjust organizational structures to suit an increasing workforce.","[Murmann, Johann Peter] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Korn, Jenny] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Worch, Hagen] Swiss Distance Univ Appl Sci, Fernfachhsch Schweiz, Inst Management 8c Innovat, CH-8105 Regensdorf, Switzerland",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Murmann, JP (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",jbnst@professor-murmann.net; jenkorn@uic.edu; hagen.worch@ffhs.ch,"Murmann, Johann Peter/AAM-5955-2020; Murmann, Johann Peter/B-7537-2009","Murmann, Johann Peter/0000-0003-1631-3012;",,,,,165,6,6,1,35,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

For example, a school that has a stellar year in basketball or football on average receives up to 10% more SAT scores. Certain demographic groups (males, Blacks, out-of-state students, and students who played sports in high school) are more likely to be influenced by sports success than their counterparts.

This article examines how gender is (re)produced in architecture, a profession that remains strangely under-researched given its status and position. The empirical work advances the theoretical concept of hegemonic masculinity via an analysis of gendered working practices and the agency of individuals through resistance and complicity with these norms. It reveals how architectural practice relies on long working hours, homosocial behaviour and creative control. However, whereas women perform their gender in ways which reproduce such gendered norms, white, heterosexual, middle class men can transgress them to challenge aspects of practice culture. This has significant implications for understanding the ways in which hegemonic masculinities are reproduced within creative workplaces.","[Sang, Katherine J.

The study asks whether women's occupations provide better conditions in areas that facilitate their dual role in society, as a trade-off for low monetary rewards. Specifically, it examines the association of women's concentration in broader occupational categories, embedded in particular national contexts, with gender differences in job quality. Utilizing the 2005 ISSP modules on work orientation shows that women lag behind men on most dimensions of job quality, countering the hypothesis that women's occupations compensate for their low wages and limited opportunities for promotion by providing better employment conditions. However, as women's relative share in occupations grows the gender gap narrows in most job quality dimensions. The implications of these results are discussed.","[Stier, Haya] Tel Aviv Univ, Levanon St, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Yaish, Meir] Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel",Tel Aviv University; University of Haifa,"Stier, H (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Levanon St, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",haya1@post.tau.ac.il,,"Yaish, Meir/0000-0003-3261-4798; Stier, Haya/0000-0002-5929-3691",,,,,40,81,86,6,89,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Theoretically grounded in Europeanization research and studies of regional governance, the empirical analysis concentrates on the ERDF absorption performance of 25 Member States at the end of the programming period in 2008. The results of Tobit models show a positive relationship between ERDF absorption and government capacity. The estimation findings also demonstrate that new Member States generally had higher absorption rates than old Member States. Furthermore, Member States with high income levels were less likely to maximize the absorption of their ERDF allocations. Finally, there is some support for the hypothesis that fiscal decentralization has a negative impact on absorption performance.","[Tosun, Jale] Heidelberg Univ, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Tosun, Jale] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Polit Sci, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Tosun, J (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, A5,6, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",jale.tosun@mzes.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,54,75,77,1,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.
