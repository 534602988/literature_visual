A new approach based on the cardinalization of categorical Self-Assessed Health valuations is suggested. Health losses have been estimated by using different Time Trade-off and Visual Analogue Scale tariffs, in order to assess the robustness of the results. The methodology is based on the existing literature about treatment effects. Our main contribution focuses on evaluating the loss of health up to 1 year after the non-fatal accident, for those who are non-institutionalized, which aids the appropriate estimation of the aggregated health losses in quality-of-life terms.

The estimator approximates the log-spectrum of the short-memory component of the signal as well as that of the perturbation by two separate polynomials. Including these polynomials we obtain a reduction in the order of magnitude of the bias, but also inflate the asymptotic variance of the long memory estimator by a multiplicative constant. We show that the estimator is consistent for d is an element of (0, 1), asymptotically normal for d is an element of (0. 3/4), and if the spectral density is sufficiently smooth near frequency zero, the rate of convergence can become arbitrarily close to the parametric rate, root n. A Monte Carlo study reveals that the proposed estimator performs well in the presence of a serially correlated perturbation term. Furthermore, an empirical investigation of the 30 DJIA stocks shows that this estimator indicates stronger persistence in volatility than the standard local Whittle (with noise) estimator.

The class of the NED spatial processes covers important spatial processes, including nonlinear autoregressive and infinite moving average random fields, which generally do not satisfy mixing conditions. Apart from accommodating a larger class of dependent processes, the proposed asymptotic theory allows for triangular arrays of heterogeneous random fields located on unevenly spaced lattices and sampled over regions of arbitrary configuration. All these features make the results applicable in a wide range of empirical settings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It applies a theoretical model of budgeting to a data set from 303 English Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) across ten broad programmes of health care to derive estimates of the elasticity of expenditure in each programme with respect to the total income of the PCT. The results suggest quite similar income elasticities across most programmes, in the range 0.6441.128. The only outlier is the musculoskeletal programme with an elasticity of about 0.46. The modelling also derives estimates of spending elasticities with respect to medical needs and thereby permits calculation of the implicit cost of saving a life year in five programmes of care. The results are important as they indicate to policy makers how specific programme areas might be affected by general budgetary reductions.

Two classes of standard errors are analyzed. Both are based on nonparametric heteroskedasticity autocorrelation (HAC) covariance matrix estimators. The first class is based on averages of HAC estimators across individuals in the cross-section, i.e. averages of HACs. This class includes the well known cluster standard errors analyzed by Arellano (1987) as a special case. The second class is based on the HAC of cross-section averages and was proposed by Driscoll and Kraay (1998). The HAC of averages standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity, serial correlation and spatial correlation but weak dependence in the time dimension is required. The averages of HACs standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity and serial correlation including the nonstationary case but they are not valid in the presence of spatial correlation. The main contribution of the paper is to develop a fixed-b asymptotic theory for statistics based on both classes of standard errors in models with individual and possibly time fixed-effects dummy variables. The asymptotics is carried out for large time sample sizes for both fixed and large cross-section sample sizes. Extensive simulations show that the fixed-b approximation is usually much better than the traditional normal or chi-square approximation especially for the Driscoll-Kraay standard errors. The use of fixed-b critical values will lead to more reliable inference in practice especially for tests of joint hypotheses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The qualitative stage identified attributes perceived important through focus groups with 84 pain sufferers and semistructured interviews with 11 physicians. The quantitative stage included online, discrete choice experiments (DCEs) in which respondents chose between hypothetical profiles or an opt-out in 15 choice tasks. The profile descriptions were based on the attributes elicited in the qualitative stage. DCEs were conducted for pain sufferers (N = 242) and physicians (N = 270) who passed a rationality test. Main-effects models were estimated by hierarchical Bayesian regression. Sufferers ranked nausea, pain impact, energy, alertness, and constipation; physicians ranked pain response, central nervous system (CNS) effects, nausea, dose form, and constipation in descending order of importance. Sufferers were unwilling to incur severe side effects to decrease pain and chose the opt-out in approximately one half of the choice tasks, whereas physicians were willing to trade between profiles. The models predicted physicians' choices better than those of pain sufferers. No age, sex, or country effects were seen, but stronger preferences were found among physicians treating noncancer (n = 40) than cancer pain and among the 55% of sufferers who had never discontinued long-term pain medication use. Sufferers' mean pain scores on an 11-point Likert scale were 4.0, 5.7, and 8.6 on their best, average, and worst days, respectively.","[Chancellor, Jeremy] i3 Innovus, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Liedgens, Hiltrud] Grunenthal GmbH, Aachen, Germany; [Baker, Mary G.] European Federat Neurol Assoc, Helensburgh, England; [Mueller-Schwefe, Gerhard H.

The implications of unanticipated shifts for forecasting, economic analyses of efficient markets, conditional expectations, and inter-temporal derivations are described. The potential success of general-to-specific model selection in tackling location shifts by impulse-indicator saturation is contrasted with the major difficulties confronting forecasting.

A 12-month clinical trial in 834 patients with moderate BA investigated whether etanercept 50 mg/wk could be reduced to half dose or discontinued in patients who achieved low disease activity after 36 weeks. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the three maintenance strategies. Methods: A Markov model integrated the three strategies from the clinical trial and extrapolated to 10 years using data from the Swedish RA registry. Assumed treatment strategies after the trial were similar in all three arms, with patients failing to maintain remission on half-dose etanercept or methotrexate alone switching to the full dose of etanercept and patients maintaining remission on full-dose etanercept allowed switching to half dose. Resource use and utilities were taken from an observational study. Results are presented as cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (both discounted 3%) in the societal perspective. Results: The cost/QALY gained with half-dose etanercept versus methotrexate ranged from (sic)14,000 to (sic)29,000: Longer simulations result in a higher cost/QALY, as the acquisition cost of etanercept increases. Half-dose etanercept technically dominates the full dose (lower costs [(sic)-3000 to 6300] and similar effectiveness [0.007-0.011]). Conclusions: Although ultimately all three strategies explored achieve a similar outcome as all three continuously manage patients to maintain remission, it appears that a dose reduction is the most advantageous strategy in patients with moderate disease activity.","[Kobelt, Gisela] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Kobelt, Gisela] European Hlth Econ, F-68200 Mulhouse, France",Lund University,"Kobelt, G (通讯作者)，European Hlth Econ, Parc Collines 15 Rue Victor Schoelcher, F-68200 Mulhouse, France.",Gisela.Kobelt@he-europe.com,,,"Pfizer, Inc.","Pfizer, Inc.(Pfizer)","Source of financial support: The study was sponsored by Pfizer, Inc., to European Health Economics.",,23,19,20,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2014,17,5.0,,,,,537,544,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.04.005,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1PE,25128046.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341084700007,0

I use child-level data from 39 African countries during 1986-2010 to show that PSP decreases diarrhea among urban-dwelling, under-five children by 2.6 percentage points, or 16% of its mean prevalence. Children from the poorest households benefit most. PSP is also associated with a 7.8 percentage point increase in school attendance of 7-17 year olds. Importantly, PSP increases usage of piped water by 9.7 percentage points, suggesting a possible causal channel explaining health improvements. To attribute causality, I exploit time-variation in the private water market share controlled by African countries' former colonizers. A placebo analysis reveals that PSP does not affect respiratory illness, nor does it affect a control group of rural children. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

The use of cross-sectional data to make such estimates is widespread in the literature, being less expensive and easier to collect than repeated-measures data. However, analysis of this dataset suggests that cross-sectional analysis could produce biased estimates of the effect of complications on QoL. Using fixed effects estimators, we show that variation in the quality of life between patients is strongly influenced by time-invariant patient characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of studying quality-of-life changes over time to distinguish between time-invariant determinants of QoL and the effect on QoL of specific events such as diabetes complications.

When all indivisible goods are homogeneous, it holds, called non-simultaneous multiplicity, that if there are multiple competitive prices, the equilibrium quantity supplied is unique; equivalently, if there are multiple equilibrium quantities, the competitive price is unique. We show that even if we allow commodity differentiation, the non-simultaneous multiplicity holds separately for each type of an indivisible good. Based on this result, we can evaluate the sizes of the sets of competitive prices and quantities for each good. As an application, we give a sufficient condition for the set of competitive prices to shrink to a unique price when markets are large and dense. We also argue that it would be difficult to extend the non-simultaneous multiplicity result to a market model where each buyer may demand more than one unit of an indivisible good.

Despite this, no long-term predictive models have been developed for AML, mainly because of the complexities associated with this disease. Objective: The objective of the current study was to develop a model (based on a UK cohort) to predict cost and life expectancy at a population level. Methods: The model developed in this study combined a decision tree with several Markov models to reflect the complexity of the prognostic factors and treatments of AML. The model was simulated with a cycle length of 1 month for a time period of 5 years and further simulated until age 100 years or death. Results were compared for two age groups and five different initial treatment intents and responses. Transition probabilities, life expectancies, and costs were derived from a UK population-based specialist registry-the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (www.hmrn.org). Results: Overall, expected 5-year medical costs and life expectancy ranged from 8,170 to 81,636 and 3.03 to 34.74 months, respectively. The economic and health outcomes varied with initial treatment intent, age at diagnosis, trial participation, and study time horizon. The model was validated by using face, internal, and external validation methods. The results show that the model captured more than 90% of the empirical costs, and it demonstrated good fit with the empirical overall survival. Conclusions: Costs and life expectancy of AML varied with patient characteristics and initial treatment intent. The robust AML model developed in this study could be used to evaluate new diagnostic tools/treatments, as well as enable policy makers to make informed decisions.","[Wang, Han-I; Howell, Debra; Roman, Eve; Smith, Alexandra] Univ York, Epidemiol & Canc Stat Grp, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Aas, Eline] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Patmore, Russell] Castle Hill Hosp, Queens Ctr Oncol & Haematol, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Jack, Andrew] St James Univ Hosp, Haematol Malignancy Diagnost Serv, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of Oslo; University of Hull; Saint James's University Hospital,"Wang, HI (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, Epidemiol & Canc Stat Grp, Seebohm Rowntree Bldg Area 3, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",Han-I.Wang@ecsg.york.ac.uk,"Howell, Debra/P-3742-2018","Howell, Debra/0000-0002-7521-7402; Roman, Eve/0000-0001-7603-3704",Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research,Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research,"HMRN is funded by Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research.

At first, we point to cases in which financial support is actually counterproductive. Then we analyze whether in-kind transfers are preferable to lump-sum transfers.

Methods: A cohort of newly diagnosed cancer patients (n = 1,799) from the 1997-2007 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and a noncancer cohort (n = 9,726) were identified and matched by panel year. Two-year total medical care spending was estimated by using generalized linear models with gamma distribution and log link including endogeneity-corrected models. Interactions between cancer and type of insurance allowed testing for differential effects of a cancer diagnosis. Results: The cancer cohort spent an adjusted $15,605 more over 2 years than did the noncancer comparison group. Relative to those without supplemental coverage, beneficiaries with employer-sponsored insurance, other private with prescription drug coverage, and public coverage had significantly higher total spending ($3,510, $2,823, and $4,065, respectively, for main models). For beneficiaries with cancer, supplemental insurance effects were similar in magnitude yet negative, suggesting little net effect of supplemental insurance for cancer patients. The endogeneity-corrected models produced implausibly large main effects of supplemental insurance, but the Cancer x Insurance interactions were similar in both models. Conclusions: Medicare beneficiaries with cancer are less responsive to the presence and type of supplemental insurance than are beneficiaries without cancer. Proposed restrictions on the availability of supplemental insurance intended to reduce Medicare spending would be unlikely to limit expenditures by beneficiaries with cancer, but would shift the financial burden to those beneficiaries. Policymakers should consider welfare effects associated with coverage restrictions.","[Erten, Mujde Z.] Univ Vermont, Coll Med, Dept Surg, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Davidoff, Amy J.] Agcy Healthcare Res & Qual, Rockville, MD USA; [Zuckerman, Ilene H.; Shaffer, Thomas; Stuart, Bruce] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Peter Lamy Ctr Drug Therapy & Aging, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Zuckerman, Ilene H.; Shaffer, Thomas; Ke, Xuehua; Stuart, Bruce] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Dougherty, J.

The main results of the paper show that, if the solution trajectories of the underlying replicator equation converge exponentially fast, then, with probability arbitrarily close to one, all the pathwise realizations of the reinforcement learning process will, from some time on, lie within an epsilon band of that solution. The paper improves upon results currently available in the literature by showing that a reinforcement learning process that has been running for some time and is found sufficiently close to a strict Nash equilibrium, will reach it with probability one.

Several variants of the instrument now exist, including versions with three and five levels of severity and one for respondents aged 8 to 14 years. From the outset, a demand for new language versions of the EQ-5D questionnaire meant that there was a need to implement standardized procedures, which ensured that such versions were produced following international recommendations for the cultural adaptation of patient-reported outcomes. The availability of new variants and formats of the instrument, such as telephone-administered or electronic formats, complicated the task of providing and controlling the quality of cultural adaptations. Although cultural adaptations of the instrument are widely used, the procedures currently used to produce them have not been widely disseminated. The present article therefore describes the evolution of the production of other language versions of the instrument from the earliest days of simultaneous production and translation of the EQ-5D questionnaire to the more recent, broader based strategy of version management We describe current adaptation procedures and innovations within those procedures. We also describe how version management is organized within the EuroQol Group, review aspects related to quality control, and provide an overview of the number of currently available language versions for each variant of the EQ-5D questionnaire: three level, five level, and youth versions. We conclude by discussing some of the relevant issues related to cultural adaptation for frequently used instruments such as the EQ-5D questionnaire.","[Rabin, Rosalind; Gudex, Claire; Herdman, Michael] EuroQol Vers Management Comm, Mataro, Spain; [Selai, Caroline] UCL, Inst Neurol, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Herdman, M (通讯作者)，Insight Consulting & Res, Cami Ral 266 2 7, Mataro 08301, Spain.",michael.herdman@insighter.com,"Herdman, Michael/AAI-7280-2020","Gudex, Claire/0000-0003-3881-9890",EuroQol Group,EuroQol Group,This study was supported by a research grant from the EuroQol Group.,,22,162,162,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN,2014,17,1.0,,,,,70,76,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.10.006,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,291RS,24438719.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329847500010,0

We compare the use of prescription drugs among beneficiaries subject to the coverage gap with usage among beneficiaries who are not exposed to it. We find that the coverage gap does, indeed, disrupt the use of prescription drugs among seniors with diabetes. But the declines in usage are modest and concentrated among higher cost, brand-name medications. Demand for high cost medications such as antipsychotics, antiasthmatics, and drugs of the central nervous system decline by 8-18% in the coverage gap, while use of lower cost medications with high generic penetration such as beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and antidepressants decline by 3-5% after reaching the gap. More importantly, lower adherence to medications is not associated with increases in medical service use. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To overcome computational constraints, we draw on ideas from the dynamic model averaging literature which achieve reductions in the computational burden through the use forgetting factors. We then extend the TVP-VAR so that its dimension can change over time. For instance, we can have a large TVP-VAR as the forecasting model at some points in time, but a smaller TVP-VAR at others. A final extension lies in the development of a new method for estimating, in a time-varying manner, the parameter(s) of the shrinkage priors commonly-used with large VARs. These extensions are operationalized through the use of forgetting factor methods and are, thus, computationally simple. An empirical application involving forecasting inflation, real output and interest rates demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of our approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Barbos, A",,,,"Barbos, Andrei",,,Project screening with tiered evaluation,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"We study a Bayesian game of two-sided incomplete information in which an agent, who owns a project of unknown quality, considers proposing it to an evaluator, who has the choice of whether or not to accept it. There exist two distinct tiers of evaluation that differ in the benefits they deliver to the agent upon acceptance of a project. The agent has to select the tier to which the project is submitted for review. Making a proposal incurs a cost on the agent in the form of a submission cost. We examine the effect of changes in the payoff parameters at the two tiers of evaluation on the efficiency of the equilibrium outcome. We show that changes in these parameters that are aimed at increasing the level of self-screening exerted by the agent do not necessarily have beneficial effects either on the quality of projects submitted for review or on the quality of projects that are implemented. From a methodological viewpoint, our paper proposes a novel method of performing comparative statics in games whose equilibria are defined by a system of equations with no closed-form solution.

Two properties of evolutionary processes are introduced: rationalizability by a fitness ordering (i.e. only the most fit types survive) and interactivity (i.e. a withdrawal of types affects the survival of other types). Those properties are shown to be logically incompatible. We then examine whether the evolutionary processes at work in canonical evolutionary OLG models satisfy rationalizability or interactivity. We study n-type version of the evolutionary OLG models of Galor and Moav (2002) and Bisin and Verdier (2001), and show that, while the evolutionary process at work in the former is generally rationalizable by a fitness ordering, the opposite is true for the latter, which exhibits, in general, interactivity.

Investment incentives depend on search frictions because both parties in a match are partially locked-in when they bargain over the joint surplus from their sunk investments.

We introduce a new concept of weak consistency, a generalization of acyclicity, as an immediate regret condition for variable preferences. The main result to establish is on an existence criterion for maximal elements of a space equipped with a weakly consistent variable preference relation. It is expressed via a preference completeness condition which is equivalent to existence of aspiration points. As applications, we show that a number of results known in the recent literature on maximum principles on a space with or without topological structure can be obtained from the unifying approach of this paper. Habit formation and state functions are also discussed in the framework of variable preference relations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that the literature has been unnecessarily restrictive in assuming that health is always at the optimal' health level. Exploring the properties of corner solutions, we find that advances in population health decrease the retirement age, whereas at the same time, individuals retire when their health has deteriorated. This potentially explains why retirees point to deteriorating health as an important reason for early retirement, whereas retirement ages have continued to fall in the developed world, despite continued improvements in population health and mortality. In our model, workers with higher human capital invest more in health and, because they stay healthier, retire later than those with lower human capital whose health deteriorates faster.

We show how damage can be apportioned on two distinct bases: causation and degree of misconduct. Our analysis uses the concept of potential damage on the basis of which we define a transferable utility game. Its core defines acceptable judgments as allocations of the total damage against which no group of tortfeasors can object. We show that weighted Shapley values define acceptable judgments and, vice versa, acceptable judgments reveal weights. Our paper illustrates how the cooperative approach may bring useful insights into legal questions. In particular, the Shapley value appears of special interest, being founded on axioms that are in line with fundamental principles of tort law. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our main objective was to explore the influence of intangible impacts of caring on both informal caregivers' ability to estimate their willingness to pay (WTP) to be replaced and their WTP value. Methods: We mapped characteristics that influence ability or inability to estimate WTP by using a multiple correspondence analysis. We ran a bivariate probit model with sample selection to further analyze the caregivers' WTP value conditional on their ability to estimate their WTP. Results: A distinction exists between the opportunity costs of the caring dimension and those of the intangible costs and benefits of caring. Informal caregivers' ability to estimate WTP is negatively influenced by both intangible benefits from caring (P < 0.001) and negative intangible impacts of caring (P < 0.05). Caregivers' WTP value is negatively associated with positive intangible impacts of informal care (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Informal caregivers' WTP and their ability to estimate WTP are both influenced by intangible burden and benefit of caring. These results call into question the relevance of a hypothetical generalized financial compensation system as the optimal way to motivate caregivers to continue providing care.","[Gerves, Chloe; Bellanger, Martine Marie] EHESP SHSC, F-35012 Rennes, France; [Gerves, Chloe; Ankri, Joel] Hop St Perrine, Lab Sante Environm Vieillissement, F-75016 Paris, France",Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Sainte-Perine - APHP,"Gervès, C (通讯作者)，EHESP SHSC, Ave Prof Leon Bernard CS 74312, F-35043 Rennes, France.",chloe.gerves@ehesp.fr,,"Gerves-Pinquie, Chloe/0000-0002-2719-9801; Ankri, Joel/0000-0002-0070-6471; Bellanger, Martine/0000-0002-1892-8961",,,,,96,16,19,0,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2013,16,5.0,,,,,745,754,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.03.1629,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CL,23947967.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325466600007,0

The analysis shows that the introduction of managerial incentives reduces a firm's incentive to form a coalition. Moreover, a firm that belongs to a coalition has an increased managerial incentive (i.e., it becomes more sales-oriented) as its coalition becomes larger. However, in equilibrium, because of externalities generated from the coalition structure and product market competition, the managerial incentive of a firm in a large coalition can be greater than that of a firm in a grand coalition, while the managerial incentive of a firm in a small coalition can be less than that of a firm under stand-alone production.

The purpose of this study was to determine the acceptability of the proposed set of QIs among stakeholders of the childhood cancer system. Methods: A modified Delphi method was used to assess stakeholder agreement on the value of the proposed QIs. A QI evaluation survey was mailed to a stakeholder group of 23 multidisciplinary health care providers, survivors, parents, and policymakers who rated each QI on specific criteria. Prior to an in-person consensus meeting, the distribution of scores was provided to panel members. At the meeting, QIs were reevaluated and discussed in three successive rounds. QIs with 80% or more of panel agreement were considered endorsed. Results: Overall, 20 QIs were endorsed by the panel, measuring all seven quality dimensions of Ontario's Cancer System Quality Index framework. Five QIs were endorsed by 100% of the panel as follows: Five-year event-free survival, chemotherapy admission delay, drug availability, sufficient multidisciplinary staff, and parent satisfaction. Although none of the QIs relating to end-of-life or Satellite care were endorsed, panel members emphasized the need to measure these components of the system. Conclusions: Standardized implementation of the 20 pediatric cancer QIs endorsed by the multidisciplinary stakeholder panel will provide ongoing monitoring of various dimensions of system quality and the development of benchmarks over time, greatly augmenting the ability to identify needed system improvements across populations and jurisdictions.","[Bradley, Nicole M.

Clinical trial managers are increasingly using ePRO data collection for PRO-based end points. Regulatory review dictates the rules to follow with ePRO data collection for medical label claims. A critical component for regulatory compliance is evidence of the validation of these electronic data collection systems. Validation of electronic systems is a process versus a focused activity that finishes at a single point in time. Eight steps need to be described and undertaken to qualify the validation of the data collection software in its target environment: requirements definition, design, coding, testing, tracing, user acceptance testing, installation and configuration, and decommissioning. These elements are consistent with recent regulatory guidance for systems validation. This report was written to explain how the validation process works for sponsors, trial teams, and other users of electronic data collection devices responsible for verifying the quality of the data entered into relational databases from such devices. It is a guide on the requirements and documentation needed from a data collection systems provider to demonstrate systems validation. It is a practical source of information for study teams to ensure that ePRO providers are using system validation and implementation processes that will ensure the systems and services: operate reliably when in practical use; produce accurate and complete data and data files; support management control and comply with any existing regulations. Furthermore, this short report will increase user understanding of the requirements for a technology review leading to more informed and balanced recommendations or decisions on electronic data collection methods.","[Zbrozek, Arthur] CSL Behring, Global Hlth Econ, Biotherapies Life, King Of Prussia, PA USA; [Hebert, Joy] PHT Corp, Boston, MA USA; [Gogates, Gregory] CRF Hlth, Plymouth Meeting, PA USA; [Thorell, Rod] PHT Corp, Charlestown, MA USA; [Dell, Christopher] ERT, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Molsen, Elizabeth] ISPOR, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Craig, Gretchen] ERT Inc, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Grice, Kenneth] Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceut Inc, Global Elect Data Capture, Montville, NJ USA; [Hines, Sheldon] ICON Late Phase & Outcomes Res, Durham, NC USA",CSL; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; ICON plc,"Molsen, E (通讯作者)，ISPOR, Sci & Hlth Policy Initiat, Lawrenceville, NJ USA.",emolsen@ispor.org,,,,,,,20,48,50,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,480,489,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.04.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796281.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900006,0

As regression estimates from individual WTP studies are often assumed to transfer across populations it also provides an opportunity to question this practice. Using a qualitative review and meta analytic methods, this article determines what has been studied and how, provides a summary mean WTP by type of intervention, considers how and why WTP estimates vary and advises on future reporting of WTP studies. WTP has been elicited mostly for insecticide-treated nets, followed by drugs for treatment. Mean WTP, including zeros, is US$2.79 for insecticide-treated nets, US$6.65 for treatment and US$2.60 for other preventive services. Controlling for a limited number of sample and design effects, results can be transferred to different countries using the value function. The main concerns are the need to account for a broader range of explanators that are study specific and the ability to transfer results into malaria contexts beyond those represented by the data. Future studies need to improve the reporting of WTP.

Methods: Individual patient data and evidence from published literature on disease progression, economic costs and THR outcomes in OA, including utilities, perioperative mortality rates, prosthesis survival, and costs of prostheses, THR, rehabilitation, follow-up, revision, and nonsurgical management, combined with population life tables, were synthesized in a Markov model of OA. The model represents the lifetime experience of a patient cohort following their treatment choice, discounting costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life-years) at 3% annually. Results: At age 65 years, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of THR over delayed THR was (sic)987 in men and (sic)466 in women; the figures for delayed THR versus medical therapy were (sic)463 and (sic)82, respectively. Among 80-year-olds, early THR is (extended) dominant. With gradual utility loss after primary THR, delaying surgery may be more appealing in women than in men in their 505, because longer female life expectancy implies longer latter periods of low health-related quality of life (HRQOL) with early THR. Conclusions: THR is cost-effective. Patients' HRQOL benefits forgone with delayed THR are worth more than the costs it saves to the Italian National Health Service. This analysis might help to explain women's consistently lower HRQOL by the time of primary operation.","[Mota, Ruben Ernesto Mujica] Univ Exeter, Inst Hlth Serv Res, Sch Med, Room 104A,Veysey Bldg,Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Mota, Ruben Ernesto Mujica] European Hlth Technol Inst Socioecon Res EHTI, Brussels, Belgium",University of Exeter,"Mota, REM (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Inst Hlth Serv Res, Sch Med, Room 104A,Veysey Bldg,Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England.",R.E.Mujica-Mota@exeter.ac.uk,,"Mujica-Mota, Ruben/0000-0002-7430-2744",,,,,70,36,39,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2013,16,2.0,,,,,267,279,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.10.020,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,144AC,23538178.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318910400006,0

Conventionally, the usual approach of economists has been to recommend choices on the basis of cost effectiveness of treatments, using metrics such as the cost per quality adjusted life year. However, this approach is based on the assumption of health maximization subject to a budget constraint and ignores the potential impact of any additional concern with protecting individuals from the financial consequences of a health shock. Furthermore, it does not take account of the possible availability of complementary privately funded health care. This paper develops a model in which risk-averse individuals care about health but also place a value on protection from the financial consequences of rare but costly events. The paper shows how conventional cost-effectiveness analysis can readily be augmented to take account of financial protection objectives. The results depend on whether or not there exists a market in complementary privately funded health care. They have important implications for the methodology adopted by health technology assessment agencies and for the broader design of publicly funded health systems.

Such broader nonhealth outcomes are usually neglected in economic evaluation studies. To allow for their consideration, insights are needed into the types of nonhealth outcomes that HP interventions produce and their relative importance compared with health outcomes. This study explored consumer preferences for health and nonhealth outcomes of HP in the context of lifestyle behavior change. Methods: A discrete choice experiment was conducted among participants in a lifestyle intervention (n = 132) and controls (n = 141). Respondents made 16 binary choices between situations that can be experienced after lifestyle behavior change. The situations were described by 10 attributes: future health state value, start point of future health state, life expectancy, clothing size above ideal, days with sufficient relaxation, endurance, experienced control over lifestyle choices, lifestyle improvement of partner and/or children, monetary cost per month, and time cost per week. Results: With the exception of time cost per week and start point of future health state, all attributes significantly determined consumer choices. Thus, both health and nonhealth outcomes affected consumer choice. Marginal rates of substitution between the price attribute and the other attributes revealed that the attributes endurance, days with sufficient relaxation, and future health state value had the greatest impact on consumer choices. The life expectancy attribute had a relatively low impact and for increases of less than 3 years, respondents were not willing to trade. Conclusions: Health outcomes and nonhealth outcomes of lifestyle behavior change were both important to consumers in this study. Decision makers should respond to consumer preferences and consider nonhealth outcomes when deciding about HP interventions.","[Alayli-Goebbels, Adrienne F. G.; Ament, Andre J. H.

Cloud computing technology can reduce efforts and funds for IT system development and maintenance. Could computing can be classified into two categories; one is public cloud that is open to other people and IT systems, and another is private cloud that is close to other people and guarantee private data maintenance and security. If cloud computing technology would be adapted to e-learning environment, then it could reduce IT system investment for e-learning and more various e-learning services could be developed and maintained. Especially several years ago, mobile learning and smart learning mean huge IT system investment and need long term plan for development. But, based on cloud computing technology, development price of mobile learning environment can get lower and lower, and within short time, mobile learning services and smart learning services could be supported. In this paper, we design hybrid cloud learning platform that can combine private cloud and public cloud. In order to combine private cloud and public cloud, we propose hybrid cloud server that cloud learning portal supports. And we propose cloud learning architecture that can classify private cloud services and public cloud services. Hybrid learning cloud platform can be easily adapted to legacy e-learning IT systems. In the hybrid learning cloud, cheap mobile learning services and smart learning services are possible and more interactions between teachers and learners. Thus, hybrid learning cloud platform will be fit for underdeveloped countries and small-sized university.","[Chung, Kwang Sik] Korea Natl Open Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Seoul 110791, South Korea; [Huang, Wen-Hao David] Univ Illinois, Dept Educ Policy Org & Leadership, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Korea National Open University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Chung, KS (通讯作者)，Korea Natl Open Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Seoul 110791, South Korea.",kchung0825@knou.ac.kr; wdhuang@illinois.edu,,,Korea National Open University Research Fund,Korea National Open University Research Fund,This research was supported by Korea National Open University Research Fund 2011.,,10,0,0,0,2,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-3900-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,12,,,,,,82,87,,,,,,6,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA9CM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339165700016,0

However, differential selection into for-profits and nonprofits can lead to biased estimates of the effect of ownership form. By using differential distance to the nearest nonprofit nursing home relative to the nearest for-profit nursing home, we mimic randomization of residents into more or less exposure to nonprofit homes when estimating the effects of ownership on quality of care. Using national Minimum Data Set assessments linked with Medicare claims, we use a national cohort of post-acute patients who were newly admitted to nursing homes within an 18-month period spanning January 1, 2004 and June 30, 2005. After instrumenting for ownership status, we found that post-acute patients in nonprofit facilities had fewer 30-day hospitalizations and greater improvement in mobility, pain, and functioning.

We take advantage of the randomized roll-out of Ecuador's cash transfer program to mothers to investigate how an exogenous increase in a woman's income affects domestic violence. We find that the effect of a cash transfer depends on a woman's education and on her education relative to her partner's. Our results show that for women with greater than primary school education a cash transfer significantly decreases psychological violence from her partner. For women with primary school education or less, however, the effect of a cash transfer depends on her education relative to her partner's. Specifically, the cash transfer significantly increases emotional violence in households where the woman's education is equal to or more than her partner's. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Forty-four (44) students as primary participants and seven (7) math teachers as secondary participants served as the respondents. In order to identify the conceptions of senior high school students in algebraic properties, research instruments were used such as questionnaires about demographic characteristics of the participants, four (4) tests, interview guide, field notes, observational checklists and audio/video camera recorder. This study used the combined qualitative - quantitative design. Quantitative data were used to determine the demographic profile of a participants, and to deal with the computational aspects of the results of the test and the test validation of conceptions on algebraic properties. Phenomenography was employed for the qualitative part of the study. A thorough investigation and analysis yielded the findings: primary and secondary participants showed common patterns of misconceptions in algebraic properties such as: 1) misunderstanding of the definition of algebraic properties, invalid distribution of the exponent and / or variables due to the misuse of definitions of algebraic properties, particularly the distributive property of multiplication over addition; 2) misreading and unfamiliarity of terms of the concepts in algebraic properties; and 3) misuse of parentheses. The common factors identified by the primary participants that may cause their misconceptions on algebraic properties are their teachers (secondary-participants) in algebra because of inadequate ideas/knowledge in teaching algebraic properties since their field of specialization is not mathematics. However, the math teachers of the students primarily blamed the textbooks and curriculum, barkadas (peers) and family as the causes that lead to students' misconceptions which also the reason of having poor performance in algebra or mathematics in general.","[Mangorsi, Solaiman B.] Mindanao State Univ, Preuniv Ctr, Marawi City 9700, Philippines",Mindanao State University System; Mindanao State University-Main,,sdmangorsi@yahoo.com.ph,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-3900-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,12,,,,,,722,726,,,,,,5,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA9CM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339165700139,0

In this paper, we look at the optimal levels of LTC insurance and of informal care, and at the link between these two decisions when the child, who provides informal care, is also the decision-maker with regard to LTC insurance. Interestingly, results differ depending on the degree of both parental and child altruism and indicate either complementarity or substitutability between insurance and informal care. In particular, we show in the presence of child altruism that insurance stimulates the offer of informal care, contrary to the case where the insurance decision is made by the elderly parent. We also investigate how exogenous shocks with respect to the opportunity cost of informal care, initial wealth levels and bequests modify simultaneously the optimal level of insurance and informal care.

There is increasing interest in its potential for application in adolescents, and previous research has demonstrated that it shows good construct validity here. This article further examines its practicality and validity in adolescents by comparing it with KIDSCREEN-10, a short generic measure for assessing children and adolescents' health-related quality of life and wellbeing. Methods: A Web-based survey, including the CHU9D, a general health question, questions on the presence of long-standing illness, disability, or medical conditions, sociodemographic variables, and KIDSCREEN-10, was administered to 961 consenting adolescents. The practicality and face and construct validity of the CHU9D were examined, and the CHU9D and KIDSCREEN-10 were compared in terms of their coverage, correlations between dimensions, and overall scores. Results: Both measures demonstrated good practicality and validity. The strongest degree of correlation was found with the only dimension in common for the CHU9D and KIDSCREEN (sad). The lowest correlations were found between all the CHU9D dimensions and the have you had enough time for yourself dimension of KIDSCREEN-10. Conclusions: The findings from this study provide further support for the practicality and validity of the application of the CHU9D in the economic evaluation of adolescent health care and public health programs. Further research to test the psychometric performance of the CHU9D in more diverse clinical samples of adolescents is desirable including tests of reliability.","[Stevens, Katherine] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of Sheffield; Flinders University South Australia,"Stevens, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",K.Stevens@Sheffield.ac.uk,"Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017; Stevens, Katherine/E-4679-2010","Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988; Stevens, Katherine/0000-0002-9018-6413","Flinders University; Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee, Flinders University [4701]","Flinders University; Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee, Flinders University","Source of financial support: This study was supported by a Flinders University seeding grant.

When the restrictions are not numerous, the rescaled classical test statistics are asymptotically chi-squared, irrespective of whether there are many or few regressors. However, when the restrictions are numerous, standard asymptotic versions of classical tests are invalid. We propose and analyze asymptotically valid versions of the classical tests, including those that are robust to the numerosity of regressors and restrictions. The local power of all asymptotically valid tests under consideration turns out to be equal. The exact F test that appeals to critical values of the F distribution is also asymptotically valid and robust to the numerosity of regressors and restrictions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the commonly used local constant kernel estimation method leads to an inconsistent estimation result, while a local polynomial estimator yields a consistent estimation result. We establish the asymptotic normality result for the proposed estimator. We also provide asymptotic analysis of the data-driven (least squares cross validation) method of selecting the smoothing parameters. In addition, we consider a partially linear time trend model and establish the asymptotic distribution of our proposed estimator. Two test statistics are proposed to test the null hypotheses of a linear and of a partially linear time trend models.

We find that, for this theoretically NP-hard task, in practice the problems span three regimes: strong consensus, weak consensus, and no consensus. We make specific recommendations for each, and propose a computationally fast test to distinguish between the regimes. In spite of the great variety of algorithms, there are few classes that are consistently Pareto optimal. In the most interesting regime, the integer program exact formulation, local search algorithms and the approximate version of a theoretically exact branch and bound algorithm arise as strong contenders.

Methods: A semi-Markov approach was used to estimate time in each health state. The model was parameterized primarily by using data from a phase III randomized, open-label trial comparing bendamustine with chlorambucil. It captured the increased progression-free survival and improved response rates with bendamustine, and the cost and quality of life impacts of postprogression treatments. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales. A lifetime (35-year) time horizon was used. Deterministic sensitivity analyses, probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and subgroup analyses in older patients and patients with poor performance status were carried out. Results: The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 11,960 pound per quality-adjusted life-year. None of the deterministic sensitivity analyses increased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio by more than 2000 pound. Subgroup analyses showed that bendamustine remained cost-effective across different patient groups. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at the 20,000 pound threshold, bendamustine has a 90% probability of being cost-effective. Conclusions: Bendamustine represents good value for first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who are unsuitable for treatment with fludarabine combination chemotherapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is below the thresholds commonly applied in England and Wales (20,000- pound 30,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year).","[Dunlop, William] Mundipharma Int Ltd, Cambridge CB4 0GW, England; [Woods, Beth; Hawkins, Neil] Oxford Outcomes, Oxford, England; [O'Toole, Alison; Bramham-Jones, Steve] Napp Pharmaceut Ltd, Cambridge, England",,"Dunlop, W (通讯作者)，Mundipharma Int Ltd, Cambridge Sci Pk,Milton Rd, Cambridge CB4 0GW, England.",will.dunlop@mundipharma.co.uk,,"Woods, Bethan Sarah/0000-0002-7669-9415; Hawkins, Neil/0000-0003-3199-221X",Napp Pharmaceuticals Limited,Napp Pharmaceuticals Limited,This study was funded by Napp Pharmaceuticals Limited.,,36,19,19,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15,5.0,,,,,759,770,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.03.1389,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867787.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100021,0

Most arguments in describing the ramifications of a tax fail to consider demand interrelationships among various beverages. To circumvent this shortcoming we employ a variation of Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model. The consumption of isotonics, regular soft drinks and fruit drinks, the set of SSBs, is negatively impacted by the proposed tax, while the consumption of fruit juices, low-fat milk, coffee, and tea is positively affected. Diversion ratios are provided identifying where the volumes of the SSBs are directed as a result of the tax policy. The reduction in the body weight as a result of a 20% tax on SSBs is estimated to be between 1.54 and 2.55?lb per year. However, not considering demand interrelationships would result in higher weight loss. Unequivocally, it is necessary to consider interrelationships among non-alcoholic beverages in assessing the effect of the tax.

This approach relies on overlap in the descriptive systems of the measures and assumes it is appropriate to use different measures on the same population, which may not always be the case. This paper presents a feasibility study for a new approach to mapping between preference-based measures (PBM) using general population visual analogue scale (VAS) values as a common yardstick. We use data from a valuation study of 502 members of the UK general population, where, using ranking and VAS tasks, interviewees simultaneously valued health states defined by three of six PBM: EQ-5D (generic), SF-6D (generic), HUI2 (generic for children and adults), AQL-5D (asthma specific), OPUS (social care specific) and ICECAP (capabilities). Regression techniques are used to estimate the relationship between these VAS values and the original value set (i.e. tariff). These results are subsequently used to estimate the relationship between all six PBM to enable value-based mapping between measures. This new method of mapping potentially has a useful role in evidence synthesis and cross programme comparisons in studies using different measures.

Data: A total of 698 respondents from the Danish population and 969 GPs answered the questionnaire in May and September 2010. Methods: In a discrete choice experiment, GPs and patients made both forced and unforced choices, allowing us to explore the congruence of preferences 1) when patients must choose a new GP and 2) when they can stay with their current GP. Results: Results show that in the forced choice, preferences are seen to differ. In the unforced choice also, preferences differ-mainly because GPs overestimate their own importance to the patients. Rank orders, however, are similar for both GPs and patients. Conclusions: It is concluded that GPs do not have a precise knowledge of patients' preferences. However, in the unforced choice, GPs do know on which attributes to compete although they underestimate the necessity of competition. The overall conclusion is that there is room for improving the agency relationship in the organization of general practice.","[Pedersen, Line Bjornskov; Kjoer, Trine; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ So Denmark, Res Unit Hlth Econ, Inst Publ Hlth, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Pedersen, Line Bjornskov; Kragstrup, Jakob] Univ So Denmark, Res Unit Gen Practice, Inst Publ Hlth, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ Queensland, Australian Ctr Econ Res Hlth, Herston Q, Australia",University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; University of Queensland,"Pedersen, LB (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Res Unit Hlth Econ, Inst Publ Hlth, JB Winslowsvej 9B, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark.",lib@sam.sdu.dk,"Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/A-3161-2011","Pedersen, Line Bjornskov/0000-0001-6804-2045; Kjaer, Trine/0000-0002-9554-374X; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/0000-0003-1137-2304",,,,,54,24,24,0,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2012,15,3.0,,,,,514,523,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.01.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,941CN,22583462.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303940600015,0

Respondents were initially asked to value one of two severe health states by way of a time-trade-off (TTO) exercise. Subsequent to the TTO exercise all respondents were asked to value an intervention, which offered a reduction in risk of falling into the health state they had evaluated. All respondents were subsequent to this initial CV exercise asked to value the same risk reduction, but in this case the outcome was death. Although our study passes the internal scope test, there is not a high degree of sensitivity to outcome. As many as 68% of respondents stated an identical maximum WTP in first and second CV valuation exercise implying that they value the interventions equally despite the fact that the health state presented in the initial CV question was deemed far better than death according to the TTO responses given by the same respondents. In contrast, the external scope test (comparison of response to initial CV across study arms) fared much better. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Gyrd-Hansen, D.; Kjaer, T.; Nielsen, J.

Methods: A multicenter, non-randomized, prospective study was conducted with women undergoing treatment for uterine fibroids (fibroid treatment group [FTG]) and normal controls (normal control group [NCG]). Women in the FTG were recruited when they were scheduled for treatment; women in the NCG were recruited during their annual exam. Participants completed the UFS-QOL and a short form 36 health survey (SF-36) at enrollment and at 6 and 12 months. Descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha, Spearman's correlations, t tests, and general linear models were used to analyze the internal consistency and test-retest reliability, concurrent and discriminant validity, and responsiveness of the UFS-QOL. Results: There were 89 NCG and 234 FTG women who completed the study. Mean age was 43.1 years for FTG and 40.8 for NCG (P < 0.001). The FTG reported significantly greater symptom severity and worse health-related quality of life (HRQL) than the NCG (all UFS-QOL subscales P < 0.001). The UFS-QOL subscales were significantly correlated in the expected direction and magnitude with each SF-36 subscale in the FTG, indicating acceptable concurrent validity. Cronbach's alphas were 0.73 to 0.97, reflecting adequate internal consistency. Each UFS-QOL subscale was responsive to changes after treatment in the FTG with effect sizes ranging between 1.1 and -2.35. The UFS-QOL remained stable in the NCG during the 1 year follow-up. Conclusion: The UFS-QOL is a valid and reliable measure to assess symptoms and HRQL in women with uterine fibroids and is highly responsive to treatment-related changes.","[Coyne, Karin S.] United BioSource Corp, Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Bradley, Linda D.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Guido, Richard] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Maxwell, G.

Methods: A published and validated computer simulation model of diabetes (the Center for Outcomes Research model) was used to make the long-term (30 years) projection of health economic outcomes. Patient demographic information and clinical end points were derived from a subgroup analysis of the Predictable Results and Experience in Diabetes through Intensification and Control to Target: an International Variability Evaluation (PREDICTIVE) study. Baseline risk factors and racial characteristic data were obtained from Chinese cohort studies. The diabetes management and complications costs were obtained from Chinese published data and adjusted to 2010 values by using the Chinese consumer price index. An annual discounting rate of 3% was used for both health and cost outcomes, and one-way sensitivities analysis was performed, which illustrated that the results were robust. Results: Conversion to IDet from IGla was projected to improve patient life expectancy by 0.06 year and 0.48 quality-adjusted life-years. Drug costs and management costs of diabetes mellitus were increased by US$368 (US$17,466 vs. US$17,097) and US$31 (US$5464 vs. US$5433), respectively. However, the costs of complications, including cerebrovascular disease, renal complications, ulcer/amputation/neuropathy, eye complications, and hypoglycemia events, were reduced by US$ 819 (US$21,294 vs. US$22,114), resulting in a total direct medical cost saving of US$420 when converting to IDet. Conclusions: Conversion to IDet from an IGla regimen improved life expectancy and was a cost-saving treatment approach in a Chinese setting.","[Yang, Li] Peking Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Christensen, Torsten] Novo Nordisk AS, Virum, Denmark; [Sun, Fengyu; Chang, Jinghua] Novo Nordisk China Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Novo Nordisk; Novo Nordisk,"Yang, L (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 38 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",lyang@hsc.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,24,17,21,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S56,S59,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.018,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265068.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000010,0

There are great regional differences in Germany, in GP, specialist and psychotherapist consultations. By means of a regression model taking account of the spatial dependencies of the error terms, we can explain a considerable part of the variation in terms of differences in demography, health status and socio-economic features. In addition, we made use of data on pollutants, the supply of services and the number of hospital cases as explanatory variables, which all have a significant influence on utilisation but contribute considerably less to explaining the differences. Overall, we are in a position to explain 29-40% of the regional differences in ambulatory case numbers at the level of the 413 counties and 55-70% at the level of the 16 German states (Lander) by observable differences.

This study uses suicide as a measure of mental health and examines how suicides are affected by sex ratios. As women tend to marry men older than themselves, shrinking populations will lead to higher sex ratios (i.e., higher proportions of men) in the marriage market. Using data from Japan, I find that high sex ratios, both early-life and current, are correlated with higher male suicide rates, whereas female suicide rates are generally not affected.

We use repeated shocks to a profitable service in the market for hospital-based medical care to test for cross-subsidization of unprofitable services. Using patient-level data from general short-term hospitals in Arizona and Colorado before and after entry by cardiac specialty hospitals, we study how incumbent hospitals adjusted their provision of three uncontested services that are widely considered to be unprofitable. We estimate that the hospitals most exposed to entry reduced their provision of psychiatric, substance-abuse, and trauma care services at a rate of about one uncontested-service admission for every four cardiac admissions they stood to lose. Although entry by single-specialty hospitals may adversely affect the provision of unprofitable uncontested services, these findings warrant further evaluation of service-line cross-subsidization as a means to finance them.

Studies using DCEs have typically used the conditional logit to estimate the underlying utility function. The conditional logit is known for several limitations. In this paper, we propose two types of models based on the mixed logit: one using preference space and the other using quality-adjusted life year (QALY) space, a concept adapted from the willingness-to-pay literature. These methods are applied to a dataset collected using the EQ-5D. The results showcase the advantages of using QALY space and demonstrate that the preferred QALY space model provides lower estimates of the utility values than the conditional logit, with the divergence increasing with worsening health states.

This collaboration on improving European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) started in February 2010 and was performed over 2 years. As a result, the templates for preparing EPARs were revised to better address the needs of heath technology organizations. The better understanding of information needs was a key outcome of the collaboration. To ascertain whether these template changes led to the inclusion of relevant information, a review of a small set of EPARs for recently approved medicinal products was carried out in parallel by both the European network for Health Technology Assessment and the European medicines Agency. This report provides an account of this project on improving EPARs, which is part of the ongoing dialogue between regulators and health technology assessment bodies on a European level to support policymaker decisions in the future.","[Berntgen, Michael; Eichler, Hans-Georg] European Medicines Agcy, London E14 4HB, England; [Gourvil, Anne; Pavlovic, Mira] La Haute Autorite Sante, La Plaine St Denis, France; [Goettsch, Wim] Natl Hlth Care Inst, Diemen, Netherlands; [Kristensen, Finn Borlum] Danish Hlth & Medicines Author, EUnetHTA Secretariat, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Berntgen, M (通讯作者)，European Medicines Agcy, 7 Westferry Circus, London E14 4HB, England.",michael.berntgen@ema.europa.eu,,"Kristensen, Finn Boerlum/0000-0003-0263-0754",European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),"The EUnetHTA contribution to this article arises from the EUnetHTA Joint Action 1, which has received funding from the European Union, in the framework of the Health Programme.",,9,35,36,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2014,17,5.0,,,,,634,641,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.04.006,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1PE,25128058.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341084700019,0

Clinical guidelines recommend prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for patients receiving chemotherapy with a 20% or greater risk of febrile neutropenia. A discrete choice experiment was conducted to explore breast cancer patients preferences and willingness to pay (WTP for prophylactic G-CSF to decrease the risk of chemotherapy induced febrile neutropenia. Methods: An online discrete choice experiment questionnaire survey of a national US convenience sample of self reported breast cancer patients with prior chemotherapy treatment was conducted. Sixteen paired G-CSF treatment scenarios, each with four attributes (risk of disruption to chemotherapy schedule due to low white blood cell counts, risk of developing an infection requiring hospitalization, frequency of administration, and total out-of-pocket cost) were presented with a follow-up no treatment option. Participant preferences and WTP out of pocket were estimated by logistic regression. Results: Participants (n = 296) preferred G-CSF regimens with lower out-of-pocket costs, lower risk of chemotherapy disruption, lower risk of infection, and greater convenience (one G-CSF injection per chemotherapy cycle). Participants' WTP was $1076 out of pocket per cycle to reduce the risk (high to low) of disrupting their chemotherapy schedule, $884 per cycle to reduce the risk (24% [high] to 7% [low]) of infection, and $851 per cycle to decrease the number of G-CSF injections (11 to 1) per cycle. Conclusions: Participants highly valued specific features of prophylactic G-CSF treatment including maintaining their chemotherapy schedule, lowering their risk of infection, and reducing the number of injections. Physicians should consider patient preferences to inform the best treatment choices for individual patients.","[Johnson, Phaedra; Bancroft, Tim; Watkins, Angela] OptumInsight, Eden Prairie, MN 55344 USA; [Barron, Richard; Legg, Jason; Li, Xiaoyan; Watson, Holly] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Naeim, Arash] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada",Optum; Amgen; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Calgary,"Johnson, P (通讯作者)，OptumInsight, 12125 Technol Dr, Eden Prairie, MN 55344 USA.",phaedra.johnson@optum.com,"Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008","Amgen, Inc.","Amgen, Inc.(Amgen)","This study was supported by Amgen, Inc.",,50,26,26,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,380,389,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.01.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24968998.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900011,0

First, we show that employing the concept of diagonal transfer continuity in place of better-reply security might be advantageous when the existence of a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is concerned. Then, we study equilibrium existence in better-reply secure games possessing a payoff secure mixed extension. With the aid of an example, we show that such games need not have mixed strategy Nash equilibria. We provide geometric conditions for the mixed extension of a two-person game that is reciprocally upper semicontinuous and uniformly payoff secure to be better-reply secure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper analyzes the impact of health information technology (HIT) on the quality and intensity of medical care. Using Medicare claims data from 1998 to 2005, I estimate the effects of early investment in HIT by exploiting variation in hospitals' adoption statuses over time, analyzing 2.5 million inpatient admissions across 3900 hospitals. HIT is associated with a 1.3% increase in billed charges (p-value: 5.6%), and there is no evidence of cost savings even five years after adoption. Additionally, HIT adoption appears to have little impact on the quality of care, measured by patient mortality, adverse drug events, and readmission rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A dataset comprising the population of 10,000 care homes was used. We constructed distance/travel-time weighted competition measures. Instrumental variable estimations, used to account for the endogeneity of competition, showed quality and price were reduced by greater competition. Further analyses suggested that the negative quality effect worked through the effect on price - higher competition reduces revenue which pushes down quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the well-known inequality indices may not always be readily applicable to measure health inequality as it may result in the arbitrariness of the health concentration index's value. In this paper, we address this problem by changing the dimension in which the categorical information is used. We therefore exploit the multi-dimensionality of this information, define a new ratio-scale health status variable and develop positional stochastic dominance conditions that can be implemented in a context of categorical variables. We also propose a parametric class of population health and socioeconomic health inequality indices. Finally we provide a twofold empirical illustration using the Joint Canada/United States Surveys of Health 2004 and the National Health Interview Survey 2010. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

With administrative income tax return data, we show that the mandate has several distinct effects on taxpayers' behavior. First, despite the large tax penalty for not having PHI coverage relative to the cost of the cheapest eligible insurance policy, compliance with mandate is relatively low: the proportion of the population with PHI coverage increases by 6.5 percentage points (15.6%) at the income threshold where the tax penalty starts to apply. This effect is most pronounced for young taxpayers, while the middle aged seem to be least responsive to this specific tax incentive. Second, the discontinuous increase in the average tax rate at the income threshold created by the policy generates a strong incentive for tax avoidance which manifests itself through bunching in the taxable income distribution below the threshold. Finally, after imposing some plausible assumptions, we extrapolate the effect of the policy to other income levels and show that this policy has not had a significant impact on the overall demand for private health insurance in Australia.

In particular, we show that the model with superior diffusion function specification is always preferred to the competing model regardless of their drift specifications if Delta is sufficiently small relative to T.

Results from estimating several meta-regressions reveal that these price elasticity estimates are influenced by a number of study characteristics. For instance, the price elasticity differs across drugs, with its absolute value being smallest for marijuana, compared with cocaine and heroin. Furthermore, price elasticity estimates are sensitive to whether demand is modeled in the short-run or the long-run, measures of quantity and price, whether or not alcohol and other illicit drugs are included in the specification of demand, and the location of demand. However, a number of other factors, including the functional form of demand, several specification issues, the type of data and method used to estimate demand, and the quality of the publication outlet, have less influence on the price elasticity.

The resolution hinges on saturated spaces.

As such, the paper offers a complete characterization of a longstanding question, and offers another game-theoretic characterization of the saturation property, one that complements a recent result of Keisler-Sun (2009) on large non-anonymous games with complete information.

Khan acknowledges with pleasure a dinner conversation with the late Jean-Francois Mertens, sometime in November 1996, for his insistence that one attempt a complete characterization of the question of existence of equilibrium in game-theoretic settings where Loeb spaces work and Lebesgue spaces do not. The authors warmly thank Yeneng Sun for his comments on the proof of the necessity result, and Achile Basile, Maria Gabriella Graziano, Michael Greinecker, Paulo Klinger Monteiro, and Vincenzo Scalzo for their interest and encouragement. The result reported here was originally presented at the workshop on The Probabilistic Impulse behind Modern Economic Theory held by Institute for Mathematical Sciences, National University of Singapore during 11-18 January 2011; and more recently at the Fifth Lisbon Meetings in Game Theory and Applications on November 8, 2013, and at the Dipartimento di Scienze Economiche e Statistiche, Universita di Napoli Federico 11 on November 12, 2013.

Following Pesaran (2003), an optimal aggregate function is derived and used (i) to establish conditions under which Granger's (1980) conjecture regarding the long memory properties of aggregate variables from 'a very large scale dynamic, econometric model' holds, and (ii) to show which distributional features of micro parameters can be identified from the aggregate model. The paper also derives impulse response functions for the aggregate variables, distinguishing between the effects of composite macro and aggregated idiosyncratic shocks. Some of the findings of the paper are illustrated by Monte Carlo experiments. The paper also contains an empirical application to consumer price inflation in Germany, France and Italy, and re-examines the extent to which 'observed' inflation persistence at the aggregate level is due to aggregation and/or common unobserved factors. Our findings suggest that dynamic heterogeneity as well as persistent common factors are needed for explaining the observed persistence of the aggregate inflation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we disentangle the channels through which different factors affect the use of medical services, whether through perceived benefits and/or costs. We do this by exploiting data on why individuals have not visited a health care professional. Amongst a sample of impoverished Colombian households, we find that health knowledge reduces the use of medical services through decreasing mothers' perceived benefits of seeking professional care for ill children; birth parity, distance to health facilities and violent shocks all decrease medical care use due to increasing the perceived costs; and education decreases both the perceived benefits and costs, with no overall effect on use. We propose two specification tests, both of which our model passes, as well as a series of robustness checks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper implements a new decomposition approach using the China Health and Nutrition Survey (1991-2006) to examine the extent to which changes in level and distribution of incomes and in income mobility are related to health disparities between rich and poor. We find that health disparities in China relate to rising income inequality and in particular to the adverse health and income experience of older (wo)men, but not to the growth rate of average incomes over the last decades. These findings suggest that replacement incomes and pensions at older ages may be one of the most important policy levers for reducing health disparities between rich and poor Chinese.

Methods: This prospective study involved patients with breast cancer from the National Cancer Centre Singapore. The concurrent validity of the FACT-Cog was assessed according to its strength of correlation with the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire 30 cognitive functioning scale, and its association with fatigue, global health status, and anxiety. The known-group validity was assessed on the basis of receipt of chemotherapy. Factor analysis was conducted to ascertain the one-factor structure of each cognitive domain. The reliability was evaluated by using Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient within the cognitive domains. Multiple regression analyses were performed to compare the total scores between the two language versions, adjusting for covariates. Results: A total of 185 English-speaking and 143 Chinese speaking patients were recruited. Both the English and Chinese FACE-Cog total scores correlated strongly with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire 30 cognitive functioning scale scores (r = 0.725 and 0.646), whereas correlations with fatigue, anxiety, and global health status were weak to moderate (vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.376-0.589). Regarding the known-group validity, more severe perceived cognitive disturbance was observed among patients receiving chemotherapy than among those who were not for both versions (P = .010 and .008, respectively). Internal consistencies within the cognitive domains were high (Cronbach's a 0.707-0.929), and test-retest reliability was satisfactory for both versions (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.762 and 0.697). The measurement equivalence between the English and Chinese versions was established for all domains except the multitasking domain. Conclusion: The English and Chinese versions of the FACT-Cog are valid, reliable, and equivalent for clinical and research use","[Cheung, Yin Ting; Lim, Si Rong; Shwe, Maung; Chan, Alexandre] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Pharm, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Cheung, Yin Ting; Chan, Alexandre] Natl Canc Ctr Singapore, Dept Pharm, Singapore, Singapore; [Tan, Yee Pin] Natl Canc Ctr Singapore, Dept Psychosocial Oncol, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS); National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS),"Chan, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Pharm, 18 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore.",phaac@nus.edu.sg,"Cheung, Yin Ting/AAT-4384-2021; Cheung, Yin Ting/N-3524-2017; Chan, Alexandre/D-5035-2016","Cheung, Yin Ting/0000-0001-9874-8938; Chan, Alexandre/0000-0003-4391-4219",National University of Singapore [R-148-000-166-112]; National Cancer Centre Singapore [NRFCB12131],National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore); National Cancer Centre Singapore,Source of financial support: This study was financed by research grants awarded by the National University of Singapore (R-148-000-166-112) and the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NRFCB12131).,,70,64,75,2,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,1001,1013,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.017,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041350.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700011,0

In contrast to the parametric literature the return distribution can display general forms of asymmetry and thick tails. An infinite mixture of multivariate normals is given a flexible Dirichlet process prior. The GARCH functional form enters into each of the components of this mixture. We discuss conjugate methods that allow for scale mixtures and nonconjugate methods which provide mixing over both the location and scale of the normal components. MCMC methods are introduced for posterior simulation and computation of the predictive density. Bayes factors and density forecasts with comparisons to GARCH models with Student-t innovations demonstrate the gains from our flexible modeling approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

IRFs could respond to the PPS by changing the number of patients admitted, admitting different types of patients, or changing the intensity of care. We use Medicare claims data to separately estimate each type of provider response. We also examine changes in patient outcomes and spillover effects on other post-acute care providers. We find that costs of care initially fell following the PPS, which we attribute to changes in treatment decisions rather than the characteristics of patients admitted to IRFs within the diagnostic categories we examine. However, the probability of admission to IRFs increased after the PPS due to the expanded admission policies of providers. We find modest spillover effects in other post-acute settings and negative health impacts for only one of three diagnostic groups studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze the role of demographic changes in the economic development process by studying the transitional and the long-run impact of both the rate of population growth and the initial population size on the levels of per capita human capital and income. We do that in an enlarged Lucas-Uzawa model with intergenerational altruism. In contrast to the existing theoretical literature, the long-run level effects of demographic changes, i.e. their impact on the levels of the variables along the balanced growth path, are deeply characterized in addition to the more standard long-run growth effects. We prove that the level effect of the population rate of growth is non-negative (positive in the empirically most relevant case) for the average level of human capital, but a priori ambiguous for the level of per capita income due to the interaction of three transmission mechanisms of demographic shocks, a standard one (dilution) and two non-standard (altruism and human capital accumulation). Overall, the sign of the level effects of population growth depends on preference and technology parameters, but numerically we show that the joint negative effect of dilution and altruism is always stronger than the induced positive human capital effect. The growth effect of population growth depends basically on the attitude to intergenerational altruism and intertemporal substitution. Moreover, we also prove that the long-run level effects of population size on per capita human capital and income may be negative, nil, or positive, depending on the relationship between preferences and technology, while its growth effect is zero. Finally, we show that the model is able to replicate complicated time relationships between economic and demographic changes. In particular, it entails a negative effect of population growth on per capita income, which dominates in the initial periods, and a positive effect which restores a positive correlation between population growth and economic performance in the long term.

We characterise the conditions under which out-of-equilibrium trading converges to efficient allocations when agents are myopic, have limited information and incur utility losses relative to current holdings by engaging in (bounded) experimentation. We show, numerically, that the rate of convergence to efficient allocations is exponential across a variety of different settings where agents' preferences can be represented by a Cobb-Douglas utility function. Finally the results are generalised to explicit exchange networks. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Background: The PLATO trial showed that ticagrelor was superior to clopidogrel for the prevention of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in a broad population of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Methods: HRQOL in the PLATO study was measured at hospital discharge, 6-month visit, and end of treatment (anticipated at 12 months) by using the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire. All patients who had an EQ-5D questionnaire assessment at discharge from the index hospitalization (n = 15,212) were included in the study. Patients who died prior to the end-of-treatment visit were assigned an EQ-5D questionnaire value of 0. Results: The EQ-5D questionnaire value at discharge among 7631 patients assigned to ticagrelor was 0.847 and among 7581 patients assigned to clopidogrel was 0.846 (P = 0.71). At 12 months, the mean EQ-5D questionnaire value was 0.840 for ticagrelor and 0.832 for clopidogrel (P = 0.046). Excluding patients who died resulted in mean EQ-5D questionnaire values of 0.864 among ticagrelor patients and 0.863 among clopidogrel patients (P = 0.69). Conclusions: In patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes with or without ST-segment elevation, treatment with ticagrelor was associated with a lower mortality but otherwise no difference in quality of life relative to treatment with clopidogrel. The improved survival and reduction in cardiovascular events with ticagrelor are therefore obtained with no loss in quality of life.","[Levin, Lars-Ake; Bernfort, Lars; Andersson, David; Janzon, Magnus] Linkoping Univ, Dept Med & Hlth Serv, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Wallentin, Lars] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala Clin Res Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden; [Storey, Robert F.] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Bergstrom, Gina; Lamm, Carl-Johan] AstraZeneca R&D, Molndal, Sweden; [Janzon, Magnus] Cty Council Ostergotland, Dept Cardiol UHL, Linkoping, Sweden; [Kaul, Padma] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Linkoping University; Uppsala University; University of Sheffield; AstraZeneca; City Council Ostergotland; University of Alberta,"Levin, LÅ (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Med & Hlth Serv, Div Hlth Care Anal, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",lars-ake.levin@liu.se,"Storey, Robert/AAA-6853-2019","Storey, Robert/0000-0002-6677-6229; Kaul, Padma/0000-0003-2239-3944",AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),This study was supported by AstraZeneca.,,23,22,23,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,574,580,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.01.013,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796291.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900016,0

Specifically, we consider estimator criterion functions that are sample averages and are smooth functions of a parameter theta. This includes log likelihood, quasi-log likelihood, and least squares criterion functions. We determine the asymptotic distributions of estimators under lack of identification and under weak, semi-strong, and strong identification. We determine the asymptotic size (in a uniform sense) of standard t and quasi-likelihood ratio (QLR) tests and CSs. We provide methods of constructing QLR tests and CSs that are robust to the strength of identification. The results are applied to two examples: a nonlinear binary choice model and the smooth transition threshold autoregressive (STAR) model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It relies on an empirical test proposed by Hartwig (2008) and extended by Colombier (2010) and uses a panel data set of 50 states over the 1980-2009 period. The results suggest that health care costs grow more rapidly when economy-wide wage increases exceed productivity gains. The findings are fairly robust with respect to time- and state-fixed effects, individual state time trends, and two-stage least square estimation. Consequently, this study suggests that the U.S. health care sector suffers from Baumol's cost disease. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A cohort of 209,650 patients aged 40 to 79 years resident in the Italian Region of Lombardia and newly treated with BP-lowering drugs during 2000 to 2001 was followed from index prescription to 2007. During the follow-up, the 10,688 patients who experienced a hospitalization for a coronary or cerebrovascular event were identified (outcome). Adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered by the therapy with BP-lowering drugs. The cost-effectiveness of enhancing adherence was measured through the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: Enhancing adherence from 52% (baseline) to 60% and 80% led to a reduced rate for CV outcomes (from 85 to 83 and 77 events every 10,000 person-year, respectively) and increased the cost for drug therapy (from (sic)1,325k to (sic)1,507k and (sic)1,934k every 10,000 person-year, respectively). The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreased from (sic)76k (95% confidence interval (sic)74k-(sic)77k) to (sic)74k (95% confidence interval (sic)72k-(sic)75k) for each CV event avoided by enhancing adherence from baseline to 60% and 80%, respectively. Conclusions: Enhancing adherence to BP-lowering medications in the setting of primary CV prevention might offer important benefits in reducing the risk of CV outcome, but at a substantial cost.","[Scotti, Lorenza; Baio, Gianluca; Corrao, Giovanni] Univ Milano Bicocca, Unit Biostat Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Merlino, Luca] Lombardia Reg Council, Operat Unit Terr Hlth Serv, Milan, Italy; [Cesana, Giancarlo; Mancia, Giuseppe] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Clin & Prevent Med, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Mancia, Giuseppe] Osped San Gerardo, Med Clin, Monza, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Milano-Bicocca; San Gerardo Hospital,"Corrao, G (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Unit Biostat & Epidemiol, Dept Stat, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",giovanni.corrao@unimib.it,"Scotti, Lorenza/AAB-9544-2019; Baio, Gianluca/A-2947-2012","Scotti, Lorenza/0000-0002-3861-9058; Baio, Gianluca/0000-0003-4314-2570; MERLINO, Luca Giuseppe/0000-0001-9232-9994",Italian Minister for University and Research (Fondo d'Ateneo per la Ricerca),Italian Minister for University and Research (Fondo d'Ateneo per la Ricerca),"This study was funded by grants from the Italian Minister for University and Research (Fondo d'Ateneo per la Ricerca portion, year 2009).",,40,13,14,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2013,16,2.0,,,,,318,324,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.11.008,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,144AC,23538184.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318910400012,0

In the health capital framework of Grossman (JPE, 1972), we derive the testable hypotheses that individuals adjust their diet in a healthier direction upon receiving negative health information, and that the effect is greater for richer individuals. Based on unique Chinese longitudinal data and a regression discontinuity design that exploits the exogenous cutoff of systolic blood pressure in the diagnosis of hypertension, we find that, upon receiving hypertension diagnosis, individuals reduce fat intake significantly, and richer individuals reduce more. Our results also indicate that among the rich, hypertension diagnosis is more effective for individuals with lower education. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

On implementing the procedures with a panel of intraday prices for a large cross-section of individual stocks and the S&P 500 market portfolio, we find that the distributions of the systematic and idiosyncratic jumps are both generally heavy-tailed and close to symmetric, and show how the jump tail dependencies deduced from the high-frequency data together with the day-to-day variation in the diffusive volatility account for the extreme joint dependencies observed at the daily level.

To fill that gap, this study examines how R&D spending is influenced by prior year cash flow and corporate market value using multiple regression analysis and a panel data set of medical device companies over the period 1962-2008. The empirical findings suggest that the elasticities of R&D spending with respect to cash flow and corporate market value equal 0.58 and 0.31, respectively. Moreover, based upon these estimates, simulations show that the recently enacted excise tax on medical devices, taken alone, will reduce R&D spending by approximately $4 billion and thereby lead to a minimum loss of $20 billion worth of human life years over the first 10 years of its enactment.

First, a binary model of benefit participation is used to investigate whether receipt is responsive to the onset of disability. Second, matching estimators are used to evaluate the consequences of missed participation on later financial wellbeing. Results indicate that participation is highly responsive to the onset of disability, although the chance of delays in receipt emerges. Personal characteristics unrelated to eligibility also appear to influence benefit receipt, translating into sizeable differences in the amount of cash support received. The comparison of recipients with observationally equivalent non-recipients confirms that timely participation reduces disabled older people's financial strain. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to review the use of 10 instruments that rate presenteeism in mood disorders and to provide recommendations regarding the appropriateness of instruments in different study settings. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify scales used to measure presenteeism, including the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, the Lam Employment Absence and Productivity Scale, the Sheehan Disability Scale, the Work Limitation Questionnaire, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire. Study characteristics and major results (by symptom level, by treatment arm, correlation to other scales, and use of monetization) were data extracted. Results: Twenty-nine studies were identified. The Sheehan Disability Scale, the Work Limitation Questionnaire, and Health and Work Performance Questionnaire were the most commonly used instruments. The majority (60%) of scales demonstrated higher presenteeism in individuals with mood disorders than in individuals without. The Lam Employment Absence and Productivity Scale, the Sheehan Disability Scale, and the Work Limitation Questionnaire showed that presenteeism increased with increasing severity of disease. Few studies reported results on presenteeism by treatment, with only small between-treatment differences observed. Good correlations between presenteeism instruments and clinical or quality-of-life scales were reported. Three studies converted results from presenteeism scales into monetary units. Conclusions: Limited experiential evidence exists comparing the performance of presenteeism scales in mood disorders. Therefore, recommendations for inclusion of a presenteeism tool must be driven by instrument properties (ease of administration, amenability to monetization) and the study type. Future research should focus on the responsiveness of the instrument and on how mood disorders impact self-reported assessment.","[Despiegel, Nicolas] OptumInsight, F-92000 Nanterre, France; [Danchenko, Natalya; Francois, Clement] Lundbeck, Issy Les Moulineaux, France; [Lensberg, Benedikte] OptumInsight, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Drummond, Michael F.] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Optum; Lundbeck Corporation; Lundbeck Corporation - France; Optum; University of York - UK,"Despiégel, N (通讯作者)，OptumInsight, 41 Rue Trois Fontanot, F-92000 Nanterre, France.",Nicolas.despiegel@optum.com,"François, Clément/AAR-3163-2021","Francois, Clement/0000-0003-2278-3352",H.

Methods: FDA, EMA, and pharmaceutical company Web sites were consulted for details pertaining to REMS and RMPs. REMS requirements include medication guides, communication plans, elements to ensure safe use, implementation systems, and specified assessment intervals. RMP requirements are increased pharmacovigilance and risk minimization activities. We compared these requirements for drugs requiring both REMS and RMPs. Results: We identified 95 drugs on FDA's REMS list as of March 2010. Of these, there were 29 drugs (11 biologics and 18 new chemical entities) with EMA RMPs. REMS and RMPs are similar in objectives, with comparable toolkits. Both allow flexibility in product-specific actions, recognizing adverse effects of potential concern. Of the 29 drugs reviewed, REMS requirements not included in RMPs were patient medication guides (100% of the drugs), provider communication plans (38%), and routine monitoring of REMS (66%). RMP requirements not included in REMS were specific adverse event reporting (45% of the drugs), prospective registry studies (34%), prospective epidemiology studies (24%), additional trial data (28%), and Summary of Product Characteristics contraindications (76%). Conclusions: Both REMS and RMPs provide positive guidance for identification, monitoring, and minimization of risk to patient safety. Currently, neither agency provides specific guidance on how risk should be related to benefit either qualitatively or quantitatively.","[Raisch, Dennis W.] Univ New Mexico, Coll Pharm, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Roberts, Melissa H.] Lovelace Clin Fdn Res, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Lis, Yvonne] PAREXEL Int, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Kamble, Shital] Quintiles Outcome, Rockuille, MD USA; [Raisch, Dennis W.] Univ Cincinnati, Med Ctr, Coll Pharm, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA",University of New Mexico; Parexel International; IQVIA; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Raisch, DW (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Coll Pharm, 1 Univ New Mexico,MSC 09 5360, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",draisch@salud.umm.edu,,"Roberts, Melissa/0000-0002-1314-4906",,,,,24,26,28,5,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2012,15,8.0,,,,,1108,1118,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.019,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,055RT,23244814.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312435300016,0

This paper provides methods of statistical inference for the HAI and compares the available variance estimators for both the CI and the HAI using Monte Carlo simulation. Results for both the CI and the HAI suggest that analytical methods and bootstrapping are well behaved. The convenient regression method gives standard errors close to the other methods, provided the CI is not too large (< 0.2), but otherwise tends to understate the standard errors. In our simulation setting, the improvement from the NeweyWest correction over the convenient regression method has mixed evidence when the CI?=?0.1 and is modest when the CI?>?0.1. Published 2011.

This paper proposes new monotonicity concepts for power in games with communication structure and investigates the monotonicity properties of the Myerson value, the restricted Banzhaf value, the position value, and the average tree solution.

We extend their fundamental contribution by considering Minimum Discrepancy projections where misspecification is measured by a family of convex functions that take into account higher moments of asset returns. The Minimum Discrepancy problems are solved on dual spaces producing a family of estimators that captures the least-square problem as a particular case. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the estimators for the Cressie-Read family of discrepancies, and illustrate their use with an assessment of the Consumption Asset Pricing Model.

First, with output-oriented stochastic frontier models whose one-sided errors have a distribution other than the standard ones (exponential or half-normal). The gamma and beta distributions are leading examples. Second, with input-oriented stochastic frontier models which are common in theoretical discussions but not in econometric applications. Third, with two-tiered stochastic frontier models when the one-sided error components follow gamma distributions. Fourth, with latent class models with gamma distributed one-sided error terms. Fifth, with models whose two-sided error component is distributed as stable Paretian and the one-sided error is gamma. The principal aim is to propose approximations to the density of the composed error based on the inversion of the characteristic function (which turns out to be manageable) using the Fourier transform. Procedures that are based on the asymptotic normal form of the log-likelihood function and have arbitrary degrees of asymptotic efficiency are also proposed, implemented and evaluated in connection with output-oriented stochastic frontiers. The new methods are illustrated using data for US commercial banks, electric utilities, and a sample from the National Youth Longitudinal Survey. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on the Bayesian model selection rule and compare it with other criteria that are frequently used in econometric practice. First, we derive each of these criteria in the presence of nonstationarity. In particular, we study the Bayesian model selection rule in detail and derive three alternative forms of it in the presence of nonstationarity. One important feature of the Bayesian model selection criterion (BMSC) is that BMSC gives different weights to the stationary and nonstationary components of a model while the other criteria do not. This feature of BMSC is a desirable property for a model selection rule in the presence of possible nonstationarity. Second, we compare these criteria with regard to parsimony and power. We have found that BMSC shows the highest parsimony. AIC is the second, and C-p and (R) over bar (2), having the same level of parsimony, are the third. With regard to power, the order is not clearly established. However, for the size adjusted power BMSC becomes dominant as the sample size increases. Without size adjustment the order in the power is exactly the opposite to that in parsimony. Also, we find that BMSC is a consistent selection rule while the other criteria are not. Third, we consider four different cases of practical interest for which BMSC with some of the other criteria is applicable. We discuss how our BMSC can be used in these cases of practical interest. Results of an extensive Monte Carlo simulation for models in these Four cases show that overall the BMSC outperforms other criteria. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The segmentation is obtained by casting the problem into the. framework of detecting structural breaks in trending regression models in which the regressors are generated by suitably smooth functions. As test statistics we propose to use the maximally selected likelihood ratio statistics and a related statistics based on partial sums of weighted residuals. The main theoretical contribution of the paper establishes the extreme value distribution of these statistics and their consistency. To circumvent the slow convergence to the extreme value limit, we propose to employ a version of the circular bootstrap. This procedure is completely data-driven and does not require knowledge of the time series structure. In an empirical part, we show in a simulation study and applications to air carrier traffic and S&P 500 data that the finite sample performance is very satisfactory. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To overcome this problem, new condition-specific PBMs (CS-PBMs) are being developed, but it is not yet clear how such measures compare with existing generic PBMs. Method: We generated CS-PBMs from three condition-specific questionnaires (Health Assessment Questionnaire for arthritis, Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer 30 for cancer, and Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale 29 for multiple sclerosis). First, the questionnaires were reduced in content, and then, a time trade-off study was conducted in the general public (N = 402) to obtain weights associated with the dimensions and levels of the new questionnaire. Finally, we compared utilities obtained by using the CS-PBMs with utilities obtained by using the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire in four data sets. Results: Utility values generated by the CS-PBMs were higher than those of the EQ-5D questionnaire. The Health Assessment Questionnaire-based measure for arthritis proved to be insensitive to comorbidities. Measures based on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale 29 and the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer 30 discriminated comorbidities and side effect equally well as the EQ-5D questionnaire and were more sensitive than the EQ-5D questionnaire for mild impairments. Conclusions: The introduction of PBMs that are specific to a certain disease may have the merit of sensitivity to disease- specific effects of interventions. That gain, however, is traded off to the loss of comparability of utility values and, in some cases, insensitivity to side effects and comorbidity. The use of a CS-PBM for costutility analysis is warranted only under strict conditions.","[Versteegh, Matthijs M.; Leunis, Annemieke; Uyl-de Groot, Carin A.; Stolk, Elly A.] Erasmus Univ, IMTA iBMG, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Versteegh, MM (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, IMTA iBMG, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",versteegh@bmg.eur.nl,"; Leunis, Annemieke/E-2072-2013","Versteegh, Matthijs/0000-0003-4804-235X; Leunis, Annemieke/0000-0002-4798-679X",ZonMW: the Netherlands organization for health research and development,ZonMW: the Netherlands organization for health research and development(Netherlands Organization for Health Research and DevelopmentNetherlands Government),This study was funded by ZonMW: the Netherlands organization for health research and development.,,29,81,84,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2012,15,3.0,,,,,504,513,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.12.003,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,941CN,22583461.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303940600014,0

We investigated the lifetime health costs and benefits of sunscreen promotion in the primary prevention of skin cancers, including melanoma. Methods: A decision-analytic model with Markov chains was used to integrate data from a central community-based randomized controlled trial conducted in Australia and other epidemiological and published sources. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year was the primary outcome. Extensive one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the uncertainty in the base findings with plausible variation to the model parameters. Results: Using a combined household and government perspective, the discounted incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from the sunscreen intervention was AU$40,890. Over the projected lifetime of the intervention cohort, this would prevent 33 melanomas, 168 cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas, and 4 melanoma-deaths at a cost of approximately AU$ 808,000. The likelihood that the sunscreen intervention was cost-effective was 64% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Conclusions: Subject to the best-available evidence depicted in our model, the active promotion of routine sunscreen use to white populations residing in sunny settings is likely to be a cost-effective investment for governments and consumers over the long term.","[Hirst, Nicholas G.; Gordon, Louisa G.; Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4131, Australia; [Gordon, Louisa G.; Scuffham, Paul A.; Green, Adele C.] Griffith Univ, A Joint Program, Griffith Med Res Coll, Herston, Qld, Australia; [Gordon, Louisa G.; Scuffham, Paul A.; Green, Adele C.] Queensland Inst Med Res, QIMR, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia; [Green, Adele C.] Univ Queensland, Royal Brisbane Hosp, Queensland Inst Med Res, Genet & Populat Hlth Div, Herston, Qld, Australia; [Green, Adele C.] Univ Manchester, Sch Translat Med, Manchester, Lancs, England",Griffith University; Griffith University; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute; Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute; University of Queensland; University of Manchester,"Hirst, NG (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Univ Dr, Brisbane, Qld 4131, Australia.",n.hirst@griffith.edu.au,"Gordon, Louisa/P-1427-2016; Scuffham, Paul/AAS-8084-2021; Green, Adele C/B-5324-2011; Green, Adele/P-2736-2014","Gordon, Louisa/0000-0002-3159-4249; Scuffham, Paul/0000-0001-5931-642X; Green, Adele/0000-0002-2753-4841",,,,,54,57,59,1,40,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2012,15,2.0,,,,,261,268,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.10.009,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,914DZ,22433757.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301930600007,0

This requires a means of valuing health states before and after intervention. Although generic measures are typically used to generate values, these do not perform well with people with dementia. We report the development of a health state classification system amenable to valuation for use in studies of dementia, derived from the DEMQOL system, measure of health-related quality of life in dementia by patient self-report (DEMQOL) and carer proxy-report (DEMQOL-Proxy). Methods: Factor analysis was used to determine the dimensional structure of DEMQOL and DEMQOL-Proxy. Rasch analysis was subsequently used to investigate item performance across factors in terms of item-level ordering, functioning across subgroups, model fit, and severity-range coverage. This enabled the selection of one item from each factor for the classification system. A sample of people with a diagnosis of mild/moderate dementia (n = 644) and a sample of carers of those with mild/moderate dementia (n = 683) were used. Results: Factor analysis found different five-factor solutions for DEMQOL and DEMQOL-Proxy. Following item reduction and selection by using Rasch analysis, a five-dimension classification for DEMQOL and a four-dimension classification for DEMQOL-Proxy were developed. Each item contained four health state levels. Conclusion: Combining Rasch and classical psychometric analysis is a valid method of selecting items for dementia health state classifications from both the patient and carer perspectives. The next stage is to obtain preference weights so that the measure can be used in the economic evaluation of treatment, care, and support arrangements for dementia.","[Mulhern, Brendan; Rowen, Donna; Brazier, John E.; Young, Tracey A.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Smith, Sarah C.; Lamping, Donna L.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Knapp, Martin] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Personal Social Serv Res Unit, London, England; [Knapp, Martin; Loftus, Vanessa; Howard, Robert J.; Banerjee, Sube] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of Sheffield; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; King's College London,"Mulhern, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",b.mulhern@sheffield.ac.uk,"Banerjee, Sube/E-3757-2010; Knapp, Martin RJ/G-3011-2011; Howard, Robert/E-4890-2010; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Young, Tracey A/A-4543-2010","Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063; Young, Tracey/0000-0001-8467-0471; Banerjee, Sube/0000-0002-8083-7649; Howard, Robert/0000-0002-3071-2338; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Knapp, Martin/0000-0003-1427-0215",NHS,NHS,The study was supported by a grant from the Health Technology Assessment Methodology Program of the NHS.,,45,32,34,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2012,15,2.0,,,,,323,333,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.09.006,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,914DZ,22433764.0,"Green Submitted, hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301930600014,0

Without public reporting, consumers may have little information to help them differentiate quality among providers, giving providers little incentive to compete on quality. Public reporting enables consumers to choose highly ranked providers. Using a four-year (2000-2003) panel dataset, we examine the relationship between report card scores and patient choice of nursing home after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began publicly reporting nursing home quality information on postacute care in 2002. We find that the relationship between reported quality and nursing home choice is positive and statistically significant suggesting that patients were more likely to choose facilities with higher reported post-acute care quality after public reporting was initiated. However, the magnitude of the effect was small. We conclude that there has been minimal consumer response to information in the post-acute care market.

It provides a simple condition for mediation to be beneficial, that is, to give the receiver a higher ex-ante payoff than the uninformed decision. This condition in turn allows us to identify scenarios in which mediation is beneficial while all cheap-talk equilibria are uninformative. Our condition extends the conditions for beneficial mediation with a binary type space (Mitusch and Strausz, 2005) and mediation via a biased mediator (Ambrus et al., 2013). Finally, we show the connection between the identified condition and related conditions in other conflict resolution schemes: delegation (Alonso and Matouschek, 2008) and arbitration (Kovac and Mylovanov, 2009).

Results show that assimilation is associated with a lower likelihood of ever quitting smoking for immigrants from countries with lower smoking rates relative to the USA and a higher likelihood for immigrants from countries with higher smoking rates, but for current or ever smoking, the estimated effects of assimilation are statistically insignificant. Although these findings demonstrate that health assimilation depends on the country of origin, the extent to which this pattern of assimilation is due to peer influence, differences in responsiveness to anti-smoking interventions such as taxes or smoke-free air restrictions, and/or other factors remains unclear because of the limitations of this study.

Our axioms provide the foundation for a recursive representation of the utility function that contains as particular cases the classical Koopmans representation (Koopmans (1960)) as well as the habit formation specification. We examine some of the consequences of our axiomatization by considering a standard consumer choice problem, and show that typically in the space of concave utility functions satisfying our axioms the consumer displays a taste for variety. The latter means that such a consumer selects optimally time variant consumption programs for any given time invariant sequence of commodities' relative prices and for all possible sequences of market discount factors. In contrast, if a concave utility function satisfies Koopmans' axioms the consumer does not display a taste for variety. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For both settings, random serial dictatorship (RSD) is a well-known rule that satisfies anonymity, ex post efficiency, and strategyproofness. Recently, it was shown that computing the resulting probabilities is #P-complete both in the voting and assignment setting. In this paper, we present efficient parametrized algorithms to compute the RSD probabilities for parameters such as the number of agent types, alternatives, or objects. When the parameters are small, then the respective algorithms are considerably more efficient than the naive approach of going through all permutations of agents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Range bias occurs when the range of money values presented to respondents in a payment card affects their stated WTP values. This paper reports the results of an exploratory study whose aim was to investigate whether the effects of range bias can be reduced through the use of an alternative to the standard payment card method, namely, a random card sort method. The results suggest that the random card sort method is prone to range bias but that this bias may be mitigated by restricting the analysis to the WTP values of those respondents who indicate they are 'definitely sure' they would pay their stated WTP.

However, many of these studies rely on non-experimental designs; use self-reported outcome measures; or both. In this study, we investigate the effects of a randomly assigned home based HIV testing and counseling (HTC) intervention on risky sexual behaviors and schooling investments among school-age females in Malawi. We find no overall effects on HIV, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-2), or achievement test scores at follow-up. However, among the small group of individuals who tested positive for HIV, we find a large increase in the probability of HSV-2 infection, with this effect being stronger among those surprised by their test results. Similarly, those surprised by HIV-negative test results have significantly higher achievement test scores at follow-up, consistent with increased returns to investments in human capital.

Although concepts such as price effects are intuitive, rigorous foundations justifying causal discourse in the wide range of economic settings remain lacking. We illustrate this deficiency using an N-bidder private-value auction, posing causal questions that cannot be addressed within existing frameworks. We extend the frameworks of Pearl (2000) and White and Chalak (2009) to introduce topological settable systems (TSS), a causal framework capable of delivering the missing answers. Particularly, TSS accommodate choices belonging to general function spaces. Our analysis suggests how TSS enable causal discourse in various areas of economics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Joint and two-step estimation procedures are considered. The joint procedure is a quasi-limited information maximum likelihood procedure, as one or both of the log likelihoods may be misspecified. The two-step control function approach is computationally simple and leads to straightforward tests of endogeneity. In the case of discrete endogenous explanatory variables, I argue that the control function approach can be applied with generalized residuals to obtain average partial effects. I show how the results apply to nonlinear models for fractional and nonnegative responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, their occurrence is often accompanied by credit booms. Incorporating these features, we provide a two-sector endogenous growth model with credit-driven stock price bubbles. Bubbles have a credit easing effect in that they relax collateral constraints and improve investment efficiency. Sectoral bubbles also have a capital reallocation effect in the sense that bubbles in a sector attract more capital to be reallocated to that sector. Their impact on economic growth depends on the interplay between these two effects. Bubbles may misallocate resources across sectors and reduce welfare.","[Miao, Jianjun] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Wang, Pengfei] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Miao, Jianjun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Miao, Jianjun] Zhejiang Univ, AFR, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Boston University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Central University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University,"Miao, JJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",miaoj@bu.edu; pfwang@ust.hk,"Wang, Pengfei/X-2272-2019","Wang, Pengfei/0000-0002-8686-4787",,,,,43,71,85,3,75,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0304-4068,1873-1538,,J MATH ECON,J.

We measure the inaccuracy in its geographic adjustment factors and categorize beneficiaries by whether they live where Medicare's formula is favorable or unfavorable to physicians. Then, using the 2001-2003 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, we examine whether differences in physician payment generosity, that is, whether favorable or unfavorable, influence the satisfaction ratings Medicare seniors assign to their quality of care and access to services. We find strong evidence that they do. Many beneficiaries live in payment-unfavorable areas and receive a less satisfying quality of care and less satisfying access to services than beneficiaries who live where payments are favorable to physicians.
