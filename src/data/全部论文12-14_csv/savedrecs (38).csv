For robustness of the results, we use two unit root tests-the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin-to measure the stationarity of both prices and returns and study if the return can be described as an order one integrated process (a proxy for the random walk). Further we apply Lo & MacKinley's Variance Ratio Test to study if the variance of the return is a linear time-dependent function, a well-known property of a random variable. The analysis is done for the period between 15 October 1997 (or the listing date on the stock exchange, respectively) and 10 April 2013, for both daily and weekly observations. Furthermore, to take into account the distortive effects of the 2007-2009 financial crisis on the market efficiency, separate analysis have been conducted for the pre- and post-recession periods.","[Pasca, Lucian] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,,luciangpasca@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-020-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,356,364,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346751900050,0

However, in many businesses, service failure may surface despite consistent avoidance efforts. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between service recovery and customer satisfaction in co-created retail industry. Co-created retail industry which reflects the engagement of customers in business value creation is a win-win approach to customers and retailers particularly in context of service recovery. Although predominant attention on service recovery has been assessed in hospitality context especially in hotel and restaurant setting, there are very limited explorations in co-created retail context to lend sufficient understanding for retail recovery management. A conceptual framework and three prepositions were developed indicating that customer satisfaction is influenced by three justice dimensions of service recovery which is outcome justice, procedural justice and interactional justice. Managerial implication of this study is discussed to exhibit the importance of service recovery in winning back the upset customers. (C) 2014 The Authors.

IC formation is very probable in high growth cities while the case of IC growth in cross-border regions remains less probable is uneven and deserves more investigation. Within cross-border regions there may also be hidden potential for intellectual capital formation owing to complementarities but there is also a tendency for people to migrate out of these regions towards important national urban agglomerations.

Factor analysis identified 5 factors affecting patient choice of private hospital: hospital branding, physician recommendation, staff attitude, functional decision criteria, and quality of service of the available offering. Hospital branding came out as the factor with the highest eigen value and accounted for the majority of the variance explained by the variables. Therefore hospital managers should incorporate these factors into improving the service to their patients and should recognise the importance that branding plays within the private healthcare sector.","[Sim, Claire] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Bick, Geoffrey] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Cape Town,"Sim, C (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa.",,"Bick, Geoff/AAB-1698-2020",,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,ASIAN BUSINESS ASSOC,CENTRL HONG KONG,"9 FLR, ANTNA TOWER, 148 DES VOEUX RD, CENTRL HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2357-190X,2357-1918,,P CHIN MARK INT CONF,,,2014,,,,,,,115,126,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359385500006,0

Based on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, MFL owns approximately 9,500 contiguous acres (3,845 ha) of which 6,350 acres is under cultivation between wheat and malting barley, with the remaining land used for sheep rearing, indigenous forest and infrastructure. MFL is a strategic supplier of malting barley to Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL), part of the SABMiller plc group, supplying up to 30% of the brewer's locally sourced Barley. Started in 2000 by Managing Director Luke Edwards, the key to the company's success has been its scalable management platform - allowing significant production volume to be achieved in a region where average farm sizes are typically 1-3ha. This management platform is a combination of both commercial production systems (classically seen in developed agricultural markets such as Australia and the US) allowing external institutional capital to be invested, and of local Tanzanian agricultural practices (a significant employment and training program is undertaken by the company), allowing MFL to operate successfully with local communities and stakeholders. The company is now looking at further investment opportunities to capitalize on the management platform they have built; options considered by the company's board of directors include diversification on MFL's land on Kilimanjaro by planting avocados to feed into a local pack-house that exports to supermarkets in Europe and starting an out-grower barley program in other areas of Tanzania also suited to Barley production.","[Simpson, John Y.; Cheong, Qing Yang] Duxton Asset Management, Singapore, Singapore",,"Simpson, JY (通讯作者)，Duxton Asset Management, Singapore, Singapore.",john.simpson@duxtonam.com,,,,,,,0,1,2,0,5,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Visions of a new, Europe-like region, peaceful, prosperous, democratic, will not be realized. Much more likely is the emergence of a new Middle East that will cause great harm to itself and other countries. All the eras have been defined by the interplay of contending forces, both internal and external to the region. What has varied is the balance between these influences. The Middle East's next era promises to be one in which outside actors have a relatively modest impact and local forces enjoy the upper hand, and in which the local actors gaining power are radical militants committed to changing the status quo. Shaping the new Middle East from the outside will be exceedingly difficult, but it will be one of the primary challenges to thwart the menace for the Western democracies in the decades to come.","Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Medzinarodnych Vztahov, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Sorby, KR (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Medzinarodnych Vztahov, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-B, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",karol.sorby@euba.sk,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-3980-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,453,459,,,,,,7,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BD8CF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363790100051,0

One of the reasons is architecture-related, because traditional approach in building information systems denies efficient handling of unstructured data. It relies on relational database management system for handling structured data and file system based repository for handling great amounts of unstructured data. This poses several limitations to the system since it is difficult for these architectures to achieve efficient scalability, availability and partition tolerance of the system. Backup and disaster recoveries are hard to establish as well. Another reason is cost-related, as even when organization decides to handle unstructured data, traditional approach assumes use of costly, storage area network based high-end hardware infrastructure. Not many organizations in Serbia are able to afford this kind of hardware. Proposed architecture solution was built on NoSQL database management system because NoSQL database management system does not suffer from listed problems. It is distributive by design and achieving horizontal scalability is almost automated process. Handling unstructured data is in the nature of these systems as handling structured data is for relational database management systems. The combination of sharding and replication techniques enables this platform to be horizontally scalable and partition tolerant. The blend of these attributes and distributive nature of the system enable high availability, because requests are handled on several servers at the same time and potential server outage will not stop the system. Proposed infrastructure solution relies on farms of inexpensive or even used servers where the power of the system lies in distributive capacity of the deployed architecture. The result is the system based on used/slow servers with acceptable performances and resilience to eventual server termination. The system remains available even when predicted number of servers stops responding, thus enabling the use of used servers with higher failure rate. This paper describes the architectural approach that shows on a practical example that it is possible to build the architecture that will be both efficient and inexpensive, marking the proposed solution suitable for deployment in countries with poor economy as Serbia is. This would enable broader usage of unstructured data in organizations in Serbia. Furthermore, it would enable the possibility for identification of intellectual capital for decision support in organizations, making them more concurrent on the contemporary world market.","Higher Educ Tech Sch Profess Studies, Novi Sad, Serbia",,"Stevic, M (通讯作者)，Higher Educ Tech Sch Profess Studies, Novi Sad, Serbia.",milorad.stevic@live.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,393,401,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000048,0

Using case study evidence from the western Canadian ethanol sector, solutions to the hold-up risks facing ethanol plants are explored.

The static analysis reveals significant positive impact of microcredit on schooling years in 2000 only, and no influence on academic performance for either wave. The dynamic analysis shows progressive treatment effects on both longer schooling years and higher average scores.

J,"Young, J; Park, PY",,,,"Young, Jason; Park, Peter Y.",,,Hotzone identification with GIS-based post-network screening analysis,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,GIS; Road safety; Hotzone identification; Kernel density estimation; Post-network screening,HAZARDOUS ROAD LOCATIONS; HOT-SPOTS; SAFETY; MUNICIPALITIES,"This paper proposes a two-step method called post-network screening analysis for identifying collision hotzones (i.e., groups of neighboring hotspots) on a road network. The first step is the familiar safety network screening that uses AASHTO's Highway Safety Manual (HSM) to identify and rank individual locations (i.e., hotspots) according to their potential for safety improvement. The second step is new and involves network-constrained kernel density estimation (KDE), a type of spatial analysis. KDE uses expected collision counts to estimate collision density, and outputs a graphical display that shows areas with a high density of expected collision counts. These are the hotzones. A particularly interesting area of application is the identification of high-collision corridors that may benefit from a program of systemic safety improvements. The proposed method was tested using five years of collision data (2005-2009) for the City of Regina, Saskatchewan. Three different network screening measures were compared: (1) observed collision counts, (2) observed severity-weighted collision counts, and (3) expected severity-weighted collision counts. The study found that observed severity-weighted collision counts produced a dramatic picture of the city's hotzones, but this picture could be misleading as it could be heavily influenced by a small number of severe collisions. The results obtained from the expected severity-weighted collision counts smoothed the effects of the severity-weighting and successfully reduced regression-to-the-mean bias. A comparison is made between the proposed approach and the results of the HSM's existing network screening method. As the proposed approach takes the spatial association of roadway segments into account, and is not limited to single roadway segments, the hotzones identified capture a higher number of expected equivalent-property-damage-only (EPDO) collisions than the existing HSM methodology. The study concludes that the proposed two-step method can help transportation safety professionals to prioritize hotzones within high-collision corridors more efficiently and scientifically.

The capital-market effects around this change have been extensively studied, but their sources are not yet well understood. This study aims to distinguish between several potential explanations for the observed capital-market effects. We find that, across all countries, mandatory IFRS reporting had little impact on liquidity. The liquidity effects around IFRS introduction are concentrated in the European Union (EU) and limited to five EU countries that concurrently made substantive changes in reporting enforcement. There is little evidence of liquidity benefits in IFRS countries without substantive enforcement changes even when they have strong legal and regulatory systems. Moreover, we find similar liquidity effects for firms that experience enforcement changes but do not concurrently switch to IFRS. Thus, changes in reporting enforcement or (unobserved) factors associated with these changes play a critical role for the observed liquidity benefits after mandatory IFRS adoption. In contrast, the change in accounting standards seems to have had little effect on market liquidity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First, we merge Execucomp executive compensation records with IRS tax records. We compare incomes from our Execucomp sample to top incomes reported by Piketty and Saez (2003). We disaggregate executive income trends by industry, showing which industries are driving the divergence in top executive incomes. We compare our results to findings from Bakija, Cole, and Heim (2010) and Kaplan and Rauh (2010), who examine trends in top incomes for broad occupation and industry categories for years prior to the Great Recession. We also decompose these income trends by income source to see which components are driving the observed changes. We find that stock options are by far the most volatile component of executive pay. Options are the key driver of both short-term swings and longer-term trends in top executive pay. However, stock awards are also a large and growing component. We find much greater variation in income across years than across industries. Executive incomes are most volatile at the very top of income distribution. In general, trends for top executives in finance and non-finance industries are quite similar; however; for those above the 99.9th percentile of the income distribution, the decline in income from 2006 to 2009 was much more pronounced for executives in finance.","[Giertz, Seth H.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Mortenson, Jacob A.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC USA; [Mortenson, Jacob A.] Joint Comm Taxat, Washington, DC USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Georgetown University,"Giertz, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",gierts@uni.edu; jm849@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

In the present investigation, working adults (N = 87) with different levels of financially linked retirement anxiety were investigated using the Emotional Stroop Task (EST). The EST involves presenting financially relevant retirement threat words (e.g., poverty) on a computer screen in addition to nonretirement neutral words (e.g., sailboat). Words were presented individually in 1 of 4 different colors of ink. Respondents' task was to identify the ink color for each word as rapidly as possible. It was hypothesized that individuals with high levels of retirement anxiety would generate slower response latencies when naming the color of retirement threat words relative to neutral words. No such processing delay was predicted for nonanxious participants. ANOVA findings revealed a 2-way interaction that was consistent with a priori predictions. The data suggest working adults with retirement anxiety experienced information processing disruptions that stem from the negative emotional content linked to retirement concepts in long-term memory. From an applied perspective, these processing disruptions may represent a significant obstacle that needs to be surmounted when encouraging individuals with retirement anxiety to plan and save for the future.","[Gutierrez, Helen C.; Hershey, Douglas A.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Psychol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Gutierrez, HC (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Psychol, 116 North Murray Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",helencg@okstate.edu,,,,,,,63,13,18,0,16,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

By using the new RavenPack News Analytics - Dow Jones Edition database that captures over 1200 types of firm-specific and macroeconomic news releases and their sentiment scores at high frequencies, we investigate the circumstances in which public news sentiment is related to the intraday volatility of the constituent stocks in the Dow Jones Composite Average (DJN 65). Two different conditionally heteroskedastic models are employed: the Fractionally Integrated Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic (FIGARCH) and the two-state Markov Regime-Switching GARCH (RS-GARCH) models. For most of the DJN 65 stocks, our results confirm the significant impact of firm-specific news sentiment on intraday volatility persistence, even after controlling for the potential effects of macroeconomic news. Compared with macroeconomic news sentiment, firm-specific news sentiment apparently accounts for a greater proportion of overall volatility persistence. Moreover, negative news has a greater impact on volatility than positive news. Furthermore, the results from the RS-GARCH model indicate that news sentiment accounts for a greater proportion of volatility persistence in the high-volatility regime (turbulent state) than in the low-volatility regime (calm state). In-sample forecasting performance and residual diagnostic tests suggest that FIGARCH generally outperforms RS-GARCH. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

First, using a structural VAR model, we find that the unemployment rate falls and employment rises following an increase in government spending. We also find that fiscal expansion affects flows in and out of unemployment. While an increase in government spending increases the job-finding rate, it reduces the separation rate. We then incorporate search and matching frictions into a standard dynamic general equilibrium model, and study whether the model can explain what we observed in data. While the model fails to predict the exact size of the impact of government spending shocks on the Japanese labor market variables, it can consistently capture the empirical pattern of responses of labor market variables to shocks.

Until then, the effect of finance on growth is nonexistent.

Framing in stated preference studies occurs when respondents use irrelevant information contained in the question to help them value the good. This may occur because respondents are uncertain or do not hold well-formed preferences for the good in question. We investigate if respondent certainty explains framing effects in a contingent valuation study, using data from a double bounded dichotomous elicitation format and a follow-up certainty question. We investigate if respondent certainty influences anchoring and the shift effect. We find evidence that the anchoring effect is stronger for respondents who are less certain about their response to the contingent valuation question compared to respondents who are very certain. However, the shift effect is significant and negative only for respondents who are very certain.

However, neither option is without cost. What is the tradeoff between these strategies? In this study, we introduce an exogenous punishment mechanism that varies the probability and magnitude of punishment to examine this tradeoff. In our punishment system, sanctions are imposed on the lowest contributor according to a predetermined probability rather than assigned by the participants. Our results indicate that exogenous punishment enhances cooperation. Moreover, we show that a punishment of an intermediate magnitude imposed with a 50% probability is significantly more effective than a more severe punishment with a 10% probability or a lesser but certain punishment, even though the expected value of the punishment is equal across the punishment treatments.

We design an experiment to compare individuals' decisions across three resource allocation contests which are isomorphic under risk-neutrality. The results indicate that in aggregate the single-prize contest generates lower expenditures than either the proportional-prize or the multi-prize contest. Interestingly, while the aggregate results indicate similar behavior in the proportionalprize and multi-prize contests, individual level analysis indicates that the behavior in the single-prize contest is more similar to the behavior in the multi-prize contest than in the proportional-prize contest. We also elicit preferences toward risk, ambiguity and losses, and find that while such preferences cannot explain individual behavior in the proportional-prize contest, preferences with regard to losses are predictive of behavior in both the single-prize and multiple-prize contests.

Our results suggest that these characteristics (book-to-market, leverage, size, institutional ownership, earnings-per-share, and turnover) are able to explain well the differences in idiosyncratic risk across securities. On the other hand, the characteristics appear to be poor predictors of the fluctuations in idiosyncratic risk of a given security over time. About 80% of the securities in our sample do not have a significant relationship between any of the considered characteristics and idiosyncratic risk at security level. These results suggest that firm characteristics can be used in the analysis of the differences in risk across securities, such as portfolio composition. However, the characteristics do not appear useful in the analysis of security risk dynamics, for example, monitoring portfolio risk over time. These conclusions are robust to alternative specifications of idiosyncratic risk, security samples, and time periods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Opponents of CDS argue that CDS could lead to financial instability as it allows speculators to bet against companies and make the crisis worse. Proponents of CDS believe that CDS could increase market competition and benefit hedging activities. Moreover, an efficient CDS market can serve as a barometer to regulators and investors regarding the credit health of the underlying reference entity. We investigate information efficiency of the U. S. CDS market using evidence from earnings surprises. Our findings confirm that negative earnings surprises are well anticipated in the CDS market in the month prior to the announcement, with both economically and statistically stronger reactions for speculative-grade firms than for investment-grade firms. On the announcement day, for both positive and negative earnings surprises, the CDS spread for speculative-grade firms presents abnormal changes. Moreover, there is no post-earnings announcement drift in the CDS market, which is in direct contrast to the well-documented post-earnings drift in the stock market. Our evidence supports the efficiency of the CDS market. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The economic field, due to the businesses it involves, is regarded as a tool capable of generating social well-being by caring for resource conservation. The retailing is part of this process, playing an important role due to the connection it provides between producers and consumers. The objectives of this study were to highlight the extent to which retailing developed in Romania, to measure the efficiency of firms in the industry and to identify sustainable development practices these firms used. In developing our approach a sample of 12 firms were selected, which were defined as constituting a reference framework based on their size and turnover. Further on, the descriptive research method was used, based on secondary sources of data investigation. After analyzing the data, it was concluded that the retailing sector in Romania is a powerful one, with a market slightly increasing, dominated by trends of concentration and with efficiency in line with the European average. The use of the principles of sustainable development into trade business companies in Romania is low. There is no urge to see these principles as business opportunities and sources of competitiveness.","[Dobrea, Mihaela; Vasiliu, Cristinel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Vasiliu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cristi_vasiliu@yahoo.com,"Vasiliu, Cristinel/B-5730-2012; MIHAELA, BUCUR/T-4541-2018","Vasiliu, Cristinel/0000-0002-1084-2522; MIHAELA, BUCUR/0000-0003-0867-2971",,,,,46,19,19,0,31,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2013,15.0,,,,7,,583,602,,,,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,268IU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328164400003,0

A planned, integrated and properly coordinated orientation towards environment protection, involvement in activities of society and local communities, supporting and streamlining its own economic activities are the core elements whereby a business can obtain long-term harmonious development, a synergic evolution and a competitive advantage. The major problem, however, lies in the poor understanding of sustainable development directions and their difficult transposition into a business' current activity, in its proper funding and in finding consumers willing to pay the price of sustainable products and services. Whereas the literature deals with the application of dimensions of sustainable development in terms of holiday or business destinations, local communities and/or regional or national authorities, the management of tourist businesses etc, the study of tourist consumers' perception has been quite infrequent. As a matter of fact, few studies set to highlight how the dimensions of sustainable development implemented by tourist units are properly perceived by consumers and how these contribute to building and increasing consumers' satisfaction. Tourism, tourist business or tourist destination may be referred to as sustainable when they are so maintained and developed that they remain viable even infinitely without affecting environment, social, economic or cultural dimensions of the analyzed area (Butler, 1999). To overcome these shortcomings, the authors appealed to experimental research in an attempt to highlight tourists' perception of the three dimensions of sustainable development as they are implemented by tourist accommodation units in one of the biggest cities of Romania. Using a structural approach and appealing to econometrical modeling of 850 valid answers, the authors show how sustainable development actions conducted by tourist accommodation units may turn into genuine stimuli for building satisfaction. The conclusions reveal important managerial and scientific implications.","[Dabija, Dan-Cristian; Babut, Raluca] BABES BOLYAI Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Dabija, DC (通讯作者)，BABES BOLYAI Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",cristian.dabija@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Dabija, Dan-Cristian/I-8101-2012; Babut, Raluca/ABC-1612-2020","Dabija, Dan-Cristian/0000-0002-8265-175X;",,,,,49,30,31,0,35,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2013,15.0,,,,7,,617,633,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,268IU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328164400005,0

We find that the concern with relative performance leads agents to trade more similarly, a development that has two effects. First, similar trading directly decreases volatility. Second, similar trading decreases the impact of dominant agents. The second effect dominates the first when agents expect large differences between their final performances, and vice versa when agents expect small differences between their final performances. Compared with the case in which agents are unconcerned about relative performance, the stock return volatility is higher when the second effect dominates, and lower when the first effect dominates.

The model features endogenous default and recovery rates that both depend on the interaction between domestic output fluctuations and global macroeconomic conditions. We show that sovereigns choose to default at higher levels of economic output once global macroeconomic conditions are bad. This yields to default rates and credit spreads that are substantially higher compared to normal times. We derive closed-form expressions for sovereign debt values and default times and focus on the dynamics of sovereign credit spreads. As opposed to standard theories of sovereign debt, this paper's structural model generates much richer default patterns and non-linearities through regime-shifts in the global macroeconomic environment. Moreover, changes in the global environment reveal the interconnectedness of the financial system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We further show that the abating effect of analyst coverage on bubble intensity is weaker when there is greater disagreement among analysts. This suggests that, in line with resale option theories of bubbles, one channel through which analyst coverage may mitigate bubbles is by coordinating investors' beliefs and thus reducing its dispersion.

The paper assumes that in response to the incentive conferred by the prospect of migration, the average level of human capital - the source of a productivity-enhancing externality - changes gradually rather than immediately. This might seem to imply that, contrary to what is claimed in Stark (2004), the welfare of the workers who do not migrate, and who early on in the transition period adjust their level of human capital in response to the prospect of migration, declines because these workers do not face a higher average level of human capital. Rather surprisingly, however, the paper finds that the welfare result of Stark (2004) is robust to the relaxation of his assumption of instantaneous adjustment: even pioneer workers, who form more human capital in an environment in which the prevailing average level of human capital is approximately at the pre-migration level, are strictly better off when there is a prospect of migration than when there is not.

The analysis tests whether voter participation decreases the House incumbent's electoral support, regardless of the level of competition in the district. The study also aims to determine if an increase in participation benefits Democratic candidates and whether this effect is constant across apportionment cycles. The results show that the influence of turnout on incumbency vote share is conditional on the level of presidential support in the district.

Our results show that the immediate annuity market in Korea is reasonably efficient. For example, the money's worth ratio of an immediate annuity of a 10-year guarantee period for a 65-year-old male is estimated to be about 0.8 with the general population mortality rate, while it improves to 0.9 with the annuitant mortality table.

It distinguishes between the effects of the level of decentralization from the way local governments finance their expenditures (common pool versus own resources); it uses a panel cointegration approach to separate the long run effects of decentralization from the short run dynamics; and it extends and revises the datasets generally used in these empirical analyses. The results show that the amount of revenue raised by sub-national governments leads to a long-term fall in the size of government but grants have the opposite effect. In addition, a greater decentralization of expenditure leads to greater overall spending. When the short-term is considered these influences work slowly, as the speed of adjustment towards the desired government size is relatively sluggish. In addition, in the short run, there is also a clear effect from the role of local revenue raising powers that stimulates the growth of government. These results appear robust to changes in the composition of the variables, countries and periods included the sample.","[Ashworth, John] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham, England; [Galli, Emma] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Sociali, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Padovano, Fabio] Univ Rennes 1, CREM CNRS, F-35064 Rennes, France; [Padovano, Fabio] Univ Rennes 1, Ctr Condorcet Polit Econ, F-35064 Rennes, France; [Padovano, Fabio] Univ Roma Tre, DIPES, Rome, Italy",Durham University; Sapienza University Rome; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes; Universite de Rennes; Roma Tre University,"Padovano, F (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CREM CNRS, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35064 Rennes, France.",fabio.padovano@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,70,32,33,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2013,156.0,3-4,,,,,491,516,,10.1007/s11127-012-9962-8,0.0,,,26,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,184NK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321897600006,0

Using a simultaneous equations framework, we investigate the relationship between bank regulatory capital and bank liquidity measured from on-balance sheet positions for European and US publicly traded commercial banks. Previous research studying the determinants of bank capital buffer has neglected the role of liquidity. On the whole, we find that banks decrease their regulatory capital ratios when they face higher illiquidity as defined in the Basel III accords or when they create more liquidity as measured by Berger and Bouwman (2009). However, considering other measures of illiquidity that focus more closely on core deposits in the United States, our results show that small banks strengthen their solvency standards when they are exposed to higher illiquidity. Our empirical investigation supports the need to implement minimum liquidity ratios concomitant to capital ratios, as stressed by the Basel Committee; however, our findings also shed light on the need to further clarify how to define and measure illiquidity and also on how to regulate large banking institutions, which behave differently than smaller ones.

Surprisingly, however, consumption volatility in many low-income countries is nontrivially higher than income volatility. Here I examine what causes high consumption volatility in low-income countries. In general, volatile consumption makes consumers worse off. Therefore, understanding the causes of high consumption volatility can contribute to improving welfare in low-income countries by suggesting measures to assist in the stabilization of consumption. Unlike much previous research, I focus on international factors when explaining high consumption volatility. The results suggest that external shocks, which are far more volatile in low-income countries than in industrialized countries, strongly swing consumption. By capturing these mechanisms, the model I use successfully accounts for consumption volatility's differences between the sample low-income country and sample industrialized country.","[Kodama, Masahiro] JETRO, Inst Dev Econ, Chiba, Japan; [Kodama, Masahiro] Malaysian Inst Econ Res, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",,"Kodama, M (通讯作者)，JETRO, Inst Dev Econ, Chiba, Japan.",,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

J,"Paciorek, A",,,,"Paciorek, Andrew",,,Supply constraints and housing market dynamics,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Housing supply; Regulation; House prices; Volatility; Supply lags,CONSTRUCTION; PRICES,"Although the volatility of house prices is often ascribed to demand-side factors, constraints on housing supply have important and little-studied implications for housing dynamics. I illustrate the strong relationship between the volatility of house prices and the regulation of new housing supply. I then employ a dynamic structural model of housing investment to investigate the mechanisms underlying this relationship. I find that supply constraints increase volatility through two channels: First, regulation lowers the elasticity of new housing supply by increasing lags in the permit process and adding to the cost of supplying new houses on the margin. Second, geographic limitations on the area available for building houses, such as steep slopes and water bodies, lead to less investment on average relative to the size of the existing housing stock, leaving less scope for the supply response to attenuate the effects of a demand shock. My estimates and simulations confirm that regulation and geographic constraints play critical and complementary roles in decreasing the responsiveness of investment to demand shocks, which in turn amplifies house price volatility.

Hence sector specific rates are expected to be more informative in understanding the changes in industry level competitiveness. The objective of this paper is to compute Turkish manufacturing industry specific real effective exchange rates (RER) and inform about the features and trends in the industry-specific indexes. The study finds that trends in industry-specific rates differ both with respect to each other as well as to broad PPI and CPI based manufacturing industry real effective exchange rates. The relative real exchange rate analysis in the paper demonstrates that industries can be classified into three groups as those whose competitiveness deteriorates, enhances moderately and improves.","[Saygili, Hulya] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Gokhan] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Istanbul Sch Cent Banking, Istanbul, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Ministry of National Education - Turkey,"Saygili, H (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey.",hulya.saygili@tcmb.gov.tr; gokhan.yilmaz@tcmb.gov.tr,"Saygılı, Hülya/IZP-9221-2023; Saygılı, Hülya/AAH-1713-2022; Saygılı, Hülya/AFL-9601-2022","Saygılı, Hülya/0000-0001-9498-6111;",,,,,25,1,1,0,6,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

It defines over-indebtedness from a customer-protection perspective, based on the borrowers' sacrifices. We analyse the sacrifices borrowers experience and find that 30 per cent of borrowers are over-indebted. We then test risk management indicators of debt problems as predictors of over-indebtedness. Over-indebtedness is strongly related to delinquency and the debt-to-income ratio but not to debt amounts or to multiple borrowing. Although our model correctly predicts 72.6 per cent of cases, even the best indicators identify only a few over-indebted borrowers. Risk management is not enough to protect customers against over-indebtedness but the industry needs to measure customer experiences directly.","Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Ctr European Res Microfinance CERMi, Ctr Emile Bernheim, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Solvay SA; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Schicks, J (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Ctr European Res Microfinance CERMi, Ctr Emile Bernheim, Campus Solbosch,Av FD Roosevelt 50,CP 114-03, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",JSchicks@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,,44,31,34,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

However, by using the industry level data, we found the existence of the S-curve pattern in some of these industries. Most of these are small and intermediate goods industries.

Compared to individuals without mental health problems, individuals with mental health problems may have higher discount rates and derive greater utility from spending (i.e., retail therapy). If the mentally ill have these characteristics, we would expect them to purchase goods and services that give immediate enjoyment, sacrificing longer-term savings goals. However, mental health disorders may result in a sense of worthlessness and lethargy such that less utility is derived from spending and less energy is available for spending, which would give us the opposite prediction. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we generally find a negative effect of mental illness on household spending, although the specific effects vary by the measure of mental illness, by the expenditure category, and by gender and couple status. Of particular concern, single and married women with mental illness reduce spending on education, which suggests a long-term financial cost of mental illness. In addition, we find some evidence of retail therapy with respect to a mental health screen for single and married women and with respect to a mental diagnosis for married men. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Refuting the tenets of the semi-feudal thesis, we argue that unfree labour can go hand in hand with capitalism, and that it can be initiated and sustained by capital itself in order to accumulate surplus value. Going against the tenets of the de-proletarianization thesis, we suggest that bonded labour is not always the preferred working arrangement for capitalism. Bonded labour should be examined in connection with specific historical contexts, the changing nature of the economy, the evolution of political forces and modes of socialization. I argue that bonded labour results from a specific regime of accumulation characterized by cheap labour, increased domestic demand sustained through household debt, as well as modes of conflict, contestation and worker identity formation that engage with both governmental programmes and consumerism.","[Guerin, Isabelle] Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Guerin, Isabelle] French Inst Pondicherry, Inst Dev Res, Res Unit Dev & Societies, Pondicherry 605001, India",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Guérin, I (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",isabelle.guerin@ird.fr,"Guerin, Isabelle/AAU-4398-2021",,,,,,66,56,61,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

This tournament was introduced by the French academic system to select best publishers. For this competition, the scientific productivity was observed in a same period from 2005 to 2010 and competitors are selected and ranked by their relative performance in publications using the same criteria (National Scientific Research Center ranking). We construct a scientific production index and estimate productivity regressions using quantile regression. We control for individual characteristics, environmental context, initial publication performance (h index), in line with stylized facts and theoretical foundations like Lotka law and scientific life cycle productivity. The paper brings two novel dimensions in the literature. The first is done by controlling for the multi-task activities of tenure and associated professor when evaluating their scientific production. The second outcome of the paper consists to evaluate the impact of network spillover externalities induced by local competences accumulated in economics departments on each individual performance.","[Kossi, Yann; Sabatier, Mareva] Univ Lyon 2, CNRS, UMR 5824, Grp Anal & Theorie Econm, 93 Chemin Mouilles, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Lesueur, Jean-Yves] Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Lesueur, Jean-Yves] GATE Lyon St Etienne, CNRS, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Sabatier, Mareva] Univ Savoie, IREGE, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,"Kossi, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 2, CNRS, UMR 5824, Grp Anal & Theorie Econm, 93 Chemin Mouilles, F-69130 Ecully, France.",kossi@gate.cnrs.fr; lesueur@gate.cnrs.fr; mareva.sabatier@univ-savoie.fr,"Sabatier, Mareva/JJE-2340-2023",,,,,,35,0,0,0,13,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Using micro-level data from 19 developing countries, we examine the structural relationship between smoking behavior and advertising exposure and the reduced-form relationship between smoking and advertising bans. Instrumental variables are used to address the endogeneity of advertising exposure. Country-specific unobserved heterogeneity is further reduced by controlling for measures of antismoking sentiment and cigarette prices. After accounting for the endogeneity of advertising, we find that the positive correlation between smoking and advertising exposure in our sample can be largely explained by the disproportionately higher propensity of smokers to observe advertising rather than a direct causal effect of advertising on smoking.

Relatively little attention, however, has been given to the effects of context in negatively-framed VCM games even though this setting is relevant to a wide array of real world challenges, such as common pool resource use and pollution externalities. This study uses a carefully-controlled laboratory experiment to investigate the degree to which the context in which decisions are made influences decision making in a negatively-framed VCM laboratory experiment. The context treatments that we evaluate vary communication, voting, and the status quo of the initial endowment. Results indicate that providing groups the opportunity to communicate and vote significantly reduces choices that impose external costs. Importantly, the pro-social effects of communication and voting are strongest when the status quo endowment is the private account, which generates costs on other participants. This result suggests that the effect of the status quo endowment is a function of whether the social dilemma is framed positively or negatively when communication between participants is allowed.","[Messer, Kent D.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Suter, Jordan F.] Oberlin Coll, Dept Econ, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA; [Yan, Jubo] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",University of Delaware; University System of Ohio; Oberlin College; Cornell University,"Messer, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",messer@udel.edu,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020","Yan, Jubo/0000-0002-5333-8465",,,,,31,7,8,2,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The adverse selection also demonstrates that the pecking order theory is not supported by our empirical results. On the other hand, the evidence of the market timing theory is favorable for the Taiwan stock market especially for the period 1990 to 2001, suggesting that the results of this theory provide an explanation when our results do not support the pecking order hypothesis. However, the market timing theory does not apply in the period of 2002-2005. In other words, firms in Taiwan prefer issuing more debt rather than equity under low market performance.

We show that abnormal returns after insider transactions are positively correlated with country-level shareholder protection against expropriation by corporate insiders, which supports the information-content hypothesis. Market reaction to insider purchases increases with shareholder protection because shareholder protection enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of insiders' actions, and limits possibilities for direct profit diversion, so that more information is eventually reflected in stock prices. For insider sales, shareholder protection decreases their negative information content. We conjecture that this is due to the effect of greater transparency and trustworthiness strengthening the diversification and liquidity reasons for selling in better shareholder protection countries. We find limited support for the rent-extraction hypothesis that conjectures that shareholder protection is associated with insider trading dollar profits. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze the incentive effects of high-powered, performance-based contracts and their implications for program outcomes using panel data on Dutch cohorts of unemployed and disabled workers that were assigned to private social welfare providers in 2002 to 2005. We employ a difference-in-differences design that takes advantage of the fact that contracts gradually moved from partial performance-contingent pay to full (100 percent) performance-contingent contracting schemes. We develop explicit measures of selection into the programs and find evidence of cream skimming and other gaming activities on the part of providers, but little impact of these activities on program outcomes. Moving to a system with contract payments fully contingent on performance appears to increase job placements, but not job duration, for more readily employable workers.

First, we study the impact of oil price variables (change and volatility) on stock market returns under regime shifts in the case of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. We employ a Markov regime-switching model to generate regime probabilities for oil market variables. We use two state Markov switching models: crisis regime and non-crisis regime. Second, we investigate the non-linear relationship among oil price, interest rates and inflation rates before and during the subprime crisis. We consider several Archimedean copula models with different tail dependence structures, namely, Gumbel, Clayton and Frank copulas. We find evidence that the relationship between GCC stock market returns and OPEC oil market volatility is regime dependent (excluding Oman in the low volatility state). We also find that the dependence structure between inflation rates and crude oil prices is asymmetric and orients toward the upper side during the recent financial crisis. Furthermore, we find evidence of significant symmetric dependence between crude oil prices and the short-term interest rate during the financial crisis. These paper's results have practical significance and important implications for both GCC economic policy and financial stability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

By applying the average treatment effect on the treated estimation and its sensitivity tests to the Japanese survey data, we obtained the following findings. First, we observed no evidence that THS work has a positive impact on the probability of being permanently employed in subsequent waves, when compared to directly hired part-time jobs. Rather, THS workers suffer from a significantly higher probability of being unemployed, at least at some point over the next 2 years, than directly hired part-time workers do. At the same time, however, we also found weak evidence that THS workers have a lower probability of being unemployed than those who were originally unemployed. We conclude that THS work in Japan has failed to provide a stepping stone to permanent employment, although it may have provided employment opportunities to those who were otherwise unemployed.

Evidence from Japan's Emergency Credit Guarantee Program,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Loan guarantee; Relationship lending; Small business credit,UNIVERSAL BANKING; PROPENSITY SCORE; INVESTMENT; POLICY; AVAILABILITY; MARKETS; DEFAULT,"This paper examines the effectiveness of Japan's Emergency Credit Guarantee (ECG) Program set up during the financial turmoil following the failure of Lehman Brothers, in increasing credit availability and improving the ex-post performance of small businesses. In particular, using a unique firm-bank matched dataset, the paper examines whether lending relationships enhanced or dampened the effects of the ECG program. It is found that the ECG program significantly improved credit availability for firms using the program. However, when it was a relationship lender (main bank) that extended an ECG loan, the increased availability was partially, if not completely, offset by a decrease in non-ECG loans by the same bank. Further, propensity score matching estimations show that the ex-post performance of firms that received ECG loans from the main bank deteriorated more than that of firms that received non-ECG loans. We do not find such loan substitution or performance deterioration effects when a non-main bank extended ECG loans. Our findings suggest that close firm-bank relationships may have perverse effects on the efficacy of public credit guarantees. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We also study the allocation of surplus created by the entry of a new faculty member and show that faculties with symmetric status distributions maximize their joint surplus under majority voting.","[Prufer, Jens] Tilburg Univ, TILEC, CentER, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Walz, Uwe] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Appl Microecon & Management, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Walz, Uwe] CFS, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Tilburg University; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Prüfer, J (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, TILEC, CentER, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",j.prufer@uvt.nl; uwalz@econ.uni-frankfurt.de,"Prufer, Jens/R-1934-2019; Walz, Uwe/D-1926-2013",,,,,,20,5,7,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2013,155.0,3-4,,,,,507,529,,10.1007/s11127-011-9885-9,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,138NQ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318515700017,0

Before competing in loan rates banks choose their capital structure, thereby making an imperfect commitment to a loan capacity. It is shown that due to this imperfect commitment, regulatory requirements not only increase the marginal cost of loan supply, but can also have a collusive effect resulting in increased profits. This paper derives the threshold value from which capital requirements can turn one round Bertrand competition into a two-stage interaction with capacity commitment, leading to Cournot outcomes. Therefore, it provides theoretical support for the applicability of the Cournot approach when modeling imperfect loan competition.","[Schliephake, Eva; Kirstein, Roland] Otto Von Guericke Univ, Magdeburg, Germany",Otto von Guericke University,"Schliephake, E (通讯作者)，Otto Von Guericke Univ, Magdeburg, Germany.",Eva.Schliephake@ovgu.de; Roland.Kirstein@ovgu.de,"Kirstein, Roland/G-5176-2013","Kirstein, Roland/0000-0002-1375-5862; Schliephake, Eva/0000-0002-9685-6182",,,,,48,11,13,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The Chinese central government gives detailed guidelines to local governments on public finance, but, ironically, their expenditure assignment is far from being well-regulated. Differences in fiscal decentralization on the expenditure side are enormous among local governments. Employing a panel dataset of 1995-2006, we provide empirical evidence that transfer dependency negatively affects expenditure decentralization in Chinese local governments.

We propose that money is one such source capable of soothing existential anxiety. We hypothesize that death anxiety would amplify the value attributed to money, and that the presence of money would alleviate death anxiety. Study 1 indicated that individuals reminded of their mortality overestimated the size of coins and monetary notes. In Study 2, participants induced to think about their mortality used higher monetary standards to define a person or family as rich than those in the control condition. Study 3 revealed that people reminded of death desired higher compensation for waiving the immediate payment of money. Finally, Study 4 showed that priming participants with the concept of money reduced self-reported fear of death.

The evidence for 1999 indicates that communities are most likely to offer one or more of these business development incentives if their residents have low incomes, if they are located close to state borders, and if their states have troubled political cultures. Ten percent greater median household income is associated with a 3.2% lower probability of offering incentives; 10% greater distance from a state border is associated with a 1.0% lower probability of offering incentives; and a 10% higher rate at which government officials are convicted of federal corruption crimes is associated with a 1.2% greater probability of offering business incentives. TIFs are the preferred incentive of communities whose residents have household incomes between $25,000 and $75,000; whereas TIFs are much less commonly offered by communities whose residents have household incomes below $25,000. The need to finance TIFs out of incremental tax revenues may make it infeasible for many of the poorest of communities to use TIFs for local business development.

This paper characterizes the optimal capital accumulation in a two-period OLG model where lifetime is risky and varies across individuals. We compare two long-run social optima: (1) the average utilitarian optimum, where steady-state average welfare is maximized; (2) the egalitarian optimum, where the welfare of the worst-off at the steady-state is maximized. It is shown that, under plausible conditions, the egalitarian optimum involves a higher capital and a lower fertility than the utilitarian optimum. Those inequalities hold also in a second-best framework where survival conditions are exogenously linked to the capital level.","[Ponthiere, Gregory] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Ponthiere, Gregory] Ecole Normale Super, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

In the first one, job information flows between individuals having a link with each other and we show that an equilibrium with a clustering of workers with the same status is likely to emerge since, in the long run, employed workers tend to be friends with employed workers. In the second model, individuals interact with both strong and weak ties and decide how much time they spend with each of them. As in Granovetter, this model stresses the strength of weak ties in finding a job because they involve a secondary ring of acquaintances who have contacts with networks outside ego's network and therefore offer new sources of information on job opportunities. We then discuss some policy implications showing how these models can explain why ethnic minorities tend to experience higher unemployment rate than workers from the majority group.","[Zenou, Yves] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Zenou, Yves] Univ Maine, GAINS, Orono, ME 04469 USA",Stockholm University; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Zenou, Y (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",yves.zenou@ne.su.se,,"Zenou, Yves/0000-0001-6516-0812",,,,,43,3,3,1,32,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

However, existing studies lack assessments of combinations of weather parameters and direct links to projected climate change. With this paper, we investigate potential effects of climate change on mode choice and distances travelled in the Randstad Holland. Based on approiximate combinations of weather conditions projected for 2050, we select seasons from the last decade, to represent current and future climate conditions. By using data from the Dutch National Travel survey for the selected seasons, we analyse travel behaviour under 2050-climate conditions compared to travel behaviour under present climate conditions. Results show increasing usage and travelled distances for open-air transport modes in milder and wetter 2050-winters, mainly at the expense of the car, whereas in hotter summers with more extreme precipitation patterns reversed effects are observed. Year-round analyses of effects from 2050-climate conditions show a flattening out of seasonal differences in modal split, while for cycling mode shares and distances travelled significantly increase.

Liquidity increases around positive and neutral messages and decreases around negative messages. Available order book depth as well as the trading intensity increases around all news.

By using the system-GMM estimator for linear dynamic panel data models on a sample covering up to 169 countries, and 5-year periods from 1960 to 2004, we find that higher degrees of political instability are associated with lower growth rates of GDP per capita. Regarding the channels of transmission, we find that political instability adversely affects growth by lowering the rates of productivity growth and, to a smaller degree, physical and human capital accumulation. Finally, economic freedom and ethnic homogeneity are beneficial to growth, while democracy may have a small negative effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we examine the extent to which nonprime mortgage borrowers prioritize payments on their monthly mortgage over credit card debt obligations over a 9-year period (200109). Before the recent financial crisis, our default order data suggest that consumers were eight times more likely to prioritize payments on mortgage debt over credit card payments. As of late 2008, in contrast, the similar consumers were just as likely to default on mortgage debt as on credit card debt. Our results reveal that important explanations for the observed changes in the pecking order of defaults include: strategic mortgage default behavior among consumers with low and negative housing equity, illiquidity in the form of available credit, the rising costs of servicing mortgage debt, and lowered underwriting standards and the greater penetration of nontraditional mortgage products. These results support the importance of strategic consumer behavior, but also emphasize that the changes in the pecking order of defaults have come about because of ability-to-pay considerations.","[Andersson, Fredrik; Chomsisengphet, Souphala; Glennon, Dennis] Off Comptroller Currency, Credit Risk Anal Div, Washington, DC 20219 USA; [Li, Feng] Off Comptroller Currency, Enterprise Risk Anal Div, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,"Andersson, F (通讯作者)，Off Comptroller Currency, Credit Risk Anal Div, Washington, DC 20219 USA.",Fredrik.Andersson@occ.treas.gov; Souphala.Chomsisengphet@occ.treas.gov; Dennis.Glennon@occ.treas.gov; Feng.Li@occ.treas.gov,,,,,,,16,19,21,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Whether consumers are nutritionally vulnerable depends on the elasticity of calories with respect to rice prices. Common demand models applied to household survey and market price data ignore quality substitution and force all adjustment onto the quantity (calorie) margin. This paper uses data from Vietnam on market prices, food quantity and quality. A 10% increase in the relative price of rice reduces household calorie consumption by less than 2% but this elasticity would be wrongly estimated to be more than twice as large if quality substitution is ignored.

Should airports be prohibited, as an EU directive intends, from charging differential input prices to airlines? We set out a model of upstream airports and downstream airlines with varying countervailing power and pricing structures. Our major findings are: (a) an increase in upstream concentration or in the degree of differentiation between airports always increases the landing fee; (b) the effect of countervailing power, via an increase in downstream concentration, lowers landing fees, but typically does not pass through to consumers; (c) with Cournot competition, uniform landing fees are always higher than discriminatory fees.

The paper finds that, based on actual outcomes in South Australia over the period from 2006 to 2011, the exercise of market power is likely to result in a preference for investment in conventional fossil fuel based electricity generation, relative to investment in wind farms. It also concludes that while wind farms have taken market share from conventional generators, wind farms are not likely to have reduced spot prices in South Australia to the extent that seems apparent in electricity markets in other countries where wind farms are as prevalent but market power is less significant. The implication of these conclusions is that higher subsidies will be needed to ensure that the Australian Government's renewable electricity targets will be met, than would be the case if the exercise of market power did not have these distributional effects.

Writing down the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio will reduce the present value of future payments on the loan, but will also reduce the probability of default, thereby saving foreclosure losses. The optimal trade-off of these two countervailing effects will pinpoint the optimal LTV at which the loan must be reset. We present a simple barrier option decomposition of the loan value that makes the optimization of LTV easy to implement. An extension of the model is shown to account for varying growth rate assumptions about house prices. The model in this paper specifically accounts for the homeowner's willingness to pay, and uses the framework to model shared-appreciation mortgages (SAMs). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, we find no significant difference in either level of CEO pay or the use of equity-based pay between U.S. and non-U.S. firms exposed to international and U.S. capital, product, and labor markets.

Of particular interest in this study are the requirements for annual audit and reporting of management's and auditor's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control for banks with $500 million or more in total assets (raised to $1 billion in 2005). We study the impact of these requirements on banks' risk-taking behavior prior to the recent financial crisis and the consequent implications for bank failure and financial trouble during the crisis period. Using a sample of 1138 banks, we provide evidence that banks required to comply with the FDICIA internal control requirements have lower risk taking in the pre-crisis period. Specifically, the volatility of net interest margin, the volatility of earnings, and Z score show less risk-taking behavior. Furthermore, these banks are less likely to experience failure and financial trouble during the crisis period. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike most of the literature on resource economics, but in line with ecological models, we allow the different biological processes of survival and recruitment to be affected differently by environmental uncertainties. We show that the overall effect of uncertainty on the optimal size of a fish stock is ambiguous, depending on the prudence of the value function. For the case of a risk-neutral fishery manager, the overall effect depends on the relative magnitude of two opposing effects, the 'convex-cost effect' and the 'gambling effect'. We apply the analysis to the Baltic cod and the North Sea herring fisheries, concluding that for risk neutral agents the net effect of environmental uncertainties on the optimal size of these fish stocks is negative, albeit small in absolute value. Under risk aversion, the effect on optimal stock size is positive for sufficiently high coefficients of constant relative risk aversion.","[Kapaun, Ute; Quaas, Martin F.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Kapaun, U (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Olshausenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",kapaun@economics.uni-kiel.de,"Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012","Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829",,,,,30,28,29,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The disagreement events are typically precipitated by stock price movements and display signed option volume in the direction that tends to eliminate the disagreements. These results show that option price quotes do not contain economically significant information about future stock prices beyond what is already reflected in current stock prices, i.e., no economically significant price discovery occurs in the option market.

For high social costs of bank failure, the optimal capital requirements are higher but less cyclically varying, like those currently targeted by Basel III.","[Repullo, Rafael; Suarez, Javier] CEMFI, Madrid 28014, Spain",,"Suarez, J (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Casado del Alisal 5, Madrid 28014, Spain.",suarez@cemfi.es,"Suarez, Javier/T-5311-2019","Suarez, Javier/0000-0002-2012-3900",,,,,58,146,176,7,94,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Whereas tropical and subtropical regions are expected to suffer severely from the effects of climate change, the impacts in northern latitudes should remain relatively moderate. However, regions are not self-sufficient, and the costs of climate change can spread across regions through international trade. I study the international spillover of climate impacts within a regionalised, climate-sensitive, dynamic computable general equilibrium model of the world economy. Using data from a global climate model shows that the world regions face welfare losses between 0.6 and 2.1 % due to climate change. I also show that climate change affects terms of trade and sectoral competitiveness. By means of a decomposition method, the extent of spillover impacts through international trade can be identified. Spillover impacts significantly affect, either positively or negatively, the total costs of climate change for a region. For regions with low exposure to climate change and high adaptive capacities, spillover effects are responsible for a 1/6 of the total cost of climate change.","ZEW Mannheim, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Schenker, O (通讯作者)，ZEW Mannheim, L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",schenker@zew.de,"Schenker, Oliver/AAX-2286-2021",,,,,,32,13,16,3,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

First, there is a significant positive relationship between board members with professional affiliations and solvency. Second, there is a negative relationship between board members with political connections and efficiency as well as solvency. These findings indicate that types of directors on the board are important as they bring specific critical resources to match the specific environmental needs facing the organizations.

I use birthplace-cluster distance as an instrumental variable for the incidence of clustering of prominent classical composers born between 1750 and 1899. I find that geographic clustering causally impacts productivity: composers were writing around one additional influential work every 3 years they spent in a cluster. The best composers and those who migrated to Paris appear to be the greatest beneficiaries of clustering.

The meeting point between foreign trade development mode and economic development mode is to guarantee high employment rate in the above contact mechanism. It follows that the primary objective of changing foreign trade mode is still to ensure enough high employment rate before domestic demand really starts. It argues that inappropriate transforming countermeasures of foreign trade mode will bring about serious employment and growth negative effects under many domestic and international constraints in the face of Chinese foreign trade. Practical experience shows that the reasonable transforming path of foreign trade development mode in China is business mode innovation under double binding of ensuring steady economic growth and enough employment rates.","[Chen Qiuyun] Jiujiang Univ, Sch Accountancy, Jiujiang 332005, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiujiang University,,,"chen, qy/JXM-3217-2024",,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,HAWTHORN EAST,"STE 4, LEVEL 3, 695 BURKE RD, HAWTHORN EAST, VC 3123, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9874593-3-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,201,206,,,,,,6,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BA4GU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335704700029,0

Our methodology is based on instability tests recently proposed in Kejriwal and Perron (2008, 2010) as well as the cointegration tests developed in Arai and Kurozumi (2007) and Kejriwal (2008). The results obtained are consistent with the existence of linear cointegration between the long and the short run Spanish interest rates. However, our empirical results also show that the cointegrating relationship has changed over time. In particular, the Kejriwal-Perron tests for testing multiple structural breaks in cointegrated regression models suggest a model of two regimes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, empirical analyses of wholesale electricity spot markets do not confirm this simple rule. Pass-through rates can be much lower or much higher than one and can sharply vary over time or across countries and markets. In several cases, such rates are not significantly different from zero and can even be negative. Until now, only a few authors have tried to offer a theoretical justification for the divergence between the assumptions used in simulation models and the results of empirical evidence. The main finding of these theoretical studies is that, when the characteristics of specific energy markets (e. g., organization, vertical and horizontal structure, technology mix, firms' strategies) are adequately taken into account, the existence and degree of imperfect competition can explain why pass-through rates can vary widely and can even assume negative values. Therefore, if the models carried out to estimate the performance and costs of environmental policies are used to support policy decisions, ignoring the role of imperfect competition and the characteristics of energy markets may induce significant distortions in estimations of the impact of public action and may lead to incorrect policy calibration.","[Gulli, Francesco] Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Chernyavs'ka, Liliya] European Investment Bank, L-2950 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",Bocconi University,"Gullì, F (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",francesco.gulli@unibocconi.it; liliyachernyavska@googlemail.com,,,,,,,14,11,11,1,19,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

In order to test the hypotheses, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) has been employed to analyze the study conducted in 352 SMEs in Pakistan. The proposed model leads to very useful insights as it proposes that SMEs must not ignore the importance of Innovation especially technological innovation and Relational learning in order to achieve higher performance.

Our results suggest that states with community rating and guaranteed issue regulations had significantly smaller increases in the fraction of taxpayers reporting some amount of self-employment income as a result of a decrease in the after-tax price of self-employed health insurance.

It is overt that in most conventional emergency alert/notification systems (BAS), call-taking can be difficult sometimes while reporting an emergency particularly if the person on the phone is a close relative of the dying patient and is experiencing panic or fear, if they are out on the street or on the highway and do not know the exact address of the emergency, or perhaps the immediate person to save the day is either a dumb, speech impaired or a deaf, hearing-impaired person. This is why an alternative system is required that will address these issues and in addition complement the existing system by bringing simplicity in locating emergency scene. The Emergency Medical Service (EMS) industry is investigating complementary and alternative methods for requesting assistance and contacting like the Enhanced-911. One such method being investigated is SMS messaging. This research work is focused on designing an m-Health application that uses mobile phones running java as its interface to build an inexpensive and complementing means to notify ambulance stations of accident locations for swift and timely first aid attention compared to others that are built into vehicles (e.g. GM Onstar) or others strictly for smart phones. This notification system engages GSM's SMS services and Google Map APIs in transmitting the exact location of where emergency service is needed to an ambulance point.","[Isibor, Oses; Omoregbe, Nicholas; Adewumi, Adewole] Covenant Univ, Ota, Nigeria",Covenant University,,osesisibor@gmail.com; nomorebge@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; wole.adewumi@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"Adewumi, Adewole/M-8695-2013","Adewumi, Adewole/0000-0002-8115-8824",,,,,18,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,2081,2092,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500206,0

We find that NO/S proxies for a short-horizon component of risk premia not identified in prior work. Higher levels of NO/S forecast lower excess returns on equities and many types of bonds, at horizons from one month to one year. These effects are generally robust to the inclusion of common return predictors and are significant on an out-of-sample basis as well.

One of them is the Gaussian curvature formula, which can be constructed only with the use of Maurer-Cartan equations. These equations are based on Cartan's idea of moving frame, which is used in many parts of mathematics, especially in differential geometry. The other part of the text is devoted to Mean curvature formula deduced with the use of Cartan moving frame and Weingarten map. Thanks to these methods, not only Mean, but also Gaussian curvature formula can be deduced. Studying of Gaussian curvature in general form on Monge surfaces only with the use of Maurer-Cartan equations is not a simple problem but essential in differential geometry. Deduction of Mean curvature with the use of Weingarten map of given general Monge surface is essential in geometry, too. Gaussian and Mean curvature formulas of general Monge surface are common results however, methods of their deduction are especially essential.","[Kanka, Milos] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Math, Prague 14800 4, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,kanka@vse.cz,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,561,569,,,,,,9,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100057,0

I extend Rubinstein's (1982) original solution of the bargaining problem for two self-interested bargainers to this strategic situation. Bargainers still reach agreement in the first period and their bargaining shares increase with the strength of their own envy. As both bargainers' envy diminishes, the agreed partition converges to the Rubinstein division. If equally patient bargaining parties exhibit similar envy, then the agreed partition is tilted away from the Rubinstein division toward the equal division. Notably, the potential sensation of envy also boosts the share of the eventually envy-free party who leaves the bargaining with the larger share under the agreed partition. This gain in bargaining strength through envy can result in a bargaining outcome that is more unequal than predicted by the Rubinstein division.","[Kohler, Stefan] Charite, Med Ctr, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin,"Kohler, S (通讯作者)，Charite, Med Ctr, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany.",stefan.kohler@charite.de,"Kohler, Stefan/GPT-0877-2022","Kohler, Stefan/0000-0003-1365-7506",,,,,28,12,12,0,12,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

Through the research it was established that in Kenya the commodity markets operate in a simplified auction system with no clear price discovery mechanism. The lack of an active and transparent market is a serious challenge in terms of the application of fair value to biological assets. Consequently most of the farmers prefer to model the market information available. In the light of the diverse nature of agricultural produce, this article recommends virtual trading and development of commodity futures in order to reduce the market access cost, to improve accessibility to market information and to transform the role of middle traders to that of market linkages.","[Maina, P.

We can construct the probability model for the wage distribution using empirical data by using general probabilistic approach. The second possibility is to use time series analysis for the model building. Both methods are then combined to estimate the future values of characteristics with the aid of trend analysis. The average wage for each year is compared with the minimum wage. We consider inflation when creating the model. We compute the Gini index for each year as a measure of inequality of wages in the CR. For comparison purposes, we use quantile measures such as median, lower and upper quartiles, and 10% and 90% percentiles.","[Marek, Lubos] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,marek@vse.cz,"Marek, Lubos/HRC-4615-2023","Marek, Lubos/0000-0003-4761-1936",,,,,13,31,31,0,5,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,947,958,,,,,,12,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100093,0

The analysis is based on results from four focus groups of women aged 67-89 living in Oslo, Norway's capital. Mobility is defined here as the ability to choose where and when to travel and which activities to participate in outside the home in everyday life. To understand the potential opportunities for mobility of older women in urban areas, we proposed a conceptual framework in which opportunities for mobility in old age can be analyzed consistently with the capability approach to wellbeing that was developed by Amartya Sen. With its focus on the importance of choice and individual action, the capability approach is especially relevant for making explicit how opportunities for mobility is not a fixed structure but is something that is managed, shaped and directed by the individual in this context, older women. The study enabled the identification of individual and contextual factors that influence the opportunities for mobility as well as strategies developed for overcoming barriers to mobility in old age. The study shows how individual resources, contextual conditions and strategies are interlinked and how they form a pool of capabilities for mobility, that is, opportunities for mobility that older women can draw onto mediate and shape their mobility.

As the example of the good practice were surveyed municipalities awarded by Golden ribbon in the competition The Village of the Year. The objective of this competition is to enhance the interest of local people in the fate of their municipality, because exactly the cohesion of the inhabitants with the village and active participation on the development activities are considered to be key aspects which contribute to the successful and sustainable development. These principles have foundation in endogenous model of the development, which is nowadays the leading approach towards the regional or local development. Theoretical background builds on social capital concept, because especially this intangible capital supports the cooperation which additionally enables easier achievement of the set of collective objectives. Research is based on the content analysis of the documents published by the organizers or participants of the competition. Various brochures, information and propagation materials contain the information about the best practices in rural development, which can be shared by rural villages. The authors search for common features, which are characteristic for the winning villages, and indicate social capital presence. We suppose that social capital is better observable in awarded municipalities, and plays significant role in the villages' development. Findings from the documents are compared to the theoretical social capital concepts. On the basis of the synthesis of the gained results, we recommend to municipalities to hold collective actions which enhance the cooperation and social capital, hence the quality of life in a village.","[Pechrova, Marie] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Boukalova, Katerina] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Human, FEM, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Pechrová, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",pechrova@pef.czu.cz; boukalova@pef.czu.cz,"Pechrová, Marie Šimpachová/X-8982-2018",,,,,,28,0,0,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,290,302,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300026,0

There is little research in marketing, however, on the effectiveness of political advertising at this level. In this study, we conduct an experimental analysis of advertisements used during the 2008 campaign to mandate new animal welfare standards in California (Proposition 2). Using subjects' willingness-to-pay for cage-free eggs as a proxy for their likely voting behavior, we investigate whether advertising provides real information to likely voters, and thus sharpens their existing attitudes toward the issue, or whether advertising can indeed change preferences. We find that advertising in support of Proposition 2 was more effective in raising subjects' willingness-to-pay for cage-free eggs than ads in opposition were in reducing it, but we also find that ads in support of the measure reduce the dispersion of preferences and thus polarize attitudes toward the initiative. More generally, political ads are found to contain considerably more hype than real information in the sense of Johnson and Myatt [Johnson, J. P., and D. P. Myatt.

But do private schools make students better or do they simply cream skim better students? In this article I take advantage of the remarkable fact that in many districts in India a majority of students attend private schools. As the private share of school enrollment increases, cream skimming becomes less plausible as the explanation for a higher rate of achievement in private schools. Evidence for cream skimming is found when the private share of schooling is low, in the range of 015%, and thus private schools have a large public pool from which to skim. But the private effect on achievement does not appear to diminish greatly even in districts where more than 70% of students are in private schools. Most importantly, mean scores taken over the entire population of students, private and public, increase with the share of private schooling. These findings support a significant productivity effect of private schools.

Findings showed a significant relationship between ethics and materialism exists as respondents who are reported to be ethical were also materialistic. These variables were also found to be significantly related to purchase intention. Ethical and materialistic consumers were less likely to report prior purchase of counterfeits. Also, gender moderates this relationship as females were reported to be more concerned with these two variables when identifying their purchasing intentions. The results show that increasing awareness and knowledge of undergraduate students on the impact of counterfeiting can lead to more ethical purchasing behaviors. However, limitations where majority respondents were Chinese and are only from limited areas makes generalizing findings to all undergraduate students across Malaysia inappropriate. This study further elaborates the demand of counterfeit goods through the effects of ethics and materialism.

The number of entrepreneurs in a country can be increased by several means including education. However, entrepreneurship had been considered a subject mainly for students with a predominantly business background. Nowadays, entrepreneurship is gaining much ground even among other disciplines with a non- business background. The aim of this research is to compare the entrepreneurial characteristics of architecture and building students of Covenant University, Nigeria. Students responded to a 10-item questionnaire. Mann-Whitney test was used to test the hypothesis of the study. The findings revealed that there is no statistically significant difference between the entrepreneurial characteristics of creativity, self-confidence /awareness, risk - taking propensity and need for achievement of architecture and building students. The findings also revealed that most of the students have a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship. Although Covenant University is already empowering all its graduates entrepreneurially to contribute significantly to the socio-economic development of the country, it is suggested that government should put institutional frameworks in place that would drive the teaching of entrepreneurial courses in other higher institutions of learning so as to facilitate the achievement of its goal of increasing entrepreneurship by 2020.","[Tunji-Olayeni, P.

Access to output markets is a key factor in generating higher incomes. The rise of modern markets (supermarkets in particular) is generally viewed as positive for the rural poor, although most commentators accede that there are challenges to be overcome in obtaining access to such markets. These challenges are generally perceived as supply-side issues: That is, the fault for market exclusion lies largely with small producers their production methods, their business organisation and their location - rather than with these markets themselves. This study asserts that much of the research that has been undertaken in this area is in fact incomplete, because it has excluded two key issues: The likely impact of the dominant supermarket business model on small farmers; and the actual position of small farmers in those countries with high levels of supermarket concentration. A closer examination of the supermarket model suggests it is inherently hostile towards smaller producers. The South African food retail market structure resembles that of industrialised countries rather than developing countries. Therefore, we should expect that the position of South African small farmers vis-a-vis supermarkets is similar to that of small farmers in industrialised countries, who are increasingly excluded from these value chains.","[van der Heijden, T.] Univ Witwatersrand, Publ Affairs Res Inst, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Vink, N.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; Stellenbosch University,"van der Heijden, T (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Publ Affairs Res Inst, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",tracy@pari.org.za; nv@sun.ac.za,"Vink, Nick/K-5330-2013","Vink, Nick/0000-0002-5874-0939",,,,,47,25,30,0,24,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2013,52.0,1,,,,,68,86,,10.1080/03031853.2013.778466,0.0,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,111TG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316543000004,0

This movement towards addressing consumers' demand for food products with more advanced quality attributes has led to increasingly complex food qualification processes and a proliferation of standards. Accompanying these changes in the agro-food system is a growing consumer concern for food safety and quality. One important attribute of quality is the origin of a food product. This paper focuses on lamb originating from the Karoo region of South Africa and tests consumers' willingness to pay a premium for this specific origin attribute of the product. A random nth price auction was conducted to obtain willingness to pay estimates for a premium on a 500g packet of certified Karoo lamb loin chops. Various demographic and behavioural variables were linked to participants' individual bids in order to determine the possible influence of these variables on participants' bidding behaviour. A general positive willingness to pay for certified Karoo lamb was observed, with an average premium of R21.80/kg recorded for loin chops. The impact of additional information was clearly visible as bids increased substantially after additional information regarding the product was introduced.","[van Zyl, K.; Kirsten, J.

We confirm the general conclusion of a positive association between analyst coverage and stock return synchronicity measured by a firm's R-2 in China. The findings from star analysts, however, show that star analyst coverage actually decreases stock return synchronicity. We contend that the firm-specific human capital in star analysts helps the analysts overcome the challenges of information production in an emerging market. The superior firm-specific human capital argument of star analysts is further supported by the negative association of star analysts' firm-specific experiences and stock return synchronicity. Our conclusions are robust to different specifications of star analyst presence and different definitions of analysts' firm-specific experiences.

The subjective nature of TA makes its definitions inconsistent in different studies and there is no uniform framework available for assessing reliability of technical trading rules. To fill the research gap, we design a scientific reliability analysis framework for technical trading rules, which is based on statistical methods (e.g., two tailed t-test) and conditional random field model (a powerful model for dealing with a time series with hidden states). Compared with the trading strategy without TA (i.e., buy-and-hold strategy), the effectiveness of TA can be tested by employing this framework. This framework also improves the reliability of technical trading rules by combining data mining techniques.

As credit purchase and logistics finance make great contribution to the successful business operation, these concepts get more and more attention in commercial field. Credit purchase mode brings great benefits to both suppliers and retailers. It helps retailers purchase more products with less capital, reduce the capital cost of stock, and satisfy more demand to improve the customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, the mode can help suppliers expand its sales scale, gain economic benefits, attract more customers, and form long-term cooperation relationship with their customers. A multi-period dynamic programming model is built to help form the strategies of retailers based on credit trades between suppliers and retailers in this paper. And the objective function of the model is to realize profit maximization. Based on the further analysis of the model, it is successful to find some good propositions and lemmas which make it accessible to the optimal solution. There are three decisions in every period constitute the solution of the model, including whether purchase on credit or not, whether repay the loan or not, and the inventory level after purchasing. To maximize the gross profit of several periods, it is necessary to pick out the optimal solution from several possible solutions.

The players only engage in destructive activities after productive effort reaches a threshold and do not increase their productive effort beyond this threshold. This result is consistent with contests in which participants increase effort in sabotage and dirty tricks more than on productive effort when the stakes are high (i.e., when the prize is high).

This framework is based on a multi-sector equilibrium model with sector-specific frictions in the form of taxes on sectoral factor inputs. Our framework is flexible for the assumption on preferences or aggregate production functions. Moreover, this framework is consistent with that commonly used in productivity analysis. I apply this framework to measure the extent to which resource misallocation explains the difference in aggregate productivity across developed countries. I find that around 9 percentage points of the difference in the measured aggregate productivity between Japan and the US can be accounted for by resource misallocation. Using the framework.

We find that in times of severe funding constraints, the need to raise financial resources becomes the principal incentive behind CRT. We document some beneficial effects of CRT on the economy, since the funds released through CRT are subsequently invested by banks to sustain credit supply, also in recession. However, we report higher overall riskiness in banks that engage intensively in loans sales and securitization, which translates into higher default rates during the crisis. Interestingly, the benefits and drawbacks of CRT are much stronger for loan sales and securitization than for credit derivatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A Business-as-Usual scenario is compared with five scenarios in which greenhouse gases emissions are taxed, at different levels. The elasticity of China's emissions is estimated by pooling observations from all scenarios and comparing them with the elasticity of emissions in OECD countries. China has a higher elasticity than the OECD for a carbon tax lower than US$50 per ton of CO2-eq. For higher taxes, emissions in OECD economies are more elastic than in China. Our best guess indicates that China would need to introduce a tax equal to about US$750 per ton of CO2-eq in 2050 to achieve the Major Economies Forum goal set for mid-century. In our preferred estimates, the discounted cost of following the 2 degrees C trajectory is equal to 5.4 per cent and to 2.7 per cent of GDP in China and the OECD, respectively.","[Carraro, Carlo] Univ Venice, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Carraro, Carlo] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Rome, Italy; [Massetti, Emanuele] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, FEEM, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Massetti, Emanuele] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, CMCC, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Fondazione Mattei; Yale University; Yale University,"Carraro, C (通讯作者)，Univ Venice, I-30123 Venice, Italy.",carlo.carraro@feem.it; emanuele.massetti@yale.edu,"Carraro, Carlo/A-7071-2014","Carraro, Carlo/0000-0002-8403-2231",,,,,29,11,12,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

When did firms become more different? Time-varying firm-specific volatility in Japan We document how firm-specific volatility in sales, earnings and employment growth evolved year by year in Japan. Our volatility measure also indicates the evolution of firm turnover. We find that patterns in firm-specific volatility have changed when macroeconomic circumstances have. Firm turnover declined during the economic stagnation of 1991-1997. The deep downturn of fiscal years 1998-2002 coincided with a substantial increase in turnover in market, profit and employment shares. Firm volatility tended to decline during the recovery after 2002. We assess whether the rise in firm turnover and deep downturn in 1998-2002 indicate that after a period of stagnation, weak firms were finally allowed to shrink or fail. Our evidence suggests that the widening in the firm growth distribution at that time did not reflect weak firms shrinking relative to healthy firms, indicating that the two recessions in 1998-2002 were not cleansing.

However, cross-state data reveal large unemployment differences. An equilibrium multi-location model with stochastic worker-location match productivity and within-location trading frictions can account for these facts. In the model, some workers move to, or stay in, a location with high unemployment because they are more productive there than elsewhere. According to the model, labor mobility and aggregate unemployment are negatively related. This prediction is in stark contrast to standard sectoral reallocation theory, but consistent with the US data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A two-stage least squares model with instrumental variables controls for the simultaneous relationship between efficiency and market power. Citing developments in efficiency modelling, efficiencies are drawn from the random parameters stochastic frontier function model that treats unobserved heterogeneity, whilst conventional Lerner indices and the efficiency adjusted Lerner index proxy market power. The quiet life hypothesis is firmly rejected after various robustness checks. To test if bank restructuring and governance changes affect efficiency and market power, I use a difference-in-differences approach to determine the impact of bank privatisation and foreign acquisition of local banks on efficiency and market power. Privatisation is preferred over foreign acquisition though its impact is concentrated on efficiency rather than market power. The evidence suggests that bank restructuring has promoted competition at the expense of market power and yielded efficiency gains at banks under conditions of monopolistic competition.

I develop a microstructure model suitable to describe the Brazilian FX market, an emerging economy frequently subjected to sudden stops in capital flows. The model introduces two major changes relative to previous microstructure models. First, dealers may decide to hold overnight positions in the FX market if they find it profitable to do so. Second, customers' demand for foreign exchange is a function of macroeconomic fundamentals, including contemporaneous feedback from exchange rate movements. The main predictions of the model are supported by a unique data set, covering all transactions between dealers and customers from the official Brazilian FX market from July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2003 (a time period in which Brazil suffered two severe external liquidity shocks).

We point out that trade liberalization of EG might in fact lead to less stringent pollution taxes, which can result in an actual rise in pollution levels. We then show that the environmental effectiveness objective of this trade reform can be achieved when the regulator uses quantitative abatement standards as an alternative pollution policy instrument.

In the theoretical framework, a representative worker maximizes expected intertemporal utility by choosing the optimal fraction of evaded contributions. The model predicts that under the assumption of liquidity constraints evasion may be optimal even when it has negative implications on the budget constraint, because it provides a way of weakening the liquidity constraint. In particular, evasion is decreasing in the individual's survival probability and in the Bismarckian factor characterizing the pension system. Results from the empirical analysis, carried out using data from a pilot survey in Bulgaria, show that the evasion of social security contributions is less likely among individuals with higher subjective survival probabilities and who perceive a strong link between contributions and pension benefits.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Perotti, V (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",vperotti@worldbank.org,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Legislation is an important instrument which can create the premises for an adequate protection of health. Recently, the Law on healthcare reform, which concerns the organization of hospitals, has led to major debates. The private medical services are an alternative which started to develop. In this context, we conducted an exploratory research in order to analyze the perception of private and public medical services in Romania, by using quantitative market research techniques (market survey). The research showed that the public system is perceived as not satisfactory and a reform of the system is perceived as being opportune, but the solution is not simply the diminution of the charges. Moreover, the research revealed the fact that the private medical services in Romania are not sufficiently developed. The subjects interviewed consider that the State plays a major role in the reform of the medical system and that there are important measures that the state should implement.","[Petrescu, Eva-Cristina; Ioncica, Diana-Eugenia] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Petrescu, EC (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",eva_petrescu@yahoo.com,"PETRESCU, EVA-CRISTINA/IQT-9854-2023","Ioncica, Diana/0000-0002-6522-3948; Petrescu, Eva-Cristina/0009-0004-5365-1082",,,,,15,2,2,0,23,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2012,14.0,,,,6,,653,664,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,038UI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000311199200006,0

At the same time, donors sabotage civil service capacity development over the longer term. Notwithstanding international accords calling on donors to curtail this behavior, collective action problems constrain donors from dismantling the projectized aid infrastructure that fragments government institutions. We identify practical implications of this collective action dilemma and explore alternative reform approaches. We examine an agency-level civil service reform (ACSR) in Cambodia, in comparative perspective, showing how strategic, incremental introduction of merit-based incentives yielded benefits in one ministry but faltered when the pilot was expanded to other agencies. To the extent that the accumulated ACSR experiences have achieved some, albeit limited, traction, they may offer a small but significant beacon for those seeking to move forward on civil service reform under difficult conditions.

Applying results from such studies to real-world situations requires understanding how decision making in cases involving real rewards correspond to decisions with hypothetical rewards. This article reports two key differences between hypothetical and real decisions in social dilemmas. First, hypothetical and real decisions cause different cognitive biases in social dilemmas: hypothetical judgements and choices stem from perceptual processes and cause contrast effects: while judgements and actions in real interaction are biased by assimilation processes involved in action selection and learning. Second, without the corrective real social interaction, people overestimate theirs and others propensity to act cooperatively. However, individuals are more confident in their predictions during real interaction, which suggests that such metacognitive judgments can predict actual behaviour and also signal when respondents provide biased responses. Overall, our results call into question established methodologies that rely on hypothetical answers, and indicate that people should be observed and measured in real or incentivised social interactions.

Satisfaction with travel has to date been assessed using utility-based models or measures of productivity of the trip. The present study is the first to assess the influence of activities performed during travel on public transport users' subjective well-being. To this end, a survey was conducted in Sweden in 2010 in which activities during the work commute by public transport were recorded and subjective well-being during travel was measured retrospectively using the Satisfaction with Travel Scale (STS). Results show that talking to other passengers has the strongest positive effect on STS, whereas activities related to entertainment and relaxation lead to lower STS, possibly since engaging in these activities reflect unsuccessful attempts to abate boredom. In addition, it is found that activities during travel may have a more positive effect on the commute back home, suggesting that the mindset related to the destination influences travel satisfaction.

However, there is no single way of providing the market information. Different designs for generating price information have been proposed. Little is known about the performance of iterative combinatorial auction designs when heterogeneous bidders, with different cost structures, participate in an auction. Using an agent based model, we evaluate a selected set of designs under different bidder heterogeneity scenarios.

The results indicate that not only do these systems have different types of user, the ways they are used are significantly different. Although conferences of different cost and quality can be arranged with either system, there are no significant differences in how the systems are evaluated as forms of communication by their users. The paper shows that the user of a room-based VC system is more interested in VC as a tool substituting for business trips than is the user of an Internet-based system. Altogether, the findings suggest that these two VC technologies have affordances that invite different uses and communication patterns. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, recent evidence from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, a large cross-national study on the level of entrepreneurial activity, establishes that 80% of nascent entrepreneurs also hold regular wage jobs. This paper offers a model of entrepreneurial entry under financial constraints where individuals choose between wage employment, part-time, and full-time entrepreneurship. Those who become nascent entrepreneurs must further decide how much capital to invest and what proportion of time to spend in business. I test this model using data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics, which covers start-ups and nascent entrepreneurs. My findings show that part-time entrepreneurs are not affected by financial constraints. The analysis suggests that industry barriers, risk aversion, and learning by doing might be other factors worth investigating.","SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Dept Econ & Finance, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Plattsburgh,"Petrova, K (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Dept Econ & Finance, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA.",kameliia.petrova@plattsburgh.edu,"Petrova, Kameliia P/G-7759-2016; wang, bo/D-4056-2014","Petrova, Kameliia/0000-0002-9911-044X",,,,,59,50,58,2,65,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The basic rationale for most of these reforms is taking advantage of economies of scale in the municipal provision of public services. However, contrary to conventional wisdom of public officials, the related empirical literature, which relies mostly on descriptive evidence, finds almost no benefits arising from an amalgamation. The purpose of this paper is to present empirical evidence for the fiscal outcomes of municipal amalgamations based on the Difference-in-Differences methodology. The paper is using an extensive panel data of municipalities in Israel for the years 1999-2007 in order to analyze the Israeli amalgamation reform of 2003. The results indicate that the amalgamations resulted in a decrease of about 9% in municipal expenditures, and are robust to the possibility of selection bias. I find no evidence of a decrease in the level of services provided to the residents of the amalgamated municipalities. The results suggest that municipal amalgamations do bring economies of scale into practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Unconditional and regression-adjusted difference-in-difference estimates suggest that the introduction of the Working Credit programme increased employment rates, earnings and exits for those on income support, but matching methods and various robustness checks provide conflicting evidence on the impact on movements from welfare to work for unemployment benefit recipients. Moreover, estimated effects on earnings while on benefits are sensitive to identifying assumptions. Notwithstanding our inability to conclusively identify causal effects of the programme, we note that our findings are broadly consistent with the incentive effects of the programme, with recipients making use of the credits to increase earnings while on benefits, but not increasing movements off welfare.","[Wilkins, Roger] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Wilkins, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",r.wilkins@unimelb.edu.au; andrew.leigh.mp@aph.gov.au,"Leigh, Andrew/AAV-1366-2020","Leigh, Andrew/0000-0002-5639-0509; Wilkins, Roger/0000-0002-8548-757X",,,,,20,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

A changing climate may pose a challenge to meeting expected targets. Bridging the modeling gaps between climate, energy, and economics, and effectively transforming climate changes into economic measures, is an emerging interdisciplinary field as nations attempt to position themselves for an uncertain future. Such a framework is adopted here to assess energy production and adaptation costs for four climate change scenarios over 20102049. Scenarios that favor a drying trend countrywide may lead to losses of 130200 terawatt-hours over the 40-year period, translating to adaptation costs of US$24 billion, compared with a no climate change scenario. Even given these potential losses, energy development utilizing hydropower appears economically reasonable from this deterministic, sector-independent evaluation. This development is desperately needed, independent of future climate change trends, with the hope of appreciably reducing vulnerability to variability.","[Block, Paul] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Strzepek, Kenneth] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Drexel University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Block, P (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, 3141 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",pblock@drexel.edu,,"Block, Paul/0000-0003-1993-7496",,,,,33,18,21,1,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We document that forward-looking provisioning designed to smooth earnings dampens discipline over risk-taking, consistent with diminished transparency inhibiting outside monitoring. In contrast, forward-looking provisioning reflecting timely recognition of expected future loan losses is associated with enhanced risk-taking discipline. Thus, proposals to change loan loss accounting embed significant risks of unintended consequences, as gains from reducing pro-cyclicality may be swamped by losses in transparency that dampen market discipline and increase the scope for less prudent risk-taking by banks.

My analysis suggests that learning effects have reduced the manifestation of the disposition effect over time, implying that academic research has influenced industry practices. When funds experience outflows and are managed by teams of portfolio managers, they are more susceptible to selling disproportionately more winners than losers. Disposition-driven behavior affects investment style, causing lower market betas and characteristics of value-oriented and contrarian styles, but has no observable effect on fund performance.","[Cici, Gjergji] Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Cici, Gjergji] Univ Cologne, Ctr Financial Res, D-50931 Cologne, Germany",William & Mary; University of Cologne,"Cici, G (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",gjergji.cici@mason.wm.edu,,,,,,,48,59,65,0,43,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

In this study we report the findings of a longitudinal study that investigates the annual change in financial risk tolerance scores of individuals over a 5 year period and the factors that influence such change. Our results indicate a relatively small annual change in individuals' financial risk tolerance. Although our regression model is ineffective in providing a clarification for a change in the financial risk tolerance scores of individual respondents, we find a slight decrease in financial risk tolerance associated with a decrease in household size and an increase in financial risk tolerance after terminating the services of a financial planner. From our results we propose that financial risk tolerance is a stable personality trait and is unlikely to change substantially over the life of an individual. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The transparency in the mechanism, which allows investors to observe prior investors' participation, leads to demand which is concentrated at either one or two points of the offer price range. Analysis of investors' demand during the offer period shows that the participation of retail investors is significantly influenced by the participation of institutional investors. We examine IPO pricing and find that favourable demand by retail investors is positively associated with a high IPO price even after controlling for demand by institutional investors. Further, we find that due to aggressive bidding by overconfident investors, retail investors are, on average, unlikely to make positive allocation weighted initial returns even in a setting where they do not have to compete with institutional investors. Retail investors, however, can earn significant positive allocation weighted initial returns if they limit their participation in IPOs with above average institutional investors' demand.

Using a large data set of 3613 managed funds for the period January 1990 to September 2009, the paper addresses two important questions yet to be addressed within the Australian market: First, for research question one; it aims to determine whether a positive feedback process exists between aggregate equity managed fund flows and excess share market returns. Second, for research question two; it examines the relation between unexpected aggregate equity managed fund flows and excess share market returns. The empirical findings contribute to the literature by confirming, in Australia, aggregate equity managed fund flows do not Granger-cause excess share market returns; however, compelling evidence reveals that share market returns do in fact Granger-cause managed fund flows. These findings support those of Edwards and Zhang (1998), who find similar evidence for the United States over the sample period 1961-1996. In addition, aggregate equity managed fund flows are found to be positively related to excess share market returns, indicating herding behavior. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Unorthodox and unconventional were the labels attached to the policy mix announced by the CBRT at the end of 2010. It should have come as no surprise to anyone that had been introduced to the (sub)field as much as we tried to outline in this study that the CBRT placed an overwhelming emphasis on current account deficit and credit expansion as the ingredients of its financial stability argument in the enhanced objective function. Credit expansion is by and large the outcome of a micro decision making process, that of loan policy of banks on a single entity basis ultimately aggregated across banks. Current account dynamics is much more intricate than credit expansion although to some extent linked to it and its analysis requires more vigor and is likely to subject to a higher degree of noise. Our findings suggest that when properly investigated, credit expansion and current account dynamics do not depict the failure story that markets thought the CBRT has suffered from following the initiation of the unconventional policy mix.

We provide several examples highlighting that seemingly similar phenomena can be governed by very different psychological processes, that the same processes can have explanatory power in very different domains, and that the situational context is a crucial determinant of the mental processes governing behavior. In doing so, we advocate a social-cognitive perspective on economic behavior, aimed at revealing the psychological mechanisms that shape how people construe a particular situation.

Second, I empirically confirm these conditions using fifteen years of high-frequency data for US stocks and daily data for twenty US bilateral exchange rates. Third, the model relies on differences in the volatility of country-specific shocks to account for the empirical results.

By introducing citizens' political participation as the driving force connecting institutions to policy outcomes, we empirically show that voter turnout is the channel through which forms of government affect economic policies. We provide evidence of the existence of two relationships. First, presidential regimes appear to be associated with lower voter participation in national elections.

In our basic model, we show that the lowest-valuation players in each group play decisive roles in determining the Nash equilibria of the game. There are multiple pure-strategy Nash equilibria in the game but there is a unique coalition-proof Nash equilibrium at which neither any player nor any group does not have an incentive to coordinate and deviate from the equilibrium. No free riding problem exists in equilibrium. As an example of our basic model, we consider a simple contest where two groups with two players compete against, and find that the high-valuation players in each group have incentives to subsidize the low-valuation players in their group. Finally, we examine the equilibrium subsidy rates of the groups in a contest where first the high-valuation players in each group decide how much to subsidize low-valuation players in their group and then the individual players in the contest choose their effort levels simultaneously and independently.

The main advantage of the stochastic frontier approach over the stylised approaches that use pooled OLS or fixed effects panel regression models is that we can not only decide whether or not the average firm is financially constrained, but also estimate a measure of the degree of the constraint for each firm and for each time period, and also the marginal impact of firm characteristics on this measure. We then apply the stochastic frontier approach to a panel of Indian manufacturing firms, for the 1997-2006 period. In our application, we highlight and discuss the aforementioned advantages, while also demonstrating that the stochastic frontier approach generates regression estimates that are consistent with the stylised intuition found in the literature on financial constraint and the wider literature on the Indian credit/capital market.

A total of six structure components are identified and related to syndicate quality, syndicate members' heterogeneity or share concentration, lead arranger's characteristics, lead lender's or syndicate's location, lender-borrower relationships, and lead institution type. In multivariate settings, all six components are significant determinants of loan spread, either directly or indirectly through their impact on other components. Lead share retention, previous lender-borrower relationships and syndicate quality are shown to be bilaterally related to loan spread.

In order to answer this question, we use the yearly surveys of the Ministry of Research over the period 1993-2003, as well as the corresponding firm-level tax files. The main issue is whether the firms would have increased their R&D expenditures without this tax incentive. We make use of the Rubin methodology. In a first step, we study the determinants of the probability to benefit from the R&D tax credit, that is the selection process at work in the recipients sample. We find that the probability to obtain a R&D tax credit increases with the R&D/Sales ratio and decreases with the direct R&D subsidies. Once we have evaluated the probability to get the R&D tax credit, we are able to correct for the selection bias. In a second step, we evaluate the effect of the incremental R&D tax credit on the private funding of research (once subtracted the direct subsidies from all the ministries). We find that, overall, the tax credit adds to the private funding of R&D: 1 Euro of tax credit would give slightly more than one Euro of total R&D. We also find that the incremental R&D tax credit increases the growth of the number of researchers.","Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE, F-94010 Creteil, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Duguet, E (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France.",emmanuel.duguet@u-pec.fr,,"DUGUET, Emmanuel/0000-0003-2214-4542",,,,,37,11,13,4,28,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The model pays careful attention to the fact that Vietnam has many state-owned enterprises. The model simulations show that the WTO tariff reductions will reduce overall welfare. Moreover, the biggest loss will take place among the poor rural households in Vietnam.

Financial development affects growth positively throughout the sample period, while trade affects growth strongly and independently after 1945. We attribute the rising importance of trade to major post-World War II changes in tariffs and quantity restrictions associated with the GATT, the establishment of the European Common Market, and the gradual elimination of capital controls after 1973. The findings are robust to the use of 'deep' fundamentals such as legal origin and indicators of the political environment as instruments for financial development and trade.

Subsequently, using this information, we examine the sources of heterogeneity. The findings suggest that the impact of capital regulation on bank risk is very heterogeneous across banks and the sources of this heterogeneity can be traced into both bank and industry characteristics, as well as into macroeconomic conditions. An important implication of the findings is that common capital regulatory umbrellas are not sufficient to promote financial stability, especially if they are not accompanied by supervisory effectiveness. On the basis of our findings, we contend that more focus should be placed on the actions needed to restrain excessive risk-taking of banks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We use an energy demand model to analyze the contributions to this decrease of energy prices, product mix, technological change, and biomass use. The product mix is made of pulp, and cardboard, and paper. Pulp is an intermediate product for the industry, but not necessarily so for mills; vertical integration varies across mills and presents different opportunities to transfer heat between stages of production. Chemical and mechanical pulping processes are used to form two groups of pulp and paper mills. We find that changes of product mixes contributed the most to reduce GHG emissions, followed to a lesser extent by increases of fuel prices relative to electricity. The estimated electricity and fuel price elasticities are low. However it is still possible to significantly reduce GHG emissions by substituting natural gas for heavy fuel oil; such a substitution could be brought about by a small change of their relative price.","[Ades, Julie; Bernard, Jean-Thomas; Gonzalez, Patrick] Univ Laval, GREEN, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University,"Adès, J (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, GREEN, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",,"Gonzalez, Patrick/R-9806-2018",,,,,,12,4,4,0,3,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We show that if the stochastic improvement satisfies a double-crossing condition, then a decision maker with utility v is willing to pay more than a decision maker with utility u, if v is both more risk averse and less downside risk averse than u. As the condition always holds in the case of self-protection, the result implies novel characterizations of individuals' willingness to pay to reduce the probability of loss. By establishing a general result on the correspondence between an individual's willingness to pay, and his optimal purchase of stochastic improvement when there is a given relationship between stochastic improvements and the amount paid for them, we further show that all results on the willingness to pay can be applied directly to characterize the conditions under which a more risk averse individual will optimally choose to buy more stochastic improvement. Generalizations of existing results on optimal choice of self-protection can be obtained as corollaries.

We discover that dependence has typically increased over time, and document mixed evidence on heavy tails in individual countries. Moreover, we uncover three additional findings related to dependence. First, the timing of downside risk differs depending on the region. Surprisingly, recent Latin American returns exhibit little downside risk. Second, Latin America exhibits a great deal of correlation complexity. Third, according to the empirical results, correlation does not vary with returns, but extreme dependence does vary monotonically with regional returns. Our results are consistent with a tradeoff between international diversification and systemic risk. They also suggest international limits to diversification, and that international investors demand some compensation for joint downside risk during extreme events. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show that a decentralized system dominates a centralized system in terms of economic growth; however, the difference in social welfare between a decentralized and a centralized system is non-monotonic and displays a hump-shaped relationship with respect to capital mobility. Since higher capital mobility induces stronger tax competition, this finding implies that there is an optimal degree of tax competition; some tax competition is desirable, but fierce tax competition may be harmful. We also show that there is a critical level of spillovers of public goods above which centralization dominates decentralization in terms of social welfare, as in previous studies; however, if spillovers are below this critical level, capital mobility also matters in the welfare comparison between centralized and decentralized systems.

Although NGO behavior in competitive environments is often subject to controversy, there is little formal empirical evidence to illustrate theoretical findings and inform policy. Using data from Kiva, an online peer-to-peer (P2P) microfinance platform, we find that competition has a sizable negative impact on projects' funding speed and that the effect is stronger between close substitutes.

We argue that the usual order flow model needs to be recast in broader terms to incorporate the transaction costs of liquidity and the limitation of price discovery through order flows that involve low trading density currencies. Using a daily data set, we find that order flows are inadequate when it comes to explaining the changes in the low trading density currencies. Alternatively, within the high trading density, both order flows and bid-ask spreads significantly affect the foreign exchange rate returns. Our findings suggest that the order flow model is better at incorporating these microstructure effects except for some currencies with a very high level of trading density. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We study how life satisfaction is affected by employment protection and the level and duration of unemployment benefit payments. Using data for almost 370,000 individuals in ten European countries, 1975-2002, we find that more employment protection and a higher benefit replacement rate increase the life satisfaction of the average citizen. At the subgroup level, different segments of the population are affected differently by the two categories of labor market institutions. While employment protection is valued especially by employed persons of intermediate age, it is less beneficial for women/housewives and for older persons. More generous unemployment insurance is valued especially by these latter subgroups and by the unemployed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Jones (1971) shows how with just a few parameters one can determine the impact of any price change in some sector on the wages of the mobile factor as well as all of the returns to the specific factors elsewhere in the economy. It is well-known that in the specific factors model, the increase in the price of any commodity will raise the wage of the mobile factor by a fraction of the percentage increase in the price, and that there will be a magnification effect on the specific factor used in that commodity and negative effects on all of the other specific factors in the economy. I estimate the elasticity of substitution by using CES production function and show how these estimates describe the general equilibrium of production with one mobile factor (labor) and nine industries of an open U.S. economy using data for 1979-2001. The results are consistent with the theory. I find that the value of the elasticity of substitution along with factor intensity between industries plays an important role in determining the impact of commodity prices on wage of mobile factor and rate of return to the specific capital.

The less vulnerable were highly skilled migrants for work in health or IT sectors. On the other hand, the head hunters were stimulated during the crisis, becoming more aggressive and increasing workers vulnerability.

An ideal situation would involve studying the entire population under investigation. This is impossible in situations where we find large populations of data. Using sampling saves time and effort for the team of auditors. Lower costs for auditors and the audited entity resulting from the application procedures for selected units only, is another advantage of using this technique. The auditor must use professional judgment to assess audit risk and establish appropriate procedures for the transactions and accounts tested.

J,"De Gregorio, J",,,,"De Gregorio, Jose",,,"POLICY CORNER Commodity Prices, Monetary Policy, and Inflation",IMF ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MARKET; TARGET,"During the second half of the 2000s, the world experienced a rapid and substantial rise in commodity prices. This shock posed complex challenges for monetary policy, in particular because of the significant increase in food and energy prices, and the repercussions they had on aggregate inflation measures. This paper discusses the role of commodity price shocks (CPS) in monetary policy in the light of recent episodes of such shocks. It begins by discussing whether monetary policy should target core or headline inflation, and what should be the role of CPS in setting interest rates. It is argued that there are good reasons to focus on headline inflation, as most central banks actually do. Although core inflation provides a good indicator of underlying inflation pressures, the evolution of commodity prices should not be overlooked, because of pervasive second-round effects. This paper reviews the evidence on the rise of inflation across countries and reports that food inflation, more than energy inflation, has relevant propagation effects on core inflation. This finding is particularly important in emerging market economies, where the share of food in the consumer basket is significant. The evidence also shows that countries that had lower inflation during the run up of commodity prices before the global crisis had more inflation in the subsequent rise after the global crisis, suggesting that part of the precrisis inflationary success may have been because of repressed inflation. This paper also discusses other factors that may explain different inflationary performances across countries.

The practical outcome of the paper is based on rules determination for search of perspective innovation and its distinguish from commercially unperceptive innovation. The second practical outcome of the paper is a research of interactions between factors during optimization of the product. In general, we gain process synergy, which can be a source of competitive advantage during product innovation in the presence of organizational complexity by systematically moving through the process definition, control, and improvement elements. The improvement elements can cause interactions between these elements (or factors/process parameters). First, we have to distinguish between synergistic and antagonistic interactions. For synergistic interaction can be used graphic illustration - lines on the plot do not cross each other. In contrast, for antagonistic interaction, the lines on the plot cross each other. In this case, the change in mean response for factor at low level is noticeable high compared to high level. Searching for positive interactions leading to the creation of synergies in the performances we can do at each stage of management innovations. At first, we realize only part of the possible gain, with unrealized potential remaining. Using process control, over time, we stabilize our process and obtain additional limited gain. Using process improvement, we can realize additional gain (it looks as short vertical line during the time), with some potential gain remaining. When new, feasible options develop, we can redefined our process and continue with our control and improvement efforts. Hence, each process-related issue definition, control, improvement has a distinct role to play. Confusion between roles or the omission of any of the roles creates disharmony and frustration in the production system, which ultimately limits production system effectiveness and efficiency. Sometimes, in the presence of confusion, it is possible that effectiveness and efficiency may decrease. In this situation, we hope to learn from our negative factor interactions (or failures) and subsequently improvement trends in long term with using sophisticated methods and own intuition. This paper objective is to create rules for planning innovation expert system. According to this rules will be possible to distinguish perspective innovation from commercially unperceptive innovation. The second paper objective is to explore interactions between factors during a product optimization. For this purpose will be used the methodology based on minimization of logic functions and design of experiments (analytical tools of DOE).",,,,,"Macak, Tomas/G-7396-2014; Hron, Jan/C-6378-2017","Macak, Tomas/0000-0002-6737-239X; Hron, Jan/0000-0001-6618-7136",,,,,5,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,191,197,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800013,0

In this study, we treated cognitive ability as a commodity and considered the demand for and supply of this commodity. Our primary data were ratings of the cognitive skills required by various occupations, as listed in the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET database. The 21 ratings in that database can be reduced to 3 dimensions, with 1 of them, general cognitive ability, being by far the largest. The demand for this ability was determined by considering the number of jobholders in the various occupations represented in O*NET. The demand closely fit a normal distribution, centered at a slightly below average cognitive ability value. This suggests that the O*NET ratings represent adequate rather than typical performance. The level of general cognitive ability established by ratings of occupations was linearly related to the performance of applicants for jobs within an occupation, indicating that the rating measure and cognitive test scores are on the same scale. The general cognitive ability ratings of occupations predicted approximately 60% of the variation in income across occupations.","[Hunt, Earl] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Madhyastha, Tara M.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Madhyastha, Tara M.] Univ Washington, Integrated Brain Imaging Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Hunt, E (通讯作者)，2001 Killarney Dr, Bellevue, WA 98004 USA.",ehunt@u.washington.edu,,,,,,,31,26,30,0,15,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

This is particularly the case for rural development measures whit voluntary participation and heterogeneous outcomes. But knowledge about the selection mechanisms for a certain treatment, in combination with econometric methods, can help to overcome these problems. One of these promising methods is the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) approach. In this paper we apply PSM in order to obtain treatment effects from the agricultural investment support programme in Austria on the farm income. We also test the robustness of the results to hidden bias with sensitivity analysis. Furthermore we split the sample in more homogenous subsamples in order to increase the robustness of the results. The results show that treatment effects differ by a large amount for the subsamples and that splitting leads to slightly more robust results.","[Kirchweger, Stefan; Kantelhardt, Jochen] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Forestry Econ, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Kirchweger, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Forestry Econ, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",stefan.kirchweger@boku.ac.at,"Kantelhardt, Jochen/AAK-2069-2021",,,,,,26,0,0,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,117,133,,,,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800009,0

This recording method is experiencing a renewed interest with the emergence of consumer neuroscience and participates in investigative techniques of brain functions. Although the implementation of EDA measurement is an attainable technique, its signal analysis is nonetheless complex. Recently, researchers in psychophysiology have developed a new digital tool for EDA signal processing, thus optimizing the evaluation of the activation component of an emotional episode. A careful reading of the literature has identified several methods of collecting and processing the EDA signal which are discussed. Recommendations are proposed and illustrated in an exploratory study using seven TV commercials. The results show that the application of standards for signal processing by means of nonnegative deconvolution improves the robustness of measures thus contributing to the enhancement of consumer neuroscience research.","[Lajante, Mathieu; Droulers, Olivier] Univ Rennes 1, Ctr Res Econ & Management, UMR 6211, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Dondaine, Thibaut] Univ Rennes 1, Behav & Basal Ganglia Equipe Accueil 425, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Amarantini, David] Univ Toulouse 3, Programme Rech Interdisciplinaire Sci Sport & Mou, Equipe Accueil 425, F-31062 Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Rennes; Universite de Rennes; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Lajante, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, Grad Sch Management IGR, 11 Rue Jean Mace, F-35000 Rennes, France.",mathieu.lajante@univ-rennes1.fr,"Amarantini, David/AAB-7381-2019; Lajante, Mathieu/G-7271-2018; Lajante, Mathieu/AAU-4838-2020","Amarantini, David/0000-0002-9292-2429; Lajante, Mathieu/0000-0002-1979-5785; Dondaine, Thibaut/0000-0002-8778-5079",,,,,36,31,33,1,31,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

So using dynamic copula model to test dependent structure is much more accurate than traditional static one. In our work, we apply GOF test and binary segmentation procedure to detect the change of copula function. The result shows that in different time period, the best copula fitting for data set is not static, thus the dependent structure of Chinese stock market varies from one stage to another one. Our empirical research shows that the dependent structure of stock market tends to change when a financial event or an abnormal behavior of stock market happened.

An institution that faces a balance sheet constraint may have incentives to suspend trading in Level 3 assets (traded on opaque over-the-counter markets) in order to avoid such marking-to-market. This keeps the book valuation artificially high, relaxing the balance sheet constraint. But, the institution loses direct control of the risk of its position. Solving this real options problem, the institution will report profits as they occur but delay reporting losses. A regulator trying to control risk imposes fines for balance sheet manipulation and capital requirements. Both these tools can increase risk-taking and balance sheet manipulation. Audits in comparision generally decrease risk-taking but may be costly to the regulator.

The consequences of this practice are devastating on the investing community as well as on the society as a whole. Sell-side security analysts, among other gatekeepers in the financial markets, have been criticized. They should examine financial data issued by listed companies to assure investing public about the reliability of published data. So, to understand how listed companies have succeeded in issuing fraudulent financial reports in the presence of gatekeepers such as sell-side analysts, a well-known fraud case was chosen, i.e. Enron Company. During Enron's fraud period, 1997-2001, the research paper examined how sell-side security analysts processed Enron's misleading financial statements. The research method adopted to analyze analysts' reports was qualitative content analysis guided by Strauss and Corbin (1990, 1998) version of grounded theory Re-reporting was one of the main results generated through the analysis process. It is meant by re-reporting is that analysts were re-reporting what had been reported by Enron without due analysis or scepticism.

Fiscal flexibility is measured by the Steuerle-Roeper index of fiscal democracy, which expresses the proportion of budgetary revenue that remains after covering mandatory expenditure, i.e. the proportion of resources available for discretionary spending. The lower the value of the index, the lower the flexibility of fiscal resources. A negative value indicates that tax revenue is not sufficient to cover mandatory expenditure and the government has no resources available for discretionary spending. The analysis of Czech fiscal data from the period between 1995 and 2009 shows, that even though the share of mandatory expenditure increases, the flexibility of fiscal policy is still substantially better compared to Germany. The results of the comparison with the United States are ambiguous, depending on methodology. Some of the possible determinants of fiscal flexibility were tested by OLS regression. The analysis confirmed a negative relation of unemployment rate with the index of fiscal democracy. Panel regression also indicates a positive effect of GDP growth and a negative effect of the debt-to-GDP ratio. The effect of population ageing was not confirmed.","Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Rozensky, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",xrozv03@vse.cz,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

It focuses on the implications of governance decentralization processes and mining regulation reforms for indigenous and migrant populations who rely on informal (unlicensed) mining for income in Central Kalimantan. While the findings illustrate the territorially uneven impacts of recent reforms, they highlight how dominant paradigms that prioritize the enforcement of property rights schemes have contributed to problems of livelihood insecurity and poor environmental governance.

Banks can make standard loans on which plentiful historical data are available and unanimous agreement exists on default probabilities. Or banks can innovate and make new loans on which limited historical data are available, leading to possible disagreement over default probabilities. In equilibrium, banks make zero profits on standard loans and positive profits on innovative loans, which engenders innovation incentives for banks. But innovation brings with it the risk that investors could disagree with the bank that the loan is worthy of continued funding and hence could Withdraw funding at an interim stage, precipitating a financial crisis. The degree of innovation in the financial system is determined by this trade-off. Welfare implications of financial innovation and mechanisms to reduce the probability of crises are discussed.

An important factor to reduce the opportunity cost of flood creation needed for the environment is the access to storage capacity. Reallocating storage capacity from agriculture to environment, however, may have important impacts on irrigation water prices and the vitality of irrigation enterprises. In this paper, the long term impacts of storage capacity reallocation on the agricultural sector are analysed. It is shown that a reduction in storage capacity for irrigation water will reduce water prices for each level of dam content and shift the distribution of dam content to the left. As a result, the value of the irrigation sector is reduced. The impact on average water price is, however, indeterminate, implying that results from previous empirical studies may be valid only locally and that sensitivity analysis is important to show the robustness of empirical results.","Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Truong, CH (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Bldg E4A,Room 452, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",chi.truong@efs.mq.edu.au,"Truong, Chi/I-2712-2016","Truong, Chi/0000-0001-6346-5516",,,,,30,4,5,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Thanks to the program, many steps towards recovering the banking system have been adopted. Four major banks have been recapitalized by the Government. The lesson here is that solving stock problem through bank recapitalization is necessary but not sufficient. Rather, bank recapitalizations without additional measures to improve bank skills and to provide sound performance incentives are likely to fail. The restructuring allowed the banks to clean up the portfolios from stressed assets, significantly reduce the foreign debts and concentrate on its sustainable development, in which most of the efforts aimed at restoring assets and conducting large-scale work to increase public confidence and to attract deposits.

However, investors differ in their decisions to assume investment risk because of their personal constraints. This study examined the factors responsible for creating gaps in investors' risk perception by focusing on three issues: (a) disclosure practices, (b) investors' perception about the mutual funds' services, and (c) risk anatomy. Avoiding the extreme investment avenues, the study has included mutual fund investors only because investment in mutual funds is put forth in a way that assumes calculated risk and assures maximum return. The results highlighted by the study revealed that investors' demographic base, along with weak disclosure practices of mutual funds and the presence of volatility, shapes the anatomy of investors' risk decisions. The major implications of the study highlight that investors' demographic base has a significant impact on their risk perception, and financial services intermediaries should respond differently to the varied needs of individual investors based on their age, knowledge, income, and social responsibilities.","[Walia, Nidhi] Punjabi Univ, PURCITM Management Studies, Patiala 147001, Punjab, India; [Kiran, Ravi] Thapar Univ, Patiala, Punjab, India",Punjabi University; Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology,"Walia, N (通讯作者)，Punjabi Univ, PURCITM Management Studies, B-201,TCIRD Thapar Technol Campus Patiala, Patiala 147001, Punjab, India.",nidhiwalia79@gmail.com,"Kiran, Ravi/AFP-6571-2022","Kiran, Ravi/0000-0003-2434-9103",,,,,36,3,4,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The main premise of the programme is to address the racially skewed land distribution pattern inherited at independence in 1980. While the programme has been accompanied by an overall reduction in agricultural production which has created widespread food insecurity throughout the country, empirical research on the impact of the programme on the agricultural productivity of its beneficiaries has been limited. This paper uses data on beneficiaries of the programme and a control group of communal farmers to (i) investigate the presence of agricultural productivity differences between beneficiaries and communal farmers, and (ii) examine differences in chemical fertiliser use as a possible source of these differences. The results suggest that FTLRP beneficiaries gain a productivity advantage not only from the fact that they use more fertiliser per hectare, but also from attaining a higher rate of return from its use.","[Zikhali, P.; Chilonda, P.] Int Water Management Inst, So African Reg Off Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Zikhali, P (通讯作者)，Int Water Management Inst, So African Reg Off Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.",prehgabadela@gmail.com; P.Chilonda@cgiar.org,,,Sida,Sida,"The authors gratefully acknowledge comments on original drafts by an anonymous reviewer, Afaf Rahim, Gunnar Kohlin, Hakan Eggert, Klaus Deininger, Mans Soderbom, Prosper Matondi, and micro-econometrics course participants as well as seminar participants at the University of Gothenburg.

We find that there are large and statistically significant discrepancies between the datasets. We also compare the dating of banking crises according to these databases using information on the number and size of bank failures for four crises for which the timing strongly differs across these databases. We conclude that information on these variables allows determining the timing of banking crises more precisely. Our dating of the four crises corresponds closely with that of Laeven and Valencia.

In the case of process innovators it is the occasional innovators that exhibit a stronger association between sales growth and subsequent R&D growth.

We use Propensity Score Matching techniques to identify a sample of non-trademarking banks which share the same characteristics as the trademarking banks to ensure that variations in the efficiency between the commercial banks in our sample can be attributed to their trademarking status only. We then explicitly test the hypothesis that trademarldng and non-trademarking banks share the same cost and profit frontiers. We cannot reject the hypothesis of a common cost and profit frontier.

Moreover, the media tend to place negative unemployment reports more prominently than positive ones.

HCF took a multi-tiered approach, providing direct incentive funding for organizations to train Certified Application Counselors (CACs) and conducting outreach activities through multiple modes of contact. Throughout the open enrollment period, HCF efforts involved knocking on nearly 60,000 doors and mailing communication to 68,000 households. HCF was committed to making real-time changes to their outreach strategies in order to increase effectiveness. Short-term evaluation efforts were canceled due to low response rates and it is too soon to assess the longer term impact of HCF outreach efforts. Overall, the experience highlights the role for local entities in providing education on health insurance and federal policy and the limitations of big data campaign-style tactics for identifying the uninsured and evaluating outreach activities, particularly those using phones as the primary contact.

This paper focuses on the effect of the exchange rate on employment in Canada. We find that appreciation of the Canadian dollar has significant effects on employment in manufacturing industries; such effects are mostly associated with the export-weighted exchange rate, but not the import-weighted exchange rate. Meanwhile, the exchange rate has little effect on jobs in non-manufacturing industries. Because the manufacturing sector accounts for only about 10 percent of employment in Canada, the overall effect of the exchange rate on employment is small. In addition, we quantify the loss of manufacturing employment associated with a commodity market boom, during which the Canadian dollar tends to appreciate. Our estimates suggest that when commodity prices increase by 15.77 percent (one standard deviation of annual change in commodity prices between 1994 and 2010), manufacturing employment in Canada decreases by 0.8 percent, which is about 0.08 percent of the total employment.","[Huang, Haifang] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada; [Pang, Ke] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Tang, Yao] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA",University of Alberta; Wilfrid Laurier University; Bowdoin College,"Huang, HF (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada.",,,,,,,,26,3,4,4,22,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Unlike previous analyses that used case studies or regional samples, I use a nationally representative sample of rural households: rounds I and II of the Mexico National Rural Household Survey (ENHRUM). Econometric results show that participation in resource extraction follows an inverted U-shaped relationship with income and that environmental reliance decreases with income. Beyond income, results show that relatively wealthy households in rural Mexico are less likely to participate in resource extraction and have lower reliance than those with less wealth. There is also clear evidence that natural resources provide some sort of insurance for households that are subjected to negative agricultural shocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with heterogeneous households and collateralised debt. The model predicts that external shocks are important in driving current account deficits that are coupled with run-ups in house prices and household debt. In this context, optimal policy features an interest-rate response to credit and a LTV ratio that countercyclically responds to house price dynamics. By allowing an interest-rate response to changes in financial variables, the monetary policy authority improves social welfare, because of the large welfare gains accrued to the Savers. The additional use of a countercyclical LTV ratio that responds to house prices, increases the ability of borrowers to smooth consumption over the cycle and is Pareto improving. Domestic and foreign shocks account for a similar fraction of the welfare gains delivered by such a policy. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Simple information on the monetary value of energy savings was the most important element guiding cost-efficient energy efficiency investments, with information on physical energy use and carbon dioxide emissions having additional but lesser importance. The degree to which the current US EnergyGuide label guided cost-efficient decisions depends on the discount rate. Using elicited individual discount rates, the current EnergyGuide label came very close to guiding cost-efficient decisions. Using a uniform 5% discount rate, the current label led to one-third undervaluation of energy efficiency.

We consider a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with housing and collateral constraints. A macroprudential rule for the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), which responds to credit growth, interacts with a traditional Taylor rule for monetary policy. We compute the optimal parameters of these rules both when monetary and macroprudential policies act in a coordinated and in a non-coordinated way. We find that both policies acting together unambiguously improves the stability of the system. In both cases, this interaction is welfare improving for the society, especially in the case of the non-coordinated game. There is though a trade-off between borrowers and savers. However, borrowers can compensate the saver's welfare loss a la Kaldor-Hicks to achieve a Pareto-superior outcome. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a sample of corporate bonds newly issued in Japan during the period 2005-2008, I find that CEO ownership is associated with higher yield spreads after controlling for other governance, bond, and firm characteristics. Founding family ownership is also positively related to yield spreads. In contrast, firms with large corporate shareholders enjoy lower yield spreads.

A single-index dynamic factor model is estimated using mixed-frequency data on GDP, industrial production, employment, private consumption and exports to obtain early estimates of Japan's quarterly GDP growth in real time. The results of a real-time forecasting exercise suggest the model performs well in comparison to the consensus forecasts, in terms both of its accuracy, measured by the size of forecast errors, to predict actual GDP estimates, and of its ability to signal turning points in GDP, showing the advantage of using the model for early assessment of ongoing economic activities in Japan. An equally important goal of this study is to share with other forecasters the results of ongoing real-time GDP forecasts for Japan, aiming at increasing knowledge regarding Japan's GDP forecasting.

This paper sets out to analyze the coordination of environmental taxes considering multiproduct firms. We find that the organizational structure chosen by the owners of the firms depends on whether or not governments coordinate with one another in setting taxes, and on whether the goods produced are substitutes or complements. Social welfare is greater if a supranational authority sets taxes in all countries.

In basic DEA models, an entity may show its best performance by selecting input and output factor weights different from those selected by the other entities in the sample. Hence, when using basic DEA models, divergence of weighting schemes across the assessed entities cannot be ruled out.Weighting imbalance is another issue encountered in the application of basic DEA models. The assignment of an extremely low or zero weight to an input or an output factor implies that it is disregarded in performance appraisal.We appraise equity market performance using the Assurance Region Global (ARG)-DEA model where weighting divergence may be eliminated while controlling weighting imbalance. We show that risk concerns and returns preferences can be modeled in the ARG-DEA model through the bounds on the virtual input and virtual output ratios. Different combinations of risk concerns and returns preferences assess equity market performance under different risk-adjusted return scenarios and thereby allow sensitivity analysis of performance.

They have lower productivity levels and growth rates, export less, and have lower investment rates. Once geography, political competition, and the business environment are controlled for, formal African firms lead in productivity levels and growth. Africa's conditional advantage is higher in low-tech than in high-tech manufacturing, and exists in manufacturing but not in services. The key factors explaining Africa's disadvantage at the firm level are lack of infrastructure, access to finance, and political competition.

We investigate the period from the introduction of the Euro in 1999 until December 2012. The estimated densities are used to provide a measure for the interest rate risk premium and state prices implicit in the futures market. We find that the real-world option-implied distributions can be used to forecast the futures rate, while the forecasting ability of the risk-neutral distributions is rejected. The state price densities in the market show a U-shaped curve suggesting that investors price higher states with high and low rates compared to the expected spot rate. However, we show that, in general, state prices have a more pronounced right tail, implying that investors are more risk averse to increasing interest rates. We also document a negative market price of interest rate risk which generates positive premium for the futures contract. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As a sort of systemic risk, changes in banking risk lead to fluctuations in aggregate economic activity. We decompose the macroeconomic effect of a banking risk shock into a pure default effect and a risk-aversion effect when risk sharing among investors is imperfect. When the shock generates a bank risk spread similar to the peak value during the Global Financial Crisis, the overall effect is a decline in employment by 4.66%. The default effect leads to a 3.40% employment decline by a within-model measure, and a 3.51 decline by a between-model measure. The remaining is attributed to the risk-aversion effect.

By comparing returns obtained using different estimators, I evaluate the importance of endogeneity and selection problems generated by specific unobserved components and individual fixed effects. After controlling for the role of collective bargaining agreements and occupation categories, results indicate that general labour market experience is the fundamental source of wage growth for blue and white collars, while returns to firm tenure are insignificant. There is some evidence of positive returns to sector and occupational tenure for white collars. Estimates from different sectors suggest that union coverage can be relevant in offsetting the role of search and matching in wage determination.","Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Sulis, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.",,"Sulis, Giovanni/AAE-3758-2022","Sulis, Giovanni/0000-0003-2970-4725",,,,,27,4,4,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

It thus contributes to the economic literature on the impact of constitutions on economic outcomes. The effects are identified based on reforms of the municipal constitutions that were exogenous from the point of view of the municipalities in content and timing: each year, quasi-randomly selected groups of municipalities introduced the new constitution. This setup helps overcome endogeneity and identification issues that are common to many studies in the field using country level data. Using a new panel dataset of the 686 municipalities in three German states, this paper shows that direct mayoral election and recall through referendum only (as opposed to election and recall through the municipal council) reduce tax rates and increases spending on government employees.","[Ade, Florian] Humboldt Univ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Ade, Florian] German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Ade, F (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",f.ade@gmx.de,,,,,,,24,15,15,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2014,160.0,3-4,,,,,367,389,,10.1007/s11127-013-0084-8,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AL7VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339344600005,0

Most often, analysts have to work with observational data and cannot directly observe the counterfactual of a policy to assess its effect accurately. In this paper, we craft a quasi-experimental design and apply two relatively new methodsthe difference-in-differences estimation and the synthetic controls methodto the policy debate on whether corporate tax cuts increase foreign direct investment (FDI). The taxation-FDI relationship has attracted wide attention because of mixed findings. We exploit a quasi-experimental design for Russian regions, which were granted autonomy to reduce corporate profit tax in 2003, enabling them to simultaneously experiment with different tax policies. We estimate both the average and local treatment effects of two types of tax cuts on FDI inflows. We find that, on average, relative to the absence of tax cuts, nondiscriminatory tax cuts on direct investment profit increase FDI, but discriminatory tax cuts on selected government-sanctioned investment projects do not. Yet for both types of tax cuts, local treatment effects vary dramatically from region to region. Our research has important implications for the design of tax policy and fiscal incentive, and the assessment of fiscal policy reforms.","[Baccini, Leonardo] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Li, Quan] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Mirkina, Irina] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Lund University,"Baccini, L (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",l.baccini@lse.ac.uk; quanli@tamu.edu; irina_v.mirkina@nek.lu.se,"Baccini, Leonardo/A-2852-2011; Mirkina, Irina/AAY-8049-2020; Mirkina, Irina/H-7067-2019","Mirkina, Irina/0000-0003-2858-4987; Baccini, Leonardo/0000-0002-6027-9192",,,,,68,21,27,0,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Second, price changes within firms are substantially synchronized, which plays a dominant role in explaining pricing dynamics.

The experiment is a fiscal expansion under the assumption of a pegged nominal rate of interest. We demonstrate that a quantitatively important issue is the articulation of the exit from the policy experiment. If the monetary-fiscal expansion is stochastic with a mean duration of T periods, the fiscal multiplier can be unboundedly large. However, if the monetary-fiscal expansion is for a fixed T periods, the multiplier is much smaller. Our explanation rests on a Jensen's inequality type argument: the deterministic multiplier is convex in duration, and the stochastic multiplier is a weighted average of the deterministic multipliers. The quantitative difference in the two multipliers also arises in a model with capital, and in the baseline nonlinear model. However, the differences between the two are less pronounced in the nonlinear models. The errors from a linear approximation are much larger for the stochastic exit model then for the deterministic exit model.","[Carlstrom, Charles T.; Fuerst, Timothy S.] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA; [Fuerst, Timothy S.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Paustian, Matthias] Bank England, London, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland; University of Notre Dame; Bank of England,"Carlstrom, CT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA.",charles.t.carlstrom@clev.frb.org; tfuerst@nd.edu; matthias.paustian@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,9,28,29,1,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The l(1) or l(2) norm constrained portfolio optimization method has been used as a robust method to control the sparsity or to shrink the estimated weights of assets. In this paper, we propose to add an additional l(infinity) norm constraint or to add a pairwise l(infinity) norm constraint in the l(1) norm constrained minimum-variance portfolio (MVP) problem. The l(infinity) constraint controls the largest absolute component of the weight vector and the pairwise l(infinity) constraint encourages retaining the cluster structure of highly correlated assets in MVP optimization. By simulation study and analysis of empirical data, we find that the proposed portfolios often have better out-of-sample performance in terms of Sharpe ratios, variances and turn-overs than existing popular portfolio strategies including the l(1) norm constrained MVP, l(2) norm constrained MVP and the 1/N portfolio. In addition, we provide moment shrinkage interpretations of the new strategies and an upper bound of errors in the approximation of the empirical optimal portfolio risk based on the theoretical optimal portfolio risk.

Although many of these programs are explicitly implemented to improve children's welfare, in theory their impact on child labor is undetermined. This paper systematically reviews the empirical evidence on the impact of cash transfers, conditional and unconditional, on child labor. We find no evidence that cash transfer interventions increase child labor in practice. On the contrary, there is broad evidence that conditional and unconditional cash transfers lower both children's participation in child labor and their hours worked and that these transfers cushion the effect of economic shocks that may lead households to use child labor as a coping strategy. Boys experience particularly strong decreases in economic activities, whereas girls experience such decreases in household chores. Our findings underline the usefulness of cash transfers as a relatively safe policy instrument to improve child welfare but also point to knowledge gaps, for instance regarding the interplay between cash transfers and other interventions, that should be addressed in future evaluations to provide detailed policy advice.","[de Hoop, Jacobus; Rosati, Furio C.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"de Hoop, J (通讯作者)，Int Labor Off Italy & San Marino, Via Panisperna 28, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",jdehoop@ucw-project.org,"ROSATI, Furio Camillo/R-6565-2017","ROSATI, Furio Camillo/0000-0001-5382-5813",,,,,64,60,67,0,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

We particularly analyze the long run equilibrium in a two-sector ('clean' and 'dirty') model with Cournot competition among firms who face a fixed cost of production. The clean sector is defined as the sector with the highest long run cost margin on emissions. We compare the welfare implications of a cap-and-trade scheme with an emissions trading scheme based on relative intensity standards. It is shown that a firm's long run equilibrium output in the clean or dirty sector does not depend on the emissions trading format, but only depends on the fixed cost of producing in the respective sector. Intensity standards can result in clean firms selling allowances to dirty firms, or dirty firms selling to clean firms. The former outcome yields higher welfare. It is demonstrated that cap-and-trade outperforms the intensity-based trading scheme in terms of long run welfare with free entry and exit. With intensity standards the size of the clean sector is too large.","[de Vries, Frans P.] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Dijkstra, Bouwe R.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [McGinty, Matthew] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Stirling; University of Nottingham; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"de Vries, FP (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",f.p.devries@stir.ac.uk; bouwe.dijkstra@nottingham.ac.uk; mmcginty@uwm.edu,"Dijkstra, Bouwe/AAE-7687-2020; Dijkstra, Bouwe/ABE-7129-2020","Dijkstra, Bouwe/0000-0002-9136-0591; Dijkstra, Bouwe/0000-0002-9136-0591; de Vries, Frans P/0000-0003-0462-5035",,,,,19,8,10,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The paper offers four solutions to strengthen bank governance. First, the regulatory capital base of banks could be increased. Second, the compensation structure of managers could be reformed. Third, effort could be focussed on creating and implementing resolution regimes which offer the credible prospect of bailing-in creditors in the event of stress and fourth solution is to reform the structure of company law for example, by extending control rights beyond shareholders. Furthermore, the paper argues that given the diversity of the whole financial system, it is expected that the risks individual financial institutions face are also diverse. It cannot be assumed that the appropriate capitalisation is constant across all risks. While leverage ratios are a useful backstop measure and guard against potential gaming of risk-weights, their appropriate role is as a backstop. The diversity within the financial system also supports the fact that a single measure of systemic risk is unlikely to be universally applicable, nor is a single instrument of financial stability policy.

The option pricing formula of Heston (Rev Financ Stud 6(2):327-343, 1993) is a particular case of ours, corresponding to the case in which there is no ambiguity (uncertainty is exclusively risk). In the presence of ambiguity, the variance uncertainty price becomes either a convex or a concave function of the instantaneous variance, depending on whether the variance ambiguity price is negative or positive.

Theory suggests that effective governance enhances financial and operational transparency, which in turn, reduces adverse selection. Facing less adverse selection problems, traders provide more liquidity to stocks of well-governed firms. Based on a sample of largest firms in Thailand from 2006 to 2009, our results show a significant relationship between governance and liquidity within firms over time. In particular, within firms, when governance quality increases, liquidity significantly improves. For instance, a rise in governance quality by one standard deviation improves the liquidity ratio by 26.19%. We also show that our results are unlikely confounded by endogeneity.

The prior research has attempted to answer the second question, however, with conflicting evidence and without a clear definition of excessive. To answer the first question, this paper uses a numerical calibration approach to estimate the optimal level of CEO pay and derive the excessive compensation which provides excessive risk-taking incentives. We then examine the extent of excessive compensation in the financial industry relative to the non-financial industries during the 2000s and whether there were changes in compensation practices between the post Sarbanes-Oxley period and the pre-crisis period. We find mixed evidence in favor of the presence of higher excessive pay in the financial industry, and the CEO compensation practices remained largely unchanged over time. In addition, the relation between excessive pay and excessive risk-taking in the financial industry is somewhat weak, suggesting that CEO compensation might not be a major cause for the crisis in 2008.

Few studies have investigated, however, whether overcompensation (i.e., compensation that is greater than the damage suffered) is more beneficial than equal compensation (i.e., compensation that covers the exact damage suffered). The results of four studies show that overcompensation offers no effects in addition to the impact of equal compensation, and that it even provokes negative outcomes. More specifically, overcompensation is attributed to occur because of a lower level of moral orientation on the part of the perpetrator (Study 2 through 4), leads to less favorable perceptions of the perpetrator (Study 2 and 4), and lower levels of trust in the perpetrator (Study 3 and 4) than equal compensation. No significant differences between overcompensation and equal compensation appeared for relationship preservation and cooperation (Study 4). These results show that while overcompensation may rebuild cooperation (albeit not more effectively than equal compensation), it does so at a monetary and relational cost that limits its effectiveness as a tool to promote true interpersonal trust. The present studies thus show that a large financial compensation does not provide any surplus value in terms of psychological outcomes and relationship continuation, even though such compensation best satisfies a victim's economic needs.

This article addresses for Vietnam the questions how capital constraints affect the performance of family firms and how entrepreneurs' human and social capital interact with capital constraints to leverage entrepreneurial income. A panel of 1721 firms in 4 years is used. Results are consistent with the resource dependency approach, indicating an adverse effect of capital constraints on firm performance: firms suffering capital constraints perform substantially better, suggesting that they need more capital simply to finance newly recognized profit opportunities. Human capital plays a vital role in relaxing capital constraints and improves the entrepreneurial performance, whereas the effect of social capital stemming from strong ties and weak ties is limited: strong ties bring emotional support and weak ties give nonfinancial benefits from regular and useful business contacts. Advanced econometric analysis tools to take into account the endogeneity of capital constraints are used to establish relationships among relevant variables.","[Hien Thu Tran; Santarelli, Enrico] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Hien Thu Tran] RMIT Int Univ, Ctr Commerce & Management, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Santarelli, Enrico] RCEA, Rimini, Italy",University of Bologna,"Santarelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",thuhien.tran@unibo.it; enrico.santarelli@unibo.it,,"SANTARELLI, ENRICO/0000-0001-8986-2755; Tran, Hien/0000-0002-1399-9146",,,,,117,46,49,0,74,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In pricing multiple cross-sections of options, the models' performance can clearly be improved by extracting daily spot volatilities from the series of VIX rather than by linking spot volatility with different dates by using the series of the underlying's returns. Moreover, in contrast to traditional returns-based Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), a joint MLE with returns and VIX improves option pricing performance, and for NGARCH, joint MLE can yield empirically almost the same out-of-sample option pricing performance as direct calibration does to in-sample options, but without costly computations.

In particular, it examines how air transport is not only experienced inequitably among different social groups, but is also an activity whose access and opportunities are geographically distributed in uneven ways. Using Singapore as a candidate and foil to reflect on this issue, this paper interrogates how three 'international' legislative frameworks air traffic rights, air navigation rules, and climate change initiatives have variously limited the city-state's potential to 'move' at different stages of its flying career. Despite the city-state's widely-acclaimed aviation success, this paper demonstrates how it remains subject to the geopolitical actions of more dominant players, residing interstitially between being at the vanguard, and at the peripheries of global air traffic. It is suggested that further interrogations on how particular transport practices and configurations become salient in the world are needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our empirical investigation detects regimes of high and low volatility alternating in a way that is consistent with a theoretical exchange-rate model in which the rate is primarily driven by investors' expectations and not by fundamentals. We interpret these findings as evidence that monetary policy makers were surprisingly able to credibly announce the resumption to gold half a year before it actually took place on January 1, 1879. Given the intense political debate about the appropriate design of the United States' financial system, this is a remarkable result. It indicates that the policy makers' ability to anchor investors' expectations is relevant to achieving asset-price stability as well as effectiveness of financial market regulation. The insights from this historical episode should therefore be of interest to policy makers and regulators combating financial crises like the ongoing current debt crises worldwide.

Our primary focus is on previous provision of informal long-term care, which some studies have found to be correlated with demand for long-term care insurance. We add to the literature by providing a test for causal relationships between previous care-giving and insurance demand, and by exploring the more generally the mechanisms through which previous life experiences are linked to insurance demand. Results are robust to a variety of empirical specifications and estimation methods, including consideration of current care-giving roles and endogenous selection into previous care-giving, and strongly support a causal relationship between previous long-term care-giving and demand for insurance. Our estimates also provide evidence that lifetime health trajectories and family relationships are associated with long-term care insurance demand, and suggest that both emotional and informational forces influence demand.

It builds on previous studies of this issue by including a wider set of control variables, focusing on a longer time period, and testing a series of related hypotheses. The results show that time differences have a negative impact on merchandise trade, with each hour of time difference reducing trade by between 2 and 7 %, although the size of the effect has fallen in recent decades. There is also evidence that the negative impact of time differences is smaller where mechanisms of formal contract enforcement are stronger, and where co-ethnic networks are more prevalent, and that time differences reduce bilateral telephone traffic as well as trade. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that time differences reduce trade by raising the non-pecuniary costs of travel and communication.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Anderson, E (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",Edward.anderson@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,10,12,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Our research has three main findings. First, more productive banks are more likely to enter foreign markets in increasingly complex modes. Second, more productive banks also hold larger volumes of foreign assets.

The most important and most influential technological changes in terms of the impact on the consumer, are iduced by internet, digitization and globalization. However, the era of technological change also means developing biotechnologies, nanotechnologies, new materials and new energy sources, all these changing people's lives, living conditions, their needs and their behaviour as consumers. The literature highlights the factors that influence purchasing behaviour and changes manifested in terms of values, stressing the importance of promoting and protecting consumer's rights and interests, The new responsible consumer can become a key driving force of sustainable development only if it is able to capitalize on new opportunities and to counter new risks of modern marketing technologies based on the Internet and mobile communications. This involves the assimilation of new knowledge throughout life to keep up with the accelerating pace of technological innovation and diffusion of e-commerce solutions and mobile commerce. We study the correlation between the composite index of consumer conditions and the level of participation in lifelong learning programmes in some Member States, based on secondary analysis of the data available at EU level,. The results confirm that the consumer's situation is better in countries where the level of participation in lifelong learning programmes is higher. At the same time, however, the correlation is not linear. This shows that the consumer's situation does not depend exclusively on formal continuing education but also other factors such as timeliness and severity of legal and institutional framework of consumer protection, the acquisition of knowledge through informal means, the requirement of different customers in different countries.","[Burghelea, Cristina] Hyperion Univ, Bucharest, Romania; [Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela] Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Burghelea, C (通讯作者)，Hyperion Univ, Bucharest, Romania.",crystachy@yahoo.com,"Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela/GYU-2760-2022; N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023","Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela/0000-0002-7884-8445",,,,,38,5,5,0,36,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2014,16.0,36,,,,,535,549,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AT0DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344607400007,0

We hypothesize that the participation of strategic alliances lowers a firm's cost of debt because it improves the level and stability of future profit streams and reduces information asymmetry among investors. Based on 2150 bond-issuing firms during the period 1985-2009, we find evidence consistent with this argument. Furthermore, we find that the mitigating effect of strategic alliances on the debt cost is much more pronounced for firms with higher product market competition, more severe financial constraints, and greater R&D investments. Taken together, this is the first paper to examine the importance of strategic alliances in the bond market and our results highlight that corporate alliance activity is valued outside the equity market and creates additional benefits that result in lower cost of debt financing.

One reason is protest behaviour. If the distribution of protest responses is not independent of respondent or survey characteristics, then simply expelling protesters from surveys can lead to sample selection bias. Furthermore, WTP estimates will not be comparable across surveys. This paper seeks to explore potential causes of protest behaviour through a meta-study based on full datasets from 38 different surveys. The objective of the study is to examine the effect of respondent specific variables as well as survey specific variables on protest behaviour. Our results suggest that some of the differences in WTP typically observed between different demographic groups, different elicitation formats and different question formats might actually be attributed to inherent differences in the propensity to protest.

The empirical results indicated that the return (volatility) of most of the assets distributed in alternative markets significantly decreased (increased) as a result of the global financial crisis. Conversely, the oil crisis yielded. inconsistent results. Regarding the influences of both crises on return and volatility, the global financial crisis was more influential than the oil crisis was. Moreover, regarding confidence levels, the skewness effect existed among VaR estimations for only the long position, whereas the fat-tail effect existed among the VaR estimations for only high confidence levels, irrespective of whether a long or short position was traded.

We argue that risks in the case of disasters are highly correlated between subjects whereas risks for which high insurance take-up can be observed (e.g. extended warranties or cell phone insurance) are typically idiosyncratic. We set up a simple model with social reference points and show that in the presence of inequality aversion social comparison makes insurance indeed less attractive if risks are correlated. In addition we conducted a simple experiment which confirms these theoretical results. The average willingness to pay for insurance is significantly higher for idiosyncratic than for correlated risks.,"[Friedl, Andreas; Schmidt, Ulrich] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [de Miranda, Katharina Lima; Schmidt, Ulrich] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Schmidt, U (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",ulrich.schmidt@ifw-kiel.de,"de Miranda, Katharina Lima/ABA-2456-2020",,,,,,39,37,38,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

The realization of the transportation infrastructures, which are already planned and funded, could multiply deforestation by three. In contrast, a global agreement on reduction of total emissions from deforestation could achieve important cuts in GHG emissions from deforestation in the Congo Basin.

The potential (annual) changes in state tax revenue range from negative $29 million in California to positive $16 million in New York. At the federal level, our estimates suggest an overall reduction in revenues, ranging from a potential loss of $187 million to $580 million.

Overall, our results support earlier findings of a negative association between net official development assistance (ODA) and domestic tax revenues, but this relationship appears to have weakened in response to greater efforts at mobilizing domestic revenues in many countries.

The paper further finds that net ODA and grants are negatively associated with VAT, excise tax, and income tax revenues, but have a positive relationship with trade taxes.

Thus, competition over the salience of issue dimensions can, under certain circumstances, be crucial for determining election outcomes. We illustrate potential non-monotonicities in priming effects in terms of the Fourier series decomposition of the distribution of voter preferences, showing that the existence of higher-level harmonics leads to greater uncertainty about election outcomes and about best heresthetic strategies.

Yet REDD+ is also about the effectiveness of reducing emissions. We propose a conceptual framework linking tenure with REDD+ effectiveness, taking into account that tenure security equally protects the right to reduce and to increase emissions. Survey-based research, at five emerging REDD+ sites in Indonesia in 2010, revealed that tenure is ambiguous and contested, thus insecure. Low dependence on forest-based livelihoods suggests limited interest in reducing emissions. Securing community tenure does not necessarily lead to REDD+ effectiveness unless it can compete with other economic interests that emit GHGs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead, narrower instruments, including the feed-in tariff (FIT) for renewable electricity generation, have become popular. However, their causal effect on renewable electricity generation remains subject to uncertainty. We use instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of FITs on renewable electricity generation in 26 industrialized countries, 1979-2005. We find that increasing the FIT by one U.S. cent (2000 constant prices) per kilowatt hour increases the percentage change in renewable electricity's share of the total by 0.11 % points. All else constant, if a country implemented for a decade the sample mean FIT of three U.S. cents, the national share of renewable electricity would increase by 3.3 % points, which is more than the sample mean. In addition to demonstrating that the FIT is an effective way to increase renewable electricity generation, our approach lays the foundation for future studies of the causal effects of renewable energy policies.","[Smith, Michael G.; Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 420 West 118th St,712 Int Affairs Bldg, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,,,,,,23,43,47,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The results indicate that the much celebrated Generalised Extreme Value distribution does not provide the most accurate description of the minima since the Generalised Logistic distribution performs better due to its ability to better capture the fat tails of returns. The time varying nature of extremes is also confirmed while a simulation exercise adds to the robustness of our results. It is also shown that the findings may have important implications for risk models, such as VaR and Expected Shortfall, since risk measures which cannot capture the fatness of tails of the empirical distribution function of returns may lead to serious underestimation of downside risk.

It is also (both qualitatively and quantitatively) robust to controlling for differences in human capital levels, labor productivity, trade union density, and international economic flows.

These measures are regressed on a series of possible determining factors as postulated in existing theoretical and empirical literature. M&A performance is primarily affected by specific M&A characteristics, but not by general market characteristics such as demand development or competition conditions. Rather astonishingly, it is also not affected by firm characteristics such as capital intensity, human capital endowment and firm size. There is an interesting exception: innovation activities.

First, we provide evidence that labor market institutions do matter in location decisions. Precisely, we show that labor market rigidity significantly reduces the country's attractiveness for foreign investors. Yet, the effect is of limited magnitude compared to FDI determinants related to the country's market potential or supply access. Second, we go deeper in the precise role of various LMI dimensions. In line with the literature, we find that stringent employment protection laws have a dampening effect on the location probability. Besides, we show that this is not the only dimension that matters. In particular, we find that the generosity of the unemployment benefit system plays a significant negative role on the country's attractiveness, even once the role of employment protection is controlled for.","[Delbecque, Vincent] Univ Paris 11, Dept Econ, F-92331 Sceaux, France; [Mejean, Isabelle] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Patureau, Lise] Univ Lille 1, Dept Econ & Social Sci, EQUIPPE, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille,"Patureau, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 1, Dept Econ & Social Sci, EQUIPPE, Bat SH2, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",vincent.delbecque@gmail.com; isabelle.mejean@polytechnique.edu; lise.patureau@univ-lille1.fr,,,,,,,30,10,13,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

There is a long tradition of studies looking at the effect of environmental amenities and disamenities on property prices. But, to our knowledge, this is the first nationwide study of the value of proximity to a large number of natural amenities in England. We analysed 1 million housing transactions over 1996-2008 and considered a large number of environmental characteristics. Results reveal that the effects of many of these environmental variables are highly statistically significant, and are quite large in economic magnitude. Gardens, green space and areas of water within the census ward all attract a considerable positive price premium. There is also a strong positive effect from freshwater and flood plain locations, broadleaved woodland, coniferous woodland and enclosed farmland. Increasing distance to natural amenities such as rivers, National Parks and National Trust sites is unambiguously associated with a fall in house prices. Our preferred regression specifications control for unobserved labour market and other geographical factors using Travel to Work Area fixed effects, and the estimates are fairly insensitive to changes in specification and sample. This provides some reassurance that the hedonic price results provide a useful representation of the values attached to proximity to environmental amenities in England. Overall, we conclude that the housing market in England reveals substantial amenity value attached to a number of habitats, designations, private gardens and local environmental amenities.","[Gibbons, Stephen; Mourato, Susana; Resende, Guilherme M.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Mourato, Susana] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Resende, Guilherme M.] Govt Brazil IPEA, Inst Appl Econ Res, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (IPEA),"Mourato, S (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.mourato@lse.ac.uk,"Resende, Guilherme Mendes/K-5821-2012","Gibbons, Stephen/0000-0002-2871-8562",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,74,114,120,5,92,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

If there is a risk-shifting problem, bailout expectations lead to steeper bonus schemes and even more risk taking. If there is an effort problem, the compensation scheme becomes flatter and effort decreases. If both types of agency problems are present, a sufficiently large increase in bailout perceptions makes it optimal for a welfare-maximizing regulator to impose caps on bank bonuses. In contrast, raising managers' liability can be counterproductive.","[Hakenes, Hendrik] Univ Bonn, Dept Finance, Bonn, Germany; [Schnabel, Isabel] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Gutenberg Sch Management & Econ, Mainz, Germany",University of Bonn; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Hakenes, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Finance, Bonn, Germany.",hakenes@uni-bonn.de; isabel.schnabel@uni-mainz.de,"Hakenes, Hendrik/AAB-2657-2019",,,,,,22,27,28,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

It provides a backstop against model risk which arises if some loans get incorrectly rated and become toxic. We study the effects of the LRR on lending strategies and its implications for banks' stability. We show that the LRR might induce banks with low-risk lending strategies to diversify their portfolios into high-risk loans until the LRR is no longer the binding capital constraint on them. If the LRR is lower than the average bank's IRB requirement, the aggregate capital costs of banks do not increase. However, because the diversification makes banks' portfolios more alike the banking sector as a whole may become more exposed to model risk in each loan category. This may undermine banking sector stability. On balance, our calibrated model motivates a significantly higher LRR than the current one. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, interactions among the various entities involved in the taxation process (e.g. taxpayers, law makers, tax practitioners, tax authorities, etc.), and the dynamics that these interactions may generate, seem to play an important role for the actual level of tax compliance. However, the mainstream neoclassical approach to tax evasion (Allingham & Sandmo, 1972) cannot account for such interactions and dynamics. Therefore, during the last two decades new approaches (e.g. lab experiments, agent-based modeling, etc.) have been developed with a view to model how behavioral dynamics may foster or prevent tax evasion. In addition, empirical evidence has been generated that supports a role for such interaction dynamics. In this contribution we survey the main developments in this research area and provide some suggestions for further research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In order to achieve these goals of social responsibility, the public administration authorities must build and adapt the tools of public territorial action based on their specificity and within the existing legal framework and resources,. Thus, the study shows the national and European context that frames the actions of public administration for what concerns the sustainable territorial development. It analyzes the characteristics of administrative- territorial structures of Romania, highlighting their socio- demographic diversity and the territorial forms of institutional cooperation. The approach of these issues is based in the first instance on an analysis of the European strategic documents in the field, as well as on the national regulations concerning the organization and functioning of public administration and territorial planning. The implementation of decentralization and local public autonomy has led to the capitalization of the local potential of some administrative divisions and caused a competition and a difficult cooperation between them. By analogy with the provisions of the quality standards regarding the responsibilities of the organizations towards customers, the study illustrates and analyzes the responsibilities and limits of public administration authorities in promoting sustainable development, territorial equity and the quality of life for the users of public services, i.e. the community members.","[Suditu, Bogdan; Nae, Mariana; Gheorghilas, Aurel] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; [Negut, Silviu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Suditu, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",b_suditu@yahoo.fr,"Gheorghilas, Aurel/AAP-2171-2021",,,,,,38,4,4,1,40,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2014,16.0,35,,,,,154,170,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI5GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336894300011,0

It has led many to question economic theory, which attributes beneficial effects to markets in the allocation of risks and the aggregation of information. In exploring its causes, we investigated to what extent excessive volatility can be observed at the individual level. Economists claim that securities prices are forecasts of future outcomes. Here, we report on a simple experiment in which participants were rewarded to make the most accurate possible forecast of a canonical financial time series. We discovered excessive volatility in individual-level forecasts, paralleling the finding at the market level. Assuming that participants updated their beliefs based on reinforcement learning, we show that excess volatility emerged because of a combination of three factors. First, we found that submitted forecasts were noisy perturbations of participants' revealed beliefs. Second, beliefs were updated using a prediction error based on submitted forecast rather than revealed past beliefs. Third, in updating beliefs, participants maladaptively decreased learning speed with prediction risk. Our results reveal formerly undocumented features in individual-level forecasting that may be critical to understand the inherent instability of financial markets and inform regulatory policy.","[Nursimulu, Anjali] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bossaerts, Peter] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Bossaerts, Peter] Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; California Institute of Technology; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI),"Nursimulu, A (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol, Stn 5 1-17, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",anjali.nursimulu@epfl.ch,"Bossaerts, Peter/AAZ-9851-2020; Bossaerts, Peter/O-9964-2015","Bossaerts, Peter/0000-0003-2308-2603;",,,,,22,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

In contrast, exports of the crisis country fall modestly and then remain close to or even above the predicted level.

After the latest development about Cyprus banking system Crisis and searching the reasons of this Crisis (of March 2013), before and after the decisions of Euro group (of 15/3/2013) we have to answer about the situation that emerged. The questions was about the reformations needed after the decision of Eurogroup, including the shrinkage of Cyprus banking system, to a more smaller in capitalization and in volume of turnover, of the existed banking system in Cyprus. The Eurogroup insisted, that the size of banking system, is now 8 times bigger than the G.D.P. of the country, asking simultaneously from Cyprus government, to alter the economic model of the country, by reducing the service/banking sector, after the bankruptcy of one at least of the two bigger banks. The big problem emerged, after the declaration of the suspension of the deposits guarantee and the fear of the Bank run  and the following collapses of banks in many states. So we have to examine the right application of rules and procedures for the Banking system. The target is to examine the mistakes and inefficiencies, that brinks the system very near to collapse, through the contagion mechanism, to the rest of Eurozone and mainly to Greek Banking System. After the above, we have to examine and re-examine the methods of Supervision of Banking System procedures (choosing among other) political/country risk and credit risk, in order to increase the credibility and the soundness of Banking System. So we have to analyze here a Systematic Risk situation and analyse the Methods referring to the supervisory criteria of Banking System to prevent the negative impacts of the systematic risk, that is possible to lead to an irregular bankruptcy.

In this study, segmentation is carried out based on expected experience of Chinese tourists in Shanghai World Expo. Segmentation reveals four tourist clusters with different interests in their experience visiting World Expo. The clusters showed insignificant differences in demographics, but proved to be powerfully discriminant in tourists' satisfaction and loyalty, which affirms the potential of tourist experience being a segmenting variable. Moreover, thanks to the analysis, an evaluation of Shanghai World Expo's success in terms of visitors' satisfaction is provided. (C) The Authors.

Uncertainty is a changeability state of the environment including uncertain market, failure to forecast the impact of changes in environmental, and unable to expect the outcomes of a response choice. SMEs have scarcity resources in terms of financial, skills, knowledge and technology; therefore, the sustainable business successes of SMEs hinge more on suppliers' capabilities and co-operative relationships as well as customer integration. Since SMEs operate under highly competitive environment, thus SMEs need to monitor their environment to identify potential collaborative opportunities with suppliers and customers. In addition, the close relationships with suppliers and customers allow SMEs to access to the latest process, technologies, materials and other methods of innovation. Particularly, there is a lack of studies that investigate the effect of EU on the external integration-firm performance relationship in Malaysian SMEs of manufacturing industry. As such, the implications of the three sources of uncertainty - demand uncertainty, technological uncertainty and competitive threats are discussed. Ultimately, this study could enrich the existing body of knowledge in supply chain integration, EU and performance of SMEs in the manufacturing industry. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Using two large datasets, the National Survey of Families and Households and the public use files of the U.S. Census, we find that the predicted probability of employment and labor force participation is 4-10 percentage points higher for married women with young children living in close proximity to their mothers or their mothers-in-law compared with those living further away.

It's notoriously known wind and solar power are more mature and establish with some competitive costs, taking into consideration the public incentives. Most of the countries with a significant level of RETs in its energy matrix, such as Brazil, Germany, US, China and others have demonstrated that it is possible to create vibrant markets for RETs, and to do so very rapidly; but the results in these same countries also shows that the renewable energy policies have been unsuccessful to date, in some aspect.

Recognition on the economic contribution of copyright-based industries therefore will bring policy implications on the development of the industry and protection of copyrights in Indonesia. Copyright issue is crucial in the era of entrepreneurship and creative economy since it protects one's invention and enables the inventor to own, buy, sell, and use their property in a market economy. This study adopts World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO)framework and methodology to quantify the contribution of copyright and related right industries in Indonesia in terms of output, value-added, and employment. Following WIPO's methodology, the copyright and related right industries are categorized into four layers, that is, core copyright, interdependent copyright, partial copyright, and non-dedicated support industries. This study has three objectives, that is (1) identifying the copyright-based industries, which are categorized to the four categories of industries, (2) calculating the economic contribution of the four categories of copyright industries, and (3) comparing the results with those of other countries.

If Quesada is correct, then his argument has major consequences for social choice theory; for instance, it warrants reconsidering the significance of Arrow's Theorem. If Quesada is incorrect, however, then his position is dangerously misleading. This paper argues that Quesada is wrong. His argument depends on his own formal account of power, an account that is implausible because it disregards a basic insight common to the standard characterisations of voting power: the idea that one has power over an outcome to the extent that one is able to change that outcome. Claims about power have a counterfactual component; to assert that an individual actually has determined an outcome is also to make an assertion about what would have been the case had that individual acted differently. We can employ David Lewis's influential account of counterfactuals to show, contra Quesada, that in a dictatorship, non-dictatorial individuals and groups cannot possibly determine a social preference. In short, Quesada is fundamentally mistaken about power, and thus also about the distribution of power in a dictatorship.","Univ Cape Town, Dept Philosophy, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Fried, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Dept Philosophy, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",gregory.fried@uct.ac.za,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2014,158.0,1-2,,,,,243,251,,10.1007/s11127-013-0092-8,0.0,,,9,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AA3FZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330979600018,0

Especially vertically cooperating systems have developed in many commercial sectors at present. One of their advantages is the unification of main distribution channel members under one umbrella. Therefore, they present themselves externally as one unit, although internally, several units work hand in hand. One example of a vertically operating system is franchising. Selecting adequate partners to expand the systems and to trigger growth, coverage, market share, and popularity has turned out to be a challenge in franchising. Researchers are united in the thought of selecting qualified franchisees; it is perceived as the franchisor's single most pervasive operating problem (Clarkin and Swavely 2006), which prevails for national and international franchising alike. The goal of this academic contribution is developing a two-step model for successful partner selection in international franchising. The model is based first on cross border literature review elements, and second, paired with expert interviews from German speaking countries to finally determine a questionnaire for franchisors, in order to build the ideal profile of franchise candidates for Germany based franchisors. The main result of this paper is the model. It is based on three franchisee attributes found relevant for selection: local knowledge, soft skills, and hard skills. Final results will help any German franchisor to fine tune its approach of franchisee selection and to professionalize the selection phase in order to chose more profitable candidates. Reliability of the model will be considered after testing the two-step model in the near future.","Univ Latvia, Riga, Germany",,"Gaul, C (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Germany.",c.gaul@andre-media.de,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-836-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,149,156,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360008500014,0

Subjective causes are of two types: The systematic failure of the human factor, which is mostly the cognitive distortion of intuitive judgment occurring at the mental level of thinking. The unpreparedness of managers to effectively apply approaches and tools of theoretical disciplines within managerial calculations (e.g. logic, game theory, system theory, information theory, probability theory, etc.), which are successfully applied in both nature and technical science.

A surprising result in Heckscher/Ohlin is that the effect on factor prices of an infinitesimal change in a commodity price depends neither on the importance of the industry nor on the differences between sectors in the flexibility of technology. For finite price changes this need no longer be the case, and the model form itself may change endogenously as production patterns get altered. Furthermore, the extent of the response of the wage rate to a price increase in the more labor-intensive commodity becomes less severe the greater is the discrepancy between the degree of labor-intensity difference between sectors in the Heckscher-Ohlin model but more severe in the Specific-Factors model.

The new Group of Twenty summit process, which includes the largest emerging economies, has established high-level international policy cooperation in this new setting. This article argues that effective global economic governance will also require changes in key global organizations-such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, World Trade Organization, and the Financial Stability Board-and closer collaboration between global and regional organizations. We suggest that federalism be introduced on a global scale by creating hierarchies of global and regional organizations with overlapping ownership structures in various functional areas (as is already the case with the World Bank and regional development banks in the area of development finance). Asia could contribute to this transformation by building effective institutions to promote macroeconomic and financial stability and deepen regional trade and investment integration. Similar logic could be applied to a broader issue of providing international public goods, such as environmental and climate protection, communicable disease control, and disaster risk management.

However the lack of awareness on the benefits of the RL both from economic and environment angles is a major factor creating the resistance to complement the logistics activities with RL. Methodology- This study follows a literature research approach in investigating the intersecting and mutually constitutive aspects of LCs and RL and offers a theoretical systematic infrastructure for the firms to be encouraged in engaging with RL through the establishment of LCs. Findings- The consolidation of RL functions under the organized structure of LC would provide a wide range of opportunities and benefits for the organizations. The five major aspects endowed by the construction of a logistics village and the inclusion of RL activities in this central organizing, operational and administrative hub are; coordination and cooperation, centralization, consolidation, 3rd party RL collaboration and integration. Conclusion- Along with the opportunities, the barriers in front of the establishment of a RL system and the contribution of LCs in overcoming these challenges are discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The data that was collected from the field was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings established that there was a strong positive correlation of 0.982 between reduction of employees and the dependent variable employee performance. From the findings the study recommends that organizations that aim at improving the performance of their employees need to consider applying downsizing.

Due to the non-stationary properties of the data, cointegration techniques are applied to investigate the long run equilibrium relationships. Error Correction Models are implemented to estimate short run dynamics as well as the speed of adjustment from the short to the long run. Results suggest that fare and GDP are the main determinants of the public transport mode shares both in the short and in the long run.

Furthermore, as of 2005, companies listed on the European stock markets had to adopt IFRS for the preparation of their group accounts, thus needing also to apply different accounting regulations: IFRS for the group accounts and European directives for individual accounts. This study investigates through an empirical association study the impact of the mandatory adoption of IFRS starting with 2005 on the absolute and relative quality (measured through value relevance) of financial information supplied by the consolidated accounts for companies listed on the largest European stock markets (London, Paris, and Frankfurt stock exchanges). The results show an increase of consolidated statements quality (value relevance) once IFRS were adopted, thus suggesting also that the IFRS adoption in Europe led to better complying with the OECD Corporate Governance Principle of high quality disclosure and transparency. Moreover, we ascertained an increase in the quality surplus supplied by group accounts compared to parent company individual accounts once the IFRS adoption became mandatory for preparing consolidated financial statements.

This study also finds that the company paying dividends or higher dividends is at the small size. Explaining for this, the groups of authors suggest that small companies pay dividends or higher dividends because they want to keep the stock price in the context of stock market declining. This makes the authors questions whether the company pay dividends to meet the need of investor. Therefore, the authors suggest further research which is used to test the theory to meet the needs of dividend on the stock market in Vietnam.","[Nguyen Gia Duong; Nguyen Thi Hai Binh Le] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Finance & Banking Fac, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Truong Niem] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Food Ind, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University; Ho Chi Minh City University of Food Industry,,nguyengiaduong@tdt.edu.vn; nguyenthihaibinh@tdt.edu.vn; niemlt@cntp.edu.vn,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,415,422,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200031,0

The semi-parametric Cox proportional hazard model is applied with a comprehensive specification of firm-specific, industrial and macroeconomic factors. There is strong evidence of market selection that labour productivity is the most important internal factor supporting firm survival. Other evidence is that firms with higher profitability in terms of profit per employee will have higher survival probability. For private firms, in terms of start-up factors, although total assets increase probability of survival, total sales decrease. Besides, industries which have increasing number of employees open favourable opportunities for new private firms. In addition, the macroeconomic factor, GDP, significantly supports the development of private firms.","[Nguyen Thi Nguyet] Cent Inst Econ Management Review, Hanoi, Vietnam",,,nguyetnt@mpi.gov.vn,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-405-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,514,527,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC0JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349078200038,0

Thus, this study aims at measuring the efficiency of water & wastewater companies (WWCs) as incentive regulation tools for stimulating efficiency of production and supply through cost reduction and improving the quality of services provide by water distributors. In this study, the performances of 34 WWCs were assessed using non-parametric methods as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in 2011. Furthermore, we reviewed the DEA-based Malmquist approach for total factor productivity (TFP) and technology change in WWCs over the period of 2008 to 2011. An input variable includes operating costs, number of employees (staff) and number of water connections and output variables are the volumes of water billed and the number of customers. The results of analysis indicate that the average efficiency of WWCs under constant return to scale (CRS) is equal to 77% (technical efficiency) and under variable return to scale (VRS) is equal to 88% (scale efficiency). In other words, given the existing resources and facilities, the potential to improve water production equals to 23% and 12% respectively. Whereas in terms of constant return to scale (CRS), the cost saving potential amounts to 1874 billion Rials or 16% of the operating costs (price=2011). Also, the Malmquist index for total factor productivity (TFP) and technology change are calculated as 0.951 and 0.940 respectively, indicating a decrease of productivity in the Iranian water & wastewater industry during 2008 to 2011.

Following Porter's (Sci Am 264(4):168, 1991) hypothesis that environmental regulation can improve firms' competitiveness, we distinguish between regulation-induced and voluntary environmental innovations. We find that innovations which do not improve firms' resource efficiency do not provide positive returns to profitability. However, innovations that increase a firm's resource efficiency in terms of material or energy consumption per unit of output have a positive impact on profitability. This positive result holds for both regulation-induced and voluntary innovations, although the effect is greater for regulation-driven innovation. We conclude that the Porter hypothesis does not hold in general for its strong version, but depends on the type of environmental innovation. Our findings rest on firm-level data from the German part of the Community Innovation Survey 2008 (CIS 2008).","[Rexhaeuser, Sascha; Rammer, Christian] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Rexhaeuser, Sascha] Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); KU Leuven,"Rexhäuser, S (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",rexhaeuser@zew.de,"Rammer, Christian/ABA-8789-2021","Rammer, Christian/0000-0002-1173-9471",,,,,61,214,231,16,182,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Some authors try to improve the prediction accuracy of the models by using averaged ratios involving several years before bankruptcy. This of course assumes that a bankruptcy can be predicted several years ahead. This idea led us to investigating the differences between the dynamics of the financial ratios developments. Here we assume that the dynamics of the values of some indicators in a group of prospering companies may be different from that of those facing bankruptcy threats. The indicators that showed a significant difference in the development dynamics were used to develop a bankruptcy prediction model. The research was carried out using data of the Czech manufacturing industries obtained from the AMADEUS database for years 2004 to 2011, with each company providing data for up to five years prior to the bankruptcy. Along with investigating the different approach to the selection of indicators for the development of a bankruptcy model, we were also concerned with the selection of a method to develop it. Researching the literature, we found that the most commonly used method is one of linear discrimination analysis, whose precision is improved if applied to normally distributed data without outliers. With financial data, however, these assumptions are difficult to meet. Therefore, a non-parametric boosted-trees method was used to select the predictors and develop the bankruptcy models.

This relatively new banking transactions channel offers its users round the clock access to bank services, reduced time, direct access from anywhere in the world, lower costs and elimination of the anxiety caused by cash carrying. However, internet banking has not yet been widely embraced by Greek bank customers. In fact Greeks have also been rather slow in adopting internet as well. This reality prompted the pursuance of the present research, whose aim is to identify the most salient factors that influence Greek bank customers regarding internet banking adoption. Field research was conducted by utilizing an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was based on an adaptation of the widely used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), incorporating also external variables found in relevant literature and was initially successfully pilot-tested by the directors of 3 bank branches and 11 bank customers. The field research target sample consisted of internet experienced bank customers in the Greek region of Thessaly, while the final sample comprised 266 correctly answered questionnaires. Principal component analysis was initially conducted to identify latent factors within the questionnaire items measufing customer perceptions and inter-item analysis was used to verify the scale's factors for internal consistency and reliability. The Cronbach's alpha values, calculated for each construct, ranged between 0.88 and 0.93. Finally, linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the effect of the external variables and TAM-based constructs on internet banking adoption. Data analysis confirmed the significant influence that customer perceptions about usefulness, credibility and easiness of use of internet banking have on intentions towards using this banking channel. Moreover domain specific innovativeness and satisfaction with ATMs were also proved strong predictors of customer use intentions. (C) 2014 The Authors.

And while the history of such research activities extends back over decades, the main driver of the comprehensive development of practical recommendations formed on their basis is an increase in the quality of sampling and improvement in research methods.

The analysis performed allows us to share positive conclusions about its relevance to emerging markets in post-crisis period as well. But what is more significant, based on the results of empirical analysis, we substantiate the necessity for researchers to go beyond the scope of the problem of selecting this or that index of static efficiency and pay attention to the dynamic efficiency index that reflects how a company has fulfilled its potential to increase value through compliance with standard correlations of growth rates of static efficiency indices.

Referencing to classical approaches we show some limitations and negligence of the widely accepted innovation indicators used in various statistics. In most considered models of innovation the role of academia is underestimated. We deal with this problem in the paper and claim the need of creating innovation feedback between academia and industry. The presented considerations are related to our experience in cooperation with industry. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We use a new measure of local dependence (introduced by Tjostheim and Hufthammer (2013)) to study the contagion effect. The central idea of the new approach is to approximate an arbitrary bivariate return distribution by a family of Gaussian bivariate distributions. At each point of the return distribution there is a Gaussian distribution that gives a good approximation at that point. The correlation of the approximating Gaussian distribution is taken as the local correlation in that neighbourhood. By examining the local Gaussian correlation before the shock (in a stable period) and after the shock (in the crisis period), we are able to test whether contagion has occurred by a bootstrap testing procedure. The use of local Gaussian correlation is compared to other methods of studying contagion. Further, the bootstrap test is examined in a Monte Carlo study, and shows good level and power properties. We illustrate our approach by re-examining the Mexican crisis of 1994, the Asian crisis of 1997-1998 and the financial crisis of 2007-2009. We find evidence of contagion based on our new procedure and are able to describe the nonlinear dependence structure of these crises. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Strategic management theories provide a basis for novel approaches to strategy development in higher education institutions. Though, they do not address all pressing issues that education managers face today. The focus of this paper is on discussing some basic principles of strategy-making in a contemporary university. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the internal factors, which comprise a complicated educational environment of a modern university. The analysis provided in this paper is based on the academic literature review as well as on the author's professional experience in the area of educational management. It is argued that in their labours to develop and implement a number of strategies, education managers should distinguish between the corporate-level strategic goals and functional area-specific strategic goals. The goals must be set with regards to the holistic approach to managing the integrated educational environment resources. The analysis performed in this paper allows the author to conclude that the implementation of strategic initiatives aimed at achieving academic excellence and competitive advantage requires the appropriate distribution of the internal educational environment resources and external funds, the emphasis being put on providing tight collaboration throughout the organization for attaining synergy across functional areas.

At the business level, strategic leadership is entrepreneurship by means of organizational learning. At the interpersonal level, strategic leadership is managerial leadership with the objective of leading organizational members to help the organization learn. On the basis of their effects on organizational learning, we characterize interpersonal-level leadership styles as enabling, coercive, or relationship-nurturing. In the Chinese cultural context, Taoist leadership is enabling, Legalist leadership is coercive, and Confucian leadership is relationship-nurturing. Different combinations of the interpersonal-level leadership styles with the business-level entrepreneurial orientation produce different effects on exploratory or exploitative organizational learning.

Indeed, there are new important players in GISc, with training in and outside of Geography, with backgrounds as diverse as the engineering/computational sciences and the digital humanities as well as critical human geographies. Mobilities researchers, qualitative GIS scholars, cyberinfrastructural scientists, and social and cultural geographers have configured research programs around the proliferation of locationally-aware devices and the 'big data' that have emerged from them.

We also find that analysts delay responses to favorable information for outperformers with lower representative information, suggesting that analysts' underreaction to new favorable information is partially explained by the effect of psychological conservatism.

Based on a stylized model of duopolistic competition under an effective AD law, we first analyze the case where a foreign firm convicted of dumping is required to pay an AD duty. We then examine the case in which a convicted foreign firm has the option of (i) paying an AD duty or (ii) accepting an undertaking by raising product price to its normal value. Taking into account the GATT/WTO policy that an AD duty rate must not exceed the margin of dumping, we show conditions under which a foreign firm chooses to evade its AD fine by a price undertaking. We find that the welfare-maximizing AD duty rate for a dumped product depends crucially on its normal value. If the foreign product's normal value is critically high, the optimal AD rate is set to fully reflect the dumping margin. Otherwise, the optimal AD rate is set lower than the dumping margin. From the perspective of social welfare, these findings help to identify the economic conditions under which one policy instrument is chosen over the other against foreign dumping.

It is therefore, important for the management to understand local customers' shopping motives toward hypermarket as prior studies on shopping motives, however, focused solely on Western shopping motives. This study provides an exploratory examination of Malaysia hypermarket shoppers' shopping motives. A total of 450 questionnaires were administered to female hypermarkets shoppers using store-intercept survey method. Factor analysis identified three shoppers for patronizing hypermarkets namely apathetic shoppers, recreational shoppers and economic shoppers. The groups significantly differ in their appraisals of what motivate them shopped at the hypermarkets. Managerial implications are discussed based on findings. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We notice a general slowdown in financial integration and a reduction in cross-border assets in the hope of limiting international contagion.

We document that preferences vary systematically with cantonal characteristics. In particular, cantons whose voters are more conservative, less in favor of redistribution and less supportive of public spending tend to have stronger direct democracy. We show that voter preferences have a stable and sizable effect on government spending even conditional on many observable cantonal characteristics. We then revisit the relationship between direct democracy and public spending. Once we fully control for voter preferences, the cross-sectional correlation between direct democracy and government spending declines by roughly 20%. The results in this article provide empirical support for models, in which both voter preferences and direct democratic institutions are important determinants of the size of government.

Many cities have thus sought to increase the share of sustainable transport, and specifically travel by bicycle. However, it appears that measures to foster cycling are often implemented on an ad hoc basis, lacking strategic focus and a more profound understanding of bicycle cultures. New insights can be gained from Copenhagen, Denmark, a selfdeclared City of Cyclists that has made considerable progress towards increasing the share of travel by bicycle, with the political goal to become the world's best city for bicycling. In this article, the success, reproducibility and limitations of the Copenhagen bicycle strategy are discussed in an urban transport transitions framework, based on a content- and discourse analysis of the city's official documents to assess the respective role of market-based, command-and-control, and soft policy measures in encouraging bicycling. Results suggest that soft policies, integrated with command-and-control measures, and the consideration of bicyclist expectations and concerns with regard to perceptions of safety, speed and comfort have been key in achieving high bicycle trip shares. Integrating these in comprehensive planning frameworks appears to be an approach that is more likely to foster bicycle cultures that can result in urban transport transitions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It will bring benefits to the environment and contribute towards financing the cost of maintaining road infrastructure, but wider effects are also expected. This study measures the transfer of revenue derived from the introduction of the Eurovignette directive using an OD trucks matrix and a Geographic Information System (GIS). A revenue transfer matrix is obtained reflecting the cost of the toll fees paid and collected by each country for the use of both its own roads and those of the other countries. From this matrix it is possible to know which countries will have positive or negative balances between revenue and payments as a consequence of introducing a common road pricing policy. The results obtained demonstrate that this revenue transfer between European countries will be highly asymmetrical, with a clear trend towards positive balances for central countries and negative balances for peripheral ones.

We incorporate filtering methods for the estimation of the latent log-volatility process. The dependence between daily returns and realized measurement errors leads us to develop a two-step estimation method for all parameters in our model specification. The estimation method is computationally straightforward even when the stochastic volatility model has non-Gaussian return innovations and leverage effects.

A historical coincidence during the land reform of the 1960-70s made only some communities eligible for plot titling.

In particular, we hypothesize that while economic freedom that emerges spontaneously may be growth promoting, economic freedom that emerges as a result of costly lobbying efforts may be less fruitful. In an extreme case, costly lobbying efforts may even negate the growth-enhancing effect of economic freedom. To the extent that lobbying efforts constitute an opportunity cost of resources diverted away from investment and production, our hypothesis also implies that greater the opportunity cost of lobbying, the more efficient is the institutional environment. Panel data analysis reveals the expected positive relation between economic freedom and growth, and consistent with our hypothesis, the findings indicate that the impact of economic freedom on growth does indeed diminish as lobbying efforts increase. In addition, we find that lobbying is more harmful to growth at greater levels of economic freedom.","[Heckelman, Jac C.] Wake Forest Univ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Wilson, Bonnie] St Louis Univ, St Louis, MO 63103 USA",Wake Forest University; Saint Louis University,"Heckelman, JC (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, 122 Carswell Hall, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",heckeljc@wfu.edu,"Wilson, Bonnie/ABD-8512-2021; Yoon, DongJoon/E-9146-2014",,,,,,53,13,14,0,29,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

A starting point in this respect may be decomposition of cyclical and structural parts of the current account balance. Employing a simple methodology, this study aims at adjusting the current account balance for the Turkish economy by correcting the cyclical components such as external demand, domestic demand and foreign trade prices during 2003-2012 period. The estimations under various assumptions indicate deterioration in the structural (non-cyclical) part of the current account balance during the last decade. Recent episode is characterized by a rather stable course for the underlying current account deficit around 5 percent of the GDP.

We provide an example in which a non-timber forest product - charcoal - appears to be providing a pathway out of poverty for some rural households in Uganda. Data come from households living adjacent to natural forests, some of whom engage in charcoal production. We use a semi-parametric method to identify the determinants of participation in charcoal production and a quantile regression decomposition to measure the heterogeneous effect of participation on household income. We find that younger households and those with few productive assets are more likely to engage in charcoal production. We also show that, as a result of their participation, charcoal producers are better off than non-charcoal producers in terms of income, even though they are worse off in terms of productive assets.","[Ainembabazi, John Herbert; Shively, Gerald; Angelsen, Arild] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, UMB Sch Econ & Business, N-1432 As, Norway; [Shively, Gerald] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Ainembabazi, JH (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, UMB Sch Econ & Business, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",J.Ainembabazi@cgiar.org; shivelyg@purdue.edu; arild.angelsen@umb.no,,"Angelsen, Arild/0000-0002-6037-6849",,,,,47,17,20,0,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

CO2 emissions for land transport options connecting with the respective ferry services are also analysed. In particular the study offers a comparison of transport CO2 emissions for long-range ferry services between Aberdeen and the Orkney Islands and short-range ferry services across the Pentland Firth. The latter involve a longer road journey for vehicles than the former. The results indicate significantly greater CO2 emissions for long-range ferry services, despite shorter road connections. Existing public policy in this regard specifies and subsidises higher CO2 emission ferry services operating on longer sea routes, to the disadvantage of non-subsidised short crossing services, the latter offering much lower CO2 emission impacts (inclusive of connecting land transport CO2 emissions). This suggests that policymakers need to focus on assessing CO2 emission impacts when considering future tenders for subsidised ferry services. Findings also suggest that, for modest sized ferries serving islands, the optimal solution may be to use/specify the shortest possible sea routes in order to reduce CO2 emissions from transport.

The contemporaneous correlations suggest that the relationship between sector indices and oil prices change over time and they are industry specific. In addition, the supply-side oil price shocks result in low to moderate positive correlation levels, the precautionary demand oil price shocks lead to almost zero correlation levels, whereas the aggregate demand oil price shocks generate significant changes in the correlation levels (either positive or negative). Both the origin of the oil price shock and the type of industry are important determinants of the correlation level between industrial sectors' returns and oil prices.

We hypothesized that, because assessment is associated with great concern over self-evaluation particularly as it applies to social comparison and extrinsic motivation-it should promote materialistic concerns which in turn should decrease affective wellbeing. In contrast, owing to high levels of task involvement and intrinsic motivation, locomotion is expected to be negatively associated with materialism and well-being. In Study 1, we found that individuals in an assessment mode as opposed to a locomotion mode were more likely to rate materialistic choices as more normative.

This paper uses a panel data set from Russia, an economy in which household debt has grown at an astounding rate, to examine the importance of financial literacy and its effects on behavior. The paper studies both the financial and real consequences of financial illiteracy. Even though consumer borrowing increased very rapidly in Russia, only 41% of respondents demonstrate an understanding of interest compounding and only 46% can answer a simple question about inflation. Financial literacy is positively related to participation in financial markets and negatively related to the use of informal sources of borrowing. Moreover, individuals with higher financial literacy are significantly less likely to report experiencing a negative income shock during 2009 and have greater availability of unspent income and higher spending capacity. The relationship between financial literacy and availability of unspent income is higher in 2009, suggesting that financial literacy may better equip individuals to deal with macroeconomic shocks.

The lack of resources in SMEs to engage in looking outward is said to be a barrier to OI, but at the same time this shortage is cited as a motive for looking beyond organisational boundaries for technological knowledge. We investigate how OI dimensions impact the innovative performance of SMEs in comparison to large companies. The key finding is that the effects of OI practices in SMEs often differ from those in large firms. SMEs are more effective in using different OI practices simultaneously when they introduce new products on the market, whereas this is less the case for large firms. Turnover from new products in SMEs is driven by intellectual property protection mechanisms, while large firms in this case benefit more from their search strategies.","[Spithoven, Andre] Belgian Sci Policy Off, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Vanhaverbeke, Wim; Roijakkers, Nadine] Hasselt Univ, Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Vanhaverbeke, Wim] Esade Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain; [Vanhaverbeke, Wim] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore",Hasselt University; Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE); National University of Singapore,"Spithoven, A (通讯作者)，Belgian Sci Policy Off, Ave Louise 231, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",andre.spithoven@belspo.be,"Roijakkers, Nadine/IQS-7526-2023; Spithoven, Andre/T-3669-2019; Vanhaverbeke, Wim/C-6367-2011","Roijakkers, Nadine/0000-0001-5475-2222; Vanhaverbeke, Wim/0000-0002-5710-4738; Spithoven, Andre/0000-0002-2178-9771",,,,,76,354,389,27,297,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using the ratio of regular employees in the labor force in the year preceding an individual's graduation as an instrument for the first-job status (i.e., regular job or not), we confirm that even for women, whose retention rates are lower than those of men because of marriage and childbirth, individuals' first-job status has a significant effect on their job status in the future. We further find that the effect gradually declines over the years and effectively disappears around 10 years after graduation. Finally, we find that the first-job effect is reversible: no negative effect of failing to obtain a regular job at graduation is observed if an individual can secure regular employment within a reasonable time period after graduation.

Although supporters stress that disclosure encourages tax compliance, policy debates proceed in the absence of empirical evidence about this, and any other, claimed behavioral impact. This paper provides the first such evidence by examining the behavioral response to the Japanese tax return public notification system. The analysis suggests that, when there is a threshold for disclosure, a non-trivial number of both individual and corporate taxpayers whose tax liability would otherwise be close to the threshold will under-report so as to avoid disclosure - a response in the opposite direction from that stressed by supporters of disclosure.

With the bank correspondents, banks are allowed to reach the almost 2200 municipalities without bank branches in 2000, connecting 45 million people to the financial sector. The evidence is based on the estimation of an entry model of financial providers in Brazilian municipalities. I estimate a zero population entry threshold for banking correspondents for the period from 2002 to 2007. The estimated population entry thresholds for bank branches in the same period are relatively stable at approximately 8000-9000 people. The population entry thresholds for the second to fifth players for banking correspondents are also consistently lower than those for bank branches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The link between these campaigns and the adoption of these non-state market driven (NSMD) mechanisms is, however, more complex than often portrayed. There is an uneasy tension between demands favouring NSMD as a new form of private governance that will vary its own stewardship standards according to scientific information, multi-stakeholder deliberations, and price signals; and traditional demands that focus on a specific behaviour of a specific firm over a specific, albeit narrow, environmental problem. Indecision on the part of NGOs about the approach to take creates mixed signals, affecting firm decisions (purchasers and producers) in ways that can reduce the institutionalization of private authority.

The volatility of an asset of composite index can be traded by using volatility derivatives, such as volatility and variance swaps, options and futures. The most popular volatility index is VIX, which is a key measure of market expectations of volatility, and hence also an important barometer of investor sentiment and market volatility. Investors interpret the VIX cash index as a fear index, and of VIX options and VIX futures as derivatives of the fear index. VIX is based on S&P500 call and put options over a wide range of strike prices, and hence is not model based. Speculators can trade on volatility risk with VIX derivatives, with views on whether volatility will increase or decrease in the future, while hedgers can use volatility derivatives to avoid exposure to volatility risk. VIX and its options and futures derivatives has been widely analysed in recent years. An alternative volatility derivative to VIX is the S&P500 variance futures, which is an expectation of the variance of the S&P500 cash index. Variance futures are futures contracts written on realized variance, or standardized variance swaps. The S&P500 variance futures are not model based, so the assumptions underlying the index do not seem to have been clearly understood. As variance futures are typically thinly traded, their returns and volatility are not easy to model accurately using a variety of volatility model specifications. This paper analyses the volatility in S82P500 3-month and 12-month variance futures Before, During and After the GFC, as well as for the full data period, for each of three alternative conditional volatility models and three densities, in order to determine whether exposure to risk can be incorporated into a financial portfolio without taking positions on the S82P500 index itself.

For any currency pair in a particular period, one currency has higher assets return than the other and can be considered the high-return-currency (HRC). Financial institutions attempt to hold more HRC assets when they become more risk-loving or the relative return of the assets is expected to increase. Such a portfolio reallocation generates buy order toward the HRC and the currency appreciates. As the HRC changes over time, the direction that the relative return and risk appetite affect the exchange rate varies in different regimes. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As realized returns are used as a proxy for expected returns, we separately examine conditional returns in upturn and downturn periods, in order to successfully identify risk and return relationships. Results indicate that co-skewness and downside beta are priced by investors. Further testing confirms a separate premium for each measure, confirming that they capture different aspects of downside risk. Robustness tests indicate that, when combined with other risk measures, both retain their explanatory power. Tests also indicate that co-skewness may be the more robust measure.

A factor model approach,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sovereign CDS spreads; Default and liquidity intensities; Grid search method and exponential affine models,LIQUIDITY RISK; YIELD SPREADS; DETERMINANTS,"In this study, we use a factor model in order to decompose sovereign Credit Default Swaps (CDS) spreads into default, liquidity, systematic liquidity and correlation components. By calibrating the model to sovereign CDSs and bonds we are able to present a better decomposition and a more accurate measure of spread components. Our analysis reveals that sovereign CDS spreads are highly driven by liquidity (55.6% of default risk and 44.32% of liquidity) and that sovereign bond spreads are less subject to liquidity frictions and therefore could represent a better proxy for sovereign default risk (73% of default risk and 26.86% of liquidity). Furthermore, our model enables us to directly study the effect of systematic liquidity and flight-to-liquidity risks on bond and CDS spreads through the factor sensitivity matrix. We find that these risks do have an influence on the default intensity and they contribute significantly to spread movements. Finally, our empirical results advance the idea that the increase in the CDS spreads observed during the crisis period was mainly due to a surge in liquidity rather than to an increase in the default intensity.

In this paper, we review the experimental evidence on preferences for redistribution and suggest some links to redistribution through pensions. For that purpose we distinguish between three types of situations. The first deals with distributional preferences behind a veil of ignorance. In the second type of situation, individuals make choices in front of the veil of ignorance and know their position. Finally, we discuss situations in which income is determined by interdependent rather than individual choices. In the closing sections of the paper, we discuss whether and how these experimental results speak to the redistribution issues of pensions.

Yet, both planar KDE and NetKDE are still used largely as a visualization tool, due to the missing of quantitative statistical inference assessment. This paper integrates NetKDE with local Moran'I for hot spot detection of traffic accidents. After density is computed for road segments through NetKDE, it is then used as the attribute for computing local Moran's I. With an NetKDE-based approach, conditional permutation, combined with a 100-m neighbor for Moran's I computation, leads to fewer statistically significant high-high (HH) segments and hot spot clusters. By conducting a statistical significance analysis of density values, it is now possible to evaluate formally the statistical significance of the extensiveness of locations with high density values in order to allocate limited resources for accident prevention and safety improvement effectively.

Sophisticated methods have been developed to reliably elicit CPT parameters on an individual basis. The aim of this paper is to analyze whether such methods are suited to be applied in real world situations, particularly in the context of investment counseling for retail investors. Specifically, we examine whether CPT parameters elicited via standardized computer tools are successful in predicting an individual's preference for different structured financial products. Surprisingly, we find only low predictive power of the elicited CPT parameters on the WTP. Using a second set of experiments, we examine possible explanations for the low prediction quality. Overall, we have to conclude that it is too much of a leap to draw conclusions about the attractiveness of complex financial products from CPT parameters elicited via simple lotteries.

Originators issue too many informationally insensitive securities in good times, blunting investor incentives to become informed. The resulting endogenous scarcity of informed investors exacerbates primary market collapses in bad times. Inefficiency arises because informed investors are a public good from the perspective of originators. All originators benefit from the presence of additional informed investors in bad times, but each originator minimizes his reliance on costly informed capital in good times by issuing safe securities. Our model suggests regulations that limit the issuance of safe securities in good times. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

One way to structurally interpret the model is by assuming aggregate demand has no long-run output effect. However, many economic theories are inconsistent with that assumption. Instead, we reinterpret the statistical model assuming a positive shock to aggregate supply lowers the price level and in the long run raises output while a positive shock to aggregate demand raises the price level. Under these assumptions, a puzzling finding from the empirical literature implies that a positive aggregate demand shock had a long-run positive effect on output in preWorld War I economies.","Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Keating, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",jkeating@ku.edu,,,,,,,12,7,7,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Since a dual income tax needs different modeling from that for a comprehensive one, this paper offers firstly a quantitative framework to measure redistributive effects; it turns out that this involves both direct and indirect effects. This makes us able to show the conditions for the DIT to be inequality-reducing. The effects of horizontal inequity and reranking are also incorporated into the decomposition analysis. Secondly, partial effects of changes in tax parameters are presented; they are channeled through the direct and indirect effects and are not always straightforward. We find the effects of changes of labor income taxation mostly ambiguous on inequality, while changes in capital income taxation are mostly unambiguous. Thirdly, the new approach is applied to Icelandic data. In Iceland, tax redistribution decreased substantially from 1997 to 2007, largely due to the indirect effects.","Univ Iceland, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Kristjánsson, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Saemundargotu 2, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",ask7@hi.is,,,,,,,32,9,9,0,19,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2013,69.0,2,,,,,148,166,,10.1628/001522113X666917,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,170FH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320835300002,0

This has led to an enlargement in saving-investment gap or the current account deficit. As a result, existing private pension system (PPS) was revised in mid-2012 in order to encourage household savings and thus reduce this gap. The revised system is aimed to enlarge pensioners' base and simplify) the benefit mechanism. Developing countries have been introducing predominantly mandatory private pension schemes through reforms in social security system since 1980's. Econometric estimations suggest that the abovementioned reforms, though with a lag, may lead to an increase in saving rates up to about 1.5 percentage points. Since PPS in Turkey is based on volunteer contributions and private pension companies currently charge very high management fees, the new reform is expected to have only limited impact on saving rates in Turkey. Projections suggest that based on current management fees, participants may prefer not to join the system and instead invest their personal funds outside the PPS.

Given that the finite sample critical values strongly depend on the tail parameters of the return distribution we propose a bootstrap-based version of the structural change test. Our empirical application spans developed and emerging financial asset returns. Somewhat surprisingly, emerging stock market tails are not more inclined to structural change than their developed counterparts. Emerging currency tails, on the contrary, do exhibit structural shifts in contrast to developed currencies. Our results suggest that extreme value theory (EVT) applications in hedging tail risks can assume stationary tail behavior over long time spans provided one considers portfolios that solely consist of stocks or bonds.

Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP) advocates suggest that MultiNational Corporations (MNCs) can simultaneously alleviate poverty and make profits by selling scaled-down products to the poor. Our paper investigates this claim using the case of the CleanCook stove-and-fuel technology introduced in Nigeria by an MNC working through a nonprofit organization and local business actors. Supply and demand-side analyses show that the CleanCook is least likely to reach the energy-poor BoP households originally targeted. The evidence suggests that serving the BoP requires greater differentiation than can be achieved with profit-driven business models. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

But many cultures value both generosity and accumulation of wealth. Combining TMT with the focus theory of normative conduct, we suggest that whether mortality salience encourages generosity or greed depends on the norm(s) salient in the situation. In Study 1 mortality salience led Americans to give less money to foreign charities. Study 2 replicated this effect, and showed it can be eliminated by activating a generosity norm. However, people who valued money as highly important donated less money following mortality salience. Study 3 showed that following mortality salience and a fairness prime, people behaved more generously when splitting money between themselves and an anonymous partner. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using a quantitative model, calibrated to the UK economy, we find that current public spending on post compulsory education corresponds to a political equilibrium. Support for the equilibrium policy comes primarily from low- and middle income groups, indicating that the policy needn't be highly regressive. Credit constraints play a minor role.

We employ CEO compensation sensitivity to risk (vega) and pay-share inequality between the CEO and other executives as measures of compensation and employ a system model to account for the endogeneity problem between vega and risk. Five main results are obtained. First, CEO compensation sensitivity to risk of BHCs has risen in response to deregulation to resemble those of the industrial firms. Second, higher vegas lead to greater bank instability. Third, the association between bank stability and managerial compensation is bi-directional; higher vegas induce greater risk and vice versa. Fourth, BHCs in the next to the largest-size group increase CEO vegas the most and have the strongest potential to create instability. Fifth, increased pay-share inequality has effects opposite to those of the increase in vega; greater pay-share inequality is associated with greater stability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, many of these countries deter foreign investors by a high risk of creeping or outright expropriation. In this paper we explore whether the correlation between countries' demographic structure and the perceived security of property rights reflects a causal relationship. We show that, in low-income countries, the ratio of young to old workers has a positive effect on the perceived security of property rights if the political system is sufficiently democratic. By contrast, this relationship cannot be observed in middle income countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This is particularly apparent in countries like Uganda where poverty reduction papers have been displaced by national development plans aimed at structural transformation, driven by the discovery of oil, the growing influence of rising powers vis-a-vis traditional donors and domestic political shifts. Although this heralds the possibility of deeper national ownership over development policy, international financial institutions have adopted strategies to maintain their influence. Moreover, Uganda currently lacks the underlying political capacities and relationships required to roll out this ambitious new agenda. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines this possibility for post-1970 monthly ASEAN-5 data, extending the existing research in two directions. First, we use recently developed unit root tests which allow for more flexible nonlinear stationary models under the alternative than the commonly used Self-Exciting Threshold or Exponential Smooth Transition AutoRegressions. Second, while different nonlinear models survive the mis-specification tests, a Monte Carlo experiment from generalized impulse response functions is used to compare their relative relevance. Our results (i) support the nonlinear mean-reverting hypothesis, and hence the Purchasing Power Parity, in most of the ASEAN-5 countries and (ii) point to the Multiple Regime-Logistic Smooth Transition and the Exponential Smooth Transition AutoRegression models as the most likely data generating processes of these real exchange rates.

Our results provide evidence on superiority of comprehensive income to net income in terms of performance measurement. This study finds that the claim of IAS 1 is supported in practice.

In particular, a later development of financial markets and a heavier tax burden for entrepreneurs have played a key role.","[Lerner, Josh] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Rock Ctr Entrepreneurship, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Tag, Joacim] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Harvard University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Tåg, J (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Box 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",josh@hbs.edu; joacim.tag@ifn.se,"Tåg, Joacim/ABA-3239-2020","Tåg, Joacim/0000-0002-4924-2479",,,,,94,80,94,3,88,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The main objective of the paper is to present an overview of the development level for logistics services market in Romania, by analyzing representative statistical data in the supply chain management domain. The research methodology focuses on collection of statistical data about Romanian logistics sector, especially from official data published by the INS, identifying key profile companies operating in Romania and analyze their development over the past five years, using indicators such as quantity of logistic spaces put into operation annual, occupancy rate, sale price / rental, logistics services for customers and other related services. This information are taken from the websites of the companies and from studies made public by consulting companies. The quality of the logistics services offered to customers by companies in Romania is being compared to the European average on various specific categories. In this respect, we used the logistic performance index that summarizes the statistical aspects of the supply chain management at national and international level, using a set of predefined criteria. The results of the research concern the positioning Romania in terms of logistics in relation to other European countries and propose solutions applicable to improving their quality. The preoccupation for identifying opportunities to improve the efficiency of supply chain management leads to analysis of information systems for supply chain management, which are designed to facilitate communication both between company departments and between it and its partners in the extended supply chain. Final remarks present the advantages of using such a system, and provide information regarding the supply and demand on the market in Romania.","[Tartavulea, Ramona Iulia; Petrariu, Radu Ioan] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tartavulea, RI (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ramona.tartavulea@yahoo.com,"PETRARIU, Ioan-Radu/AAQ-1606-2021; PETRARIU, Ioan-Radu/AAQ-4223-2021; Tartavulea, Ramona Iulia/AAP-1576-2021","PETRARIU, Ioan-Radu/0000-0002-9133-0181; PETRARIU, Ioan-Radu/0000-0002-9133-0181;",,,,,20,7,7,0,29,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2013,15.0,33,,,,,180,196,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,087FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314746900014,0

The performance measures were Return on Equity (ROE), Return on Asset (ROA) and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE). Twenty- five (25) manufacturing firms were selected and from which data were collected for the period (2004-2011). Empirical analysis was carried out using regression and correlation. The result of the analysis showed a positive significant relationship between independence and financial expertise of the audit committee and ROA, ROE and ROCE. However, the size and meetings of audit committee showed no significant relationship with all performance variables. This study therefore recommends that the audit committee should be made more effective by ensuring that members are made up of independent non-executive directors and also ensure that more members with financial expertise especially accounting expertise be drafted into the audit committee and lastly ensure that audit committee meetings are tailored towards relevant issues that enhance financial performance of the firm.","[Aanu, Ojeka Stephen; Iyoha, Francis Odianonsen; Foyeke, Obigbemi Imoleayo] Covenant Univ, Dept Accounting, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,,stephen.ojeka@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; iyoha.francis@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; imole.obigbemi@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,,,,,,,23,0,0,2,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,2118,2127,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500209,0

We widely define activity based techniques any management accounting technique/practice that uses activities as its hard core. Using this definition, we explored the extent to which the investigated set of innovations is adopted in the UK manufacturing companies. In addition we explored the influence of cultural (specifically, innovation, outcome orientation, and tight versus loose control), technological (IT quality and use of ERP systems) and organizational (size, structure and strategy) factors for their association with the initiation, adoption and extent of adoption of activity based techniques as defined in this paper. Data were collected by mail survey questionnaire of a random sample of UK manufacturing business units, with questionnaire design and distribution based on Dillman's Tailored Design Method. The results show that almost 72% of the business units have some experience of adopting or using ABT. At multivariate level, only the cultural dimension of 'outcome orientation' can be considered as a general cultural factor that affects the adoption and extent of use of activity based techniques. We conclude that business units where action, achievement and results are emphasized, and, high expectations for performance and competitiveness are in place, are likely to adopt activity based techniques as such techniques have the potential to enhance business performance and cost management. We also conclude that higher levels of ABT use and integration are more likely in business units that have higher levels of outcome orientation culture.","[Al-Sayed, Mahmoud; Dugdale, David] Univ Southampton, Sch Management, Ctr Res Accounting Accountabil & Governance, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,,M.Al-Sayed@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,87,0,0,0,14,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,849,875,,,,,,27,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100092,0

Studies show that a strong reason for resistance by the sales force to the technology is the failure to convince salespeople of the advantages and benefits of the new technology. Consequently firms face the challenge of selecting SFA technologies that their sales force will perceive as valuable and accept to use to enhance its performance. The present study proposes a value-based approach for planning the introduction of SFA to support the sales force. The approach suggested provides guidelines on how to determine whether or not a new SFA would add value to the sales force before those technologies actually get selected and implemented. Good planning of SFA investment would help firms avoid resistance of the sales force towards the implemented systems, rather than having to treat it at the post-implementation stage.","[Benmoussa, Chihab] Al Akhawayn Univ, Ifrane, Morocco",Al Akhawayn University,,c.benmoussa@aui.ma,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1576,1588,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100167,0

The unique aspect of this model comes from the assumption that an increase in the number of consumers of green (brown) product increases the satisfaction of each green (brown) consumer. We show that, paradoxically, when the network effect of a green product is higher than that of a brown product, this externality reduces product environmental quality and raises consumption of the green product. Conversely, when the network effect of the brown product is higher, the externality improves product environmental quality and raises consumption of the brown product. In both cases, the network effect does not affect the overall pollution level. The externality correction requires the use of three optimal fiscal policies: an ad valorem tax on products, an emission tax, and a subsidy or a tax on the green purchase. A second-best optimum can also be reached through the green taxation.","Univ Nantes, LEMNA, IEMN IAE, F-44322 Nantes 3, France",Nantes Universite,"Brécard, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, LEMNA, IEMN IAE, Chemin Censive du Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France.",dorothee.brecard@univ-nantes.fr,"Brécard, Dorothée/HJO-8652-2023","Brecard, Dorothee/0000-0002-0715-0234",,,,,37,27,31,1,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

According to study findings, not all successors are completely satisfied with the business succession process. Unrelated manager successors have higher satisfaction the family member successors, but neither group exceeds the moderate level. All successors recorded lower performance than the incumbent but unrelated manager successors had better results the family member successors in both indicators.

Schumpeter (1961) has shown that growth and development can only take place if the economy is constantly disturbed to an out-of-equilibrium phase. The neo-Schumpeterian theories, based on Schumpeter's theory, expanded the theory by focussing on innovation from an innovation system perspective and can be classified under evolutionary economics. The renewed interest in the role of innovation in economic development since 1980 resulted in a number of publications. The aim of this article is to determine how the studies since 1980 have changed regarding their foundation in the different schools of thought. A methodological and theoretical review is conducted of post 1980 empirical studies that determined the relationship between innovation and economic development. This review is aimed at establishing if these studies are following the methodological and theoretical trends of evolutionary economics. It was found that the movement towards evolutionary economics is slow due to the difficulty of measuring the performance of the complex innovation system and the difficulty of predicting its effect on economic development. Unfortunately, by ignoring the complexity of the innovation system, the results of predicting the innovation's effect on economic development will not be reliable. This paper serves to contribute to the literature of evolutionary economics and towards the understanding of the relationship between innovation and economic development.","[Eggink, Maria Elizabeth] Tshwane Univ Technol, Nelspruit, South Africa",Tshwane University of Technology,,egginkme@tut.ac.za,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,88,96,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200010,0

Eight clusters of buyers of horticultural products are identified which show significant differences concerning their socio-demographic characteristics, purchase behavior and buying motives. Gender and the affirmation of the respondent to purchasing or non-purchasing bed & balcony or potted indoor plants are the most important discriminatory variables.

The results show the energy consumption was mainly affected by the improvements in the energy efficiency (which, however, lost most of their momentum after 1999). The impacts of the changes in the structure exhibit two opposing periods: from 1993 to 1999, the energy consumption was pushed up, up to the overall increase of nearly a third of the industrial energy consumption in 1993. However, this structural consumption increase was almost completely eradicated in the period 2004 to 2011. The change in the consumption due to the changes in the economic activity of the industry would have contributed to the net increase of the energy consumption by 6704 TOE. With the combination with other factors, the overall decrease of energy consumption in the examined period was over 42% of the industrial energy consumption in 1993.","[Hajko, Vladimir] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,vladimir.hajko@mail.muni.cz,"Hajko, Vladimir/I-4626-2018","Hajko, Vladimir/0000-0002-4089-979X",,,,,10,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,438,444,,,,,,7,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100045,0

The considered model estimated via the three-stage least squares method (3SLS) is fully statistically verified. Therefore, it offers several useful interpretations and applications. In particular, one can deal with analysis of anticipations of possible future developments from the actuarial point of view. Generally, results for particular generated scenarios (deterministic or random) can be taken into account by life insurance companies, e. g. in their internal calculations or for financial planning purposes, or by an insurance regulator, e. g. for stress testing presented by Solvency II.

The higher incentive for savings for the middle-aged, resulting from the habit formation preference, causes an even higher demand for bonds and a lower demand for equity, which eventually generates a lower risk-free rate and a higher required return for holding equity than does the framework of non-habit forming models. Calibration results verify that the habit formation setting, together with an OLG framework is capable of yielding lower bond returns and higher equity returns than the standard CRRA utility models, and the borrowing constraint imposed on the young-aged consumers amplifies the positive effect of habit formation on the equity premium. The findings imply that habit formation preferences within the overlapping-generations framework under the borrowing-constrained economy can provide a more improved explanation of the equity premium puzzle.

For the comparison, the World Tax Index (WTI) is used, which is an overall multicriteria indicator that combines hard and soft data to express the real tax burden of economic entities. The results of panel data estimations show that the tax quota is not suitable for tax burden approximation, especially in case of corporate taxes and value added type taxes.

Meanwhile, it analyzes the relationship between the pyramid shareholding structure and corporate value. The research finds the GEM Board listed companies' family shareholding proportion, family control right and the value of the company emerge a negative correlation. The situation of the actual controller being the part-time chairperson of the Board of Directors or general manager does not have an obvious influence on corporate values. In family governance companies, the pyramid shareholding structure accounts for a relatively high proportion. Compared with those without pyramid shareholding structure, their corporate values are significantly lower. However, in the pyramid shareholding structure, the two rights' deviation of the ultimate controlling shareholder does not have a significant impact on corporate values. The research suggests the authoritarian leadership and relational governance mode under family control in GEM Board are adverse to the corporate value growth.

The result of solving this problem is the creation of a model where the selected dynamic processes are examined. Addressing of the strategic management of e-commerce in the company is focused primarily on customers. It is very important to make a survey of an entire company, to learn its business decisions and obtain information not only about the market, but also in internal affairs. Among the results belong the characteristics of a company's strategy and information characterization, which are based on a commercial (business) corporate strategy and corporate strategy quality, or other strategies. The strategy is continually evaluated at certain intervals and adapted to current requirements. Using MATLAB software an economic model of electronic commerce is designed. For the actual model Simulink as a special toolbox for modelling cybernetic systems is used. Methodology/methods Setting out from an analysis of theoretical resources dealing with e-commerce, business strategy and customer strategy our research were based on primary and secondary research. We have used empiric data to make conclusions. Scientific aim Basic question is how economic crisis affects surroundings of electronic business, e-commerce and customer strategy. Our important task is to describe both of them and to find solution or suggest a way to accommodation in this new era. Article uses basic theoretical information and actual data.

The first objective is to propose a theoretical e-business model for doing business in the Internet era and with new facts we have learned from global crisis. The second objective is to propose a multidimensional classification-scheme for e-Business Models, as opposed to the actual tendency in academic literature to use two-dimensional classifications. The final objective is to define critical success factors, based on a field study in order to find out and compare the performance indicators used by e-business firms that are competing with similar business models. Conclusions This paper describes connections between economic situation of customers and sales-situation in e-business. Very important is e-business strategy in these cases.","[Nemcova, Zuzana; Jankova, Martina] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Informat, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,nemcova@fbm.vutbr.cz; jankova@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1345,1352,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500131,0

It increases the uncertainty regarding the probability of flood occurrence, making weather less predictable, rainfall more uncertain but heavy storms more likely. This necessitates rethinking and changing the traditional ways of planning and dealing with floods. When flooding occurs according to a predictable pattern, an optimal package of flood damage control measures can be planned in advance, but when flood events become unpredictable due to climate change, the optimal package of flood damage control measures will change, cannot be planned with sufficient certainty in advance and different management strategies are needed. In this study a benefit cost analysis was applied to compare the merits of different structural flood mitigation options for Soweto-on-Sea, with and without climate change. The option with the highest net benefit remains the clearing out of the river channel for both (with and without) scenarios. In order to protect/improve the quality of life of the urban poor flood victims, the economic dimension of flood control planning, which is implied when using benefit cost analysis to select the best flood mitigation option, is insufficient. Besides the economic dimension, the social and environmental dimensions must also be included, suggesting that a multi-criteria decision analysis procedure be used.","[Ogundeji, A. A.; Viljoen, M.

Thirdly, the chosen method based on panel data regression analysis provides estimates for all variables taken into consideration. Among the countries selected and included in the study, are also the greatest wine producers in Europe. The paper confirms that investments in the wine making industry are supporting wine production, even though seen globally this is a process influenced by climatic conditions.

The study is based on a survey of sample of 155 companies having completed mergers and acquisitions deals announced during January 2003 to December 2008. We document a positive relationship between corporate governance score and short-term abnormal returns by constructing broad corporate governance Index (CGI) for Indian public listed companies. We use a broad, multifactor corporate governance score, which is based on the responses to objective survey questions supplemented with interviews of senior management, directors, CFOs, board members, company secretaries, compliance officers, and investor relation officers. The questionnaire is designed on the basis of major standard qualities relevant to measure the corporate governance. The present study concludes that companies with higher rank for corporate governance score have better short-term performance which is revealed from positive and higher abnormal returns during the event windows.

In a within-subjects design, the participants were presented purchase decision trials with 14 different grocery products (seven private label and seven national brand products) whose prices were increased and decreased while their EEG activity was recorded. The results showed that relatively greater left frontal activation (i.e., higher approach motivation) during the predecision period predicted an affirmative purchase decision. The relationship of frontal EEG asymmetry with purchase decision was stronger for national brand products compared with private label products and when the price of a product was below a normal price (i.e., implicit reference price) compared with when it was above a normal price. Higher perceived need for a product and higher perceived product quality were associated with greater relative left frontal activation.","[Ravaja, Niklas; Somervuori, Outi; Salminen, Mikko] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland; [Ravaja, Niklas] Helsinki Inst Informat Technol, Helsinki, Finland; [Ravaja, Niklas] Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Somervuori, O (通讯作者)，Runeberginkatu 22-24, Helsinki 00100, Finland.",outi.somervuori@aalto.fi,"Salminen, Mikko/R-2441-2018; Salminen, Mikko/M-6654-2019; Ravaja, Niklas/D-1532-2013","Salminen, Mikko/0000-0002-6528-8389; Salminen, Mikko/0000-0002-6528-8389; Ravaja, Niklas/0000-0003-1876-8731",,,,,66,67,75,6,45,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The findings are based primarily on non-released documents from the records office of the University of Economics in Prague, Archives of the Czech Technical University in Prague, interviews with eyewitnesses and released sources of personal provenience. We came to the conclusion that the University of Economics in Prague emerged from a massive reform of the economic education system which had been commenced by the Communist Party after 1948. The new university was a result of a political decision and squaring with the so called Slanism of the University of Political and Economic Sciences.

We find that that R&D-related vulnerability was the highest in the pharmaceutical sector in Bangladesh. Cluster analysis supports this proposition as 79.8% of the sampled firms had below average levels of innovativeness. We argue that the TRIPS transition period (which began in 2005 and is to end in 2015) has not been used effectively used by Bangladesh, the most technologically advanced LDC to create a strong technological platform for the pharmaceutical industry. Also, the expected process of transfer of technology has not taken place. We recommend that the post-TRIPS industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry in Bangladesh should be designed and delivered with a key focus to improve the R&D and innovation capabilities of the domestic firms.

Bank bailout programs changed the composition of both banks' and sovereign balance sheets and, moreover, affected the linkage between the default risk of governments and their local banks. Our main findings suggest that in the period before bank bailouts the contagion disperses from bank credit spreads into the sovereign CDS market. After bailouts, a financial sector shock affects sovereign CDS spreads more strongly in the short run. However, the impact becomes insignificant in the long term.

We further show that in a world without financial investors, purely financial bilateral instruments, such as forward contracts, achieve optimal risk-sharing without distorting product market outcomes.

Because it contains complex and high-volume derivative products, 2008 crisis differs from other crises. Credit default swaps which is the most traded product in derivatives market, is an agreement that buyer of the credit default swaps makes a payment with certain maturities to the seller who will compensate the buyer in the event of a loan default. There is a positive relationship between debt default risk of a country and credit default swaps. In this study, 14 European Union member country's credit default swap rates and Public Debt/GDP rates relationship are examined by panel data analysis for the period 2004:Q1-2011:Q2. In addition, in order to see the effect of 2008 financial crisis, a financial crisis index is calculated and included in the model as an explanatory variable. According to the estimation results of Fixed Effect Model, one unit increase in the Public Debt/GDP ratio increases credit default swaps by 11.9 units and one unit increase in financial crisis index increases credit default swaps by 5.6 units.","[Ciftci, Dikk; Cevis, Ismail] Pamukkale Univ, Denizli, Turkey",Pamukkale University,"Çevis, I (通讯作者)，Pamukkale Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Bolumu Kinikli, Kampusu DENIZLI, Denizli, Turkey.",icevis@pau.edu.tr,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,25,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Following a negative productivity shock, the share of low-efficiency workers in the pool of unemployed rises, and this composition effect reduces the incentive of firms to post vacancies, lowering job opportunities for all workers. Heterogeneity in workers efficiency amplifies unemployment fluctuations in economies with small gross labor flows and leads to persistent buildups of unemployment and slow recoveries. The composition effect worsens the unemploymentinflation trade-off faced by the monetary authority, leading to very large sacrifice ratios when a fall in productivity primarily affects low-efficiency workers.","[Ravenna, Federico] HEC Montreal, Inst Appl Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Walsh, Carl E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Ravenna, F (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Inst Appl Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",federico.ravenna@hec.ca; walshc@ucsc.edu,,,,,,,46,12,16,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We hypothesize that this evolution is attributable to a shift in the convertible bond investor base from long-only investors towards convertible arbitrage funds. These funds buy convertibles and short the underlying stocks, causing downward price pressure. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the differences in announcement returns between the Traditional Investor period (1984-1999) and the Arbitrage period (2000-September 2008) disappear when controlling for arbitrage-induced short selling associated with a range of hedging strategies. Post-issuance stock returns are also in line with the arbitrage explanation.

Most migration studies are concerned with the determinants of international migration to the UK. Few look at the drivers of the spatial distributions once migrants arrive. However, migrant housing is primarily a local, urban problem and, arguably, the main issue is the spatial concentrations, rather than absolute numbers. The UK has experienced waves of migrants throughout its history and these are well documented in the censuses since the mid 19th century. A feature of the study is its long-run perspective, which allows the examination of the characteristics of the different waves and shows the high degree of persistence in spatial structures. The second part of the study examines why there is little evidence that migration has much effect on house prices, despite the popular perception that the impact is important. The study demonstrates that the nature of housing market adjustment is more complex than price indicators alone would suggest. Adjustment also takes place through changes to household formation and through the mobility of domestic residents, which mitigate the price effects.","Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Meen, G (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",,,"Meen, Geoffrey/0000-0001-8502-9694",,,,,20,2,2,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The WHO ranks health systems according to evidence on such inequalities. However, in measuring equity in the use of health care, studies typically disregard the use of traditional medicines. Therefore, it is assumed that the failure to use modern health care is equivalent to not receiving any health care at all. Although traditional medicines are less effective than modern medicines, they have the potential to provide relief and cure and are commonly used. Using data from Ghana, this paper hypothesizes and finds evidence for reductions in inequality estimates once traditional medicines are taken into account. Further, it explores inequities in utilization of modern medicine (from public institutions, private sources, and by self) and traditional medicines (by self and through healers) and finds the former to be pro rich whereas the latter is pro poor. These figures are then decomposed into socioeconomic determinants to show nonneed factors to be significant contributors of horizontal inequity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Technical analysis using the imbalance-based trading rules is motivated by the evidence presented first in this paper that short-term returns can be predicted from the information regarding the order-flow and order-book imbalances for more than half of Nikkei 225-listed stocks. However, we demonstrate that no strategies, including limit order trading where trading signals are derived from the order-book imbalance, beat the buy-and-hold strategy within our sample. The results imply that past prices and demand/supply imbalances do not contribute to profiting in intraday trading and that non-execution and picking-off risks are too large for limit order trading to be profitable in our sample.

Moreover, the significant effect of stock price informativeness on the savings-to-price sensitivity is not due to market mispricings and remains even after controlling for various sources of public and managerial private information.

The pricing formula of an ARMA-type option is similar to that of Black and Scholes, except that the total volatility input depends upon the AR and MA parameters. From numerical analyses, the option values are increasing functions of the levels of AR or MA parameters across all moneyness levels. Specifically, the AR effect is more significant than the MA effect. Finally, based on the daily closing prices of TAIEX options from 2004 to 2008, the ad hoc ARMA(1,1) model provides the best in-sample fit and the second best out-of-sample fit, whereas the variance gamma model provides the second best in-sample fit and the best out-of-sample fit. Therefore, both variance gamma model and ad hoc ARMA model are superior models for pricing TAIEX options. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We use a unique database covering the asset allocations of US defined-benefit pension funds for the period 1990-2008, and we test the role of each factor in explaining their returns. Our results shed new light on pension funds' sources of performance. While the previous literature emphasized that policy allocation accounts for the bulk of returns, leaving little room for active management, we show that taking explicit account of market movement can change the results significantly. Although active management plays a minor role in global asset allocation, its role is predominant in explaining returns to individual asset classes, whether traditional or alternative. This paper rehabilitates the contribution of active management as a source of performance for pension funds, at least at the asset class level. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical findings support our hypotheses. Bid premiums in stock offers are negatively and jointly related to target shareholder tax liabilities and to variables proxying for target shareholder willingness to hold acquirer stock.

The relative stability of the New Zealand personal income tax system, in terms of marginal rates, thresholds and the tax base, provides helpful conditions for deriving these estimates. The elasticity of taxable income was estimated to be substantially higher for the highest income groups. Changes in the timing of income flows for the higher income recipients were found to be an important response to the announcement of a new higher rate bracket. The marginal welfare costs of personal income taxation were consistent across years, being relatively small for all but the higher tax brackets. For the top marginal rate bracket of 39 per cent, the welfare cost of raising an extra dollar of tax revenue was estimated to be well in excess of a dollar. Implications of the findings are that: disincentive effects of high top marginal rates can be substantial even when labour supply responses are small; the welfare costs of increases in top marginal tax rates can be high; and announcement effects of tax policy changes can lead to considerable income shifting between time periods.","[Creedy, John] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,,iclaus@adb.org; jcreedy@unimelb.edu.au; josh.teng@ird.govt.nz,,,,,,,16,11,11,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Using data collected by the National Research Council for each of five federal agencies, our analysis shows that on average over two-fifths of all projects retained zero employees after completion and over one-third retained only one or two employees. Thus, on average, the direct impact of SBIR funded projects on employment is small, especially when compared to the mean number of employees in the firms. However, there are substantial cross-project differences in the number of retained employees that are explained by differences in the firms and their SBIR projects. We find across funding agencies that projects with intellectual property-patents, copyrights, trademarks, or publications-retained more employees after completion of the project. Also, we find that the public funding of research by the SBIR program is more likely to stimulate employment when the government created a market for the products, processes, or services developed by the research projects.","[Link, Albert N.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA; [Scott, John T.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; Dartmouth College,"Link, AN (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA.",anlink@uncg.edu; john.t.scott@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,35,21,32,0,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

I address two questions: to what extent is the MLP useful for transport and sustainability researchers; and how might the MLP be improved to overcome present limitations and better address transport and sustainability research needs? I highlight contributions of the MLP to transport and sustainability modelling and social research including providing a more integrated and systemic perspective on socio-technical change. The MLP has also been useful as an analytical tool for identifying and engaging with diverse stakeholder groups, including mainstream ('regime') and alternative ('niche') organisations. The MLP might be improved by integrating natural, behavioural and political science insights, and particularly by elucidating how behavioural-institutional change might occur. This is critical for transport research given the expressed and observed public resistance to changing travel behaviour. It remains to be seen whether the MLP and transitions framework themselves require more radical adjustment to be able to predict the changes needed to support a transition to a sustainable society.

Our empirical analysis uses a variety of specifications, estimators, and robustness checks, including a random growth specification that controls for selection bias from both time-varying and time-invariant unobserved country-specific characteristics. The results indicate that a temporary foreign visitor policy with less requirements, such as the US VWP, tends to increase the bilateral trade levels between the US and the selected VWP countries, especially for US exports. This suggests that VWP may have encouraged business travel and commerce enough such that there are export benefits from this less restrictive temporary foreign visitor policy of about 10-20% (similar to 2-4% in tariff equivalent terms).","[Yasar, Mahmut] Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Yasar, Mahmut] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Lisner, David] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Rejesus, Roderick M.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; Emory University; Columbia University; North Carolina State University,"Yasar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",myasar@uta.edu; dlisner@gmail.com; rod_rejesus@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,56,7,7,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We find that decentralized banks-where branch managers have greater autonomy over lending decisions-give larger loans to small firms and those with soft information. However, decentralized banks are also more responsive to their own competitive environment. They are more likely to expand credit when faced with competition but also cherry pick customers and restrict credit when they have market power. This darker side to decentralized banks in concentrated markets highlights that the level of local banking competition is key to determining which organizational structure provides better lending terms for small businesses.

Outstanding debt, representing mortgages, affects positively consumer debt, and the debt on durable goods. This hypothesis is empirically tested for the U.S. using PSID 2005 wave. Our results are striking. First, we find strong evidence supporting a positive association between mortgage loans and consumer debts, regardless of the measures used, the control variables used, and the methods used. The results remain unchanged when we address potential endogeneity and measurement error problems. Second, we find that the effects of mortgages on the debt on durable goods are in general smaller than the effects of mortgages on other types of debts. Third, our distributional analysis reveals an interesting pattern of the effects on consumer debt of mortgage over the distribution. Specifically, the effects monotonically decrease as the quantile increase, with the smallest effects being at the upper tail of the distribution. Finally, we also examine the short-run dynamics of the relation between mortgage and consumer debts. We find that there is no systematic relation between the growth rate of mortgage and the growth rates of consumer debts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This is consistent with a straightforward matching model with a lag in seller response.

Contrary to this dominant finding, a few recent studies conclude that voters reward public spending. We reconcile these conflicting findings, positing that the structure of fiscal federalism in countries like Argentina causes voters to reward fiscal expansion because they perceive that this extra spending at the margin is not financed by them, but rather by the nation at large. We provide evidence and microfoundations for the electoral connection implicit in this argument: voters reward public spending when they can pass the cost on to someone else (e.g., as in Argentina), and punish it otherwise (e.g., as in the United States).","[Jones, Mark P.] Rice Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Meloni, Osvaldo] Univ Nacl Tucuman, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Tommasi, Mariano] Univ San Andres, Victoria, Buenos Aires, Argentina",Rice University; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman,"Jones, MP (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",mpjones@rice.edu,,"Meloni, Osvaldo/0000-0003-1416-405X",,,,,62,29,34,1,19,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The analysis uses survey data that provide new perspectives on the role of the founder's experience. The analysis concentrates on the importance of a balanced skill set for self-employment duration. The results show that most self-employed individuals find themselves unemployed upon ending their self-employment. Firm-level characteristics are less significant in explaining self-employment duration, while experience and motivation appear to be driving forces for self-employment longevity. The findings support the importance of combined practical experience and adequate skills. Having broad experience combined with competence in sales/business is one of the most important factors for self-employment duration.

Reforming the regulatory framework of financial and banking activity and the increase role of state in banking systems in many countries are important factors that involve major changes in the organizing of banking activity, the strategies adopted, the business models practiced, etc. Based on these considerations, the paper examines trends in banking models after the 2007 crisis. The analysis of the banking models is performed from the perspective of the deep organizational changes that affected the banking environment and sustainable financial stability. The study focuses on the analysis of the banking sustenability and the business model in the Romanian banking system, in the context of the post-crisis organizational changes. The profound interdependence of the Romanian banking system with the banking systems of the European countries and the international tendencies in financial regulation are important factors that influence the business models of the Romanian banks. The banking model practiced in Romania continues to be the traditional one. Currently, the most important challenges of the Romanian banking system are the growth of the non-performing loans, the loans in foreign currency to unhedged borrowers, the pressure to meet the Basel III requirements, as well as the possibility that the exposure of foreign banks towards Romania to decrease.","[State, Olimpia] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Baicu, Claudia Gabriela] Spiru Haret Univ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Spiru Haret University,"State, O (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",state.olimpia@com.ase.ro,"State, Olimpia/AAF-2322-2019; Baicu, Claudia Gabriela/AAD-8314-2022","State, Olimpia/0000-0002-9737-867X; Baicu, Claudia Gabriela/0000-0002-1423-6108",,,,,52,7,7,1,31,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2012,14.0,32,,,,,436,450,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,964ED,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305675600011,0

We document very rapid educational upgrading in Britain over the last 30 years or so and show that this rise has featured faster increases in education acquisition by people from relatively rich family backgrounds. At the same time, wage differentials for the more educated have risen. Putting these two together (more education for people from richer backgrounds and an increase in the pay-off to this education) implies increasing within-generation inequality. By reinforcing already-existing inequalities from the previous generation, this has hindered social mobility. We also highlight three important aspects that, to date, have not been well integrated into the social mobility literature: the acquisition of postgraduate qualifications; gender differences; and the poor education performance of men at the lower end of the education distribution.","[Lindley, Joanne] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Machin, Stephen] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Machin, Stephen] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",University of Sydney; University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lindley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",j.lindley@surrey.ac.uk; s.machin@ucl.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,16,20,20,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

It is based on two key intuitions. First, players suffer a utility cost if they break norms of honesty and fairness, and this cost is highest if most others comply with the norm. Second, people are heterogeneous with regard to their concern for norms. We show that a model based on honesty norms alone cannot explain why pre-play communication fosters cooperation in simultaneous social dilemmas. In contrast, the model based on norms of honesty and fairness can. We also illustrate other predictions of the model, offering experimental evidence in line with them - e.g., the effect of communication on cooperation depends on how many players communicate, and whether the social dilemma is played simultaneously or sequentially. In addition, ideas for new experiments are suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These policies normally involve subsidies or transfers to the poorest regions. Over any given short-term horizon such subsidies serve to reduce inter-regional inequalities, but as they also affect migration patterns the long-term effects are less clear. This paper demonstrates using a three-region general equilibrium model that subsidising the poorest region may be to the detriment of the periphery as a whole and even to the very region that receives the subsidy, if the subsidy draws firms away from a nearby region that would function better as a production centre. If the subsidy does not attract a sufficient number of firms to the subsidised region, then the long-term effect on the residents of that region would be negative. Though further research is needed to isolate the conditions under which such an effect would arise, this result has potentially important implications for the design of regional policy.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Sheard, N (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",ns@ne.su.se,,"Sheard, Nicholas/0000-0003-4936-5126",,,,,23,0,1,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

A temporal and spatial analysis of Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) data from 1992 to 2008 on the highways in Denver has been conducted to determine if that objective has been fulfilled after the initial light rail service began in 1994. Temporal analysis provides an insight into the changes in the level of highway traffic before and after the opening of three segments (Central, Southwest, and Southeast Corridors) of the light rail system. This part of the analysis also compares the traffic levels of highways affected by light rail with those not affected by light rail. Spatial analysis examines whether the changes have taken place uniformly throughout all the highways, or whether they have been concentrated on particular highways. Results indicate that light rail has reduced level of traffic along some of the adjacent highways for a short period of time. Overall, the three light rail corridors in operation have succeeded in lowering the rate of increase in the level of traffic on highways within the rail transit influence zone as compared to highways outside the influence zone.

High-EDR stocks are generally characterized by high idiosyncratic risk, large downside beta, lower coskewness and cokurtosis, and high bankruptcy risk.

Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) modelling results show that a one per cent increase in: (1) terms of trade appreciates the RER by 0.96-1.05 per cent in the long-run; (2) government expenditure appreciates the RER by 0.53-0.46 per cent in the long-run; (3) net foreign liabilities appreciates the RER by 0.18-0.22 per cent in the long-run; (4) interest rate differential depreciates the RER by 0.007-0.01 per cent in the long-run; (5) openness in trade depreciates the RER by 1.15-1.31 per cent in the long-run; and (6) per-worker labour productivity depreciates the RER by 0.38-0.55 per cent in the long-run. The two endogenously determined structural breaks are positive but are statistically insignificant. The speed of adjustment towards equilibrium is high with short-run disequilibrium correcting by nearly 39-47 per cent per quarter.

Using the Northern shrimp fishery as a case study, this paper argues that rather than being simply a tool for sustainability or even earning market access, MSC certification allows fishery clients those organizations that ultimately hold the MSC certificate to control resource access and production relations. The processing association that acted as the initial client in this fishery gained new members by sharing access to certification in 2009 and expelled a community-based fishing co-operative from the client group in 2010. Certification dynamics in this case reflected, and were used to reinforce, a highly competitive political economy of production.

Decision processes (or heuristics) such as value learning and strategic misrepresentation have been offered as explanations for these results. While a few studies have tested these heuristics as competing hypotheses, none has investigated the possibility that each explains the response behaviour of a subgroup of the population. In this paper, we make a contribution towards addressing this research gap by presenting a probabilistic decision process model designed to estimate the proportion of respondents employing defined heuristics. We demonstrate the model on binary and multinomial choice data sources and find three distinct types of response behaviour. The results suggest that accounting for heterogeneity in response behaviour may be a better way forward than attempting to identify a single heuristic to explain the behaviour of all respondents.","[McNair, Ben J.; Bennett, Jeff] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Australian National University; University of Sydney,"McNair, BJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Ben.McNair@anu.edu.au,"Bennett, Jeff W/A-1084-2008","McNair, Benjamin/0000-0002-5026-101X; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,,38,20,21,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We identify the elements behind the sectoral differences in the mode of foreign market servicing in the context of a general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition. Our calibration exercise shows that traditional margins such as transportation, fixed entry costs, utility weights, and dispersion of firm productivity are not enough to capture the observed sectoral differences, as is commonly assumed. We propose augmenting the model to allow for sectoral differences in intangible costs of operating in a foreign market in order to explain these observations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We show that the investment thresholds have a U-shaped relation with the debt capacity constraint, in that they are increasing (decreasing) with the constraint for high (low) debt issuance capacity. Although the financing constraint distorts investment timing, it may encourage the constrained levered firm to overinvest compared with the non-constrained levered firm. Our result fits well with the related problems involving the internal financing constraint. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Turnover in stocks headquartered in an outage area with 0.5% of U.S. electrical customers drops by 3-7% on the first full day of the outage, and bid-ask spreads narrow by 2.5%. Firm-specific price volatility is 2.3% lower on blackout dates. This effect is larger for smaller, lesser-known stocks and in higher income areas. Consistent with a valuation discount and higher expected returns for stocks with more informed traders, firms with a one-standard-deviation higher local trading propensity have market-to-book values that are 5% lower, Tobin's Q that is 6% lower, annualized four-factor alphas that are 1.2% higher, and average spreads that are 6.5% higher. Together, the evidence suggests that informed investors contribute disproportionately to both liquidity and price discovery, and that these contributions are reflected in valuations and expected returns.

We provide the literature's first evaluation of legislation enacted by California in 2005 that required private employers within the state to treat employees in committed same-sex relationships in the same way as employees in different-sex marriages with respect to ESI. Our analysis uses data on sexual orientation, partnership, and health insurance from the 2001 to 2007 California Health Interview Surveys (CHIS). Prior to the reform, partnered gay men and lesbians were significantly less likely to have ESI in someone else's name than partnered heterosexuals. Pooling data from 2001 to 2007, we find that the reform had no effects on differences in insurance outcomes between gay and straight men. We find some evidence that the reform increased partnership, reduced full-time employment, and increased health insurance coverage among lesbians relative to heterosexual women. The increases in insurance coverage for lesbians are consistent with a role for expanded dependent ESI, suggesting that such policies may reduce sexual orientation-based insurance disparities among women.","[Buchmueller, Thomas C.] Univ Michigan, Stephen Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Carpenter, Christopher S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Buchmueller, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Stephen Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,"Buchmueller, Thomas/0000-0002-3068-7419",,,,,39,32,37,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

This paper focuses on what the increase in resources directed at English universities arising from top-up fees means for the relative funding of English and Scottish undergraduates. Widely-used funding-per-head figures do not provide an accurate picture of home- and EU-domiciled undergraduate funding, as they include funding for research, postgraduate degrees and overseas students. The empirical work of this paper focuses on creating a consistent series of funding per full-time equivalent undergraduate over time for England and for Scotland, stripping out funding for research, non-EU students and postgraduate degrees to create a more accurate picture of the funding gap between the two countries. It also takes into account the different composition of undergraduate degree subjects taken in England and Scotland. The findings indicate that the apparent historical advantage in funding per head in Scottish institutions compared with English ones has been largely driven by compositional differences: Scotland has a high proportion of medical, science and engineering undergraduates subjects that command greater funding due to their relative complexity to teach. The top-up fee introduced in 200607 brought funding per head in England to a level similar to that experienced in Scotland, and the future increase will result in funding per head in England outstripping that in Scotland by some magnitude. This suggests that the funding of Scottish students will fall significantly behind that of English students unless additional new sources of public or private funding for nScottish universities are found.","[Dearden, Lorraine] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Wyness, Gill] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dearden, L (通讯作者)，Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1E 7HU, England.",ldearden@ifs.org.uk; alissa_g@ifs.org.uk; g.wyness@lse.ac.uk,"Dearden, Lorraine M/D-4926-2017; Dearden, Lorraine/AAO-6720-2020","Dearden, Lorraine M/0000-0002-9529-8860;",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,13,4,4,2,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Because of data limitations, we cover the 1967-2002 period. We find that aid flows decreased the likelihood of observing a democratic regime in a recipient country. This effect is sensitive to economic and social conditions. The negative relation between aid and democracy is moderated when aid flows are preceded by economic liberalization.

This club makes it possible for hooligans to realize gains from trade. But it attracts ultra-violent persons we call sadists. If the proportion of fight-club members who are sadists grows sufficiently high, the fight club self-destructs. Rules that regulate the form club conflict can take, but don't eliminate conflict, can prevent the club from self-destructing even when populated exclusively by sadists. This creates strong pressure for private rules that regulate conflict to emerge within the club.

The results reveal that portfolio investments, foreign borrowing, aid, and income lead to real exchange rate appreciation, while remittances have disparate effects across regions. Foreign direct investments have no effect on the real exchange rate, contributing to resolve the above dilemma. (C) 2011 International Monetary Fund. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Ellis, F",,,,"Ellis, Frank",,,"'We Are All Poor Here': Economic Difference, Social Divisiveness and Targeting Cash Transfers in Sub-Saharan Africa",JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"While the central thrust of Michael Lipton's work has been the crucial role of productivity gains in small farm agriculture for rural poverty reduction, in many sub-Saharan African countries this desirable outcome has stubbornly refused to materialise, and growing numbers of rural poor people are found persistently to fail to secure even minimal acceptable levels of food consumption. A social protection policy response is to target social cash transfers to the chronic extreme poor. This article focuses on the level of cash transfers relative to income differences between households in the bottom half of the income distribution, and the social tensions that arise from beneficiary selection and exclusion. It is found that cash transfers to target groups such as 'the poorest 10 per cent: or the 'ultra-poor labour constrained' must be set low, even below the welfare levels they seek to achieve, if they are to avoid socially invidious reshuffling of the income distribution. The article identifies critical trade-offs between the cost and coverage of different types of social transfer, their social acceptability and their political traction, helping to explain the reluctance of governments to adopt scaled-up poverty-targeted transfers as the preferred form of social cash transfer to those most in need in their societies.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Ellis, F (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",f.ellis@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,21,35,40,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In behavioral economic and finance models, it is usually captured by misperceiving the reliability of signals and results in overweighting private information. Empirical tests of these models often fail to find evidence for the predicted effects of overconfidence. These studies assume, however, that a specific type of overconfidence, i.e. miscalibration, captures the underlying trait. We challenge this assumption and borrow the psychological methodology of single-cue probability learning to obtain a direct measure for misperceiving signal reliability. Our findings indicate that the perception of signal precision and measures of miscalibration are unrelated. We thus conclude that in order to test the theoretical predictions of the overconfidence literature in economics and finance, one cannot rely on the well-established miscalibration bias.

We relate the Act to its most important predecessor, the Banking Act of 1933, and consider the desirability and implications of the Dodd-Frank Act's all-encompassing approach to the reform of financial-sector architecture and regulation.","[Acharya, Viral V.; Richardson, Matthew] NYU, Dept Finance, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Richardson, Matthew] NYU, Salomon Ctr Study Financial Inst, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Acharya, Viral V.; Richardson, Matthew] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Acharya, Viral V.; Richardson, Matthew] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Acharya, Viral V.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 3PZ, England",New York University; New York University; New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Acharya, VV (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Finance, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",vacharya@stern.nyu.edu; mrichar0@stern.nyu.edu,"Acharya, Viral V./HCH-4349-2022",,,,,,121,15,22,0,72,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4804-5,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

This article focuses on two hegemonic policy models of such intensification: (1) the 'Alvord model' of plough-based, integrated crop-livestock farming promoted in colonial Zimbabwe; and (2) minimum-tillage mulch-based, Conservation Agriculture, as currently preached by a wide range of international agricultural research and development agencies. An analysis of smallholder farming practices in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley, reveals the limited inherent understanding of farmer practices in these models. It shows why many smallholder farmers in southern Africa are predisposed towards extensification rather than intensification, and suggests that widespread Conservation Agriculture adoption is unlikely.","[Baudron, Frederic] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Baudron, Frederic; Andersson, Jens A.; Corbeels, Marc; Giller, Ken E.] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Andersson, Jens A.] Univ Zimbabwe, Ctr Appl Social Sci, Harare, Zimbabwe",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Wageningen University & Research; University of Zimbabwe,"Baudron, F (通讯作者)，CIMMYT Ethiopia, ILRI, Shola Campus,POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",f.baudron@cgiar.org,"Andersson, Jens/G-7984-2011; Giller, Ken E/K-2799-2012; Corbeels, Marc/ABA-3249-2022","Andersson, Jens/0000-0002-8124-3447; Giller, Ken E/0000-0002-5998-4652; Corbeels, Marc/0000-0002-8084-9287; Baudron, Frederic/0000-0002-5648-2083",,,,,60,76,95,0,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

We explore the sensitivity of our results to the assumption of market power. We show that welfare gains from free trade are not generally lost but can face considerable redistribution under reasonable assumptions of market power. Varying the rival reactions did not change the result that total economic surplus with four firms after NAFTA is greater than when there were ten firms but no trade. Mergers reduce the trade gains of malt consumers and barley producers in both countries and reduce the welfare losses of malting plants in the U. S.

Furthermore, we observe the January effect during pre-crisis period. However, the subsample analysis provides very different results, perhaps due to increasing degree of capital market maturity, EU accession and other important events, such as the financial crisis.

As the issue of the payout policy, governance of state-owned conglomerates faces new challenges and draws attentions from everyone, including government, public and scholars. The study of state-owned conglomerates governance becomes even more typical when a conglomerate is with a subsidiary company listed in the stock market, as it has access to taking advantage of the bilayer structure to lower the dividends by hiding the profits.

This division resulted in a fervent search for a comprehensive macroeconomic theory to replace the Keynesian paradigm and to handle the imbalances we experience today.

This paper aims to analyze such a relationship for Central and Eastern European countries (EU members). The crisis had a major impact on capital flows to the region, although the magnitude of the impact differed notably, depending on the type of capital inflows and the receiving country. In order to highlight this, we use a regression model and panel data methodology, trying to find if there is some difference between the analyzed countries. The results will be very useful if there is a pattern for different countries regarding the main effect of the financial crisis and the interaction with economic growth over the FDI. Taking into consideration the fact that we found that economic growth has a significant influence over the level of FDI and, moreover, a positive influence, the present study is very important in supporting the regulatory environment of those specific countries, in order to attract more FDI, as a solution for recovery of the economies affected by crisis.

Second, we draw lessons about financial and real sectoral patterns of adjustment in crisis countries, including whether and how IMF programs facilitate this adjustment. Third, we explore the interplay between IMF actions in crisis countries and the actions and responses of local authorities.

After an inflationary shock, nominal prices adjust upward rapidly, and we observe no real effects. However, after a deflationary shock, nominal prices display considerable inertia and real prices adjust only slowly and incompletely toward the levels that would prevail in the absence of a shock.

Technical analysis is not able to outperform the buy-and-hold approach for any portfolio in the set in the second half of the sample period. The finding that the short-term return predictability becomes much weaker in the more recent period suggests that the underlying segments of the equity market have become more efficient over time. The fact that mechanical trading strategies have been futile after adjusting for data snooping bias for two samples of portfolios where technical analysis is most anticipated to succeed suggests that it is unlikely to have delivered abnormal returns in any other segment of the domestic equity market in the last decade.

It shows that it is not inevitable to advocate the aprioristic character of economics (resp. science of human action), as Mises does, to maintain the subjectivist-individualist methodology and the effort to adequately grasp the general laws of human action from its perspective. The present redefinition of apriorism is developed on the basis of thoughts of Barry Smith and Alfred Schutz. It suggests abandoning the apodictic character of apriori (which is untenable) and move closer to a broadly defined empiricism. The methodological insights developed in the paper are finally used to contribute to the debate between the behavioral economists and the proponents of rational choice theory.","Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Dept Philosophy, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Specián, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Dept Philosophy, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",specian.p@gmail.com,"Specian, Petr/I-3429-2017","Specian, Petr/0000-0003-2702-0354",,,,,43,2,2,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Many economic principles about corporate income taxes apply equally in advanced and developing economies, but some characteristics of developing economies lead to different trade-offs. These include fewer locational rents and generally lower administrative capacity. Empirically, corporate income tax developments broadly resemble those in advanced economies, but there are important differences too, such as a greater reliance on tax incentives, reflected in a gradual narrowing - rather than broadening - of tax bases in combination with tax cuts. Detailed analysis using effective tax rates reveals various distortions including a preference for certain assets, and strong tax advantages of debt finance over equity finance, particularly in high-inflation environments. An empirical analysis of correlations between country-specific features and the likelihood of using tax incentives shows that countries offering low tax rates also tend to offer tax incentives, but that they cut their standard rates by substantially less than other countries between 1996 and 2007.","[Abramovsky, Laura; Phillips, David] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Klemm, Alexander] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; International Monetary Fund,"Abramovsky, L (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",laura_a@ifs.org.uk; aklemm@imf.org; david_p@ifs.org.uk,"Klemm, Alexander/AAI-4154-2020","Klemm, Alexander/0000-0002-9892-3182",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,13,13,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We investigate the variation of these wealth effects with the persistence of each kind of wealth fluctuation in an estimated linear dynamic fixed-effects model, allowing for both cointegration and endogeneity. Retail sales respond most strongly to housing wealth fluctuations which persist for one to four years, whereas the response to stock wealth fluctuations is smaller and is concentrated on fluctuations with a persistence of either less than a year or more than four years. These differential persistence effects point to a need for a richer theoretical formulation in this area.

For the largest corporations, such assessments typically rely on data from operational audits, as opposed to random audits, owing to the difficulty of constructing a representative sample for this relatively small group of heterogeneous firms. However, the possibility of selection bias arises when a non-randomly selected sample is used to infer characteristics about a population. This paper introduces an alternative approach for estimating tax under-reporting by corporations. The methodology relies on data from operational audits but derives an estimate of total non-compliance using a fundamental theorem of extreme value (EV) theory, which holds that the largest observations of a stochastic process are Pareto-Zipf distributed.

A computationally efficient particle filter is used that allows for the approximation of the unknown efficient prices and, in combination with a recursive EM algorithm, for the estimation of the volatility curve. We neither assume that the transaction times are equidistant nor do we use interpolated prices.

Evidence suggests that local financial networks display a modular (i.e. clustered) scalefree (i.e. inhomogeneous) architecture. Results concur with other real-world networks, and propose new insights and challenges for authorities contributing to financial stability. For instance, (i) traditional reductionist assumptions for modeling financial systems (e.g. homogeneity) may be particularly misleading; (ii) the observed modular scale-free architecture favors robustness and resilience; (iii) the generating process of such architecture overlaps with literature on trading relationships; (iv) carelessly reducing inhomogeneity in financial systems may backfire in the form of a less robust and less resilient financial system; and (v) financial authorities should understand and take advantage of the existing architecture by means of designing and implementing macro-prudential regulation and system-calibrated requirements.

To answer this question, we analyze the extent of national environmental regulation when policy is determined in a lobbying game between a government and a firm. We compare the resulting equilibrium regulation levels, outputs and welfare in a game with a multinational firm with those in an otherwise identical game with a national firm. For low transportation costs, output and pollution of a national firm are always as least as high as for a multinational; this changes for high transportation costs and intermediate damage parameters. When there is no lobbying, welfare levels. are always higher with multinationals than with national firms. However, the existence of lobbying may reverse this ordering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The results support that process innovation shows a positive effect on employment, especially for SMEs, while the effect of product innovation is not significant. The study also distinguishes that this effect appears in the contemporaneous year but it increases with the number of lags. This result confirms that compensation effects of process innovation may appear with a certain delay justifying the importance for SMEs of being persistent in innovation strategies to make them compatible with employment growth.","[Triguero, Angela; Cuerva, Maria C.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Econo & Empresariales, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Corcoles, David] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac CC, Cuenca 16071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Triguero, A (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Econo & Empresariales, Plaza Univ 1, Albacete 02071, Spain.",Angela.Triguero@uclm.es; David.Corcoles@uclm.es; mariac.cuerva@uclm.es,"Triguero, Angela/F-3204-2014; Cuerva Narro, María del Carmen/AFV-2284-2022; Corcoles Gonzalez, David/S-5831-2016","Triguero, Angela/0000-0002-1126-4429; Cuerva Narro, María del Carmen/0000-0003-1620-5118; Corcoles Gonzalez, David/0000-0003-3523-0976",,,,,46,40,43,5,72,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

For a closer analysis, disaster is classified into various categories, including general floods, other floods, tropical storms, other storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. Furthermore, this paper explores whether natural disasters have different impacts on corruption levels in developed and developing countries. The study reveals a number of novel findings. (1) Natural disasters that cause substantial damage increase public sector corruption in both developing and developed countries. (2) Natural disasters have a greater impact on public sector corruption in developed countries than in developing countries. (3) In developed countries, natural disaster frequency has a significant impact on the level of corruption. Hence, foreseeable disasters increase corruption in general.

We present evidence that the anomaly is a very time dependent phenomenon. We also formulate a model where the ex post returns from the carry trade are functionally related to the relative difference between the interest rate on the funding currency and the interest rate associated with the target currency; i.e. the relative interest rate opportunity (RIRO). We estimate a nonlinear smooth transition regime model that relates the RIRO to the returns on the carry trade, and the estimated transition function then represents the time periods when the carry trade was profitable and when it was not. The analysis indicates that the desirability of carry trading has declined and for many currencies has actually become unprofitable since the financial crisis of 2008.","[Baillie, Richard T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Baillie, Richard T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Finance, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Baillie, Richard T.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Baillie, Richard T.] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy; [Cho, Dooyeon] Kookmin Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136702, South Korea",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Kookmin University,"Cho, D (通讯作者)，Kookmin Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136702, South Korea.",baillie@msu.edu; dcho@kookmin.ac.kr,,"Cho, Dooyeon/0000-0003-2588-9347",,,,,23,8,9,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

During this period, real trade linkages also increased equity price co-movements. By contrast, no robust evidence is found that equity or FDI integration increased asset price co-movements during the crisis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The newly proposed cross-sectional volatility measure is a strong predictor for future returns on the aggregate stock market at the daily frequency.

Lower density cities could be well served by regional aircraft, either regional jets or turboprops, which offer different qualities and a different future for Chinese aviation. Turboprops offer a high level of fuel efficiency compared with regional jets which may improve the cost economics for carriers and reduce the air quality and climate impacts of a growing aviation system in a region where air quality and greenhouse gas emissions are a serious concern. However, regional jets are known for their superior quality of service and faster travel speeds. We begin with a spatial analysis of existing Chinese short-haul aviation networks and find that turboprops are deployed in limited number and are dispersed throughout the country. Their limited use, however, is not because of their cost economics. For the existing regional jet network we estimate the trade space of fuel and time for the replacement of regional jets with turboprops and find that all regional jet routes in China would generate savings if replaced with turboprops. We next establish future short-haul aviation routes between new and emerging airports and estimate the likelihood that a turboprop will be used. The finding that the most viable turboprop markets are spatially dispersed through the country validates considering turboprop investment at the state-level as a component of the established Chinese aviation sustainability initiative.

We show theoretically that by facilitating cooperation, trust may lead to more equal outcomes, while the feedback from inequality to trust is ambiguous. Using a structural equation model estimated on a large country sample, we find that trust has a positive effect on both market and net income equality. Larger welfare states lead to higher net equality but neither net income equality nor welfare state size seems to have a causal effect on trust. We conclude that while trust facilitates welfare state policies that may reduce net inequality, this decrease in inequality does not increase trust. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a sample of underwriters in China's IPO market during 2004-2012, we find the following results. First, underwriting quality is overall positively related to underwriting market share. Second, individual underwriting quality measures are significantly related to market share as well: Affiliated star analysts are valued by both state-owned enterprise (SOE) and non-SUE (NSOE) issuers. The post-IPO performance of previous clients (industry specialization) is a significant determinant of market share in the SUE (NSOE) IPO market. Third, central government ownership of underwriters is a significant determinant of market share in the SUE market. Finally, a further test on regulatory change shows that underwriting quality is playing an increasingly important role in enhancing underwriting market share in China's new issue reform era.

In particular, we focus on the pre-averaged realized volatility estimator proposed by Podolskij and Vetter (2009). This statistic can be written (up to a bias correction term) as the (scaled) sum of squared pre-averaged returns, where the pre-averaging is done over all possible nonoverlapping blocks of consecutive observations. Pre-averaging reduces the influence of the noise and allows for realized volatility estimation on the pre-averaged returns. The nonoverlapping nature of the pre-averaged returns implies that these are asymptotically uncorrelated, but possibly heteroskedastic. This motivates the application of the wild bootstrap in this context. We provide a proof of the first-order asymptotic validity of this method for percentile and percentile-t intervals. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that the wild bootstrap can improve the finite sample properties of the existing first-order asymptotic theory provided we choose the external random variable appropriately. We use empirical work to illustrate its use in practice.","[Goncalves, Silvia] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Hounyo, Ulrich] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Meddahi, Nour] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Montreal; University of Oxford; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Gonçalves, S (通讯作者)，CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",silvia.goncalves@umontreal.ca,,,,,,,24,8,9,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

This may result in irrational behavior. Perhaps rational agents reduce spontaneous social-cognitive responses to successfully maximize profits in a labor market. We tested this hypothesis by creating a labor market-an economic market where people serve as commodities. fMRI participants initially purchased players from a timeestimation skill labor market, then revalued these players based on performance in an attempt to maximize profit. Despite implementing a variety of purchasing strategies, we find that participants initially reduce activity in social cognition brain regions when viewing purchased players-an initial reduction consistent with a dehumanized brain response-that predicts later revaluation of purchased labor market players. However, traditional valuation regions in medial orbito-frontal cortex (MOFC) predict nonpurchased players' revaluation. These results suggest valuation and social cognition brain regions independently guide revaluation processes when people are treated like commodities.","[Harris, Lasana T.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Lee, Victoria K.; Capestany, Beatrice H.] Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Cohen, Alexandra O.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Neurol & Neurosci, New York, NY USA",Duke University; Duke University; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine,"Harris, LT (通讯作者)，Inst Psychol, Fac Social & Behav Sci, 2nd Floor,POB 9555, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands.",l.t.harris@fsw.ledienuniv.nl,,"Harris, Lasana/0000-0002-8503-3201",Duke University,Duke University,This research was funded by Duke University through start-up funds awarded to Lasana T.

According to the results, the majority of the earnings gap between Dalits and non-Dalits is attributed to the endowment effect. Dalits earn less than non-Dalits because Dalits have some characteristics that non-Dalits do not, that are unfavorable in the labor market. That this endowment effect works against Dalits could be a reflection of the social exclusion and job segregation faced by Dalits in the past.","[Karki, Menuka; Bohara, Alok K.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Karki, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, 1915 Roma Ave NE,1019, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",mkarki@unm.edu,,,,,,,30,11,13,1,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Researchers manifest in their turn, a growing interest to study the role of vocational counselling, from the perspective of increasing the efficiency of investment in education and strengthening the capacity of enterprises to meet the challenges of the knowledge economy. In Romania, high school students have access to career guidance services, but there is little information on the extent to which they use or how useful they consider these services. Many times, there is a social conformism among high school graduates, which determines them to choose professions valued at a certain moment, without making a personal judgment. The aim of this paper is to analyse, as a good practice, the role of high school graduate vocational counselling in developing professional skills, in order to help them make the right career decision. In order to monitor the high school students' opinions on the vocational guidance and their perceptions of the integration in the labour market, a market research study has been conducted. This is a survey conducted on a sample of 2,364 high school students in their final year of study (twelve grade). The research has shown that a reduced percentage of the interviewed high school students have knowledge about the vocational guidance activity. From those who have used these services, most of them were satisfied. The study also highlighted the fact that the most important criteria for getting a job are the skills acquired during studies.","[Bratucu, Gabriel; Madar, Anca; Neacsu, Nicoleta Andreea; Boscor, Dana; Baltescu, Codruta Adina] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Econ Sci & Business Adm, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,"Bratucu, G (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Econ Sci & Business Adm, Brasov, Romania.",gabriel.bratucu@unitbv.ro,"Baltescu, Codruta A/B-3057-2016","BRATUCU, Gabriel/0000-0002-9636-3660",,,,,35,1,1,0,13,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2014,16.0,37,,,,,1014,1025,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344542400022,0

The Big Push hypothesis proposes the existence of one threshold below which aid is not effective, whereas the constraints inferred by the concept of absorptive capacity suggest the existence of a second threshold above which aid is no longer effective. This paper addresses the issue of these thresholds which characterize the aid to growth relationship. Using a semi-parametric econometric method, the author finds that aid becomes effective only above a critical level, but what is more it becomes detrimental to growth at high aid flows. The author also investigates how the quality of institutions and economic vulnerability modify the level of these two thresholds. He finds that economic vulnerability is a key factor conditioning aid effectiveness.","[Wagner, Laurent] Univ Auvergne Clermont Ferrand 1, Ecole Econ, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Wagner, Laurent] FERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France",,"Wagner, L (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne Clermont Ferrand 1, Ecole Econ, CERDI, 65 Bd F Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",laurentwagner@ymail.com,,,,,,,40,12,16,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We also find that tax benefits for retirement savings increase strongly with income, although the increase is slightly smaller when taxpayers are ranked by their permanent (rather than current) income. In addition, we find that a large portion of the benefits from the Saver's Credit go to taxpayers who would not be eligible based on their permanent income. Finally, we find that recent tax changes (including the introduction of the Saver's Credit) significantly increased contributions among low-income households, although the effect was centered among those with only transitorily low income.

Fast traders' ability to revise their quotes quickly after news arrivals helps to reduce the inefficiency that is rooted in the risk of being picked off, which increases trade. However, their presence induces slow traders to strategically submit limit orders with a lower execution probability, thereby reducing trade. Because speed is a source of market power, it enables fast traders to extract rents from other market participants and triggers a costly arms race that reduces social welfare. The model generates a number of testable implications concerning the effects of high-frequency trading in limit order markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Combined weather and travel survey datasets that span a period of over 13 years were analysed. Simultaneous Tobit models were applied to explore the interactions among these activity travel indicators, whilst municipalities' unique conditions and heterogeneities between different time-points were taken into account. The model results reveal the trade-offs between routine and leisure activities in terms of activity duration, number of trips and travel time. Positive mutual endogeneity was found between slow-mode share in routine and leisure trips. The results also highlight the trade-offs between routine and leisure activities under abnormal weather conditions. Regional differences between weather effects are substantial due to differences in direct, indirect and total marginal effects. Between-municipality variability constitutes a considerable part of the variability in activity duration and travel time. Between-municipality variability in leisure activity duration and leisure travel time is larger in northern Sweden, while that of routine activity duration and routine travel time is larger in central Sweden, after weather and social demographics have been controlled.

Relatively less is known about mode choice for discretionary and more flexible activities, such as social visits. These choices are dynamic and depend on personal habits and preferences, reflected to some extent in the history of similar choices. This study adopts the theory of path dependence to take life cycle dynamics and habitual preferences into account. Using a dataset collected in the Netherlands in 2011, a multinomial logit model of mode choice was developed. Results suggest that mode choices for social activities are path dependent, yet not entirely. There is also evidence of switching towards faster and more flexible modes after a life cycle event.

One highly localized form of government is a homeowners' association (HOA). HOAs could be well suited for triaging foreclosures, as they may detect delinquencies and looming defaults through direct observation or missed dues. On the other hand, the reliance on dues may leave HOAs particularly vulnerable to members' foreclosure. We examine how property prices respond to homeowner distress and foreclosure within HOA communities in Florida. We combine datasets of HOAs, sales and aggregate loan delinquency and foreclosures from 2000 through 2008. We find properties in HOAs are relatively less impacted by more distressed neighbor homes compared to non-HOA properties, but only when considering less severe delinquency rates. We also find that negative price effects from higher delinquency exposure rates are ameliorated for properties in larger and newer HOAs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Adoption of ERM represents a radical paradigm shift from the traditional method of managing risks individually to managing risks collectively allowing ERM-adopting firms to better recognize natural hedges, prioritize hedging activities towards the risks that contribute most to the total risk of the firm, and optimize the evaluation and selection of available hedging instruments. We hypothesize that these advantages allow ERM-adopting firms to produce greater risk reduction per dollar spent. Our hypothesis further predicts that, after implementing ERM, firms experience profit maximizing incentives to lower risk. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that firms adopting ERM experience a reduction in stock return volatility. We also find that the reduction in return volatility for ERM-adopting firms becomes stronger over time. Further, we find that operating profits per unit of risk (ROA/retum volatility) increase post ERM adoption. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
