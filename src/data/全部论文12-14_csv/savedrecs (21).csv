In estimating RP/SP models, assumptions on error structures are required: (a) RP and SP have both a common error component and independent error components (general model); (b) RP and SP have a common error component and SP only has an independent error component (SP-off-RP model); (c) RP and SP have independent error components only (independent model); and (d) RP and SP have a common error component only (double-bound model). This study simulates and examines the estimation efficiency of-RP/SP models based on the D-error considering both error structures and attribute differences. Insights obtained are the following. (1) The general model offers better estimation efficiency in the neighbourhood of X=1.0. (2) For the SP-off-RP model and the independent model, the larger the variance in the error components of the SP model relative to the RP model, the larger the value of X that is required to minimise the D-error. The authors propose a method for designing an SP experiment in which the level-of-service of the SP differs from that of the RP by only a single attribute value. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper addresses the role of direct payments granted in the context of the market and income support policies and of rural development policies in the distribution of farm income among farmers. Using the Gini coefficient and its disaggregation, this study investigates the impact of DPs on farm income inequality among a large sample of farms in Italy. The analysis is developed at a national level but also considers the three main regions of Italy and three types of farming. The DPs are very concentrated but reduce farm income inequality. However, the recent CAP reform has weakened this latter positive characteristic. The results of the analysis suggest the need to avoid a drastic reduction in the level of DPs because this is expected to increase farm income concentration and any attempt to change their distribution should be welcome if it results in a reduction of farm income concentration.

Pipelines are needed to transport the oil and natural gas from this landlocked region over long distances within countries and across borders to meet this increasing demand. The evaluation of alternative export routes in the Caspian Sea basin is a complex multicriteria problem with conflicting objectives. We present a Group Decision Support System (GDSS) for the evaluation of alternative pipeline routes in this region. The proposed system decomposes the route selection process into manageable steps. The system combines Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat (SWOT) analysis with the Delphi method to capture the decision makers' (DMs') beliefs. A group Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) model is used to integrate these beliefs with subjective judgments and identify the most attractive pipeline route. The Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Assistance (GALA) plane is used to further analyze the alternative routes and arrive at a group solution consistent with managerial goals and objectives.

To this end, central banks use various monetary policy rules. This paper intends to provide a broad survey of the literature on Taylor-type monetary policy rules with a time-varying parameter (TVP) specification. To include the TVP feature, some modification is made in the monetary transmission mechanism of Taylor-type monetary policy models to account for the changing risk preference of individuals. In line with this approach, we introduce an interest rate pass-through specification of the monetary transmission process in a general equilibrium model to account for the varying perceptions of risk by individuals. We include an application for Turkey and estimate the time-variable parameters of the model by employing a structural extended Kalman filter (EKF).

It covers the period of 1975-2010, and assumes a log-linear relationship between the variables. The bounds test for cointegration indicates a unique long-run relationship between the variables. Moreover, it finds that sub-optimal electricity production is eroding the private business investment in the short run. Based on these facts, this study advocates the promotion of hydropower plants that are beneficial for two reasons. First, it would produce clean power in the country. Second, the cost of production would also drop resulting in lower tariff rates.

This finding can be attributed to the unique characteristics of the KOSPI200 options market, which determine the dynamics of the VKOSPI.","[Lee, Bong Soo] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Ryu, Doojin] Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Sch Econ, Seoul 156756, South Korea",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Chung Ang University,"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Sch Econ, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",doojin.ryu@gmail.com,"Lee, BongSoo/AAP-3262-2020; Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887",,,,,24,1,1,0,14,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,FEB 4,2013,7.0,,,,,,,,20133.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-3,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,091IB,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315041700001,0

Based on a small open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with fiscal feedback rules, we analyze the dynamic macroeconomic response in particular of the current account under alternative exchange rate regimes. Our results indicate that entry into monetary union makes the economy more vulnerable to a productivity shock and leads to higher variability of the current account. For a risk premium shock, an entry into EMU implies lower variability of most macroeconomic variables, but a higher persistence in the adjustment process of the current account. For both shocks, a countercyclical fiscal response to the current account is more stabilizing for most macroeconomic variables than a conventional countercyclical response to output. Stabilizing the current account comes at the price of higher variability of output in the short-run, however.","[Hohberger, Stefan] Univ Bayreuth, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,,bernhard.herz@uni-bayreuth.de; stefan.hohberger@uni-bayreuth.de,"Hohberger, Stefan/T-9141-2019","Hohberger, Stefan/0000-0001-8399-2241",,,,,46,9,9,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Especially in the euro area where monetary policy is centralised and discretionary fiscal policy making is constrained by the EU fiscal rules, knowing the size and the effectiveness of automatic stabilisers is crucial. While automatic stabilisers are a fairly established concept in the fiscal policy literature, there is still no consensus about their actual nature and their effectiveness. This paper shows that differences in opinion mirror a deeper disagreement over how the budget would look like without automatic stabilisers. This issue is addressed by defining two types of counterfactual budgets giving rise to two different interpretations about the nature of automatic stabilisation. Simulations with a structural model confirm that the degree of smoothing is conditional on how the counterfactual budget, i.e. the budget without automatic stabilisers, is defined.","[in't Veld, Jan; Larch, Martin] Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Vandeweyer, Marieke] Univ Louvain, Fac Business & Econ, VIVES, Louvain, Belgium",,"in't Veld, J (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",jan.intveld@ec.europa.eu; martin.larch@ec.europa.eu; marieke.vandeweyer@kuleuven.be,"Larch, Martin/AAI-7587-2021","Vandeweyer, Marieke/0000-0002-0294-0544",,,,,33,11,11,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This literature is augmented by analyzing short- and long-term growth effects of exchange rate flexibility in a panel-cointegration framework for a sample of 60 countries clustered in five country groups.

In lesser developed countries, millions of people are contracting the disease, which can be fatal without access to proper treatment. In developed countries, prevalence is on the rise and has cycled around endemic levels for decades. We investigate syphilis dynamics by extending the classic SIRS epidemiological model to incorporate forward-looking, rational individuals. The integrated economic-epidemiological model shows that human preferences over health and sexual activity are central to the nature of syphilis cycles. We find that low-activity individuals will behave in a manner that significantly dampen the cycles, while high-activity individuals will tend to exacerbate the cycles, a phenomenon we refer to as rational dynamic resonance. The model also provides insights into failed attempts by the U.S. government to eradicate syphilis from the U.S. population.","[Aadland, David; Finnoff, David C.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Huang, Kevin X.

In addition, the quality of their outputs depends on their machines and therefore every company should select the best machine by itself Also, a choice of appropriate machine tool is very significant for a manufacturing company as it helps to reach high productivity and efficiency. Furthermore, market offers variety kind of machines with different brands. Besides, there are many criteria with respect to numerous alternatives that should be considered as part of proper machine tool selection, such as cost, operative flexibility, safety, etc. Consequently selection of machine tool can be regarded as a multiple-attribute decision making (MADM) problem. Generally, MADM methods deal with the process of selection of an alternative among number of different alternatives in the presence of usually conflict objectives and criteria. In this study two MADM methods, step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and complex proportional assessment of alternatives with grey relations (COPRAS-G), were applied for machine tool evaluation and selection. This model is a hybrid model which integrates two MADM methods for improving the quality and accuracy of the selection. Literature survey was used to identify the most attractive criteria which influence the selection of a machine tool. Eight criteria for evaluation process include cost, operative flexibility, maintainability and service ability, size and physical, compatibility, safety, precision and productivity. More precisely, the first part of the proposed methodology, i.e. SWARA is useful for determining the importance of each criterion and calculating weight of each criterion, while the second part with COPRAS-G is useful for evaluating alternatives more precisely than usual crisp COPRAS and for ranking machine tool alternatives from the best to the worst ones. In evaluation process decision maker has to assess criteria which are not accurate. Grey relation analysis allows incorporating the vague and imprecise information in to the decision model. For illustration of the proposed methodology, a case study was explained in a manufacturing company in Karaj, Iran. This model can help managers to evaluate and select the best machine tool alternative based on own company strategies, resources, policies, etc. for their organization.","[Aghdaie, Mohammad Hasan; Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Aghdaie, Mohammad Hasan] Shomal Univ, Amol, Mazandaran, Iran; [Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Tehran, Iran",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Amirkabir University of Technology,"Aghdaie, MH (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",mh_aghdaie@yahoo.com; sa.hashemkhani@gmail.com; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani/AAA-9918-2021","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X;",,,,,75,93,94,2,62,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Agents face uninsurable idiosyncratic shocks to labor productivity in a production economy with costly financial intermediation and a borrowing limit. Reducing intermediation costs has two effects: (1) For a given decrease in the interest rate on borrowing, agents' ability to smooth consumption over time improves. (2) The demand for loans increases, which increases the interest rate. The net welfare gain of reducing intermediation costs from 3.927% (U.S. level) to 1% is about 1.14% of equivalent consumption in the baseline economy for an endogenous interest rate and 1.90% for an exogenous interest rate. The gains are distributed unevenly: households at the bottom wealth decile improve welfare by 3.96% and 5.86% of equivalent consumption, while those at the top decile have welfare gains of 0.35% and 0.2%, respectively. Sufficiently high intermediation costs eliminate borrowing and hence the welfare gain of reducing costs is not substantial. The welfare analysis includes transitional dynamics between steady states.

The empirical findings reveal substantial homogeneity across sectors as well as across price indices. These results suggest a very moderate degree of inflation persistence for both aggregate and disaggregate price indices. The results point to the need to account for the presence of a structural break typically related to the Maastricht effect; and entailed a structural increase in the persistence measure, though the average level of inflation declined. This could be a piece of evidence that although the monetary component of inflation in Greece was neutralized due to the implementation of the monetary policy by a central monetary authority, other idiosyncratic characteristics of the Greek inflation contribute to this persistent structure of the inflation series.","Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Piraeus, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Apergis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Piraeus, Greece.",napergis@unipi.gr,"Apergis, Nikolas/J-7125-2017","Apergis, Nicholas/0000-0002-7433-2871; , Nick/0000-0002-0375-2457",,,,,41,3,3,0,7,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,1,,,,,51,71,,10.2298/PAN1301051A,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,148KA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319242300003,0

Specifically, firms compete for market share through cost-reducing technological innovation, and they vie for influence over government transfer policy through rent-seeking activities. We find that rent-seeking affects growth in two ways: it allows firms to ignore economic competition, leading to less innovation, and it alters the number of firms that are supported in equilibrium. The former effect is negative, while the latter is ambiguous. We show how these effects depend on various characteristics of economic and political markets.","[Brou, Daniel] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Ruta, Michele] World Trade Org, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland",Western University (University of Western Ontario); World Trade Organization,"Brou, D (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",dbrou@uwo.ca; michele.ruta@wto.org,,,,,,,37,12,13,1,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

We use this insight to explain why conflict often takes place along ethnic lines, why some ethnic groups are more often in conflict than others (and some never are), and why the same groups are sometimes in conflict and sometimes at peace. In our theory ethnic markers help enforce group membership: in homogeneous societies members of the losing group can more easily pass themselves as members of the winning group, and this reduces the chances of conflict as an equilibrium outcome. We derive a number of implications of the model relating social, political, and economic indicators such as the incidence of conflict, the distance between ethnic groups, group sizes, income inequality, and expropriable resources. One of the insights is that the incidence of ethnic conflict is nonmonotonic in expropriable resources as a fraction of total resources, with a low incidence for either low or high values. We use the model's predictions to interpret historical examples of conflict associated with skin pigmentation, body size, language, and religion.","[Caselli, Francesco] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Coleman, Wilbur John, II] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Duke University,"Caselli, F (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",f.caselli@lse.ac.edu; coleman@duke.edu,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,72,118,148,3,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Much of the literature studying the effect of voucher programs on public schools has looked at the effect on student and mean school scores. This paper tries to go inside the black box to investigate some of the ways in which schools facing the Florida accountability-tied voucher program behaved. Schools getting an F grade for the first time were exposed to the threat of vouchers, but did not face vouchers unless and until they got a second F within the next 3 years. In addition, F, being the lowest grade, exposed the threatened schools to stigma. Exploiting the institutional details of this program, I analyze the incentives built into the system and investigate the behavior of the threatened public schools facing these incentives. There is strong evidence that they did respond to incentives. Using highly disaggregated school-level data, a difference-in-differences estimation strategy as well as a regression discontinuity (RD) analysis, I find that the threatened schools tended to focus more on students below the minimum criteria cutoffs rather than equally on all. Second, consistent with incentives, the threatened school improvements were, by far, the largest in writing. These results are robust to controlling for differential preprogram trends, changes in demographic compositions, mean reversion, and sorting. These findings have important policy implications.

It will thus be critical to complement research on the efficiency of specific land rental arrangements such as sharecropping with an inquiry into the broader productivity impacts of the land rental market. Plot-level data for a matched landlord-tenant sample in an environment where sharecropping dominates allow us to explore both issues. We find that pure output sharing leads to significantly lower levels of efficiency that can be attenuated by monitoring while the inefficiency disappears if inputs are shared as well. Rentals transfer land to more productive producers but realization of this productivity advantage is prevented by the inefficiency of contractual arrangements, suggesting changes that would prompt adoption of different contractual arrangements could have significant benefits.","[Deininger, Klaus; Ali, Daniel Ayalew] World Bank, DEC, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Alemu, Tekie] Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",The World Bank; Addis Ababa University,"Ali, DA (通讯作者)，World Bank, DEC, 1818 H St NW,Mail Stop 3305, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dali1@worldbank.org,,"Deininger, Klaus/0000-0003-3198-0083",,,,,35,22,26,1,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A sample of the main Spanish companies, those quoted on the IBEX-35, was selected and the relationship was analysed between investment in intangible resources (training being representative of Human Capital and advertising of Relational Capital) and the market value relevance of the company's intangibles (measured using Tobin's Q) in two periods: 2006-2009 and 2008-2011. We thus obtain that both investing in training and investing in advertising separately have a positive impact on Tobin's Q. Regarding the joint effect, there is a positive and significant relationship with Tobin's Q in the first period analysed and no significant relation in the second period analysed. That is, investment in intellectual capital dimensions generates increases in the future market value of the firm.

Less certain is the effect this influence has on the wealth of those firms' shareholders. We contribute to the literature by analysing stock market reactions to announcements by Chinese firms of overseas mergers and acquisitions (OMAs). OMAs are of particular interest because there can exist a conflict between the interests of the public sector in acquiring overseas assets, and the interests of the private sector in maximizing shareholder wealth. Our main dataset consists of 213 observations of 157 OMA events that occurred between 1994 and 2009, using share market returns from the Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and US markets. The aggregation of share price data across multiple markets, and the listing of firms in multiple exchanges, raise econometric issues for the standard event-study methodology. To address these, we use a new, feasible generalized least squares (GLS) procedure developed by Gu and Reed (2012). On the basis of an analysis using both aggregated and disaggregated samples, and of daily and cumulative abnormal returns, we find consistent evidence that (i) Chinese OMAs have not lowered the wealth of shareholders of Chinese acquiring firms, and (ii) shareholders of Chinese acquiring firms have not fared worse under under China's 'Go Global' policy of encouraging outward investment by Chinese firms.","[Gu, Lulu] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Reed, W.

It develops an Equilibrium Correction Model (ECM) to explain variations in the aggregate number of CVLs in England and Wales between 1963 and 1995. This is then subjected to out-of-sample testing over the subsequent 10-year period. The results indicate that in both the short-run and the long-run, changes in the level of liquidations can be explained by two main explanatory variables namely: the nominal after-tax cost of borrowing and changes in the overall level of economic activity.

To accomplish this task, a dynamic general equilibrium model is developed so that it could incorporate the inter-regional transactions and endogenous growth mechanisms within the framework of an Overlapping Generations (OLG) model. Key parameter values associated with the regional interconnections were assigned using a multi-regional Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of the Midwest states. Two different steady-state results were presented with two different age-cohort population structures corresponding to year 2007 and 2030. These steady-state results imply that the rate of declining of per-capita output is projected to be heterogeneous across the regions due to different developments of age-cohort population structures and consequently different levels of endogenously determined educational investment of workers. Also, two steady-state simulation results revealed that the development of output price in a certain region reflects the dynamics of demographics of every region. Meanwhile, the dynamic simulation results reveal that the per-capita output of every region is projected to grow positively in the near future when the population ageing will be pronounced. However, the growth rate of the per-capita output is projected to be heterogeneous across the regions: the regions with high-skilled workers hold the potential threat that population ageing could give more negative impacts on the economy due to the relatively sluggish growth of human capital stock. Also, the dynamic simulation results show that certain regions in the Midwest will experience their terms of trade deterioration in the near future, implying that careful attention should be given to their future trade conditions.","[Kim, Tae-Jeong; Hewings, Geoffrey J.

According to our results we conclude that the general idea that well-developed countries with good institutional characteristics experience the market-based system can be confirmed.

We find that residual demand rationing does not significantly impact the capacity choices of experimental subjects, although it does affect pricing.

Furthermore, investor demand for relevant information and improved quality and timeliness of financial information is increasing in the face of deteriorating usefulness of traditionally reported earnings, cash flows, and equity values. Thus, many accounting industry practitioners, analysts, and researchers now see Intellectual Capital (IC) as a driver for a firm's long term business competitiveness. However, most researchers have overlooked the negative side of IC which is referred to as Intellectual Liabilities (IL). Therefore, the objective of the present study is to explore through empirical analysis how Intellectual Assets (IA) and IL components, as independent variables, influence Firm Financial Performance (FFP) as a dependent variable. The present study uses content analysis of 2010 and 2011 annual reports for all publicly listed companies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Multivariate regression analysis is employed to answer the research question: What are the characteristics of a new conceptual model that assists in explaining the relationships between IC disclosure and FFP for companies listed on the UAE stock exchanges? The findings indicate a statistically positive relationship between Human Capital (HC), Relational Capital (RC), Structural Capital (SC), Human Liabilities (HL), Relational Liabilities (RL), and Structural Liabilities (RL) on one hand, and Return on Equity (ROE) on the other hand. However, this study has some limitations which include the restrictions inherent in the content analysis method, in addition to the external validity to other jurisdictions due to the sample being chosen from the UAE only. In terms of practical implications, the findings of this study provide an insight to firm managers on the impact of increased transparency and disclosure on FFP.","[Majdalany, George] UGSM Monarch Business Sch Switzerland, Fac Accounting & Finance, Zug, Switzerland; [Henderson, Jeffrey] UGSM Monarch Business Sch Switzerland, Fac Business Eth, Zug, Switzerland",,"Majdalany, G (通讯作者)，UGSM Monarch Business Sch Switzerland, Fac Accounting & Finance, Zug, Switzerland.",george.asaad.majdalany@ugsm-monarch.ch; dr.henderson@ugsm-monarch.ch,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,248,258,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000029,0

Vertically integrated firms run both wholesale activities (buying gas from the producers under take-or-pay obligations) and retail activities (selling gas to final customers). The market is decentralized and the firms decide which customers to serve, competing then in prices. We show that TOP clauses limit the incentives to face-to-face competition and determine segmentation and monopoly pricing even when entry of new competitors occurs. The development of wholesale trade, instead, may induce generalized entry and retail competition. This equilibrium outcome is obtained if a compulsory wholesale market is introduced, even when firms are vertically integrated, or under vertical separation of wholesale and retail activities when firms can use only linear bilateral contracts.

In order to address the problem of variables' selection, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is used while choosing the appropriate variables for the regression. In order to loose the assumption of stability overtime in the regression, interaction terms of particular regressors are introduced with time dummies (the whole sample is divided into time intervals and is allowed for structural breaks). Finally, in order to address the problem of potential inconsistency of typically used estimators, the study employs Blundell and Bond's GMM system estimator. The main findings are the following. (1) The EU27 countries converged at the rate of about 5% per annum while the EU15 countries-at 3% p.a., which is an enormous difference as compared with the widely cited 2% rate of convergence. (2) The pure mechanism of conditional convergence of the countries under study was rather constant over time: there were periods of more rapid or slower convergence but the differences were not as huge as one could expect.

This results in the need to integrate into the financial accounting such evaluation methods which would enable enterprises to reliably establish the value of IC or its constituent parts in monetary units. A number of scholars have dealt with methods of IC valuation. However, no uniform opinion has been reached yet regarding which of the evaluation methods (return on assets or market capitalization) enable(s) to establish the value of the IC of an enterprise and its constituent parts in monetary units. Hence the objective of the present research is to explore and systemize the advantages and drawbacks typical of these methods and to outline the theoretical aspects of the most appropriate method of IC evaluation in monetary units. The main methods applied in the present article are synthesis and generalization of academic writings. The results of the research and its conclusions are based on the analysis of academic investigations conducted by various authors and the resulting publications. The article generalizes on analyses of methods of IC evaluation suggested in researches of a number of scholars, provides comparisons and reveals advantages as well as drawbacks of these methods. A synthesis of return on assets (ROA) and market capitalization (MC) type methods establishes that the value of the IC of an organization in monetary units is more reliably defined by MC methods. Even though the main disadvantage of these methods is the use of the enterprise market value (MV) as the background yet subjectivity (which is the principal drawback of ROA methods) is thus avoided. Nevertheless, the application of MC methods is limited as they can only be employed for those enterprises whose MV may be reliably established.","[Ramanauskaite, Agne; Rudzioniene, Kristina] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Ramanauskaite, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Kaunas, Lithuania.",agne.ramanauskaite@khf.vu.lt; kristina.rudzioniene@khf.vu.lt,"Rudžionienė, Kristina/AAE-5447-2021","Rudžionienė, Kristina/0000-0001-8111-5675",,,,,47,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,557,563,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000064,0

A job is a credible way of redistributing when it provides rents (such as in situations with moral hazard), and employment is optimal ex post. Moreover, a job is selective and reversible, and thus ties the continuation utility of a voter to the political success of a particular politician. We show that the need to make offers of employment incentive-compatible leads to inefficiencies in the supply of public goods. We also show that such inefficient redistribution becomes relatively attractive in situations with high inequality and low productivity. Inefficiency is increased when the stakes from politics are high, when inequality is high, and when money matters less than ideology in politics.","[Robinson, James A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Verdier, Thierry] Paris Sch Econ, FR-75014 Paris, France",Harvard University; Paris School of Economics,"Robinson, JA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jrobinson@gov.harvard.edu; tv@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,35,177,227,1,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

The paper, Intellectual Capital Statements in Brazilian SME (Fernandez, et al., 2012), points out that, in the rapidly emerging Brazilian economy, intangible assets become a key success factor for sustainable growth. As experiences in the fast moving city and state of Rio de Janeiro have shown, the development of systematic management procedures for these intangible assets is especially valuable for fast growing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to serve as the solid backbone for an increasingly knowledge-based economy. In this context, it becomes an essential management goal to keep productivity at a constant high level, in a dynamic and fast growing business environment, and thus, at the same time, securing individual profits and national welfare. This management challenge has been the starting point for the first pilot-project on implementing the management tool Intellectual Capital Statement, ICS, in ten pioneer SMEs from Rio de Janeiro. The second initiative described in the paper Current State of Competitive Intelligence in Brazil (Sequeira, et al., 2012) highlights that Brazil has been evolving into a knowledge society dealing with political changes, globalization, new technologies, and new global competitors, such as China. The need to enhance companies' and, by extension, countries' competitiveness has grown rapidly. The Brazilian government and companies have realized that competing in a global economy requires a strong vision of what exists outside the country. As a result, Competitive Intelligence is becoming more accepted as a fundamental business function. The paper concludes that organisations in Brazil should seek to engage proactively with the global environment by revising their strategic priorities. It is, therefore, evident that organisations and particularly government policies need to redress some critical competitiveness issues, most notably the establishment of the Competitive Intelligence System as a strategic tool. Without such tool, organisations and the country will find it difficult to position themselves in the global marketplace. Taking into account the main conclusions of the two initiatives described above, and the unique circumstances of organically grown organizations in the Brazilian business environment, this paper discusses the challenge of integrating the ICS into a comprehensive strategic change process.

However in recent years, the European Union (EU) has seen stagnating economic growth, rising unemployment leading to social tensions, and sovereign debt crises in several European countries, exacerbated by the fact that the future outlook remains uncertain. This situation is driven mainly by Europe's persistent competitiveness shortfall as compared to other advanced economies and by the lack of EU competitiveness in many social-economic issues. More recently Europe has started to implement deeper reforms to rebuild competitiveness, paving the way towards a more sustainable path of prosperity. Consequent and sustained implementation of these measures will be required in order to ensure their full impact. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of economic crisis on EU competitiveness, to identify and discuss several competitiveness practices that European countries have undertaken in order to boost their competitiveness. In rebuilding Europe's competitiveness, the reform processes require a revitalization of values and visions that have driven European integration, such as partnership, solidarity and social inclusion. However, there is a sense of urgency and scale to do it, so in order to avoid a lost decade for economic growth that could endanger the social cohesion model that Europe has built over the past decades.","[Stanickova, Michaela; Melecky, Lukas] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Stanícková, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",michaela.stanickova@vsb.cz; lukas.melecky@vsb.cz,"Stanickova, Michaela/ABE-6334-2020; Melecky, Lukas/AAY-7847-2021; Melecky, Lukas/A-8078-2015","Stanickova, Michaela/0000-0001-6210-2377; Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400; Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400","SGS project of Faculty of Economics, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava [SP2013/45]; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296]","SGS project of Faculty of Economics, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness","This paper was created under SGS project (SP2013/45) of Faculty of Economics, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava and Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness (Project CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296).",,18,0,0,1,4,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-248-3095-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,324,337,,,,,,14,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393737200031,0

This paper attempts to contribute to this debate by shedding some light on these two points. First, as different measures have been proposed to evaluate the evolution of (regional) disparities, the report attempts to verify whether all of them roughly convey similar information. Second, given that different (single and composite) indicators, other than the traditional per capita GDP, have been proposed to represent the term development, the paper wants to see whether the conclusions drawn from the use of these single and composite indicators are generally similar to those from the per capita GDP. Regarding inequality measures, the results tended to show that all of them convey more or less the same information, namely, a common time pattern leading to a significant reduction of regional disparities in EU27 during the period 1995-2007. With respect to the development indicators, the results tend to support the conclusion that regional variations in development, whatever indicator is employed, are closely related to variations in per capita GDP.","[Villaverde, Jose; Maza, Adolfo] Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain; [Villaverde, Jose] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",Universidad de Cantabria; University of Limerick,"Villaverde, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain.",villavej@unican.es; adolfo.maza@unican.es,"Maza, Adolfo/H-5265-2019","Maza, Adolfo/0000-0002-7299-3449; Villaverde, Jose/0000-0002-5393-091X",,,,,31,3,3,0,6,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Likewise IC information is deemed important as it is used for decision-making and could enhance stakeholders' confidence. One area that has attracted little attention in both the research and business communities is the way in which IC information is made available. Current mandatory corporate filings in most countries lack information on IC in view of difficulty to systematically disclose IC Information to organizational managers and stakeholders Against this context, this study seeks to examine the prevalence of IC information disclosed by organizations and ascertains whether the presence of IC information correlates to OP from three perspectives, namely human capital, relational capital and organizational capital. This study is drawn from Annual reports and Responsibility Statements published for FYE2011 in English by the Global Fortune 500 companies in Europe. Findings show that IC information on human capital is most widely reported, followed by organizational capital and relational capital. IC scholars can leverage on the findings as springboard for new ideas in generating more research on IC information.

The literature so far pointed out that the spatial proximity is necessary for sustaining interaction between KIBS and the client. However, spatial proximity may also become a limit to further growth: empirical evidence have highlighted that KIBS firms are increasingly developing interactions outside their local market and even internationalizing. Those studies did not point out which are the variables that sustain market extension. The paper aims ad addressing this gap in the literature. Using original survey data on about 350 KIBS located in the Veneto region (Italy), this paper contributes to the literature by investigating the factors related to the EMS' market extension. Findings suggest innovation capabilities are positively related to the market extension of a KIBS. Furthermore, KIBS that cooperate with non-local partners are more likely to serve non-local market. The agglomeration effects (location in urban areas or industrial districts) have instead no positive relation with KIBS market extension.","[Di Maria, Eleonora; Bettiol, Marco; De Marchi, Valentina; Grandinetti, Roberto] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali Marco Fanno DSE, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Di Maria, E (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali Marco Fanno DSE, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",eleonora.dimaria@unipd.it; marco.bettiol@unipd.it; valentina.demarchi@unipd.it; roberto.grandinetti@unipd.it,"De Marchi, Valentina/J-8024-2019","De Marchi, Valentina/0000-0002-9571-8407; Grandinetti, Roberto/0000-0001-7736-9074; Di Maria, Eleonora/0000-0003-4595-2155",,,,,55,12,12,0,39,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Multiple proxies for training quality are identified from bidding processes in which public and private training institutions compete for limited public funding in Peru. Information about exact dates of program enrollment is analyzed to show whether the first-come-first-served assignment rule randomized eligible individuals across courses of varying quality. Generalized propensity score (GPS) is implemented to estimate dose-response functions in the context of multiple treatments. We find that beneficiaries attending high-quality training courses show higher earnings and better job-quality characteristics than either beneficiaries attending low-quality courses or nonparticipants. The returns are particularly robust for women, making the provision of high-quality training services cost-effective. Furthermore, the most important training attribute is expenditures per trainee. Class size and infrastructure are weakly related to the expected impacts, while teacher experience, curricular activities, and market knowledge seem to bear no relationship with the expected impacts. External validity was assessed by using five cohorts of individuals over an eight-year period. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Surveys in Chile have suggested that parents are not aware of the performance of their children's schools. In this paper, we assess the effect of public information of school quality on the school choice by parents. We use a data set which includes measurements of the distance between homes and schools, and the performance of the school measured by a standardized tests and the school fee for two distinct periods (1996 and 2003). Whereas in 1996, information regarding school performance was scarce, it was widespread in 2003. We conclude that regardless of these considerations, school performance is an important determinant of school choice. Thus, parents appear to act as if they knew it when choosing a school. Nevertheless, making public the information regarding the performance of the schools has made it a more important factor in choosing a school.","[Gomez, Daniel; Paredes, Ricardo D.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Chumacero, Romulo A.] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Gómez, D (通讯作者)，Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",degomezc@puc.cl; rchumace@econ.uchile.cl; rparedes@ing.puc.cl,"Harwood, Ian A/O-9917-2016; Paredes, Ricardo/M-1653-2013","Paredes, Ricardo/0000-0002-4081-1700; CHUMACERO, ROMULO/0000-0001-7218-0440",,,,,17,11,20,0,28,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0304-2758,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

Assuming that money is universally recognizable but bond is not, two types of trades arise one where both money and bond are accepted and the other where only money is accepted as a medium of exchange-depending on a seller's strategy of accepting or rejecting the bond of unrecognized quality and a buyer's strategy of carrying the counterfeit bond. Equilibrium restrictions imply that the liquidity differentials between money and bond tend to increase with the recognizability problem. Money commands higher liquidity than bond by providing additional liquidity service when sellers reject the bond of unrecognized quality as well as when they recognize counterfeit bond.

Whilst shown to raise aggregate output and employment, these policies crowd-out private consumption and typically reduce welfare. On account of their widespread use to stimulate economic activity, we consider the use of tax-and-subsidize instead of tax-and-spend policies. Within a static general equilibrium macro-model with imperfectly competitive goods markets, we examine the effects of wage and output subsidies and show that, for a small open economy, positive tax and subsidy rates exist which maximize welfare, rendering no intervention suboptimal. We also show that, within a two-country setting, a Nash non-cooperative symmetric equilibrium with positive tax and subsidy rates exists, and that cooperation between governments in setting these rates is more expansionary and leads to an improvement upon the non-cooperative solution.","[Molana, Hassan; Montagna, Catia] Univ Dundee, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Montagna, Catia] Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Kwan, Chang Yee] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",University of Dundee; University of Nottingham; National University of Singapore,"Montagna, C (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, 3 Perth Rd, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",c.montagna@dundee.ac.uk,,"Kwan, Chang Yee/0000-0003-3966-4843",,,,,52,2,2,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Commons's institutional economic framework, this paper analyzes the evolution of key institutions in the Malian cotton sector, starting with Mali's independence in 1960 to the ongoing market-oriented reforms in the 2000s. In accordance with Commons's economic theory, institutional changes in the Malian cotton sector have led to both intended and unintended consequences, impacting economic performance at the farm, gin, and state levels. This has, in turn, contributed to the emergence of new limiting factors. At present, lack of adequate technical advising, indebtedness, issues related to input access, discordance between farmers and their union leader representatives, unreasonable seed cotton prices, delays in payment, and low cotton yields are the current limiting factors to desired economic performance. Based on these findings, we draw policy recommendations for revitalizing the Malian cotton sector.","[Theriault, Veronique] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Sterns, James A.] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Michigan State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Theriault, V (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,,40,7,11,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Nowhere is it better visible than in the mainstream discussions about the euro zone and its problems, where most debaters glide over the fundamentals of Europe's long-term problems and concentrate on the superficial and short-term issues. The discussions on how to save the euro zone strangely forget the defects in its creation, glide over the lessons to be drawn from policies pursued during the past decade, and defend the virtue of maintaining its present membership. But the problems of Europe run much deeper than the survival or collapse of the monetary union. Even if we assume that the problems of confidence the member states have in each other's behaviour are restored and the rest of the world regains confidence in the institutions of the monetary union, the fundamental problems will remain unsolved. A clue to the real long-term problems may be found in the answer to a rather simple question. It runs as follows: Why is the large majority of European countries indebted to such an extent that any further increase in debt to GDP ratio generates panic reactions among potential lenders?","Tischner European Univ, PL-31033 Krakow, Poland",,"Winiecki, J (通讯作者)，Tischner European Univ, Ul Westerplatte 11, PL-31033 Krakow, Poland.",winiecki@neostrada.pl,,,,,,,13,1,1,1,19,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Evidence from transcripts of village parliaments in south India,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Deliberation; Inequality; Democracy; Local government; India,UNANIMOUS JURY VERDICTS; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; DEFENSE,"The role of deliberation among citizens to determine and forge agreement on policy is often seen as a crucial feature of democratic government. This paper provides the first large-N empirical evidence on the credibility of voice in a deliberative democracy in an non-laboratory setting, using a unique dataset collected from transcripts of deliberation that occurred between January and September 2003 in 127 functioning village parliaments (gram sabhas) in Southern India. We exploit a natural experiment in the arrangement of India's state borders across ethnolinguistic lines that led exogenously to increased caste fragmentation and a reduced degree of consensus on public goods priorities. We then examine the patterns of deliberation. We reject the presence of pure cheap talk in both heterogeneous and homogeneous villages. Instead, we show that in caste-fragmented South Indian villages, where there is less village-wide agreement on the relative importance of different public goods, the probability of an individual's highest priority being discussed increases as the household becomes more credible: its preferences approach the pivotal agent in a pure representative democracy, the median household. These effects are lower in ethnically homogeneous villages where there is greater consensus on the prioritization of public goods. Taken together, our results suggest that India's village parliaments, rather than being mere talking shops or being entirely captured by elites, seem instead to be both democratically representative and to be assigning roles to credible agents in their deliberative processes.

We develop a simple model with two regions where the cost of an appliance in one region depends upon the level of energy efficiency in that region and the level of R&D activities by the appliance industry. In our model, the cooperative outcome can be decentralized by imposing a tax on energy. However, we show that when regions do not cooperate, they have an incentive to adopt additional instruments to increase energy efficiency. The reason is that the lack of cooperation leads to under-taxation of the environmental externality which in turn creates an incentive to try to reduce emissions produced abroad.

When the new technology is also subject to access provision, we find that migration from the old to the new generation network at the wholesale level can be incentivized if a positive correlation between the access prices (to the two old and new generation networks) is maintained.

Although little empirical evidence has been generated yet with respect to carbon footprint labels, much can be learned from our experience with similar product labels. We first review the theory and evidence on the role of product labeling in affecting consumer and firm behavior. Next, we consider the role of governments and nongovernmental organizations, concluding that international, multistakeholder organizations have a critical part to play in setting protocols and standards. We argue that it is important to consider the entire life cycle of a product being labeled and develop an international standard for measurement and reporting. Finally, we examine the potential impact of carbon product labeling, discussing methodological and trade challenges and proposing a framework for choosing products best suited for labeling.

Assuming that agents' partitions are independently distributed, we prove that the asymptotic probability of nontrivial common knowledge undergoes a phase transition.

Employing a factor model coupled with a dataset of high-frequency portfolio capital flows to 50 economies, the paper finds that common shocks - key crisis events as well as changes to global liquidity and risk - have exerted a large effect on capital flows both in the crisis and in the recovery. However, these effects have been highly heterogeneous across countries, with a large part of this heterogeneity being explained by differences in the quality of domestic institutions, country risk and the strength of domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. Comparing and quantifying these effects show that common factors (push factors) were overall the main drivers of capital flows during the crisis, while country-specific determinants (pull factors) have been dominant in accounting for the dynamics of global capital flows in 2009 and 2010, in particular for emerging markets.

Additionally, a multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) model is applied to explore volatility interactions between the three markets involved in the study. Our findings reveal that Brent crude oil and Zeebrugge natural gas forward prices play a prominent role in the Spanish electricity price formation process. Furthermore, causation, both in price and volatility, runs from Brent crude oil and natural gas forward markets to the Spanish electricity forward market. These results are of practical importance for both the wholesale and retail markets' participants as well as the regulator through the established link between the forward contracts' price and the Spanish tariff of last resort paid by more than 23 million of customers.

In contrast to approaches relying on political budget cycles or partisan theory, we find strong and theory-consistent evidence that prime ministers tend to favour fiscal policies supporting the social class in which they are socialised.

We assume in this exercise that the renminbi will have largely achieved capital account convertibility by the end of the current decade, a timetable consistent with recent proposals by the People's Bank of China. Our analysis shows that if the capital account were liberalized, China's gross international investment position would grow significantly, and inflows and outflows would become much more balanced. The private sector would turn its net liability position into a balanced position, and the official sector would reduce its net asset position significantly, relative to the country's GDP. Because of the increasing importance of private sector foreign claims and the decreasing importance of official foreign reserves, China would be able to earn higher net investment income from abroad. Overall, China would continue to be a net creditor, with the net foreign asset position as a share of GDP remaining largely stable through this decade. These findings suggest that the renminbi real exchange rate would not be particularly sensitive to capital account liberalization as capital flows are expected to be two-sided. The renminbi real exchange rate would likely be on a path of moderate appreciation as China is expected to maintain a sizeable growth differential with its trading partners.","[Cheung, Lillian; Zhang, Wenlang; Wu, Tommy] Hong Kong Monetary Author, Res Dept, Econ Res Div, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),"Zhang, WL (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Monetary Author, Res Dept, Econ Res Div, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dhe@hkma.gov.hk; lcheung@hkma.gov.hk; wzhang@hkma.gov.hk; ttowu@hkma.gov.hk,,,,,,,35,16,18,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2012,20.0,6,,,,,29,54,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.12001.x,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,051RZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312146300002,0

This paper examines the income elasticities for the categories of goods to be consistent with the theoretical implications, using the trade flows between China and Korea over the sample period of 1991-2008. The new trade theory implies that the inclusion of new variety terms reduces the magnitude of income elasticities, disaggregation of trade flows yields different magnitudes of income elasticity, and income elasticity of differentiated goods is higher than that of homogeneous goods. The empirical findings are consistent with the implication from the new trade theory. However, the asymmetry in income elasticity (Houthakker-Magee finding) is quite durable.

While deeply indebted to Marx's vision of capitalism as a system incessantly in travail, Schumpeter was no 'Marxist'. He shared Bohm's view that profits are not due to 'exploitation', but thought that the latter's attack on Marx was a failure. There are remarkable differences, but also similarities between the analyses of Schumpeter and Keynes. Marx, Schumpeter and Keynes rejected Say's law and other basic ideas constituting the marginalist doctrine.

We argue that trust plays an important role in interpersonal relationships, but in more impersonal dealings, as in economic life, reliable and impartial institutions that create binding rules and ensure their enforcement are more important. These provide a stable framework for exchange and make it safe for people to take risks involving others they do not know directly. Relational trust, however, may be critical in situations in which institutions are weak or corrupt. And, even if economic relationships are constrained by carefully devised contracts, there remains residual uncertainty that can be resolved only by relying on trust.. If networks involving trust relationships are the dominant means for engaging in exchange, however, exchange is limited to those whom one knows personally or is linked to through close ties, and opportunities for broader exchange are constrained, which may retard the transition to a more open economy.","[Latusek, Dominika] Kozminski Univ, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland; [Cook, Karen S.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Kozminski University; Stanford University,"Latusek, D (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Ul Jagiellonska 59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,47,27,32,0,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2012,65.0,4,,,,,512,525,,10.1111/kykl.12004,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,026AT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310241200005,0

The competence of a government is measured by its ability to do a lot with only a little money. Voters receive, through observing the level of public output, only a noisy signal of government's quality so that the lobby groups, which are better informed, may transmit to them more precise information about it. We show that when unions are unbiased, i.e. have no hostility against or sympathy for the incumbent government, strikes may occur only when the government is bad. Consequently, a strike in this case acts as a clear, though costly, signal (to the public) of an incompetent government. When some or all unions or lobby groups are biased against the incumbent government, we show that the possibility of strikes may distort the budget allocation away from the efficient one. Bad governments have a tendency to favor their political enemies while good governments favor their political enemies only when they are not overly biased. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Limited commitment reduces the proportion of assets that can be used as collateral, and thus banks with high liquidity demands face borrowing constraints in interbank markets. These constraints can be relieved by the central bank (a lender of last resort) through the provision of liquidity loans. I show that the constrained-efficient allocation can be decentralized by controlling only the money growth rate if commitment to interbank contracts is not limited. Otherwise, a proper combination of central bank loans and monetary policy is needed to bring the market equilibrium into a state of constrained efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In order to explore the essence of this effect, I build a model with working capital under which foreign currency is substituted with the less liquid components of domestic money. The framework closely mimics the actual pattern of currency substitution across varying rates of inflation and enables the study of an additional channel that works through the impact of currency substitution on interest rates. It is found that there is a threshold inflation rate, which turns out to be 44% under baseline calibration, below which currency substitution decreases welfare and vice versa. A practical implication is that, at inflation rates lower (greater) than the threshold, the potential welfare gains from disinflation to a near-zero inflation rate are higher (lower) if there is currency substitution than otherwise.

The existing literature can provide several theories, hypotheses and concepts that could potentially help to explain those differences; the outcome of those approaches is the extrapolation of various demand and supply side factors that affect cross-country differences in the size of the sector. The exploratory approach taken in the paper is focused on combining the effect of those factors for the purpose of their empirical verification.

Capital markets are completely integrated if assets of equal risk have identical expected returns, irrespective of the location of the capital market. Therefore the risk that the investor agrees to take in the integrated international,market is the result of common factors and it is not possible to diversify the risk. The degree of financial integration of capital markets can be determined by analyzing the movement of market indices. In this paper the multivariate VAR(5) econometric models were set up and tested in order to analyze the multilateral integration of selected capital markets of developed European countries (Britain and Germany) and selected - new EU member states (Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Hungary). Input data of the model are daily stock market indices (FTSE, DAX, BUX, SAX, PX and SBI20) for the time period January 2001 to October 2009. The study was conducted in three stages: In the first stage each series index was tested for the presence of unit roots, in order to determine whether the time series was stationary or not (to do this, ADF and Phillips - Perron tests were used). In the second stage multivariate VAR(5) models were set up, to which the Johansen method for determining cointegration was applied. In the third stage of the research process, the dynamics of the integration of underlying capital markets was determined by calculating the relevant lambda(trace) value and dividing it by the critical lambda value.","Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik,"Svilokos, T (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia.",tonci.svilokos@unidu.hr,"Svilokos, Tonći/JTS-6609-2023","Svilokos, Tonci/0000-0003-4159-7918",,,,,17,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Education quality is inversely related to the degree of congestion in schools, which is itself measured in two ways: the proportions of teachers and students in the population, and the ratio of government spending on education to teaching capacity. The balanced-growth path is derived and the transitional dynamics associated with an increase in the degree of congestion are analysed. The growth-maximizing share of government spending on education is shown to depend negatively on the congestion parameter.

The transfers may be allocated to debt reduction, or to the productivity enhancement of the traded or nontraded sector. The effect of the transfer on aggregate economic performance depends crucially upon: (i) the relative capital intensities of the two productive sectors, and (ii) the allocation of the transfers across the sectors. The consequences for wealth and income inequality depend not only upon these factors, but also upon (iii) the economy's access to the world financial market. Most of the analysis is conducted using simulations, where we characterize the dynamic evolution of both the aggregate economy and the inequality measures. Whether growth and inequality are positively or negatively associated over time depends upon the three factors noted above.","[Bouza, Serpil] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Turnovsky, Stephen J.] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",International Monetary Fund; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Bouza, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",sturn@u.washington.edu,,,,,,,41,5,7,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In this note we move beyond this assumption to obtain a direct measure of imported materials by industry for the United States in 1997. At the 3-digit I-O industry level, there is a correlation of 0.68 between the offshoring shares made with and without the proportionality assumption, and a higher correlation of 0.87 when the shares are value weighted.

We propose an evolutionary model of the diffusion process, focusing on the characteristics of economic agents and on the interactions among them, and relate those determinants with the observed shape of the diffusion curve. Using simulation techniques, we show that the proposed model is able to explain why an innovation may not diffuse globally across an economy/region, even when it faces no rival innovations. Moreover, we show how network size, informational spillovers, and the behavior of innovation prices shape the diffusion process. The results regarding network size and informational spillovers rationalize the importance of informational lock-outs, proving they can influence both the aggregate adoption rate and the speed of the diffusion process. With respect to innovation prices, simulation results show that faster price decline leads to higher aggregate adoption rates, and that the diffusion process is more sensitive to the pricing dynamics than to the network size or the behavior of spillovers.","[Teixeira, Aurora A.

Even as oil prices continue to fluctuate greatly, the impact of oil price changes on transportation firms has heretofore not been adequately examined. This paper fills this gap, documenting important new findings based on analysis of over two decades of daily data on large changes in oil prices (oil price shocks). First, while transportation firm returns are influenced negatively by oil price increases, risks are increased more by oil price declines. Second, firm characteristics are important with the market-to-book ratio being the most important firm characteristic, and ROA, firm size, and the prior run up in prices are also important in influencing oil price related returns, betas, variances, and trading volumes. Third, in the S&P transportation sub-sector, industry concentration is negatively related to returns, oil price risk, and trading volume, and asymmetrically related to returns and market betas. These new findings enhance our understanding of the asset price impact of oil price shocks and should be of much interest to scholars, corporate executives, money managers, regulators, and policy makers.

Using OECD indicators on product market regulations, characterized by persistent fluctuations, and taking into account the non stationary properties of the inflation process, we investigate the empirical relevance of this NKPC for inflation dynamics in the US and France, assuming VAR expectations.

Since the immediate effect on the livestock sector could affect the entire supply chain and US livestock, meat and dairy exports, we measure these impacts using GTAP, a multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the global economy. The immediate shocks to the US livestock, raw milk and other animal products sectors indirectly affect all sectors of the economy, as well as international markets and trade. We decompose these effects due to each component of the initial shocks, and estimate the importance of these shocks to the national food system for the Mid-Atlantic Region using IMPLAN. Our GTAP results indicate that losses to the USA economy would be about $11.7 billion, and with the ripple effect throughout the rest of the world including beneficiary nations (Argentina, Brazil, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand) and losers (Canada, Mexico, European Union) would be 14.1 billion. We estimate the proportion of the domestic impact affecting the Mid-Atlantic Region. Based on a regional input-output model of that region, we estimate that total losses in value added are nearly $800 million; losses in labor income total about $565 million; and there are job losses of just over 12 thousand.

Evidence indicates that the economic and social consequences of these policies have been so disastrous that there is now more poverty and more inequality than a generation ago. The same scenario is being proposed as the alternative to what has hitherto been labeled a social-democratic economic system in industrialized nations. The economically dominant minority has largely succeeded in imposing its neoliberal agenda by convincing the general public, through various means, of the need for austerity. The paper challenges the erroneous theories on which austerity is based and proposes an alternative explanation to what is the 'best practice' in public finance. It argues that deficit spending by the government is an important policy tool that can be successfully used to guarantee full employment and create wealth and prosperity for the whole society.","Laurentian Univ, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada",Laurentian University,"Bougrine, H (通讯作者)，Laurentian Univ, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.",,,,,,,,38,7,7,0,9,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Shifting government resources to public consumption while allocating the aid to either type of public expenditure or as a pure transfer changes the productivity of the private factors in production. Agents respond, as with any government transfer, by adjusting consumption, debt and work effort. Private capital accumulation slows and the welfare effect dominates. The fungibility results maintain for parameterizations that reflect limited substitution in production and where the public capital externality is small. The analysis, which employs extensive numerical simulations, emphasizes the tradeoffs between long-run capital accumulation and welfare that maintain even when aid is fungible. The simulations highlight the complementarity between foreign aid and public expenditure, the tradeoff between welfare and capital accumulation, and that aid cannot replace the government's own commitment to financing public expenditure. The results suggest that a policy in which the government is required to maintain its expenditure commitment to public capital yields the highest level effects to capital accumulation, consumption and output.","Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Montgomery, AL 36124 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University Montgomery; Auburn University,"Byron, S (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Montgomery, AL 36124 USA.",sbyron@aum.edu,,,,,,,75,3,3,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

One of the objectives of the LEADER Program is to improve the governance of rural areas through a bottom-up approach to local development. Are the conditions for carrying it out it in each country's institutional context capable of boosting citizen participation in collective actions and consolidating local democracy? Defined and formulated at the EU level, the Leader approach has been transposed by member states in different ways and incorporated in each country's system of local government in line with political strategies for establishing action areas that differ in their territorial coverage and articulation with institutional units. Empirical research sheds light on how local action groups have been shaped through the formation of partnerships and networks. The positions adopted by a few mayors on the local scene provide evidence of the emergence of a genuine political leadership.","[Chevalier, Pascal] Univ Montpellier 3, ARTDEV, F-34032 Montpellier, France; [Maurel, Marie-Claude] EHESS, Paris, France",Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier,"Chevalier, P (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier 3, ARTDEV, F-34032 Montpellier, France.",pascal.chevalier@univ-montp3.fr; maurel@ehess.fr; Pola@rkk.hu,,,,,,,41,6,6,0,30,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Our results indicate that individual inequality aversion measured by the model of Fehr and Schmidt (Quarterly Journal of Economics 114(3):817-868, 1999) is not generally robust to the way endowments emerge. The inequality aversion model has only low predictive power for individual behaviour.

We examine this fact using Census microdata on plant shipments from the Commodity Flow Survey. We show that the fact is not entirely an international trade phenomenon: part of it can be accounted for by the effect of distance, distinct from any border effect. Export destinations tend to be farther than domestic destinations, and large plants tend to ship farther distances even to domestic locations compared with small plants. We develop an extension of the Melitz (2003) model and use it to set up an analysis with model interpretations of ratios between large plant and small plant shipments that can be calculated with the data. We obtain a decomposition of the overall ratio into a term that varies with distance, holding fixed the border, and a term that varies with the border, holding fixed the distance. The distance term accounts for more than half of the overall difference. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that remittances reduce the incidence of poverty by 31 per cent and depth of poverty by 49 per cent.

If the seller cannot observe the valuation (asymmetric information), bilateral trade is inefficient. This bilateral trading game is embedded into a large matching market. In the steady-state equilibrium of the market game, the relation between the informational regime and efficiency is inverted: With small frictions efficiency obtains if information is asymmetric.

We use panel-data econometrics based on bias corrected dynamic fixed effect analysis (LSDVC) to assess the impact of reforms on macroeconomic and power sector outcomes. The results indicate that power sector reform is highly interdependent with wider reforms in other sectors of the economy. The findings indicate that failure to harmonize inter-sector reforms leads to power sector reform measures being ineffective.

We show that in the case of Sweden this severely underestimates the actual increase in inequality and, in particular, top income shares during recent decades. Using micro panel data to average incomes over longer periods and re-rank individuals according to income excluding capital gains, we show that capital gains indeed are a reoccurring addition to rather than a transitory component in top incomes. Doing the same for lower income groups, however, makes virtually no difference. We also try to find the roots of the recent surge in capital gains-driven inequality in Sweden since the 1980s. While there are no evident changes in terms of who earns these gains (high wage earners vs. top capital income earners), the primary driver instead seems to be the drastic asset price increases on the post-1980 deregulated financial markets.","[Roine, Jesper] Stockholm Sch Econ, SITE, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Waldenstrom, Daniel] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics; Uppsala University,"Roine, J (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, SITE, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",jesper.roine@hhs.se,,"Roine, Jesper/0000-0003-1700-0018",,,,,32,31,34,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

To the best of our knowledge, such a model is novel in the literature. We determine that the investment cost of providing electricity to Sub-Saharan Africa over a 10-year period is between 160 and 215 billion U.S. dollars, depending on assumptions for electricity access and the cross-country electricity trade.

We find that as counterfeiting may occur, sales of the original product could either increase or decrease. The welfare effects of government enforcement are shown as follows. First, a strict enforcement on counterfeiting by government may either increase or decrease welfare. Second, when counterfeiting emerges, welfare under a stricter enforcement is not necessarily larger than that without enforcement.

Domestic firms face a fringe comprised of foreign firms who import their products into the domestic market. In the eyes of domestic consumers, these imports are viewed as imperfect substitutes in demand to the output produced by the domestic firms. The model is solved in terms of the 'critical' import supply elasticity that can then be used evaluate the ability of imports to constrain an anticompetitive price increase post-merger.

This paper uses large multi-country datasets on educational scores - namely PISA and TIMSS - to examine the factors associated with educational outcomes. In particular, it distinguishes between individual and family background factors and those emanating from the school or institutional environment. Using pooled data as well as cross sectional evidence we look at the variation across countries before looking at within country variation in Russia. We find that both in the benchmark cross-country estimates, as also those using just Russia data, a number of individual and family variables are robustly associated with better educational outcomes. Institutional variables also matter - notably student-teacher ratios and indicators of school autonomy - but there are also some clear particularities in the Russian case.

Estimation is performed under the null hypothesis of constant asymmetry of the innovations and, in a second step, tests for conditional asymmetry are performed on generalized residuals through parametric and non-parametric methods. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the tests that incorporates the uncertainty of the estimated parameters. A Monte Carlo study shows that neglecting this uncertainty severely biases the tests.

We show that when both firms codetermine employment together with decentralised employees' representatives, a rise in wages acts as an economic (de)stabiliser when the wage is fairly (high) low, while under profit maximisation a rise in wages always acts as a stabilising device because the parametric stability region monotonically increases with the wage in such a case. Moreover, a rise in the union's bargaining power has a destabilising effect, except when the wage is low and the firm power is already high. Therefore, under codetermination a change either in the wage or firm power in the Nash bargaining plays an ambiguous role on stability. We also show with numerical simulations that complex dynamics can also occur. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is conducted within a Generalized Leontief cost function framework, and employs pooled data across eight countries over the time period 1978-2004. We present short-run own- and cross-price elasticities of fossil fuel demand, and assess the impacts of a set of government policies implemented over this time period. The empirical results show evidence of notable short-run interfuel substitution between oil and gas, and particularly in countries where fossil fuels are used extensively for both base and peak load purposes. These findings support the notion that ex post fossil fuel substitution takes place in dual- and multi-fired plants, by switching load between different single-fuel fired plants, as well as through the conversion of power plants to be able to burn alternate fuels. The results also illustrate that different public policies - i.e., removal of coal subsidies, electricity market liberalization etc. - have had profound impacts on fossil fuel choices and have in particular favored power generation gas use at the expense of coal. Finally, the paper makes use of the empirical results to simulate the fuel switching impacts of different carbon prices within the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A characteristic of the Nordic Power market is the large variety of production technologies, of which hydro and nuclear power are capacity constrained. We analyze the impact of RIP on: the need for total, peak and midmerit capacities; total demand; prices; peak demand hours; and economic welfare. We have also studied whether the results of RIP are sensitive to the simultaneous implementation of tradable emission permits. We find that RIP diminishes the need for total capacity even with inelastic demand. Our results show that even with modest assumptions related to RIP participation, the annual midmerit and peaker capacity efficiency savings amount to 97 million Euros, which are around 6% of their total annual investment costs. The price of the peak demand hour clearly diminishes as the share of the RIP customers increases or demand becomes more price elastic. We compare RTP and tradable emission permits as two separate instruments in reaching energy use efficiencies and show how these two instruments must be seen as complementary and not as substitutable instruments. We show how RIP and tradable emission permits have a positive correlation in promoting market access of renewable energy sources. We End that welfare effects of the implementation of RTP are positive. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Estimated effects of policies are compared using two models, one with hyperbolic preferences and one with standard exponential preferences. Sophisticated hyperbolic discounters may accumulate substantial amounts of wealth for retirement. We find it is frequently difficult to distinguish empirically between models with the two types of preferences on the basis of asset accumulation paths or consumption paths around the period of retirement. Simulations suggest that, despite the much higher initial time preference rate, individuals with hyperbolic preferences may actually value a real annuity more than individuals with exponential preferences who have accumulated roughly equal amounts of assets. This appears to be especially true for individuals with relatively high time preference rates or who have low assets for whatever reason. This affects the tradeoff between current benefits and future benefits on which many of the retirement incentives of the Social Security system rest. Simulations involving increasing the early entitlement age and increasing the delayed retirement credit do not show a great deal of difference whether exponential or hyperbolic preferences are used, but simulations for eliminating the earnings test show a non-trivially greater effect when exponential preferences are used.

When unemployment benefits are the only available tool, the insurance agency is not able to induce older workers to search for a job. This is because of the short time-horizon of workers close to retirement. We propose to introduce a pension tax dependent on the length of the unemployment spell. We show that this device performs better than a wage tax after re-employment. First, it makes jobs more attractive, as they are free of tax. Second, because re-employment will be short-lived, a pension tax is a more powerful incentive than a wage tax, and provides more substantial fiscal gains to the agency. Finally, a pension tax allows those workers near retirement who still do not exercise job search to smooth their consumption during their unemployment spell, as if they could borrow against their future pension.

The study was performed on the basis of a questionnaire which was distributed to the management of Slovene firms in 2007, analyzing the use of performance measurement techniques in the post-transition period. Slovene companies mainly use traditional performance measurement techniques. Contemporary performance measurement systems were used only occasionally. Moreover, the study demonstrates that performance measurement techniques differ between companies of different size. Small companies have less developed performance measurement systems that are based almost solely on traditional measurement techniques, while large companies have more developed performance measurement systems and also use some more contemporary techniques. Future research should analyze the design of management accounting systems in economies that have completed the transition period to provide evidence about the changes that occur afterwards.","[Odar, Marjan; Kavcic, Slavka] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Jerman, Mateja] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper 6104, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Primorska,"Odar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",marjan.odar@ef.uni-lj.si; slavka.kavcic@ef.uni-lj.si; mateja.jerman@fm-kp.si,,,,,,,27,6,7,0,19,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This paper assesses the sensitivity of poverty and inequality estimates to the multiple imputation of coarse earnings data and reported zero values using the 2001-2006 South African Labour Force Surveys. Estimates of poverty amongst the employed are shown not to be sensitive to multiple imputation of missing and interval-censored data, but are sensitive to the treatment of workers reporting zero earnings. Poverty trends are generally robust to the choice of method, and a significant decline in poverty is evident. Inequality estimates, on the other hand, appear more sensitive to the treatment of zero values and the choice of imputation methods, and, overall, no particular trends in inequality could be discerned.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Econ & Finance, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Vermaak, C (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Econ & Finance, Westville Campus,Pvt Bag X54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.",vermaakc@ukzn.ac.za,"Vermaak, Claire/ACC-2926-2022","Vermaak, Claire/0000-0001-6355-3321",,,,,37,6,7,0,7,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Unfortunately, it can be difficult to persuade institutional stakeholders that the change is necessary, and as a result, efforts at institutional change often fail. To avoid situations in which change is sudden and disruptive, China has chosen a more cautious approach of gradual institutional change leading to smooth reform, which Deng Xiaoping referred to as crossing the river by stepping from stone to stone - a metaphor that translates into doing a careful experiment before broad application of an approach for which you lack prior experience. This approach allows adaptation to local conditions during subsequent broader adoption of a new approach, and can thereby decrease the risks and costs of adopting a new strategy by first testing the change and then demonstrating the potential benefits to local residents and governments. This innovative approach has been a key component of China's economic reforms since 1978, and the Chinese experience shows how adapting programs to local natural and social conditions can help to motivate change and sustain the implementation of new institutions.

A capital poor median voter chooses to use redistributive capital taxes to provide public goods. The expectation of high capital taxes, however, results in a small capital stock which lowers returns to redistribution. The median voter therefore wants to commit to a lower level of capital taxes. She does so by setting a partial degree of decentralization in the Constitution. The equilibrium degree of decentralization balances the positive effect of tax competition on capital taxes with the loss in redistribution that results. We show that the degree of decentralization is nonmonotonic in inequality, increasing in the redistributive efficiency of public good provision, and decreasing in capital productivity. When public goods are heterogeneous in their capacity to transfer funds, all voters agree that goods with high redistributive capacity should be decentralized.","[Hatfield, John William] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Padro i Miquel, Gerard] London Sch Econ, London, England",Stanford University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hatfield, JW (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hatfield@stanford.edu; g.padro@lse.ac.uk,"Hatfield, John/HPF-4272-2023","Hatfield, John/0000-0002-3339-5059",,,,,45,29,29,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

This paper focuses on cross-country heterogeneity in access to international financial markets that derives from the presence of capital controls and argues that the process of capital liberalization over the past decades can explain a substantial fraction of US net external liabilities. We present a simple two-country model with an internationally traded bond, in which capital controls are reflected in the presence of borrowing and lending constraints on that bond. In a US versus the rest of the world (RoW) scenario, we perform experiments that are largely consistent with countries' liberalization experiences. A reduction in the RoW's controls on capital outflows and/or a tightening in the RoW's borrowing constraint enable the US economy to better insure against consumption risk relative to the rest of the world, and therefore decrease its motives for precautionary asset holdings relative to the rest of the world. As a result of these asymmetric shifts in countries' barriers to capital mobility, the US runs a long run external deficit. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper emerges from the failure of the traditional models of hyperinflation with perfect foresight. Insights from two standard optimizing monetary settings and economic reasoning from case studies of extreme hyperinflation episodes provide relevant requirements for the specification of the demand for money during hyperinflation. The paper demonstrates that the possibility of perfect foresight monetary hyperinflation paths depends robustly on the essentiality of money. The essentiality of money provides some depth of explanation of the reasons why the popular semi-log schedule of the demand for money is not appropriate for analysing monetary hyperinflation with perfect foresight. The paper proposes a simple test of money essentiality for the appropriate specification of the demand-for-money equation in empirical studies of hyperinflation.,,,"Sokic, A (通讯作者)，Pole Univ Leonard de Vinci, ESCE, F-92916 Paris, France.",alexandre.sokic@esce.fr,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Judging by the ensuing movements in commercial bank interest rates and private sector credit, monetary policy transmission appears to be weak. This is confirmed by an empirical examination of interest rate pass-through and credit growth. Weak credit demand and under-developed financial markets seem to have limited the effectiveness of monetary policy, but the inflexibility of exchange rates and rising real interest rates have also served to frustrate the central banks' efforts despite a supporting fiscal policy. While highlighting the importance of developing domestic financial markets in the long run, this experience also points to the need to coordinate macroeconomic policies and to use all macroeconomic tools available in conducting countercyclical policies, including exchange rate flexibility.","[Wang, Shengzu; Dunn, Jonathan; Wu, Yiqun] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,,,"wu, yi/JEP-1581-2023",,,,,,28,3,3,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Although they have been pursued quite independently by different communities of researchers, empirical evidence points to very similar underlying causal mechanisms. In particular, in both cases per capita income seems to play a major role only up to a very low threshold, beyond which relative income and other relational factors become crucial for happiness and health. On the basis of these structural analogies, we argue that a process of cross-fertilisation between these two research streams would contribute to their development by clarifying the relationship between happiness, health and their determinants. Finally, we observe that the two literatures have converging policy implications: measures meant to reduce poverty and inequality and invest in social and environmental capital may improve both health and happiness of the individuals.","[Borghesi, Simone; Vercelli, Alessandro] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Borghesi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",,"Borghesi, Simone/B-7143-2012","BORGHESI, SIMONE/0000-0002-7419-1212",,,,,148,24,26,11,85,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The inclusion of durables greatly improves the explanatory power of the weak credibility hypothesis. The hypothesis can account for the main qualitative properties of the boom-bust cycle provided the elasticity of durables expenditure with respect to Tobin's q is greater than the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Moreover, the quantitative effects are very large. In numerical simulations based on conservative assumptions about the expenditure share of durables (20%) and wealth effects (none), aggregate consumption increases 17-22% and the real exchange rate appreciates 24-26% when the crawl decreases from 100% to zero for 3 years. In variants of the model that incorporate supply effects, the consumption boom is equally strong but appreciation of the real exchange rate rises to 30-40%. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

We investigate the behavior of an agent with limited willpower who optimally consumes over time an endowment of a tempting and storable consumption good or cake. We assume that restraining consumption below the most tempting feasible rate requires willpower. Any willpower not used to regulate consumption may be valuable in controlling other urges. Willpower thus links otherwise unrelated behaviors requiring self-control. An agent with limited willpower will display apparent domain-specific time preference. Such an agent will almost never perfectly smooth his consumption, even when it is feasible to do so. Whether the agent relaxes control of his consumption over time as experimental psychologists predict or tightens it as most behavioral theories predict depends in our model on the net effect of two analytically distinct but opposing forces.","[Ozdenoren, Emre] London Business Sch, London, England; [Salant, Stephen W.; Silverman, Dan] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of London; London Business School; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Ozdenoren, E (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.",eozdenoren@london.edu; ssalant@umich.edu; dansilv@umich.edu,"Ozdenoren, Emre/HTS-7576-2023; Salant, Stephen/L-8398-2016","Salant, Stephen/0000-0001-5407-4572",,,,,23,36,47,0,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The complex of interrelated issues regarding integrated assessment of economic sectors is discussed in the paper. The object of research is financial indicators of different Lithuanian economic sectors. The proposed procedure for multi-criteria comparison of economic sectors encompasses: 1) the indicator system, 2) application of fuzzy MCDM methods, and 3) inter-sectoral comparison based on ranks provided by fuzzy MCDM methods. The research covers period of 2007-2010, starting at the very beginning of the economic recession and, hopefully, ending with the upcoming recovery. The application of the three MCDM methods was successful. The results suggested the best performing sector being that of forestry and logging. Furthermore, enterprises operating in trade sector, hospitality sector, mining and quarrying sector, information sector, or manufacturing sector can be considered as working more efficiently than an average Lithuanian enterprise. At the other end of spectrum, construction, real estate, and transportation sectors were those severely damaged by the economic crisis: they were ranked below the average alternative. Meanwhile, relatively low positions of utilities sectors may be caused by their specifics. Finally, the transport sector can be considered as the typical victim of economic downturn.","[Balezentis, Tomas] Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Balezentis, Alvydas] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Dept Strateg Management, LT-10101 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Misiunas, Algimantas] Vilnius Univ, Dept Quantitat Methods & Modelling, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Mykolas Romeris University; Vilnius University,"Balezentis, T (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Sauletekio Al 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",a.balezentis@gmail.com; t.balezentis@gmail.com; a.misiunas@gmail.com,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711",,,,,87,72,74,0,36,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This paper presents a framework to decompose the moments of unemployment and study the respective contributions of vacancy posting, a measure of firms' hiring efforts, and separation. Separation accounts for about 40% of unemployment's variance, compared to 60% for vacancy posting, and contributes to about 60% of unemployment steepness asymmetry, the fact that unemployment increases faster than it decreases. Further, while vacancy posting is, on average, the most important contributor of unemployment fluctuations, the opposite is true around business cycle turning points, when separation is responsible for most of unemployment movements.

Using highly disaggregated export data for four North African countries (Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia) over the 19952008 period, we estimate the impact of the EuroMed agreements on both trade margins, thus providing empirical evidence about the validity of theoretical predictions.

To address these questions, we develop two empirical entry models. In the benchmark coordinated entry model, the upstream firm sets market-specific wholesale prices and implements the first best. In the more realistic restricted/free entry model, the upstream firm only sets a uniform wholesale price. As a second-best solution, it restricts entry in markets where business stealing (encroachment) is high, and allows free entry elsewhere. We apply the model to magazine distribution, and assess the profitability of alternative vertical restraints. Banning restricted licensing reduces profits only slightly, so the business rationale for restricted licensing should not be sought in the prevention of encroachment. Furthermore, market-specific wholesale prices implement the first best, but the profit increase would be small, providing a rationale for the commonly observed uniform wholesale prices. Finally, uniform franchise fees are much less effective than a uniform wholesale price to cope with local market differences.","[Verboven, Frank] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium; [Verboven, Frank] CEPR London, London, England",KU Leuven; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,,stijn.ferrari@nbb.be; frank.verboven@econ.kuleuven.be,"Verboven, Frank/GLV-3358-2022","Verboven, Frank/0000-0002-5686-3820",,,,,33,14,16,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0741-6261,,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Using data for 16 OECD countries over 135 years we examine whether the outputcapital ratio reverts to a constant in the long run using univariate and panel stationarity tests with structural breaks. Univariate stationarity tests with one break provide more evidence of trend reversion than mean reversion. However, in stationarity tests with two breaks and with up to five breaks, the results are largely independent of the inclusion of a trend. When we allow for up to five breaks in the intercept we find that for 12 of the 16 countries, the outputcapital ratio is mean reverting and when we allow for up to five breaks in the intercept for 11 of the 16 countries, the outputcapital ratio is trend reverting. We also find that for the panel as a whole the outputcapital ratio is mean reverting and trend reverting when we allow for up to five breaks.","[Madsen, Jakob B.; Mishra, Vinod; Smyth, Russell] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Madsen, JB (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",,"Smyth, Russell/AAE-1492-2019; Mishra, Vinod/D-1221-2011","Smyth, Russell/0000-0001-6593-5462; Madsen, Jakob/0000-0002-4952-3043; Mishra, Vinod/0000-0002-4686-5195",,,,,28,7,7,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Yet little is known about the important topic of whether parental divorce has deleterious consequences upon adult children. By combining experimental and econometric survey-based evidence, this study attempts to provide an answer. Under controlled conditions, it measures university students' subjective well-being and productivity (in a standardized laboratory task). It finds no evidence that either of these is negatively associated with recent parental divorce. If anything, happiness and productivity appear to be slightly greater, particularly among males, if their parents have divorced. Using longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey-to control for so-called fixed effects-we then cross-check this result, and confirm the same finding, on various random samples of young British adults.","[Proto, Eugenio; Sgroi, Daniel; Oswald, Andrew J.] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Proto, E (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",e.proto@warwick.ac.uk,"Oswald, Andrew/AAT-9888-2021; Sgroi, Daniel/D-3449-2012","Sgroi, Daniel/0000-0001-9575-2640; Proto, Eugenio/0000-0001-7766-6503",ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,22,3,5,2,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

It is wonderful to see how this baby, which I, along with Carl Shapiro and Timothy Taylor, nurtured through its formative years-from 1984 (three years before the first issue in 1987) until I left in 1993-has grown up and become an established part of the economics profession. In founding the journal, we had many objectives, hopes, and ambitions. We were concerned about the increasing specialization within the economics profession. We sought to have complex and sometimes arcane or highly mathematical ideas translated into plain English, or at least that dialect of the language known as Economese-and in a way that was not only informative but engaging. We were worried too about a growing distance between economics and policy. At least a portion of economic research should be related to ideas that were, or should or would be, part of the national and global policy debates. We began with an explicit commitment to present a diversity of viewpoints, hence the word perspectives in the title. One of the goals we set out for ourselves was to disseminate developments within economics more rapidly. We never shied away from controversy at the journal, but we tried to ensure that the discussion was balanced.","Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Stiglitz, JE (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,0,6,7,0,21,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We derive optimal sales strategies and analyze welfare effects with and without commitment. Under commitment, strategies do not depend on the rival's realized sales. In this case, there is a unique Nash equilibrium for any allocation of initial supplies and prices increase over time. Absent commitment, sellers can adjust their supply decision after the first period. In this case, a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium does not always exist and prices may decline over time. A more asymmetric allocation of stocks generally leads to higher first-period prices, whereas the impact on second-period prices is ambiguous. The larger firm typically prefers not to commit, whereas the smaller firm is better off under commitment. Commitment generates a higher total surplus and (almost always) a higher consumer surplus. Our findings thus suggest that market transparency or flexible supply contracts can adversely affect welfare in situations where production precedes sales and firms face an intertemporal capacity constraint.

In particular, it concentrates on democratic exporters and estimates a gravity-type panel tobit for the years 19752004. Results suggest that the exporter's chief executive, being right-wing, has a positive and significant impact on MCW exports. This may reflect a general right-wing tendency to support national industry and deregulate heavy industry exports.

To guide and structure the review, an analytical framework is developed and applied. The framework integrates transaction costs into the analysis of pollution problems and policies to overcome them. Moreover, it understands a pollution externality not only as a market failure but more generally as the failure of private governance structures. Based on this insight, two rationales for using a policy mix are identified. First, a policy mix may help to correct for multiple reinforcing failures of private governance structures, such as pollution externalities and technological spillovers. Second, a policy mix can be employed if the implementation of single first-best policies brings about high transaction costs, e.g. when marginal pollution damages are heterogeneous or polluters are unlikely to comply with the policy. For each rationale, the relevant literature is presented.

We use a new database including both political and land supply data for more than 2,000 Spanish municipalities for the period 2003-2007. In Spain, land use policies are largely a local responsibility, with municipalities needing periodically to pass comprehensive land use plans. The main policy variable in these plans, and the one analyzed here, is the amount of land classified for potential development. We measure local political competition as the margin of victory of the incumbent government. This variable is, however, potentially endogenous, since not only do votes affect policy, but also policy is expected to affect votes. To deal with this problem, we instrument this variable using the votes at the first national legislative elections following the re-establishment of democracy and votes actually obtained regionally at the same type of election. The results indicate that stiffer political competition does indeed reduce the amount of new land designated for development. This effect is found to be most marked in suburbs, in towns with a high percentage of commuters and homeowners, and in municipalities governed by the left. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our results indicate that the unemployed experience a higher degree of income poverty and costs in terms of people's reduced likelihood of being able to access medical or dental treatment and their being able to afford a week's holiday in both countries.

This article examines the effects of foreign competition on racial wages of union and nonunion workers utilizing an empirical model which allows for cluster-adjusted SEs by industry. Such a procedure allows independence of observations across industries but not within industries, thereby not overstating the significance of industry invariant controls. In this analysis, clustered SEs prevent the overstatement of the significance of imports as a means to reduce earnings discrimination. We find evidence of a wage premium for nonunion white workers in concentrated industries; however, imports cause the wages of nonunion whites to converge towards market rates. In contrast, for union workers in concentrated industries, wage standardization provides a sanctuary from market power initiated discrimination such that imports play a limited role in reducing discrimination.","[Agesa, Jacqueline; Agesa, Richard U.] Marshall Univ, Div Finance & Econ, Huntington, WV 25755 USA",Marshall University,"Agesa, J (通讯作者)，Marshall Univ, Div Finance & Econ, 1 John Marshall Dr, Huntington, WV 25755 USA.",agesaj@marshall.edu,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We start from a statistical equilibrium model that leads to a stationary Subbotin density in the presence of complex interactions among competitive heterogeneous firms. To investigate the dynamics of firm profitability, we construct a diffusion process that has the Subbotin distribution as its stationary probability density. This leads to a phenomenologically inspired interpretation of variations in the shape parameter of the Subbotin distribution, which essentially measures the competitive pressure in and across industries. Our findings have profound implications both for the previous literature on the 'persistence of profits' as well as for understanding competition as a dynamic process. Our main formal finding is that firms' idiosyncratic efforts and the tendency for competition to equalize profit rates are two sides of the same coin, and that a ratio of these two effects ultimately determines the dispersion of the equilibrium distribution.

The improvement efforts of young republic and resulting business entities were off from sufficient academic interest and research. Although the topic was examined to a certain point by the economists, it was not discussed by business economic researchers. The research on Turkish business entities are not historical and center mostly on the holdings which were established in the recent decades and have an increasing effects today. This study, by focusing on Turkish industry and Maadin Bank established during the early years of Turkish Republic as a case study, aims to explain and evaluate the financial policies implemented in the establishment period of the new Republic. Considering the establishment conditions, its organizational structure and vision, it is clear that Maadin, instead of being a bank, had many features of a business entity in fact. This finding, generally, is important to put forward the underlying reasons behind the relative economic success of the new Republic in the paw of equity capital shortages, economic depressions and recessions, and to put forward the first discussions of the holdings processes in Turkey.","[Ozkaleli, Ferit Murat] Trakya Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Edirne, Turkey; [Katircioglu, Salih Turan] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, No Cyprus, Turkey",Trakya University; Eastern Mediterranean University,,,"Katircioglu, Salih T./H-3494-2016; Ozkaleli, Ferit/ABF-5019-2020",,,,,,42,0,0,0,5,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

Americans downsize housing much more than the British largely because Americans are much more mobile. The principal reasons for greater mobility among older Americans are twofold: (1) greater spatial distribution of geographic distribution of amenities (such as warm weather) and housing costs; (2) greater institutional rigidities in subsidized British rental housing providing stronger incentives for British renters not to move.

This paper explores a unique household survey designed and conducted to answer this research question. We analyze the case of Cape Verde, a country with allegedly the highest 'brain drain' in Africa, despite a marked record of income and human capital growth in recent decades. We propose the first explicit test of 'brain drain' arguments, according to which the prospects of own future migration can positively impact educational attainment. Our most conservative estimates using individual specific variation in economic conditions at the destination indicate that a 10 pp increase in the probability of own future migration improves the probability of completing intermediate secondary schooling by nearly 4 pp for individuals who do not migrate before age 16. These findings are robust to the choice of instruments and econometric specification. Counterfactual simulations point to significant human capital gains from lowering migration barriers.

To test this prediction, I use new data on political refugees resettled in the U.S. and exploit the fact that these refugees are distributed across cities by a resettlement agency, precluding individuals from sorting. The results indicate that an increase in the number of social network members resettled in the same year or one year prior to a new arrival leads to a deterioration of outcomes, while a greater number of tenured network members improves the probability of employment and raises the hourly wage.","Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Beaman, LA (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,31,180,238,3,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Using data for Austrian municipalities, we examine differential pre- and post-1990 wage and employment growth rates between regions bordering the formerly communist economies and interior regions. If the 'border regions' are defined narrowly, within a band of less than 50 km, we can identify statistically significant liberalization effects on both employment and wages. While wages responded earlier than employment, the employment effect over the entire adjustment period is estimated to be around three times as large as the wage effect.

The case of banking system liquidity surplus is analysed focusing on creation of liquidity through FX intervention in a regime of fixed or managed exchange rates. In addition the article focuses on the main sources of liquidity absorption in the long run and on stability of monetary base backing by net foreign assets of the central bank in the context of trend appreciation of the domestic currency typical for transition economies. Last but not least, the article examines the speed of FX reserves decline in emerging FX markets and the implications of the exchange rate regime for both exchange rate volatility and foreign exchange market structure. The problems are analysed and compared using the examples of the Czech Republic (CR), Poland and Hungary in 1999-2009. The analysis focuses on the main differences in exchange rate policies, the level of liquidity surplus, cost of sterilisation, main sources of liquidity absorption and volatility of exchange rates. We find that absorption is influenced by the volume of excess liquidity and cost of sterilisation, which reflect the level of the main policy rate. The trend growth of currency in circulation is a key source of liquidity absorption in all central banks. Decline of FX reserves is a limited source of absorption owing to the lower liquidity of FX markets in the CR, Poland and Hungary. It is not possible to confirm a hypothesis of higher exchange rate volatility under floating regimes in CR and Poland as the Hungarian forint in a fixed rate regime suffers from higher volatility due to macroeconomic instability. Trend appreciation causes a decrease in the backing of the monetary base by net foreign assets but still both currency in circulation and banks' reserves are fully backed by net foreign assets of central banks.","[Bruna, Karel; Durcakova, Jaroslava] Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bruna, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",bruna@vse.cz,"Bruna, Karel/AAD-9178-2020","Bruna, Karel/0000-0003-3690-1364",,,,,24,4,5,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24.0,2,,,,,257,275,,10.1080/14631377.2012.675159,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,944CD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304175100006,0

The relevance and timeliness of analysis of the concept of export competitiveness proves the fact that competition is a very important precondition, which affects the effectiveness of development of national economy under the conditions of globalization. The research of the concept of export competitiveness and the ways of improving competitiveness of national economy are especially relevant for the countries in the period of recovering from the outcomes of economic crisis of 2008 - 2009. In the European Union, the worst influence of economics recession was brought on Baltic States - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia economies. One of the most important factors, which could stimulate the development of national economy, is export. Its development is especially essential for small countries, which are too small to consume all the production made by these countries. Higher export competitiveness could help the country to overcome after-effects of economic recession and stimulate the development of the total national economy. Export is often associated with competitiveness of the country at the international level. While the academic understanding of international competitiveness of the country is still forming, the factors of international competitiveness are still being identified in scientific literature, export competitiveness can be measured in different ways: by analyzing one or several factors of the country's export, creating composite indices, analyzing factors and conditions which stimulate the international trade, etc. As every method has its advantages and disadvantages, the scientists seek to find the most reliable, methodologically justified, understandable, convenient to practical use and objective method, which could be accepted generally and widely used in strategic planning on improving competitiveness of the national export and total national economy. But why the measurement of export competitiveness is so important? The answer to this question is related to the fact, that if competitiveness can not be measured, it can not be improved. As Baltic States and other countries compete directly among each other for the export markets, the identification of the current situations of export competitiveness in comparison with other competitors and its variation in the period of time will provide the information necessary for the government, business and scientist sectors, which are creating, updating, implementing and evaluating efficiency of the export improvement strategy and various means for its stimulation. This article presents the problems related to the increase of export competitiveness in the Baltic States and its measurement. The factors enhancing export development are distinguished, possibilities on application of the basic competitiveness models and methods and their application for measurement of the export competitiveness are analysed. Based on the conducted theoretical analysis, the index of measurement of the Baltic States export competitiveness was established, thus allowing to identify the main factors determining competitiveness of the Baltic States export and quantitative measure the competitiveness of the Baltic States export. The established index is empirically based when assessing competitiveness of the Baltic States export within the period of 2005 - 2010. The article ends by providing strategic proposals regarding increase in export competitiveness of Lithuania. The newly created Baltic States export competitiveness index, presented in the article, is one of the ambitions to promote the methodological background for measurement of export competitiveness and promote establishment of conditions, stimulating national enterprises to export and be competitive within international markets.","[Bruneckiene, Jurgita; Paltanaviciene, Dovile] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Bruneckiene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurgita.bruneckiene@ktu.lt; dovile.baranauskaite@gmail.com,"Bruneckiene, Jurgita/AAE-4948-2020","Bruneckiene, Jurgita/0000-0002-8281-1813",,,,,41,24,27,10,72,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The objective of this article is to estimate the role played by such factors in determining the occurrence of such diseases and utilization of formal health care for children under the age of three in India. The major findings are briefly enlisted as follows. First, a woman with greater educational qualification and autonomy in terms of her power to take decisions on her own, control over household resources and complete freedom to move beyond the confines of her household exerts a significant influence on the probability of seeking care. In addition to this, formal care is more likely to be sought for children whose mothers are more exposed to the media. Programmes devised to enhance utilization of formal health care for children should be targeted to catering for the needs of the vulnerable group i.e. female child, predominantly, residing in households belonging to Scheduled Tribe. In addition to this, children belonging to Muslim households are at higher risk of contracting the diseases but there is no significant difference in their health seeking behaviour as compared to other religious groups.","Madras Sch Econ, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India",Madras School of Economics,"Chakrabarti, A (通讯作者)，Madras Sch Econ, Gandhi Mandapam Rd, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India.",aninchak@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,15,16,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The efficiency gained by doing so increases the advantage of the common bidding agent. Almost common value auction theory predicts that an advantaged bidder is able to reduce competition by credibly enhancing the 'winner's curse' of disadvantaged rivals. The credible threat results in disadvantaged rivals exiting the bidding process early, leaving the advantaged bidder to purchase most, if not all, units at lower prices than when rivals have common values.

The British experience, however, remains a key point of study in informing these continuing developments. This article looks at the issue of contestability in bus markets, and tests for the existence of the contestable market in Britain through an examination of fare levels, profit margins and technical efficiencies in 90 identifiable bus markets. The main conclusion is that there is evidence of the contestable market in Britain, however it can hardly be described as widespread, only found to be present in 15 of the 90 markets identified in the sample. The real issue however, particularly with regard to continuing reforms elsewhere in Europe, is the ability of regulatory authorities to maintain competitive and contestable (free) markets and the research suggests that in the face of market forces this is simply not possible. The only conclusion therefore is that contestability in the free market is not sustainable, and thus can only be introduced directly through franchising.","Edinburgh Napier Univ, TRi SEBE, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Edinburgh Napier University,"Cowie, J (通讯作者)，Edinburgh Napier Univ, TRi SEBE, 10 Colinton Rd, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",j.cowie@napier.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Deconsumption as the expression of the shift in the outlook on life creates a culture basing on: (1) a conscious limitation of consumption to a rational size, i.e., one which stems from the natural, individual, physical and psychological needs of the consumer; (2) limiting material consumption in order to substitute it with immaterial consumption.","[Gardocka-Jalowiec, Anna] Univ Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok,"Gardocka-Jalowiec, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.",anna.gardocka76@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-172-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,61,65,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9MQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393447500010,0

However, this study explores a dimension that is not only unique but also close to actual behavior. The author suggests that in the current scenario of economic recession, both consumers and organizations want a return. Organizations are struggling for every purchase, therefore in order to influence consumers purchase behavior they should provide them what they want, and that is of value.

The OLG model captures direct effects, working through adjustments in the savings rate, labor supply, and capital deepening, and indirect effects, working through changes of taxes, government spending components and the retirement age in politico-economic equilibrium. Growth is driven by capital accumulation and productivity increases fueled by public investment. The closed-form solutions of the model predict taxation and the retirement age in OECD economies to increase in response to demographic ageing and per-capita growth to accelerate. If the retirement age was held constant, the growth rate in politico-economic equilibrium would essentially remain unchanged, due to a surge of social-security transfers and crowding out of public investment.

We show that after controlling for Government Effectiveness index, which measures the quality of civil services and quality and quantity of public infrastructure in a country, the effect of culture on corruption becomes insignificant. However, the Country Corruption index and the Government Effectiveness index are strongly correlated which makes it difficult to identify the causal determinant of corruption. It is important to keep this correlation in mind before arriving at conclusions from empirical studies, because Country Corruption index could be proxying for other influences such as Government Effectiveness index, and ignoring this might lead us to falsely attribute the observed behavior to cultural or social norms alone.

In this paper, we investigate the extent to which retail banking data - which as far as we know are not currently used by anti-terror intelligence agencies in any systematic manner - are a useful tool in identifying terrorists. Using detailed administrative records of a large British bank, we demonstrate that a number of variables in the data are strongly correlated with terrorism-related activities. Having both an Islamic given name and surname, not surprisingly, are among the strongest of these predictors, but a wide range of other demographic characteristics and behaviors observed in the data are also correlated strongly with terrorist involvement. The real key to our method, however, rests on the identification of one particular pattern of banking behavior (what we call Variable Z) which dramatically improves our ability to identify terrorists. Our model is demonstrated to have substantial power to identify terrorists both within sample and out of sample.","Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Levitt, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",slevitt@midway.uchicago.edu,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,18,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The author expressed his view on the cooperation with IMF and other international lending organizations. An anti-inflationary strategy is proposed which should convince the subjects within the economic system in handleability of inflationary processes through full strengthening of the market system mechanisms, probable changes in the consumer psychology and overcoming the fear of inflation motivation. Until the consumer is sure that price fluctuations are within market, he will stick to the perilous for the economy proneness to increase the current demand in an inflationary manner.

The study sample covers monthly data from January, 1995 to May, 2010 for Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, from January 1994 to May, 2010 for the Czech Republic, and from January, 2002 to June 2010 for Romania. The shortest sample used, from January, 2003 to September, 2010, was for Serbia and is due to the late start in the transition process. The results of this study enriched the existing ones on this topic by extending the sample period to cover even the recent years of relatively higher inflation rates and by including Romania and Serbia, which were not previously considered. The study led to two main findings: first, inflation of moderate to high magnitude persistence in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Serbia, and inflation of smaller order persistence in Slovakia and the Czech Republic was detected within the Markov switching model approach. In addition, the changes in inflation persistence often correspond to changes in variability and mean of inflation. Second, New Keynesian Phillips Curve represents a valid structural approach to describe the inflation dynamics in this region. In all the six cases studied, weights on backward and forward looking behaviors were significant, while the impact of the driving variable was insignificant only once. It is found that significant influence of the economic driving variable can be captured by real gross wage inflation and real broad money growth. The estimates show that the backward-looking term plays an important role in determining the inflation dynamics. Similar conclusions are drawn by using quarterly data in econometric estimations for the selected countries.","[Mladenovic, Zorica; Nojkovic, Aleksandra] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Mladenovic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",zorima@eunet.rs; nojkovic@gmail.com,"Mladenovic, Zorica/AAY-8964-2020","Mladenovic, Zorica/0000-0003-1579-4205",,,,,20,6,6,0,8,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,2,,,SI,,235,266,,10.2298/PAN1202235M,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,956MH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305093300007,0

However, when evaluating the effect of EITC programmes on income and poverty, governments generally calculate the effect using simple accounting, where the value of the state or federal EITC benefit is added to a person's income. These calculations omit the behavioural incentives created by the existence of these programmes, the corresponding effect on labour supply and hours worked, and therefore the actual effect on income and poverty. This article simulates the full effect of an expansion of the New York State EITC benefit on employment, hours worked, income, poverty and programme expenditures. These results are then compared to those omitting labour supply effects. Relative to estimates excluding labour supply effects, the preferred behavioural results show that an expansion of the New York State EITC increases employment by an additional 14 244 persons, labour earnings by an additional $95.8 million, family income by an additional $84.5 million, decreases poverty by an additional 56 576 persons and increases costs to the State by $29.7 million.","Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Schmeiser, MD (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",max.schmeiser@frb.gov,"Schmeiser, Maximilian D/A-2350-2010",,,,,,28,6,7,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While data on years of schooling are readily available, data on education quality are not. I use the returns to schooling of foreign-educated immigrants in the U.S. to measure the education quality of their birth country. Immigrants from developed countries earn higher returns than do immigrants from developing countries. I show how to incorporate this measure of education quality into an otherwise standard development accounting exercise. The main result is that cross-country differences in education quality are roughly as important as cross-country differences in years of schooling in accounting for output per worker differences, raising the total contribution of education from 10% to 20% of output per worker differences.","Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Schoellman, T (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,,,,,,,44,88,100,1,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Then, we compare this program with 7 well-known green hotel rating programs. Similar to other programs, Taiwanese is also strong in environmental protection. However, there are two significant differences of Taiwan's rating program: certification not by NGO, and no symbolized rating sign. No matter what kind of rating programs, the results of this study show that almost all of the rating programs' criteria get very little involvement in ecological conservation, so we suggest that rating programs would be made more effective by adding factors of ecological conservation. Surveys should also be conducted on an ongoing basis to clarify and incorporate ecological viewpoints and to keep green hotel rating systems updated.

To incorporate spatial interdependencies in the behavioral analysis, we propose a spatial random utility model of recreation demand. The model combines the set-theoretic concept of spatial neighborhood, endogeneity of spatial interdependencies, and unobservable individual preferences. Our estimation procedure uses an efficient pseudo maximum likelihood estimator. We apply the model to the study of recreational travel demand in Iowa and evaluate the significance of unobserved spatial interdependencies between individual households in recreational travel choices.

Our innovation in this regard is to employ a wind field model on hurricane track data to arrive at a more scientifically based index of potential local destruction. This index allows us to identify damages at a detailed geographical level, compare hurricanes' destructiveness, as well as identify the countries that are most affected, without having to rely on potentially questionable monetary loss estimates. Combining our destruction index with macroeconomic data we show that the average hurricane strike caused output to fall by at least 0.83 percentage points in the region, although this depends on controlling for local economic characteristics of the country affected and what time of the year the storm strikes.

When experts operate in a network that is closely linked to their subjects, the type of knowledge they discover will have a greater degree of policy relevance. Evidence from P. T.

The analyses were carried out for an MRIO model to calculate the Dutch carbon footprint. A sensitivity analysis of the technical coefficients showed that changes in the coefficients in the domestic blocks and in the Dutch import blocks had the largest effects on the calculated footprint. The uncertainty analysis consisting of a Monte Carlo simulation based on probability distributions around the model coefficients showed a relatively low degree of uncertainty in the total Dutch carbon footprint; uncertainties in the carbon emissions allocated to regions, sectors and products were larger.

A nationally representative sample of 1780 workers in the United States, aged 52-64, are drawn from the 2004-2006 Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Binary logistic regressions and censored Tobit models are estimated for workers' likelihood of missing work days due to illness and the number of illness-related work days missed, respectively, while explicitly addressing the possibility of insurance-selection effects. The findings suggest that over a 12-month period, older workers without health insurance are as likely as insured workers to miss work days due to illness and there are no differences in the number of days missed between insured and uninsured workers. However, there is strong evidence that poor baseline health, onset of new diseases and longer hospitalization significantly increase an older worker's absenteeism at work. These results suggest that having health insurance does not affect illness-related absenteeism among older workers in the US. Future research examining other aspects of worker productivity, such as 'presenteeism', and the longer term effects of insurance on productivity can extend our understanding of the role of health insurance in the workplace.","[Xu, Xiao] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Womens Hosp L4000, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jensen, Gail A.] Wayne State Univ, Inst Gerontol, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Wayne State University,"Xu, X (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Womens Hosp L4000, 1500 E Med Ctr Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",xiaox@med.umich.edu,,,,,,,56,7,13,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Differently from the main body of theoretical literature on quality leisure, we assume that the productivity of leisure is not determined by the stock of human capital but instead by the quality of social environment, which in turn depends on the joint action of the economy-wide average leisure and of the stock of social capital. In this context we show that the time evolution of social capital may exhibit an inverted-U shaped path, according to which the stock of social capital, initially increasing, becomes definitively decreasing. This result is consistent with several empirical studies about the time evolution of social capital in industrialized economies (see e.g. Robert Putnam, 1995, 2000). Furthermore, we show that the inverted-U shaped evolution of the stock of social capital can be observed only if the balanced growth path is locally indeterminate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A reason that may explain why trade linkages play a less important role in recent years is the changing composition of trade. In particular, the increasing formation of international production networks implies that trade increasingly involves indirect trade linkages. As a result, direct trade statistics may fail to accurately to capture the total trade exposure. In our study, we estimate total trade linkages by including indirect trade linkages obtained from the construction of a trade matrix. When we account for indirect trade linkages, we find that export dependency on the U.S. market still helps to explain crisis severity for developed countries.","[Cheewatrakoolpong, Kornkarun; Manprasert, Somprawin] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,"Cheewatrakoolpong, K (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",Kornkarun.k@chula.ac.th; somprawin.m@chula.ac.th,,,,,,,23,14,15,0,74,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

If investment opportunities are scarce, inequality is high, property rights are not secure, and social comparisons are strong, society is likely to be in the fear equilibrium, in which better endowed agents underinvest in order to avoid destructive envy of the relatively poor. Otherwise, the standard keeping up with the Joneses competition arises, and envy is satisfied through suboptimally high efforts. Economic growth expands the production possibilities frontier and triggers an endogenous transition from one equilibrium to the other causing a qualitative shift in the relationship between envy and economic performance: envy-avoidance behavior with its adverse effect on investment paves the way to creative emulation. From a welfare perspective, better institutions and wealth redistribution that move the society away from the low-output fear equilibrium need not be Pareto improving in the short run, as they unleash the negative consumption externality. In the long run, such policies contribute to an increase in social welfare due to enhanced productivity growth.","Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Gershman, B (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",boris.gershman@american.edu,,"Gershman, Boris/0000-0002-7688-053X",,,,,64,16,18,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Our results show that overall inequality in per capita expenditure increases between 2008 and 2010, which coincides with a rising trend in the official Gini coefficient. The contribution of inequality within urban and rural areas to total inequality is larger than that of inequality between urban and rural areas. Looking within urban and rural areas, urban inequality is significantly higher than rural inequality. Java-Bali in particular records very high urban inequality. Overall, urban inequality increases, urban-rural inequality remains stable, rural inequality decreases, and inequality at the national level increases. Although urban-rural inequality has a relatively low share in overall inequality, the share is not small enough to ignore its impact. Furthermore, when using the alternative decomposition method, the contribution of urban-rural inequality increases substantially.

Since little or no direct debate has previously occurred between the two perspectives, this paper presents an extended critique of the ENE approach in both general and Keynes-specific terms. The critique argues, inter alia, that the ENE approach is untenable because it makes it impossible for agents to obtain knowledge of the relevant state of reality; it employs two conflicting definitions of ergodicity; its accounts of agent learning are incoherent or internally inconsistent; it commits the excluded middle fallacy; its view of causality is oversimplified; and its treatment of Keynes's philosophical work is inaccurate and tendentious. General aspects of the critique also apply to other schools employing the ENE approach.","Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"O'Donell, R (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",,,,,,,,41,20,20,3,14,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The arguments and figures provided show that the intense process of political and fiscal decentralisation that took place over the 1990s and 2000s did not lead to higher debt ratios in terms of GDP at these tiers of government until 2007. Although a kind of overspending bias was in effect until the late 2000s, the paper shows that the evolution of GDP and tax revenues provided regional and local governments with enough resources to vigorously pursue their devolved public policy responsibilities and still keep their debt ratios under control. However, since 2008, when the world financial crisis broke out, the situation has changed dramatically. Even though the crisis originated in the financial sector, the paper concludes by stressing the importance of creating incentives and setting controls through institutional arrangements characterising multilevel government for all tiers of government to save in periods of economic growth in order to confront the impact of recession once it comes.","Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Appl Econ Dept, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Toboso, F (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Appl Econ Dept, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",Fernando.Toboso@uv.es,"Toboso, Fernando/G-4744-2015","Toboso, Fernando/0000-0002-8586-0629",,,,,41,1,1,0,17,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

An estimation of labour productivity in 52 industrial classes finds that structural heterogeneity increased particularly in the 1994-2001 subperiod, alongside technical and organizational improvements that were increasingly concentrated in a small number of subsidiary companies of transnational automotive-assembly enterprises. The application of a shift-share technique also revealed the absence of any significant structural change. Lastly, an extension of the methodology to evaluate competitiveness developed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and its application to a second database that reclassifies 1,345 foreign trade products, makes it possible to contrast these changes with the dynamism of the global production networks in which the leading firms of the sector in Mexico are engaged.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ind Econ Unit, Inst Econ Res, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"López, RV (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ind Econ Unit, Inst Econ Res, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",rvazquez@unam.mx,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,8,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,DEC,2014,,114,,,,,135,151,,,,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF4LI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352520200008,0

Such a monetary authority represents A monopoly private money supplier or situations where fiscal policy drives monetary policy and hence the name Leviathan. Under no commitment, I characterize an equilibrium with reputation concerns. The centralized market interaction is modeled as an infinitely repeated game between the Leviathan monetary authority (a large player) and the economic agents (small players), where the size of the players refers to the ability to influence aggregate outcomes. This large-small player dynamics pins down the equilibrium set of payoffs. Under the assumption that agents do not refuse to use money purely for coordination reasons, the one shot game has a unique Nash equilibrium with maximum inflation tax. The set of equilibria is considerably enlarged in the infinite repetition of the game and equilibria with a lower inflation tax can also be supported by providing appropriate incentives to the money supplier.

Based on a broad overview of that literature, several patterns emerge. First, the empirical literature points toward strongly anticyclical policy, which consists of procyclical tax revenues, acyclical tax rates and government purchases, and countercyclical transfer payments. Secondly, consolidation in response to the debt has come primarily through adjustments to taxes and possibly purchases. Thirdly, a large government is associated with reduced macroeconomic volatility. Meanwhile, the theoretical literature on anticyclical fiscal policy has gone from mostly focusing on government purchases and tax rates toward beginning to focus on transfer payments, although more quantitative work remains to be done in linking theory with empirics. In addition, a policy literature has begun to develop, which has applied lessons from the theoretical literature in order to understand different consolidation scenarios and different proposed fiscal rules, particularly in Europe.","Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Reicher, C (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",claire.reicher@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,122,0,0,0,17,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 7,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201438.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-38,0.0,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CL4AG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356893800001,0

Our quasi-maximum likelihood estimation controls for location differences and instruments for price endogeneity. The microdata allow us to estimate the effects of demographics on both elasticities of telephone penetration and the level of telephone penetration. Based on our preferred estimates, the subsidy programs increased aggregate penetration by 6.1% for households below the poverty line. Our results suggest that automatic enrollment programs are important and that Linkup is more cost-effective than Lifeline, which calls into question a recent FCC (2012) decision to reduce Linkup subsidies in favor of Lifeline.

While they contend that their approach is ontologically and analytically coherent and useful, scholars sympathetic with it, e.g., Ostrom and Basurto (2011), have called for further methodological and empirical specification. In the same vein, this paper seeks to develop the Dopfer-Potts framework by proposing an analytic methodology to translate their rule-based approach into an operational method for identifying and testing hypotheses that relate to rules. It does so by defining a methodology connecting explanandum (response rule) and explanantia (factor rules) at the same level of rules. The concept of a 'savings rule' serves as a roving example that later is extended into a case study. The paper offers a methodological template for applied evolutionary analysis in economics.","[Blind, G.] Univ Zurich, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pyka, A.] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University of Zurich; University Hohenheim,"Pyka, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, Wollgrasweg 23, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",a.pyka@uni-hohenheim.de,"Pyka, Andreas/IST-6329-2023",", Georg/0000-0001-9038-1799; Pyka, Andreas/0000-0001-6207-6690",,,,,32,10,10,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Specifically, the coefficient on income (residential sector) or output (commercial and industrial sectors) is allowed to follow a smooth semiparametric function of time, providing a flexible specification that allows more accurate out-of-sample forecasts than either fixed or discretely changing regression coefficients. We fit the model to Korean data over 1995:01-2012:12 for the residential sector and 1985:01-2012:12 for the commercial and industrial sectors.

Two symmetric regions are part of an economically integrated area (the Union), while the third region represents an outside trade partner. We explore how the spatial allocation of industrial production and employment within the Union is affected by changes in two aspects of trade liberalisation, regional integration and globalisation, conditional to the skill endowment and the market size of the outside region. Our main contribution pertains to the analysis of the local and global dynamics of the specified factor mobility process. We show that significant parameter ranges exist for which an asymmetric distribution of economic activities is one of the possible long-run outcomes which may allow a smooth transition to agglomeration (in contrast to the NEG typical catastrophic scenario). In addition, we show that multistability is pervasive and that some attractors are Milnor attractors.

The results showed that there has been a significant increase in bilateral trade between the two countries over the past decade or so. However, the estimated trade intensity indices suggest that Canada and China are trading less than they should. On the other hand, analysis using revealed comparative advantage indices suggests that there is no overlap in comparative advantage between two countries. Further, the trade complementarity indices show that Canada's export structure is compatible with China's import structure and at the same time, China's export structure is also compatible with Canada's import structure.

Previous studies evaluating the performance of distribution companies after the reform have not found evidence of improvements, although large differences in efficiency have been found among firms. This suggests high inefficiency persistence and heterogeneity in the Colombian distribution sector. In this paper, we propose an extension of dynamic stochastic frontier models that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in the inefficiency persistence and in the technology. The model incorporates total expenses, service quality and energy losses in an efficiency analysis of Colombian distributors over fifteen years after the reform. We identify the presence of high inefficiency persistence in the sector, and important differences between firms. In particular, rural companies and firms with small customers present low persistence and evidence the largest gains in efficiency during the period. However, increases in efficiency are only manifested during the last five years when the main improvements in service quality and energy losses are presented. Overall, inefficiency persistence, customer density and consumption density are found to be important criteria to be considered for regulatory purposes. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, we conduct a randomized field experiment to evaluate a leading entrepreneurship education program that is taught worldwide in the final grade of primary school. We focus on pupils' development of entrepreneurship knowledge and a set of non-cognitive skills relevant for entrepreneurial activity. The results indicate that knowledge is unaffected by the program. However, the program has a robust positive effect on non-cognitive entrepreneurial skills. This is surprising since previous evaluations found zero or negative effects. Because these earlier studies all pertain to entrepreneurship education for adolescents, our result tentatively suggests that non-cognitive entrepreneurial skills are best developed at an early age. As the entrepreneurship program has various features besides its entrepreneurship content, we must leave it to future research to determine which specific element has the greatest impact on the development of non-cognitive entrepreneurial skills.

The following facts motivate our study. First, environmental (resource) problems are either framed as public bads prevention or public goods provision. Second, the occurrence of these problems is characterized by thresholds that are interchangeably represented as nonconvexity, bifurcation, bi-stability, or catastrophes. Third, the threshold location is mostly unknown. We employ a provision point mechanism with threshold uncertainty and analyze the responses of cooperative behaviors to uncertainty and to the framing for each type of social preferences categorized by a value orientation test. We find that aggregate framing effects are negligible, although the response to the frame is the opposite depending on the type of social preferences. Cooperative subjects become more cooperative in negative frames than in positive frames, whereas individualistic subjects are less cooperative in negative frames than in positive ones. This finding implies that the insignificance of aggregate framing effects arises from behavioral asymmetry. We also find that the percentage of cooperative choices non-monotonically varies with the degree of threshold uncertainty, irrespective of framing and value orientation. Specifically, the degree of cooperation is highest at intermediate levels of threshold uncertainty and decreases as the uncertainty becomes sufficiently large.","[Kotani, Koji] Kochi Univ Technol, Dept Management, Kami, Kochi 7828502, Japan; [Tanaka, Kenta] Musashi Univ, Fac Econ, Nerima Ku, Tokyo 1768534, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan",Kochi University Technology; Tohoku University,"Kotani, K (通讯作者)，Kochi Univ Technol, Dept Management, 185 Miyanokuchi, Kami, Kochi 7828502, Japan.",kojikotani757@gmail.com; tanaka58.tin@gmail.com; managi.s@gmail.com,"Kotani, Koji/X-7947-2019; Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013; Kotani, Koji/C-6896-2011","Kotani, Koji/0000-0003-0667-1895; Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427; Kotani, Koji/0000-0003-0667-1895",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530276] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,28,6,7,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Some argue that developed economies, especially the US, may gain from these policies through trade. This paper studies this issue in a two-country model with dollar currency pricing. We find that the optimal level of oil price stabilization chosen by developing countries and its implications for global welfare depend critically on whether monetary policy can effectively respond to oil shocks. In an environment without monetary shocks, when optimal monetary policies are considered, there is no role for oil price stabilization in developing countries. However, to make the oil price stabilization policy redundant, optimal monetary policy is not necessary. Some non-optimal endogenous monetary policies satisfying certain conditions can also make the developing countries choose zero oil price stabilization. The results change when there are monetary shocks. Even with optimal monetary policies, the developing countries will choose a positive level of oil price stabilization. However, due to dollar currency pricing, the US actually loses from the stabilization policy. Our results-are well supported by the quantitative analysis in a full-fledged dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The paper also finds that the gap between the magnitudes of the impacts from pursuing the different strategies has been falling since the 1970s. The trend seems compatible with the much debated Great Moderation in advanced economies and similar developments in economies around the world.","[Prazmowski, Peter A.] Amer Chamber Commerce Dominican Republ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Prazmowski, Peter A.] Grp Leon Jimenes, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep; [Sanchez-Fung, Jose R.] Univ Nottingham, NUBS, Dept Quantitat & Appl Econ, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Sanchez-Fung, Jose R.] Univ London, ILAS, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of London,"Prazmowski, PA (通讯作者)，X-16445,POB 025389, Miami, FL 33102 USA.",pprazmowski@live.com; JoseR.Sanchez-Fung@nottingham.edu.cn,"Sánchez-Fung, José R./AGY-7842-2022","Sánchez-Fung, José R./0000-0001-5532-107X",,,,,24,0,0,0,8,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Using a daily dataset covering from 1990 to 2013 (which includes crucial events for energy markets such as invasion of Iraq and global financial crisis of 2008), we estimate time-varying generalized Hurst exponents of several energy futures contracts with different times to maturity using a rolling window approach. Results reveal that efficiency of energy futures markets is clearly time-varying and changes drastically over the sample period. For futures contracts with 1-4 months to maturities, crude oil and gasoline are found to be more efficient compared to others. On the other hand, for contracts with 5-9 months to maturities, crude oil and natural gas futures are more efficient. For almost every different month to maturity, heating oil and gas oil futures are found to be the least efficient markets. Moreover in general, the efficiency of energy futures markets is found to be decreasing dramatically when time to maturity is increasing. Several implications are discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A pure comparative statics analysis of our model suggests that a reduction of trade barriers, modeled as small but positive import tariffs, always enhances welfare. However, taking a dynamic perspective reveals that nonlinear trade interactions between two regions may generate endogenous price fluctuations which can hamper welfare. Finally, we allow special interest groups, such as consumers or producers from these two regions, to lobby for a particular level of trade barriers.

The causal relationships between the systematic problems were identified by the survey and grouped into 6 components by Exploratory Factor Analysis: weakness in technology diffusion mechanisms, the lack of centralized governance on science and technology policy, the government's pivotal role as an executor in education and research, weak laws and regulations in the field of research and technology, the lack of adequate financial resources in R&D and the lack of any perspective on the creation of wealth and entrepreneurship among the actors of research and technology. Finally the bottleneck of Iran's NIS was recognized by Thinking Process tools: the small participation of private sector in research and education system as the result of government's pivotal role as an executor of Iran's national innovation system.

Based on the method of hypothetical extraction from input-output tables, and on the Beijing case, this paper puts forward an approach to assess the dependence of the agro-economy on urban sectors. The research shows that in Beijing in the period from 1982 to 2007 the relationship between agriculture and the urban economy has gone through three phases. At the start of the economic reform, the relationship was weak, characterised by intensive inputs of agricultural productive materials and policy orders. What followed was a phase of disconnection characterised by fast urban growth and low competitive status of agriculture. The third was a period of increasingly integrated development with technological inputs and upgrading of the management of agriculture. The current strong relationship indicates that agriculture can be tuned to meet the preferences of urban consumers. Key associated urban sectors are screened out to verify this relationship. The approach is valuable for quantifying the structural relationship between agriculture and urban sectors, for further analysing rural-urban economic relationships to support development policy design and programming.","[Yang, Zhenshan; Cai, Jianming; Dunford, Michael] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Dunford, Michael] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton BN1 9, E Sussex, England; [Webster, Douglas] ASU, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Sussex; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe","Cai, JM (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",caijm@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Dunford, Michael/J-8306-2019","Dunford, Michael/0000-0002-0028-3130; Yang, Zhenshan/0000-0002-3697-7396",,,,,43,11,14,1,31,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In contrast, increases in the real prices of corn, soybeans, wheat and rice received by US farmers have been more substantial and can be linked in part to increases in the real price of oil. That link, however, appears largely driven by common macroeconomic determinants of the prices of oil and of agricultural commodities rather than the pass-through from higher oil prices. We show that there is no evidence that corn ethanol mandates have created a tight link between oil and agricultural markets. Moreover, increases in agricultural commodity prices have contributed little to US retail food price increases, because of the small cost share of agricultural products in food prices. In short, there is no evidence that oil price shocks have been associated with more than a negligible increase in US retail food prices in recent years. Nor is there evidence for the prevailing wisdom that oil-price driven increases in the cost of food processing, packaging, transportation and distribution have been responsible for higher retail food prices. Similar results hold for other industrialized countries. There is reason, however, to expect food commodity prices to be more tightly linked to retail food prices in developing countries.

We use for this purpose a relatively unknown but simple and attractive social evaluation approach called critical-level generalized utilitarianism (CLGU). CLGU posits that social welfare increases with population size if and only if the new lives come with a level of living standards higher than that of a critical level. Despite its attractiveness, CLGU poses a number of practical difficulties that may explain why the literature has left it largely unexplored. We address these difficulties by developing new procedures for making partial CLGU orderings. The headline result is that we can robustly conclude that world welfare has increased between 1990 and 2005 if we judge that lives with per capita yearly consumption of more than $1,248 necessarily increase social welfare; the same conclusion applies to Sub-Saharan Africa if and only if we are willing to make that same judgment for lives with any level of per capita yearly consumption above $147. Otherwise, some of the admissible CLGU functions will judge the last two decades' increase in global population size to have lowered global social welfare. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To take this nexus between city age and city size into account, we introduce endogenous city creation into a dynamic economic model of an urban system. Our model predicts a pattern of age-dependent urban growth that is in line with recently established empirical evidence. The size distribution that emerges in our economy delivers a close fit to different types of US data and it outperforms other suggested parametrizations.

Actively traded in over-the-counter markets, these products are often priced by continuously sampled approximations to simplify the computations. This paper presents an analytical approach to efficiently and accurately price discretely sampled volatility derivatives, under a general stochastic volatility model. We first obtain an accurate approximation for the characteristic function of the discretely sampled realized variance. This characteristic function is then applied to price discrete volatility derivatives through either semi-analytical pricing formulae (up to an inverse Fourier transform) or an efficient Fourier-cosine series method. Numerical experiments show that our approximation is more accurate in comparison to the approximations in the literature. We remark that although discretely sampled variance swaps and options are usually more expensive than their continuously sampled counterparts, discretely sampled volatility swaps are more prone to be cheaper than the continuously sampled counterparts. An analysis is then provided to explain why this is the case in general for realistic contract specifications and reasonable model parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The role of such interdependencies is explicitly studied in this paper. A social accounting matrix for Malaysia that distinguishes between the major ethnic groups in Malaysia (Malays, Chinese, and Indians) is used to run the analyses. Interdependencies among production sectors are measured by splitting the total output effect into the initial, direct and indirect effects. The results show that sectors which have large (small) spillover effects are associated with lower (higher) poverty reduction. The best way to increase the income of poor workers in a sector, generally is to stimulate that sector rather than other sectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Saari, M.

The models differ in what sellers know about the buyer's preferences for their products, and they yield substantially different prices and payoffs, different implications for institutional choice, surprising intensities of competition, and qualitatively different comparative statics. These findings caution against using the analytically convenient models when the newer model is empirically appropriate.

We calculate the optimal size of government and estimate the efficiency of government spending by applying data envelopment analysis and Tobit regression models. Apart from Croatia, our results also relate to other European Union member states, Iceland and Norway. We find that a binding constraint to Croatia's economic growth is not a big government but rather a weak government plagued by corruption. The average optimal size of government in old EU member states is larger than that in new EU member states but the former need to cut their government expenditure more sharply in order to reach the optimal size.

It is well known that a unilateral CO2 abatement policy in one region may cause CO2 emissions to increase in non-abating regions because of the relocation of CO2-intensive firms and because of energy market effects. If, however, the CO2 mitigation policy induces energy-saving technological innovation in the home region and this innovation can freely spill-over to energy users abroad, carbon leakage may be offset by induced efficiency gains in foreign firms. In this paper we develop a simple mathematical model of carbon leakage and technological spillovers and perform numerical simulations with an adjusted CGE model to illustrate the potential importance of international technology spillovers. We show that carbon leakage can become negative at moderate levels of technology spillover. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of participation in the early 1980s oil and gas boom and long-term specialization were considered as possible drivers of socioeconomic outcomes. Generalized estimating equations were used to regress 11 measures of economic growth and quality of life on oil and gas specialization while accounting for various confounding factors including degree of access to markets, initial socioeconomic conditions in 1980, and dependence on other economic sectors. Long-term oil and gas specialization is observed to have negative effects on change in per capita income, crime rate, and education rate. Participation in the early 1980s boom was positively associated with change in per capita income; however the positive effect decreases the longer counties remain specialized in oil and gas. Our findings contribute to a broader public dialogue about the consequences of resource specialization involving oil and natural gas and call into question the assumption that long-term oil and gas development confers economic advantages upon host communities.

We incorporate this channel in a new dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous economic growth and heterogeneous overlapping generations. We calibrate the model for the US economy and obtain the following results. First, the effect of a decline in population growth on labor productivity growth is positive and quantitatively significant. In our benchmark, it is predicted to increase from an average annual growth rate of 1.74% over 1990-2000 to 2.41% in 2100.

While proponents of the former approach claim that environmental measures can promote growth by, for example, more efficient use of natural resources, proponents of the latter maintain that environmental integrity can only be upheld by slowing down growth. This paper argues that both approaches constitute inadequate foundations for public policy as they fail to appropriately conceptualize social welfare. We show how policy aimed at social welfare can be understood as managing a portfolio of capital stocks, some of which exhibit the characteristics of 'commons' (i.e. common pool resources and public goods). We then propose a programme of 'welfare diagnostics', which aims at establishing minimum thresholds for capital stocks essential to welfare as a guide for real-world policy formulation, and discuss the role of appropriation of natural resource rents for its practical implementation. We conclude by highlighting the central role of scientific policy advice in determining how different conceptions of welfare would be reflected in setting targets and choosing the means to achieve them.","[Jakob, Michael] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Jakob, Michael] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Jakob, M (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.",jakob@mcc-berlin.net; ottmar.edenhofer@pik-potsdam.de,"Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,,107,70,72,4,88,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Toward that end, a New Keynesian model with price and wage rigidities is used. The results show that monetary policy responded counter-cyclically during the crisis only in countries with weak trade unions and in countries with flexible exchange rates, which indicates that fixed exchange rates and strong trade unions constrain monetary policy in countries in these regions. Also, the findings show that the main driver of price inflation in these countries is not economic activity, but wages, which are affected to a large extent by trade unions. Therefore, trade unions should be active partners in the decision-making processes in these countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In an effort to fill this gap, this paper examines South Africa's Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD) program. We exploit features of LRAD program implementation to extract exogenous variation in whether, and for how long, applicant households enjoyed land transfers. Binary treatment estimates, which compare treated with untreated households, show that beneficiary households on average experienced a 25% increase in per-capita consumption. Our preferred continuous treatment estimates, which analyze only the subset of treated households, identify the impact time path of land transfers on consumption. These estimates show that living standards initially drop and then, after 3-4 years, rise to 150% of their pre-transfer level. These results are statistically significant and robust to a statistically more conservative identification strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It exists in many countries, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Nigeria, Tanzania, Vietnam, and more. We analyze in our article the effect of low quality fertilizer, which contains less nitrogen than is advertised on the packaging. We show that this could lead to bias in the estimation of production functions. Using panel data from the Hebei Province of China and the Monte Carlo simulation, we examine the magnitude of the bias across different levels of fertilizer quality under various scenarios of uncertainty. We find that ignoring the uncertainty leads to an overestimation of fertilizer's effectiveness. Depending on the scenarios of uncertainty, the bias could even switch the sign of fertilizer's partial elasticity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this regime, a central bank manipulates its key interest rate to steer an economy to the objectives it wants to achieve. To implement its monetary policy, Taylor rule is claimed to be a quantitative tool used as a guide for setting interest rate in response to the state of the economy. Despite its widespread popularity, the Taylor rule is just an orientational guidance at best and cannot be followed strictly since it would be against the common practice of conducting monetary policy of most central banks. Therefore, we propose a new rule for inflation targeting monetary policy based on fuzzy control technique. This rule seems to be able to quantify those widely accepted qualitative knowledge on monetary policy. Further, the policy derived by this rule also better captures the common behaviour of central banks. We verify this rule on the monetary policy conducted by the Czech National Bank in the period from 2000 to 2011.

With aggregate risk the same can happen with only two possible endowment realizations. With respect to risk aversion the intuitive comparative statics result holds without aggregate risk, but it holds only under strong assumptions in the presence of aggregate risk.

We found that the income inequality is influenced predominantly by governmental policy on subsidies and social transfers. Different amount of subsidies and social transfers across various countries makes the data biased. The inverted U-curve was found in countries with low amount of social contribution. However, increasing amount of social contributions makes the U-curve flat and shifts its maximum to higher values of the average income.

The model is the five-variable SVAR framework proposed by Perotti (2005), further augmented to allow for the possibility that taxes, spending and interest rates might respond to the level of the debt over time. We examine the dynamic responses of output, inflation and the interest rate to changes in government spending and revenues and analyse the contribution of shocks to New Zealand's business cycle for the period 1983: 1-2010: 2. We find that the effects of government expenditure shocks in New Zealand appear to be positive but small in the short run at the cost of higher interest rates and lower output in the medium to long run. The sign of the effects of tax policy changes are less clear-cut, but again the effects on GDP appear similarly modest. Past fiscal policy is analysed through a historical decomposition of the shocks in the model. This suggests that discretionary fiscal policy has had a generally pro-cyclical impact on GDP over the past 15 years, and a material impact on the real long-term interest rate. A fiscal expansion has a positive but limited impact on inflation.","[Parkyn, Oscar; Vehbi, Tugrul] New Zealand Treasury, Wellington, New Zealand; [Vehbi, Tugrul] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Vehbi, Tugrul] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",Australian National University; University of Cambridge,"Vehbi, T (通讯作者)，New Zealand Treasury, Wellington, New Zealand.",tugrul.vehbi@treasury.govt.nz,,"Vehbi, Tugrul/0000-0002-2828-7838",,,,,36,7,7,2,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

These discussions are also ongoing in Portugal, namely in what concerns the level and duration of feed-in tariffs that should be provided to independent power producers. This, in turn, raises the question of whether the past feed-in tariff levels were well designed to achieve the goals of a larger penetration of renewables in the Portuguese grid. The policies to induce wind adoption have led to a growth in wind installed capacity and share of electricity generated by wind in Portugal, but questions arise on their cost-effectiveness and whether alternative policy designs would have led to the same goal. In this work, we estimate profits made by wind independent power producers for wind parks that were connected in Portugal between 1992 and 2010, and conclude that the feed-in tariffs have overcompensated some wind power producers.

In contrast to classical special interest groups, commercial lobbying firms represent a variety of clients and are not directly affected by policy outcomes. They are hired by citizens, or groups of citizens, to act as intermediaries on their behalf with policymakers. In our analysis we address two basic questions: what tasks are commercial lobbying firms performing, and what are the implications of their existence for social welfare? We answer the first part of this question by proposing that commercial lobbying firms possess a verification technology that allows them to improve the quality of information concerning the social desirability of policy proposals. This gives policymakers the incentive to allocate their scarce time to commercial lobbying firms. Essentially, it is this access to policymakers that commercial lobbying firms sell to their clients. To address the question of social welfare we construct a simple general equilibrium model that includes commercial lobbying firms, and compare the equilibrium obtained under market provision of lobbying services to the first best optimum. We find that the market level of lobbying services can be socially either too large or too small, and characterize when each will be the case. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show that a pure exchange economy has excessive trade in equilibrium because agents interact to rebalance their portfolios. Intergenerational financial intermediaries reduce the number of interactions because agents only transact when they face liquidity needs. In the absence of asset risk, intermediaries match redemptions with deposits and dividends, and never sell assets. If the economy is subject to transaction costs, the intermediated economy can sustain higher stationary investment and welfare. We also find that dead weight transaction costs can increase welfare because it protects banks from interbank arbitrage and dampens the inherent cyclicality of market economies.

We use a dataset of CIT reforms and estimate the effect of tax rate changes on leverage, dividend policies and earnings management of banks. The results suggest that taxation influences all three variables. Leverage increases with the CIT rate in the first three years after the reform. The reason is that the statutory CIT rate determines the value of the debt tax shield. A higher tax rate increases incentives to use debt finance when interest payments are deductible from the CIT base. The tax effects we find are statistically and economically significant but considerably lower than those found in previous research. Also, dividend pay-outs increase after an increase in CIT rates. This could indicate that banks actively manage their pay-out policies around tax reforms and adjust their capital structure with changes in dividends. Furthermore, banks increase loss loan reserves in anticipation of tax rate cuts since losses become less valuable with lower CIT rates.","[Hemmelgarn, Thomas] Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Taxat & Customs Union, SPA3 06-19A, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Teichmann, Daniel] Fac Econ & Business Adm, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",,"Hemmelgarn, T (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Taxat & Customs Union, SPA3 06-19A, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",thomas.hemmelgarn@ec.europa.eu; daniel.teichmann@hof.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,72,20,22,1,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We use fixed effects estimation and fixed effects, instrumental variables estimation to isolate the effects of remittances and other events on human capital. We find that boys aged 14-18 in remittances' receiving households are less likely to be enrolled in school than other children. We also find that girls in remittances' receiving households are more likely to be malnourished (thin). Both effects are relatively small. Remittances do not improve the human capital of children left behind. However, we do find an overall positive improvement in school enrollment among young children between 2005 and 2009 but a negative trend in enrollment among older boys and girls.

Expectations in the four industrial groupings are shown to follow a common long-run trend, identified with the one guiding the export grouping.

We consider the problem of a benevolent government that signs a risk-sharing contract with the rest of the world, and that has to choose optimally distortionary taxes on labor income, domestic debt and international transfers. Both the home country and the rest of the world may have limited commitment, which means that they can leave the contract if they find it convenient. The contract is designed so that, at any point in time, neither party has incentives to exit. We define a small open emerging economy as an economy where the limited commitment problem is active in equilibrium. Conversely, a small open developed economy is an economy in which the commitment problem is not active. Our model is able to rationalize some stylized facts about fiscal policy in emerging economies: i) the volatility of tax revenues over GDP is higher in emerging economies than in developed ones; ii) fiscal policy is procyclical in emerging economies; iii) emerging economies may graduate from procyclical fiscal policy and adopt countercyclical policies in the long run.

Any economic policy should be assessed, he proposed, by its expected effect on the size, distribution and variability of the national dividend. His programme, though rough and ready, has proved to be more useful than the 'new' welfare economics, which tended to leave distributional questions for others and 'efficiency' questions to competitive markets. Pigou himself, however, took a conservative view of what might be done in practice. The impact of policies on the size, distribution and variability of income is still a central focus of both popular and technical interest. Some of the issues now recognised as important to well-being, such as welfare in unequal societies and the experience of unemployment, may be subsumed into Pigou's three criteria.","Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Collard, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",collarddavid@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,60,2,2,2,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

I show that when firms believe that consumers have a brand preference for them, then they charge more to these consumers, and this price has an inverse U-shaped relationship with the signal's accuracy. In contrast, the price charged after a disloyal signal has been observed falls as the signal's accuracy rises. While industry profit and overall welfare fall monotonically when price discrimination is based on increasingly more accurate information, the reverse happens to consumer surplus.","Univ Minho, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Esteves, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",rbranca@eeg.uminho.pt,"Esteves, Rosa-Branca/B-5332-2009","Esteves, Rosa-Branca/0000-0001-5063-697X",,,,,31,16,18,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

In this paper, we focus on modeling and forecasting the long-term price level, since it is the dominant factor in many such applications. To provide a foundation for our modeling approach we first evaluate the empirical characteristics of crude oil price data from 1990 to 2013 using unit root and variance ratio tests. Statistical evidence from these tests shows only weak support for the applicability of stationary mean-reverting type processes up through 2004, with non-stationary Brownian motion type processes becoming more plausible when the data from 2005 to 2013 is added. We then apply a Kalman filtering method with maximum likelihood approach to estimate the model parameters for both a single-factor Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) process as well as the two-factor Schwartz and Smith (2000) process. The latter process decomposes the spot price into unobservable factors for the long-term equilibrium level and short-term deviation, and it accommodates aspects of both a GBM process and a mean-reverting process. Both empirical and simulated data are analyzed with these models, and we quantify the increases in both the drift rate and volatility of these processes that result from developments in the crude oil markets since the middle of the last decade. We conclude by comparing and contrasting both historical accuracy and forecasts from the parameterized models, and show that when the emphasis is on the long-term expectations, a single factor GBM forecast may be sufficient.

We show that groups are more likely to make ambiguity-neutral decisions than individuals, and that individuals make more ambiguity-neutral decisions after discussing the decisions with others. This shift toward higher ambiguity neutrality in groups and after a group discussion is associated with a reduction in the rates of both ambiguity aversion and ambiguity seeking.

We describe collusion-resistant mechanisms with verification that return optimal solutions for a wide class of mechanism design problems (which includes utilitarian ones as a special case). Note that every collusion-resistant mechanism without verification must have an unbounded approximation factor and, in general, optimal solutions cannot be obtained even if we content ourselves with truthful (non-collusion-resistant) mechanisms.

Japan, South Korea, China and Brazil are all examples, most of which grew at phenomenal rates. The National Development Plan in South Africa sets out the intention of the South African government to transform the government into a capable and developmental state able to intervene to correct our historical inequities... However, what the South African government means by the term developmental state is not entirely clear. To help bring some clarity, this paper distinguishes between the East Asian developmental state and the Scandinavian developmentalist welfare state. The paper furthermore draws on Bernard and Boucher's distinction between a social investment state and a transfer welfare state. The former is a more precise description of the Scandinavian developmentalist welfare state. Subsequently, the paper discusses the applicability of the developmental state framework to South Africa. Specifically, it argues that the East Asian model neither is a model that would work in South Africa, nor is it a model that South Africa would wish to apply. South Africa currently resembles more a transfer welfare state than the Scandinavian-Brazilian social investment state. The social investment state, though, is closer to what South Africa needs.","Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Burger, P (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, POB 339, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",BurgerP@ufs.ac.za,,"Burger, Philippe/0000-0001-6820-1130",,,,,36,10,11,1,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The paper shows that demolition's coordination strengthens local governments' incentive to demolish part of their stock, by shutting down inter city migration within qualities.-A case study on Germany's East illustrates the effects of coordinated, simultaneous every-city demolition.","Touro Coll Berlin, Dept Management, D-14055 Berlin, Germany",,"Dascher, K (通讯作者)，Touro Coll Berlin, Dept Management, Rupenhorn 5, D-14055 Berlin, Germany.",dascher@euv-frankfurt-o.de,,,,,,,23,1,1,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

S. Treasury are two powerful planning agencies with regard to monetary policy and the economy. Yet, their monetary policies do not consider climate-change remediation. Their policy emphasis is mainly focused on investment and production, while climate change from investment and production is creating devastating ecological and social disruption. The double-entry accounting system utilized by banks and production corporations is not designed to record the consequences of their finance, investment, and production activities on climate change. Restructuring Federal Reserve and Treasury policy regarding climate change is not possible without change in the accounting system to provide relevant indicators because banks, corporations, and monetary authorities are captives of a double-entry accounting system that does not consider ecological challenges. In order to record and integrate ecological impacts, a conversion to single-entry accounting is not necessary. Accounts for ecological impacts can be added to traditional double-entry accounts in order to demonstrate the environmental impact of particular corporate activities. Then, monetary authorities could require banks to consider such ecological accounts when making loans and, in turn, consider that database in their relationships with the banks.","Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Hayden, FG (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",,,,,,,,14,2,2,1,17,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Assessing the Evidence,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; OCCUPATIONAL CHOICE; PERSISTENT POVERTY; WELFARE DYNAMICS; GROWTH; MICROENTERPRISES; INCOME; POPULATION; INEQUALITY; MIGRATION,"A poverty trap can be understood as a set of self-reinforcing mechanisms whereby countries start poor and remain poor: poverty begets poverty, so that current poverty is itself a direct cause of poverty in the future. The idea of a poverty trap has this striking implication for policy: much poverty is needless, in the sense that a different equilibrium is possible and one-time policy efforts to break the poverty trap may have lasting effects. But what does the modern evidence suggest about the extent to which poverty traps exist in practice and the underlying mechanisms that may be involved? The main mechanisms we examine include S-shaped savings functions at the country level; big-push theories of development based on coordination failures; hunger-based traps which rely on physical work capacity rising nonlinearly with food intake at low levels; and occupational poverty traps whereby poor individuals who start businesses that are too small will be trapped earning subsistence returns. We conclude that these types of poverty traps are rare and largely limited to remote or otherwise disadvantaged areas. We discuss behavioral poverty traps as a recent area of research, and geographic poverty traps as the most likely form of a trap. The resulting policy prescriptions are quite different from the calls for a big push in aid or an expansion of microfinance. The more-likely poverty traps call for action in less-traditional policy areas such as promoting more migration.","[Kraay, Aart; McKenzie, David] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Kraay, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",akraay@worldbank.org; dmckenzie@worldbank.org,,,,,,,58,121,149,4,57,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

It uses a modified version of the methodology pioneered by Pissarides and Weber. The extent of income underreporting is estimated by comparing food Engel curves for households with and without reported business income. The baseline result is that the reported total income of households with business income above 20% of total income must be multiplied by 2.6 in order to attain the same propensity to food consumption as households of wage earners. In this sense, households with business income underreport 62% of their true' total income. Households with reported business income above 0 but below 20% also underreport income but to a lesser extent. The estimates are higher than those found for developed countries but consistent with other studies of unreported activities in transition countries.","[Kukk, Merike; Staehr, Karsten] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Staehr, Karsten] Eesti Pank, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology; Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank),"Kukk, M (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",merike.kukk@ttu.ee,"Kukk, Merike/ABA-8594-2021; Staehr, Karsten/G-4707-2016","Kukk, Merike/0000-0001-9804-8472; Staehr, Karsten/0000-0002-2128-6672",,,,,32,38,39,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUN,2014,26.0,2,,,,,257,276,,10.1080/14631377.2014.904110,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AH8GK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000336374800006,0

In equilibrium decisions are identical from the first or second player onwards in all experimental conditions. However, complete adherence to equilibrium play is seldom observed in our experiment. We further analyze our data using a quantal response equilibrium approach and test for behavioral regularities related to base rate fallacy/conservatism bias, social conformity/rebelliousness, and preference for experimentation (preferring the lottery with potentially more information spillover value). Our estimations reveal a consistent preference for experimentation across conditions, and further analysis offers some support to our surmise that this behavioral regularity is due, in part, to an attempt to influence others behind in the queue.","[Mak, Vincent] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Zwick, Rami] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Business Adm, Dept Management & Mkt, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of Cambridge; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Mak, V (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",v.mak@jbs.cam.ac.uk; ramiz@ucr.edu,,"Zwick, Rami/0000-0003-1241-0464",,,,,32,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The negative income shock can affect the mental health status of the individual who directly experiences such displacement, as well as the psychological well-being of his partner; also, job loss may have a significantly detrimental effect on life satisfaction, self-esteem and on the individual's perceived role in society. This analysis is based on a sample of married and cohabitating couples from the first 14 waves of the British Household Panel Survey. In order to correct for the possible endogeneity of job loss, data from employment histories is utilised and redundancies (different from dismissals) in declining industries are used as an indicator of exogenous job loss. Results show evidence that couples in which the husband experiences a job loss are more likely to experience poor mental health.","Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Mendolia, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",silvia_mendolia@uow.edu.au,,"Mendolia, Silvia/0000-0001-8902-6394",,,,,33,35,41,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

By letting the MNC choose both leverage and the debt shifting percentage, we depart from the relevant literature which has mainly focused on the latter. Using the AMADEUS dataset we show that: (i) in line with the relevant literature, subsidiary leverage increases with its tax rate; (ii) contrary to previous work, the parent company tax rate does not have a negative effect on subsidiary leverage. More specifically, its effect is estimated to be nil when statutory tax rates are used. When however, effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs), accounting for cross-border effects, are used, the impact of parent company taxation on subsidiary leverage is positive.","[Miniaci, R.; Parisi, M.

I start with the principle of historical specificity, where the known history of corruption processes and concepts are examined. I follow the evolution of the corruption discourse, starting with the classical scholars of ancient Greece and numerous others, who had a systemic view of the matter. I proceed through the micro-views of Roman law, to Adam Smith and others who took an individualist view of corruption, and onto the reemergence of the corruption discourse in the period between the 1970s and the 2010s. In the process, I investigate the micro-perspective, but increasingly center on the modern classical works on systemic corruption. Then, I present the basics of a modern institutional and evolutionary perspective on corruption through the principle of contradiction, which defines corruption as the promotion of vested interests against the common good in the form of bribery, fraud, embezzlement, state capture, nepotism, extortion, and others. Social dominance theory is applied to corruption vis-a-vis dominant and subordinate groups, and the styles of corruption activated by elites are surveyed as they gain resources, favors, and economic surplus against the interests of common people. Finally, I scrutinize the principle of uneven development, paying special attention to four main stylized facts about corruption throughout the world in relation to (i) development patterns, (ii) corporate corruption, (iii) key sectors/nations, and (iv) inequality. Throughout the paper, I outline ways to reduce corruption and modify the structure of power to benefit the common good, socioeconomic performance, and the functioning of institutions.","GPERU, Perth, WA, Australia",,"O'Hara, PA (通讯作者)，GPERU, Perth, WA, Australia.",ohara.gperu@gmail.com,,,,,,,83,17,18,3,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

I use data from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and American Community Survey to estimate the parameters which form the backbone of the simulation. I address selection into both higher education and specific major categories using measures of cognitive and noncognitive ability. Additionally, I present the lifetime premia under various assumptions regarding the magnitude of unobservable sorting. I find substantial heterogeneity in the returns to each educational outcome, ranging from $700,000 for Arts/Humanities majors to $1.5 million for Science Technology Engineering or Math (STEM) graduates (each premium is relative to high school graduates with no college experience). The differentials are larger when search behavior (allowing for differential unemployment probabilities across majors) is taken into account. Finally, I estimate the major premia separately across three birth cohorts to account for the changing nature of selection into both college and majors over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although a bidirectional relation is found in the case of Thailand, since there is no positive effect of energy consumption on GDP, the conservation hypothesis is supported.

To this end, we develop an agent-based model in which alternative learning schemes can be compared in terms of the consumption behavior that they yield. We show that neither purely adaptive learning nor social learning based on imitation can ensure satisfactory consumption behavior. In contrast, if the agents can form adaptive expectations, based on an evolving individual mental model, their behavior becomes much more interesting in terms of its regularity and its ability to improve performance (which is a clear manifestation of learning). Our results indicate that assumptions on bounded rationality and on adaptive expectations are perfectly compatible with sound and realistic economic behavior, which, in some cases, can even converge to the optimal solution. This framework may therefore be used to develop macroeconomic models with adaptive dynamics.","CNRS, UMR 5113, GREThA, F-75700 Paris, France; Bordeaux Univ, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Yildizoglu, M (通讯作者)，Bordeaux Univ, GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",yildi@u-bordeaux4.fr,"Salle, Isabelle/GOP-1243-2022",,,,,,35,6,7,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This is because of the higher human capital accumulation induced by the intergenerational transfer arrangements under China's poor-functioning formal social security system. Parents raise their children and depend on them for support when they reach an advanced age. A decrease in the number of children prompted by the OCP results in parents investing more in their children's education to ensure retirement consumption. In addition, decreased childcare costs strengthen educational investment through an income effect. Using a calibrated model, a benchmark with the OCP is compared to three counterfactual experiments without the OCP. Output in 2025 without OCP decreases about 4% under moderate estimates. The output gain comes from a greatly increased educational investment driven by fewer children (11.4 years of schooling rather than 8.1). Our model sheds new light on the prospects of China's long-term growth by emphasizing the OCP's growth enhancing role through human capital formation under intergenerational transfer arrangements.

There is nothing to match the early psychology experiments where subjects were often swayed by the behaviour of others to an extraordinary degree, but there is plenty of evidence of conformism. This seems built-in to our sociality either because we have preferences for conversation or status which are activated by the knowledge of what others do, or because other people face relevantly similar decisions to our own and so that their behaviour signals something useful to us about the uncertain world. These social influences can cause mischief. The more worrying cases, however, are those where individual preferences themselves change through interaction with others: the strongest experimental evidence for this is with respect to individual social preferences, particularly in a context where individuals belong to different groups.","Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Heap, SPH (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England.",s.hargreavesheap@kcl.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,27,2,2,0,9,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,MAY 23,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201422.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-22,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1MW,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339611400001,0

The difference GMM approach is employed to overcome the heterogeneity and endogeneity problems inherent in dynamic panel data models. Our evidence shows that previous abnormal earnings are a good predictor for subsequent abnormal earnings. Other than previous abnormal earnings, only dividend increases are strongly related to future profitability. Subsequent to dividend increases, profitability can last for four years. On the other hand, dividend decreases, initiations and omissions tend to reflect only concurrent profit performance. It is possible that previous abnormal earnings convey the most information about subsequent profitability, undermining the signalling of the dividend changes.","[Chen, Tai-Yuan; Kao, Lie-Jane] Kainan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Luzhu Township 33857, Taoyuan County, Taiwan",Nan Kai University Technology,"Chen, TY (通讯作者)，Kainan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Luzhu Township 33857, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.",taichen@mail.knu.edu.tw,,,,,,,12,9,9,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

As predicted by our theoretical model, we find that better legal institutions alleviate contracting frictions especially in sectors with large contracting problems, thereby increasing state dependence more in those sectors.

First, in contrast to the prior literature, we demonstrate that the law of one price holds very well within currency unions for tens of thousands of goods sold by each of the retailers, implying good-level real exchange rates often equal to 1. Prices of these same goods exhibit large deviations from the law of one price outside of currency unions, even when the nominal exchange rate is pegged. This clarifies that the common currency per se, and not simply the lack of nominal volatility, is important in reducing cross-country price dispersion. Second, we derive a new decomposition that shows that good-level real exchange rates in our data predominantly reflect differences in prices at the time products are first introduced, as opposed to the component emerging from heterogeneous passthrough or from nominal rigidities during the life of the good. Further, these international relative prices measured at the time of introduction move together with the nominal exchange rate. This stands in sharp contrast to pricing behavior in models where all price rigidity for any given good is due simply to costly price adjustment for that good.","[Cavallo, Alberto] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago,"Cavallo, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",acavallo@mit.edu,,,,,,,56,58,65,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Any random variable is decomposed as a combination of indicators. A prespecified set of collections of events indicates which decompositions are allowed and which are not. Each allowable decomposition has a value determined by the capacity. The decomposition-integral of a random variable is defined as the highest of these values. Thus, different sets of collections induce different decomposition-integrals. It turns out that this decomposition approach unifies well-known integrals, such as Choquet, the concave and Riemann integral. Decomposition-integrals are investigated with respect to a few essential properties that emerge in economic contexts, such as concavity (uncertainty-aversion), monotonicity with respect to stochastic dominance and translation-covariance. The paper characterizes the sets of collections that induce decomposition-integrals, which respect each of these properties.","[Even, Yaarit; Lehrer, Ehud] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Lehrer, Ehud] INSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France",Tel Aviv University; INSEAD Business School,"Lehrer, E (通讯作者)，INSEAD, Blvd Constance, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France.",lehrer@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,38,73,73,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The article argues that bond market growth has been held back by a sharp fall in business investment, which has left firms with little need for bond borrowing. Even so, markets have developed in other ways, to such an extent that substantial amounts of foreign portfolio investment have begun to flow into ASEAN-5 bonds. These developments have important ramifications. With the investor base growing and infrastructure investment likely to rise, ASEAN-5 bond markets could expand rapidly, holding out the prospect that the region could finally achieve 'twin engine' financial systems in the near future.","[Felman, Joshua] IMF, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Gray, Simon] IMF, Monetary & Capital Markets MCM Dept, Washington, DC USA; [Goswami, Mangal] IMF Singapore Reg Training Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Jobst, Andreas A.] IMF, MCM Dept, Washington, DC USA; [Pradhan, Mahmood] IMF, European Dept, Washington, DC USA; [Peiris, Shanaka] IMF Resident Representat, Manila, Philippines; [Seneviratne, Dulani] IMF, APD Dept, Washington, DC USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Felman, J (通讯作者)，IMF, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",jfelman@imf.org; sgray@imf.org; mgoswami@imf.org; ajobst@imf.org; mpradhan@imf.org; speiris@imf.org; dseneviratne@imf.org,,,,,,,23,6,8,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

In order to do so, a dynamic model is presented which establishes relationships between economic growth, the fossil fuel, water and biomass sectors, and energy policies, based on the application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. Among other results, the analysis establishes that, under the optimal path, the price of commodities for non-energy uses should be twice the price of the energy assets. This indicates that sources which are not commodities such as solar energy, wind energy, and geothermal energy, should be used to generate electricity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Two different scenarios for such a haircut are assumed: an expected and an unexpected haircut. In the union, the governments of participating countries pursue national goals when deciding on fiscal policies whereas the common central bank's monetary policy aims at union-wide objective variables. The union considered is asymmetric, consisting of a core with lower initial public debt, and a periphery with higher initial public debt. The periphery'' may experience the haircut due to the high level of its sovereign debt. We calculate numerical solutions of the dynamic game between the governments and the central bank using the OPTGAME algorithm. We show that a haircut as modeled in our study is disadvantageous for both the core and the periphery of the monetary union, both when expected and when unexpected.","[Neck, Reinhard; Blueschke, Dmitri] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Econ, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria",University of Klagenfurt,"Neck, R (通讯作者)，Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Econ, Univ Str 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria.",reinhard.neck@uni-klu.ac.at,,"Blueschke, Dmitri/0000-0002-5493-1893",,,,,16,12,12,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2014,41.0,2,,,SI,,153,175,,10.1007/s10663-014-9252-4,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AG6UT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335554700003,0

The data shed light on the behavior of the intensive and extensive margins of multinational production (MP). To capture the patterns observed in the data, I build and calibrate a multi-country general-equilibrium model of MP that combines a Lucas (1978) span-of-control with an Eaton and Kortum (2002) type model, and includes both fixed and variable costs of opening affiliates abroad. I use the calibrated model to calculate the gains that a country would experience from liberalizing access to foreign firms. Those calculations suggest that the welfare losses of closing up to foreign firms would be around 4%, while the gains of liberalizing access to foreign firms would be large, particularly if the variable - rather than the fixed - component of MP costs were lowered.

Both domestic and foreign investment have remained lackluster post-AFC; while foreigners continue to shun Malaysia, it seems even domestic investors are fleeing as well, with Malaysia having become a net exporter of capital since 2005. Malaysia continues to grow but, without private investment, it is unlikely to break out of the middle-income trap. The crucial questions are: what happened and can it be fixed? We argue that the investment malaise can be attributed to two inter-related factors: (i) distortions introduced by the New Economic Policy (NEP) and its reincarnates, and (ii) the widespread presence and overbearing influence of government-linked corporations (GLCs) that deter new investment. While the impacts of both factors may have been masked during the heady days leading up to the AFC, this is no longer the case in the current competitive environment where residency options for both capital and skilled labor are much greater. Fixing the problem requires addressing the distortions of the NEP and curtailing the influence of the GLCs. Although there have been a few recent moves to dilute the NEP, some of these measures have already been reversed. Similarly, while there has been an active program of divestment from GLCs, there have also been GLC acquisitions in new sectors, making it more of a diversification than a divestment program. Malaysia's investment malaise can be fixed, but not in this way.","Off Reg Econ Integrat Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines",,"Menon, J (通讯作者)，Off Reg Econ Integrat Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines.",jmenon@adb.org,,,,,,,26,12,12,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

To help resolve this pertinent question, we present evidence using Canadian data. We estimate feasible generalized least squares models of annual gender-specific suicide rates in the working age population (aged 25-64) using data from each of the 10 Canadian provinces over the period 1982 to 2007. We allow for heteroscedasticity across provinces and first-order autocorrelation common to all provinces. We posit that suicide rates in this population are a function of macroeconomic conditions (current and lagged unemployment rates and real per capita GDP) and other determinants that might be correlated with macro conditions, such as physician supply. We find that different factors affect suicide rates across genders and that some of the results are sensitive to the specification of the model we use and the regressors included. Generally, economic conditions affect men more than women; suicide rates are counter-cyclical and a higher supply of psychiatrists in a province is correlated with lower suicide rates.","[Pierard, Emmanuelle] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Pierard, Emmanuelle] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy; [Grootendorst, Paul] Univ Toronto, Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Toronto,"Piérard, E (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",epierard@uwaterloo.ca,,"Grootendorst, Paul/0000-0003-1978-2834",,,,,42,7,8,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The benefits of the forestry and cellulose supply chain, which is of global importance, are not spreading through its territory, which remains underdeveloped. Greater Concepcion, the country's second most important industrial conurbation, has not succeeded in establishing a positive connection with its hinterland via its economic networks or with the forestry and cellulose chain of the Secano Interior. This article is based on economic flow data from the 2008 input-output matrix, on surveys carried out as part of a National Fund for Regional Development project (FNDR, 2008) and on studies of Chile and its development types (Falabella, 2000 and 2002).

We argue that the availability of sanctions sets in motion a virtuous emotional circle that accompanies cooperation. Emotional reaction to free riding leads cooperators to apply sanctions. In response, and in addition to the monetary consequences of receiving sanctions, the negative emotions experienced by the free-riders when punished lead them to increase their subsequent level of cooperation. The outcome is an increased level of cooperation that becomes a new norm.

The latent risk factors have three levels: global across the entire banking system, parent-sectoral for the intermediate loan sectors and sector-specific for the individual loan sectors. The aggregate credit loss distribution of the banking system over a risk horizon is generated by Monte Carlo simulation, and a quantile estimator is used to produce the aggregate risk measure and economic capital. The risk contributions of the individual sectors and risk factors are measured by combining the Hoeffding decomposition with the Euler capital allocation rule. For the U.S. banking system, we find that the real GDP growth rate, the global and sector-wide frailty risk factors and their spillovers significantly affect loan defaults, and the impacts of the frailty factors are not only economy-wide but also sector-specific. We also find that the frailty risk factors make more significant risk contributions to the aggregate portfolio risk than the macroeconomic factors, while the macroeconomic factors help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the credit risk forecasts.

This article examines the role of war in generating these differences. It presents a model that shows that when governance institutions are weak, increasing military spending makes a country more likely to win in a war and increases the probability that coups succeed. An incumbent can avoid coups by strengthening governance institutions, but this limits the rents he can extract. Both the optimal choice of military spending and the strength of governance institutions depend on the probability of war. The article predicts a non-monotonic relationship between the frequency of wars and coups and presents empirical evidence consistent with this prediction.","[Leon, Gabriel] Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England; [Leon, Gabriel] St Catharines Coll, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",University of Cambridge,"Leon, G (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Austin Robinson Bldg,Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",gjl38@cam.ac.uk,,"Leon Ablan, Gabriel/0000-0001-9826-7966",,,,,38,7,7,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The simultaneous carrying out of agents' intentional action plans within an economic system generates processes that are at the base of structural change and the emergence of adaptive complex systems. This paper argues that goals and intentionality are key elements of the structure of rational human action and are the origin of emergent properties such as innovation within economic complex systems. To deal with the locus and role of goals and intentionality in relation to the emergence of complexity we propose an analytical approach based on agents' action plans. Action plans are open representations of the action projected by agents (as individuals or organizations), where the means (actions) and objectives (or goals) are not necessarily given, but produced by agents themselves.","[Munoz, Felix-Fernando; Encinar, Maria-Isabel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Muñoz, FF (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",felix.munoz@uam.es; maribel.encinar@uam.es,"Munoz, Felix-Fernando/B-5042-2009; Muñoz, Fernando/JGC-9950-2023","Munoz, Felix-Fernando/0000-0002-5460-9108; ENCINAR DEL POZO, MARIA ISABEL/0000-0002-8764-8285",,,,,89,14,19,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Our findings suggest that the state-level settlement pattern of undocumented immigrants in the US is an increasing function of a state's median family income level, the mean January temperature in a state and the relative size of the documented Hispanic population in the state, while being a decreasing function of the overall cost of living in the state.

In an experiment conducted at a large public university in the United States, we manipulate the salience of participants' multidimensional natural identities and investigate the effects of identity on coordination and cooperation in a series of minimum-effort and prisoner's dilemma games. By priming a fragmenting (ethnic) identity, we find that, compared to the control, participants are significantly less likely to choose high effort in the minimum-effort games, leading to less efficient coordination. In comparison, priming a common organization (school) identity significantly increases the choice of a rational joint payoff maximizing strategy in a prisoner's dilemma game. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The 'new economy' is underpinned by intangible capital and specialised business services. However, despite prevalent empirical evidence, theoretical appreciations of this structural change are sparse. This paper addresses the lacuna by examining the impact of intangible capital on economic growth. It extends the Uzawa-Lucas framework by incorporating a specific production sector for intangible capital and endogenises the human capital effort devoted to intangible capital production. The model provides a novel approach to the analysis of the 'new economy' and the impact of business services on growth. The model reveals that expansion of the intangible capital sector may enhance growth by drawing human capital from the other sectors. This possibility is especially relevant for countries where physical capital is relatively scarce. This has significant policy implications for developed as well as emerging economies.

There are, however, very few studies that analyze how CSR policies and instruments affect the realization of social and environmental CSR goals, such as the reduction of workplace accidents or CO2 emissions. Therefore, it remains uncertain to what extent CSR really contributes to sustainable development and whether it can serve as an alternative to government regulation to internalize external effects from market operation. The present study provides an explorative empirical analysis that aims to fill this gap. We employ regression analysis on a sample of 109 Chinese companies. The estimation results show that having a code of conduct stimulates the implementation of other organizational CSR instruments, but CSR implementation only partly affects the realization of CSR goals. Having codes of conduct without implementing CSR does not have a significant impact on societal welfare.","[Graafland, Johan] European Banking Ctr, Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, Dept Econ, CentER,Dept Philosophy, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Smid, Hugo] Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, Dept Econ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Graafland, J (通讯作者)，European Banking Ctr, Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, Dept Econ, CentER,Dept Philosophy, Tilburg, Netherlands.",j.j.graafland@uvt.nl; h.smid@uvt.nl,,,,,,,62,6,6,1,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR,2014,22.0,2,,,SI,,102,124,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12064.x,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AC5YW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000332597900007,0

High trust and abundant bridging social capital reinforce each other, leading to a high equilibrium where both these variables take persistently high values, and earnings and well-being are high as well, whereas low trust and lack of bridging social capital create a vicious circle, leading to a low trust trap where all these variables are persistently low.

First, our simulations confirm that sufficient capital buffers in individual banks are crucial for protecting the stability of the whole system. Second, we show that the regulatory measures installed as preventive measures to ensure that the banks possess sufficient capital buffers have almost no positive effects on stability when the system is collapsing. Finally, we highlight various data deficiencies which prevent the researchers and regulators from fully understanding the complete range of systemic risk and make it difficult to devise effective and targeted regulatory measures at this time.","[Klinger, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Teply, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Klinger, T (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",tomas.klinger@seznam.cz; petr.teply@vse.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,,,,,31,17,18,1,32,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Our goal is to provide a clear understanding of the role of expectations that integrates across the different papers and specifications in the literature. We discuss the properties of the various limited-information econometric methods used in the literature and provide explanations of why they produce conflicting results. Using a common dataset and a flexible empirical approach, we find that researchers are faced with substantial specification uncertainty, as different combinations of various a priori reasonable specification choices give rise to a vast set of point estimates. Moreover, given a specification, estimation is subject to considerable sampling uncertainty due to weak identification. We highlight the assumptions that seem to matter most for identification and the configuration of point estimates. We conclude that the literature has reached a limit on how much can be learned about the New Keynesian Phillips curve from aggregate macroeconomic time series. New identification approaches and new datasets are needed to reach an empirical consensus.","[Mavroeidis, Sophocles] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Mavroeidis, Sophocles] INET, Oxford, England; [Plagborg-Moller, Mikkel; Stock, James H.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Oxford; Harvard University,"Mavroeidis, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,"Plagborg-Møller, Mikkel/R-2348-2019","Plagborg-Møller, Mikkel/0000-0002-5070-2030",,,,,185,138,148,0,51,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Using a Cambridge model with a variable profit share and full utilization of capital, a fiscal transfer from capitalists to workers is shown to increase (not decrease as Palley wrote) the capitalist share of wealth and to increase the profit share enough to impoverish workers, creating a type of transfer paradox. A balanced budget spending program financed with a tax on capitalists also has this effect. These results dramatize the fact that the Cambridge model confronts the distributional conflicts that the Kaleckian models are able to overlook by virtue of their assumption that the output capital ratio (the utilization rate) is a free variable.","Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Michl, TR (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",,,,,,,,6,2,2,0,4,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

However, participants do select prices associated with high nominal payoffs within a set of maximum real payoffs as a heuristic to simplify their decision task. The cognitive challenge of this task explains the majority of the magnitude of nominal inertia; money illusion exerts only a second-order effect.

We modify the standard model in two ways. First, we allow positive public debt in the steady state as in Leeper [Journal of Monetary Economics 27, 129-147 (1991)]. Second, we add rule-of-thumb consumers as in Bilbiie [Journal of Economic Theory 140, 162-196 (2008)]. Leeper studied a model in which Ricardian equivalence holds, and he showed that monetary and fiscal policy can be studied independently. In Bilbiie's analysis, rule-of-thumb consumers break the Ricardian equivalence and generate important consequences for the design of monetary policy. In his model, steady-state public debt was equal to zero. We study a model with both rule-of-thumb consumers and positive steady-state public debt. We find that the mix of fiscal and monetary policies that guarantees equilibrium determinacy is sensitive to the exact values of the parameters of the model.","[Rossi, Raffaele] Univ Milano Bicocca, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Rossi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",raffaele.rossi1@unimib.it,,"Rossi, Raffaele/0000-0001-7234-779X",,,,,25,9,10,2,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The purpose of this paper is to assess empirically the effects of enterprise credit market and household credit market on economic growth. The empirical study is based on estimations of OLS and IV regression and GMM dynamic panel data model. Using a sample of 27 European's countries over the period 1995-2012, empirical results shows that enterprise credit market affects positively economic growth whereas household credit market has a negative effect. Our finding gives an explanation of the negative effect of aggregate credit measures on economic growth in empirical literature as well as the heterogeneity of the credit-growth across country.

I use real-world data to estimate trade costs and to recover values for these disutility parameters that are consistent with the Nash-Walras equilibrium predicted by the model. In counterfactual exercises, I investigate the effects of changing trade costs on the aggregate level and distribution of pollution as well as the welfare of each country.

While Baier and Bergstrand were the first to show empirically the impact of a country-pair's economic characteristics on the likelihood of the pair having an FTA, the literature has been extended to demonstrate the importance empirically of FTA interdependencethe effect of other FTAs on the probability of a pair having an FTA. In the context of the Baier-Bergstrand framework, this paper delves deeper into the sources of interdependencean own-FTA effect and a cross-FTA effect. The authors argue that the own-FTA effect (the impact on the net welfare gains of an FTA between two countries owing to either already having other FTAs) likely dwarfs the cross-FTA effect (the impact on the net welfare gains of an FTA between the pair owing to other FTAs existing in the rest of the world, or ROW). Augmenting a parsimonious logit model with simple multilateral FTA and ROW FTA terms to differentiate the own and cross effects empirically, it is shown that the marginal impact on the probability of a country-pair having an agreement of either country having one more FTA with a third country is 50 times that of one more FTA between another pair in ROW. The results suggest that domino (own-FTA) effects have far exceeded competitive liberalization (cross-FTA) effects in the proliferation of FTAs.","[Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Dept Finance, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] Univ Notre Dame, Kellogg Inst Int Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Baier, Scott L.] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Mariutto, Ronald] ConAgra, Omaha, NE 68102 USA","University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; Ifo Institut; Clemson University; Conagra Brands, Inc.","Baier, SL (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",bergstrand.1@nd.edu,,,,,,,21,54,58,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We investigate further and demonstrate that, in a stylised model, cronyism in the labour market, (e.g. the ability to exert influence to gain high wage positions without merit), may impact heavily on the relationship between schooling inputs and cognitive skills, due to incentive effects. We then use a two-stage DEA approach to identify factors affecting inefficiency in education performance of OECD countries, as measured by PISA scores. Along with other well known factors, a proxy measure for cronyism from the World Value Survey, explains a substantial fraction of the inefficiency. This result suggests that, as in our model, in the presence of cronyism, incentives to cognitive skills acquisition are dampened. The best way to improve education performance may be to increase transparency in labour access. (C) 2014 Elsevier By.

However, when interest rates are close to the zero lower bound, there is limited scope for exchange rate expectations to be reflected in interest rate differentials. Here we introduce a new mechanism, based on the central bank balance sheet, which works to bring about equilibrium in currency markets even when interest rates are zero. An expectation of exchange rate appreciation will cause foreign exchange reserves to swell, increasing the cost to policy-makers of allowing an appreciation and, therefore, lowering the likelihood of the fixed exchange rate being abandoned. Under normal circumstances, this channel reinforces the equilibrating effect of interest rate differentials. When interest rates cannot adjust only this channel operates, implying that much larger changes in reserves are required to equilibrate currency markets. We develop a simple model to illustrate these arguments and find support for the predictions of the model using data for Hong Kong, the world's largest economy with a currency board.","[Cook, David] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yetman, James] Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Cook, D (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Lee Shau Kee Bldg, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",davcook@ust.hk,,"Cook, David/0000-0002-7936-5939",,,,,23,4,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We employ a Regime-Switching specification which allows us to distinguish between different regimes corresponding to high and low volatile periods. The results show differences in the seasonal patterns in cash and futures indexes due to the existence of basis risk. Calendar effects are also conditioned to the market situation.

Following Rosen (Am Econ Rev 71(5):845-858, 1981), I test if differences in artistic performance have a direct effect on financial rewards as regards physical and digital record sales (direct superstar effect). Following Adler (Handbook on the economics of art and culture. Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1985), I also study sales effects of a media presence of artists (classical superstar effect). Controlling for various contingency factors (e.g., record labels' support, artists' socio-demographics), I deal with an economic issue of general interest: Does it pay more to develop your skills in your core business to perfection or to maintain the current level of skills and invest in self-marketing; and do these effects apply to all folk artists alike? Rather contrary to studies on pop and rock genres, I find that higher ability increases artists' revenues disproportionately, but simultaneously, openly competing for the recognition of one's talent holds substantial economic risk. I also observe a positive effect of various types of media presence on financial rewards. However, these income determinants have different impacts on sales in physical versus in digital markets, and their effects vary across the success distribution from low- to top-selling artists as well.","Univ Munster, Inst Strateg Management, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Meiseberg, B (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Strateg Management, Leonardo Campus 18, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",meiseberg@ism.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,102,10,12,1,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

This approach combines the classical time series analysis with frequency domain analysis and presents the advantages of assessing the co-movement of the two series in the context of both time and frequencies. Using discrete and continuous wavelet methodologies for the study of the inflation-output gap nexus in the case of France, we determine that the output gap is able to predict the inflation dynamics in the short- and medium-runs, and these results have important implications to the Phillips curve theory. More precisely, we discovered that in a discrete wavelet framework, the short- and medium-term fluctuations of both variables are more closely correlated, whereas the continuous wavelet analysis states that the output gap leads inflation in short- and medium-runs.

The model postulates that an increase in the price of oil has negative consequences for the economy if the new price exceeds the maximum price observed over a reference period of arbitrary length. The relationship between the net oil price increase and other economic variables is often evaluated with Granger causality tests, the results of which are sensitive to the choice of the reference period.

We found that lenders behave asymmetrically in response to changes in the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) cash rate. The RBA's rate rises are passed on to borrowers much faster than rate cuts and the aggregate credit card interest rate showed a very resilient degree of downward rigidity. Overall, based on the estimated short-run dynamic model, banks immediately pass on 112% of any RBA's rate rises, but only 53.7% of any rate cut. In other words, the short-run effects of rate cuts were not only less than half of the rate rises but also were delayed on average by two months. As far as changes in the credit card interest rate are concerned, an expansionary monetary policy is thus less effective than a contractionary policy.","[Valadkhani, Abbas] Univ New England, UNE Business Sch, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Maroochydore, Australia; [Arjomandi, Amir] Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of New England; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of Wollongong,"Valadkhani, A (通讯作者)，Univ New England, UNE Business Sch, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",abbas@une.edu.au,"Anwar, Sajid/F-4401-2013; Valadkhani, Abbas/I-6960-2019; Anwar, Sajid/JBJ-1127-2023","Anwar, Sajid/0000-0001-9087-1309; Valadkhani, Abbas/0000-0003-2538-1949;",,,,,46,1,1,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The empirical analysis applies a structural approach in which firm TFP follows a controlled Markov process that is affected by the relative use of labor contracts, and labor services are perfect substitutes but with different labor-augmenting factors. The empirical results show that when including labor-contract composition in the TIP process: i) the difference between permanent and temporary contracts in the labor-augmenting productivity factor is not significant and ii) the incidence of permanent contracts in total contracts has a positive effect on TFP dynamics.

The paper extends the standard New Keynesian Small Open Economy model to include three countries: a small oil-exporting country and two large foreign countries. The model also features three sectors: traded, non-traded, and primary-commodity (crude-oil). The sources of uncertainty are random monetary (demand), productivity (real), and real oil price (supply) shocks. Despite the absence of a non-oil traded sector in this primary-commodity economy, the welfare analysis suggests that flexible exchange rate regimes can reduce external shocks and consumption volatility given certain caveats about pricing-schemes. The analysis also suggests that a basket peg is more welfare-improving than a unilateral peg, as higher volatility of the anchor currency reduces consumer welfare. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The structure of the paper is twofold. In the first part, it examines the relationship between a set of macro financial variables, the main stock indices of Western Europe (MSCI EAFE indices, United Kingdom, Germany, Austria) and the stock market indices of four Central and Eastern European countries using a Vector Autoregressive model. The VAR model showed that during the global financial crisis there was an increased impact of the macroeconomic factors on the financial returns of the CEE countries. In the second part, the paper explores the conditional correlations of the index returns between Western Europe and the CEE countries using multivariate GARCH models. By investigating the stock market co-movements of the countries that have recently joined the European Union with the developed European capital markets, we may see that the level of correlation across markets has significantly increased after joining the European Union. During the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, the indices displayed a high conditional correlation indicating that the financial shocks had simultaneously hit all the regional Stock Exchanges. In the period after the crisis, the BEKK model showed evidence of the spillover effects generated by the sovereign debt crisis over the CEE countries.","[Anghelache, Gabriela Victoria] Univ Econ Studies ASE, Bucharest, Romania; [Kralik, Lorand Istvan] Univ Babes Bolyai, Financial Supervisoty Author, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Acatrinei, Marius] Inst Econ Forecasting, Kiev, Ukraine; [Pete, Stefan] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania","Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Institute of Economics & Forecasting, National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj","Anghelache, GV (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Studies ASE, Bucharest, Romania.",gabriela.anghelache@gmail.com; lorand17@gmail.com; marius.acatrinei@gmail.com; peteistvan_nv@yahoo.ca,"Anghelache, Gabriela Victoria/I-6762-2015",,,,,,25,6,6,0,16,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Recognizing that information asymmetry may be the root cause of the insignificant relationship, we test the relationship further within multiple subsamples and with alternative models.

Using a two-tier oligopolistic structure, we first show that gas storage is actually used strategically even in a symmetric oligopolistic setting along the gas value chain. Storage is then a way to intensify competition on the spot market. Second, we analyze the setting where a company has favored access to storage, for example due to a historical monopolistic position, and we analyze this as a leadership situation in the context of TPA regulation. We then show that this setting compels the leader to adopt a strategic storage decision. This strategy consists of levels of gas stored being greater than supplies available in the downstream market. Such a leader decision is part of a strategy to raise a rival's costs. Furthermore, one can think that optimal regulation of the access to storage facilities would prevent such a behavior. However, especially when storage is not too costly, we show that preventing a storage strategy for the leader is not optimal, since the strategy helps to reduce the spot market price.

This article shows that changes in credit supply conditions have much deeper effects on firms' population dynamics, well above and beyond the experience of entry. I explore the hypothesis that changes in credit supply have important effects on the demand side as well. I conjecture that when financial capital is difficult to obtain, while fewer firms may enter, those entering are drawn from a population with a better distribution of entrepreneurial quality. In an environment where financial capital is easily obtainable instead, the population of loan applicants changes as well, including those in a tougher environment who would not have tried entrepreneurship in the first place. These changes in the population of applicants imply significant effects on firms' life expectancy profile, and these effects are heterogeneous across firms of different vintage. Modifications in life expectancy are likely to affect firms' incentives in undertaking future capital investment and likewise investments in technological innovation. Hence, these changes in overall firms' population dynamics characterize an explicit mechanism through which finance can affect real economic activity.","Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Cetorelli, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA.",nicola.cetorelli@ny.frb.org,,,,,,,36,5,6,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

We show that firms' technological heterogeneity creates the diversification effect for R&D financiers, facilitating R&D investment, and thus leading to long-run economic growth. This result holds even when heterogeneity limits the possibility of a synergy effect between firms with similar technologies. In testing the model's prediction using U.S. firm-level data, we define industries with higher firm-specific or idiosyncratic stock return volatility as those exhibiting higher firm-level technological heterogeneity and find a positive link between this measure and R&D intensity. Our paper implies that an economic growth policy aimed at increasing the diversity of the corporate sector may be more effective in attracting private R&D investments than the one aimed at concentration of resources on homogeneous projects due to the foregone diversification benefit of the latter.

Instead of exploring all profitable opportunities immediately, they first establish themselves in their home countries and then enter new markets stepwise. We argue that this behavior is driven by uncertainty concerning a firm's success in new markets. After entry, the firm collects information which is used to update its beliefs about its performance in a market. As conditions in different markets are correlated, the information gathered in one of them can also be used to update beliefs elsewhere - with the degree of correlation depending on issues such as the geographical or cultural distance between markets. This correlated learning may render it optimal to enter markets sequentially - investment in market A is only followed by entry in market B if the firm was sufficiently successful in A. The prediction that firms start their expansion in markets that are closer to their home base and then proceed step by step is supported by our empirical analysis, which features the universe of foreign affiliates held by German multinationals. Based on a rich set of benchmark estimates and sensitivity checks, we identify correlated learning across markets beyond alternative explanations as a key driver of gradualism in the genesis of MNEs' foreign affiliate networks.

The empirical analysis shows evidence towards the existence of an inverted-U relationship between relative informal sector size and environmental pollution indicators in the long-run. That is small and large sizes of the shadow economy are associated with little environmental pollution and medium levels of the size of the shadow economy are associated with higher levels of environmental pollution. Moreover, using multivariate cointegration techniques, we suggest and test an economic mechanism to account for this observation.

In the model, the decision maker assigns a subjective payoff assessment to each action based on his past experience and chooses the action that has the highest assessment. After receiving a payoff, the decision maker updates his assessments of actions in an adaptive manner, using not only the objective payoff information but also the foregone payoff information, which may be distorted. The distortion may arise from the grass is always greener on the other side effect, pessimism/optimism or envy/gloating; it depends on how the decision maker views the source of the information. We first provide conditions in which the assessment of each action converges, in that the limit assessment is expressed as an average of the expected objective payoff and the expected distorted payoff of the action. Then, we show that the decision maker chooses the optimal action most frequently in the long run if the expected distorted payoff of the action is greater than the ones of the other actions. We also provide conditions, under which this model coincides with the experience-weighted attraction learning, stochastic fictitious play and quantal response equilibrium models, and thus this model provides theoretical predictions for the models in decision problems.","Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Funai, N (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",n.funai@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

One problem in exploring these issues empirically has been the difficulty of comparing countries on the basis of harmonized measures of job reallocation. A related problem is that there may be unobserved measurement errors or other factors accounting for differences in job reallocation across countries. This paper overcomes these challenges by using harmonized measures of job creation and destruction in a sample of 16 industrial and emerging economies, exploiting the country, industry and firm size dimensions. The analysis of variance in the paper shows that firm size effects are a dominant factor in accounting for the variation in the pace of job reallocation across country, industry and size cells. However, even after controlling for industry and size effects there remain significant differences in job flows across countries that could reflect differences in labor market regulations. We use the harmonized data to explore this hypothesis with a difference-in-difference approach. We find strong and robust evidence that stringent hiring and firing regulations tend to reduce the pace of job reallocation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In a first stage, we obtain national income distributions considering a model with two parameters. In particular, we propose to use the so-called Lame distributions, which are curved versions of the Sigh-Maddala and Dagum distributions. The main feature of this family is that they represent parsimonious models which can fit income data adequately with just two parameters and whose Lorenz curves are characterized by only one parameter. In a second stage, global and regional distributions are derived from a finite mixture of these families using population shares. We test the validity of the model, comparing it with other two-parameter families. Our estimates of different inequality measures suggest that global inequality presents a decreasing pattern mainly driven by the fall of the differences across countries during the course of the study period that offsets the increase in disparities within countries.","[Jorda, Vanesa; Sarabia, Jose Maria; Prieto, Faustino] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Jorda, V (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",,"Prieto, Faustino/AAA-3517-2019; Jorda, Vanesa/ABG-7763-2020; Prieto, Faustino/I-1073-2015; Sarabia, José María/F-5672-2016","Prieto, Faustino/0000-0001-7174-5788; Jorda, Vanesa/0000-0001-7722-8351;",,,,,43,6,6,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78350-556-2; 978-1-78350-567-8,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2014,22.0,,,,,,115,145,,10.1108/S1049-258520140000022003,0.0,,,31,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360561500004,0

The framework is a dynamic general equilibrium life-cycle economy populated by heterogeneous individuals with respect to age, income and homeownership status. Inflation raises the non-residential capital income tax burden, affects the user cost of housing capital and raises the opportunity cost of holding money. A numerical analysis is provided based on parameter values from the US economy. We find that housing capital and inflation exhibit a positive correlation while inflation reduces savings in business capital. It is shown that this outcome arises from the interaction of inflation with individual tenure decisions and a number of characteristics and tax provisions available in the housing market.","Brock Univ, Dept Econ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",Brock University,"Koka, K (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Dept Econ, 500 Glenridge Ave, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",kkoka@brocku.ca,"Koka, Katerina/AAA-9938-2021","Koka, Katerina/0000-0002-8834-7994",,,,,29,0,0,1,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Thus, available data of the GEM project allow analysis and identification of potential specific group of transition countries compared to other countries with different development levels in terms of the achieved level of economic development, growth and size and structure of entrepreneurial activity by using the application of statistical methods for determining differences between groups using MANOVA, ANOVA and discriminant analysis.

Not all of this means that the entrepreneurship in less developed countries, in this case, transitional countries, should be discouraged for their contribution to economic development because of the identified environmental limits; on the contrary, small businesses and entrepreneurial projects represent the driving force to go through crises and the factor of economic stabilization in transitional countries.","[Lekovic, Bozidar; Maric, Slobodan; Lekovic, Bojan] Univ Novi Sad, Subotica 24000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Lekovic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Segedinski Put 9-1, Subotica 24000, Serbia.",bolesu@ef.uns.ac.rs; marics@ef.uns.ac.rs; bojan.lekovic@ef.uns.ac.rs,"Marić, Slobodan/ABB-7377-2021","Marić, Slobodan/0000-0002-7414-4037",,,,,33,4,4,1,23,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Unlike existing studies, which provide evidence of a wealth transfer from nuclear to renewable energy firms for specific countries, we use an international sample and investigate whether changes in the regulatory environment and the firm-specific commitment to nuclear and renewable energies correlate with the capital market's reactions to the Fukushima Daiichi accident. Our findings suggest that the more a firm relies on nuclear power, the more its share price declined after the accident. A commitment to renewable energies does not prevent declines in share prices but significantly helps to reduce the increase in market beta that is associated with this event. Nuclear energy firms domiciled in countries with a higher number of regulatory interventions that were triggered by the catastrophe have lower abnormal returns than those that are domiciled elsewhere. However, as a cross-sectional analysis reveals, a stronger commitment to nuclear power is the main driver for negative stock market returns. Furthermore, nuclear energy firms domiciled in countries with stronger regulatory shifts away from nuclear energy experience significant increases in market beta and the book-to-market equity factor loading according to the Carhart (1997) 4-factor model. We conclude that capital market participants are able to differentiate between the affectedness of firms with respect to their product portfolio.

In our paper, we employ these tables in order to illustrate the idea that very inconclusive post-study probabilities that a tested phenomenon is true may result from novel, surprising findings. The main arguments in Kataria (2014) are the following: First, if P(H-0) is unknown, as is often the case with economic applications, the post-study probability can lead to even worse inference than the Classical significance test, depending on the quality of the prior. Second, the simulation in Maniadis et al. (2014) ignores previous assessments of P(H-0) and instead utilizes a selective empirical setup that favors the use of post-study probabilities..

This explorative empirical study is a first step in investigating the relationship between CCM methods and financial performance. The aim of the research is to clarify the conceptual and methodological ambiguities surrounding the justification of using adopted measurement scales. This study is based on the outcomes of a questionnaire completed by a representative sample of 48 Croatian limited companies. The findings highlight the influence of CCM methods on the financial performance of the companies surveyed. They also provide the basis for recommendations to management accountants and raise more questions for research.

The abrogation took effect in 2013. In parallel, the VAT for the purchase of new housing was increased after a short period in which it had a reduced rate. The aim of this paper is to assess the macroeconomic effects of these two relevant housing market reforms. In order to do that, we use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model calibrated to capture the key ratios of the Spanish economy. The model includes a housing market, covering both the rental market side and the property market side and credit-constrained agents. We find that these measures drive down housing prices and have a negative impact on output and employment in the construction sector. However, in the long run, this last effect is offset by the benefits of a reduction in distortionary taxes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Real economic actors, however, are multiple-goal and boundedly rational decision-makers. An exclusive reliance on rational-choice models therefore generates the risk that both the pace and the type of behavioural adaptations to changing institutional environments are misjudged. Against this background, this article addresses three questions. First, can we use business simulation games as a convincing but low-cost experimental tool for policy analysis? Second, how do intentionally varied nitrogen extensification schemes impact the behaviour of students who participate in an explorative business simulation study? Third, do nitrogen reduction policies that are framed as voluntary as opposed to prescriptive schemes have a different impact on behaviour even if they lead to the same profits respectively? In our business simulation game, the student-participants take the role of farmers who are confronted with different policy measures aimed at reducing nitrogen loads. The student-farmers react very differently to different measures even though all measures have an identical impact on profitability. This is an indication that the behavioural changes that can be achieved per Euro of the taxpayers' money, and therefore the cost efficiency (and smartness) of regulatory measures, are contingent on their specific design.","[Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Hirschauer, Norbert] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, D-06120 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Musshoff, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889",,,,,55,13,13,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

For this purpose, this paper uses data from Spain's local television industry from 1995 through 2001, which provide a unique opportunity for examining how firms' profitability changes with the introduction of regulation and a posterior liberalization. During this period, the local television industry transitioned from a state of alegality (no regulation in place) to being highly regulated and finally to being informally deregulated. Using a firm entry model from Bresnahan and Reiss (1990, 1991a,b), we estimate local TV station entry thresholds by number of entrants across years. We find the entry threshold in 1998 increased relative to the thresholds in 1995 and 2001, suggesting that entry was less attractive during the period when the local TV industry was highly regulated. We decompose the entry thresholds into the fixed costs and variable profits, and find the fixed-cost ratios increase in 1998 and stay constant in 2001. Meanwhile, we find an increase in the variable-profit ratios in 2001. These findings suggest that the informal deregulation did not invalidate the regulation introduced in 1995 on the cost side. However, the deregulation seemed to have an impact on variable profits through how local TV stations competed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the experiment, participants make pairwise choices that distinguish prudent from imprudent, and temperate from intemperate, behaviour. We correlate individuals' risk aversion, prudence, and temperance levels to their demographic profiles and their financial decisions outside the experiment. We observe that the majority of individuals' decisions are consistent with risk aversion, prudence, and temperance.

Following the approach of Yaari (1987, 1988), this allows constructing a set of social welfare functions from which the corresponding inequality indices are derived. The obtained measures incorporate diverse normative criteria, with different degrees of preference for equality. The generalized Gini coefficients and the family of indices proposed by Aaberge (2000) are obtained as particular cases. This approach allows interpreting each inequality measure in terms of the statistics computed from a randomly selected sample and the identification of unbiased estimators of the Social Welfare Functions. It also shows that each of the families of inequality indices are obtained from the moments of the order statistics and, therefore, each of the families characterizes any income distribution with finite mean. This characterization is very useful in the case of distributions with heavy tail and pronounced positive skew that shows only a few potential moments.","[Parrado-Gallardo, Encarnacion M.; Barcena-Martin, Elena; Imedio-Olmedo, Luis J.] Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Parrado-Gallardo, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",,"Barcena-Martin, Elena/J-4833-2013","Barcena-Martin, Elena/0000-0002-6381-7507",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78350-556-2; 978-1-78350-567-8,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2014,22.0,,,,,,383,399,,10.1108/S1049-258520140000022012,0.0,,,17,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360561500013,0

For the inflation rate predictions made for Romania over the period Q4:2012- Q4:2013, a fan chart based on BVAR models with non-informative priors presents a lower degree of uncertainty compared with a fan chart using VAR models. The numerical procedure is based on forecasts that use auto-regressive models and the Monte Carlo method. In this case, the probabilities that the inflation forecasts are greater than the National Bank of Romania's (NBR's) target and the previous value increased from a quarter to the next. Therefore, this method of assessing the forecast uncertainty is a better tool than the fan charts. Moreover, the simple NBR methodology that did not take into account the probability distribution of the forecasts should be replaced by the fan charts. The forecast's uncertainty assessment is necessary for the establishment of monetary policy.","Acad Romana, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Simionescu, M (通讯作者)，Acad Romana, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaela_mb1@yahoo.com,"Simionescu, Mihaela/AAP-7639-2021; Simionescu, Mihaela/L-1249-2016","Simionescu, Mihaela/0000-0002-6124-2172",,,,,29,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The results herein present that the maximum differentiation (end point agglomeration) is the unique location equilibrium with substitutes (complements), irrespective of what type of competition. We demonstrate that if the unit transportation rate is sufficiently high, then consumer surplus, profits, and social welfare are higher under price competition than under quantity competition for both substitutes and complements.

In less competitive industries where banks are less concerned about financial distress as a creditor, the presence of bankers on the board has higher leverage and more active investment, which can align with the interest of shareholders.

The methodological approach comprises two steps. First, inflation uncertainty series have been created by choosing an optimal Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity- (GARCH) type model. Subsequently, inflation and inflation uncertainty have been observed together by two models examining whether Friedman's and Cukierman Meltzer's hypotheses hold for selected Eastern Europe Countries (EEC). Due to the heterogeneous behaviour of some series of inflation and inflation uncertainty, the unconditional quantile regression estimation technique has been applied because of its robustness to the particular non-normal characteristics and outliers' presence in the empirical data. According to the findings, both Friedman's and Cukierman Meltzer's hypotheses have been confirmed primarily for the largest EEC with flexible exchange rate. In contrast, these theories are refuted in smaller, open economies with firm exchange rate regime.","[Zivkov, Dejan; Njegic, Jovan] Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad Business Sch, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Pecanac, Marko] Cabinet Serbian Prime Minister, Beograd 11000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Zivkov, D (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad Business Sch, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",dejanzivkov@gmail.com,"Njegic, Jovan/K-9087-2019",,,,,,32,13,13,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

In the developed general equilibrium growth model, each final good can be produced by one of two technologies. Each technology is characterized by a specific labor complemented by a specific set of intermediate goods, which are enhanced periodically by Schumpeterian R&D activities. When quality reaches a threshold level, a GPT arises in one of the technologies and spreads first to the other technology within the North. Then, it propagates to the South, following a similar sequence. Since diffusion is not even, neither intra- nor inter-country, the GPT produces successive changes in the direction of technological knowledge and in inter- and intra-country wage inequality. Through this mechanism the different observed paths of wage inequality can be accommodated.","[Afonso, Oscar] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEFUP, OBEGEF, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Afonso, Oscar] NIFIP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Bandeira, Ana Maria] Polytech Inst Porto, Inst Accounting & Adm Porto, P-4465004 Sao Mamede de Infesta, Portugal; [Bandeira, Ana Maria] CECEJ, P-4465004 Sao Mamede de Infesta, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto,"Afonso, O (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEFUP, OBEGEF, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",oafonso@fep.up.pt; bandeira@iscap.ipp.pt,"Bandeira, Ana/A-3005-2017; Afonso, Oscar/B-6016-2009","Bandeira, Ana/0000-0003-2324-9119;",,,,,42,0,0,0,12,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

To do this, we focus on a policy that has received criticism for being motivated by ranking concerns: optional reporting of SAT I scores. This policy allows colleges to report an average SAT I score based on those applicants who chose to submit their scores which may not be reflective of actual student body quality. We use proprietary data from two liberal arts colleges to address how the optional reporting policy affects the colleges' admission decisions as well as how applicants' SAT I scores influence their decision to submit these scores to the colleges. The data suggest that college admission departments are behaving strategically by rewarding applicants who do submit their SAT I scores when their scores will raise the college's average SAT I score reported to U.S. News and World Report and rewarding applicants who do not submit when their SAT I scores will lower the college's reported score. The data also suggest that applicants are behaving strategically by choosing not to reveal their SAT I scores if they are below a value one might predict based on their other observable characteristics.

To this end, we estimate smooth-transition regression models for a sample of 28 emerging currencies over the 1994-2011 period.

Utilizing a new measure of stochastic stability, we establish two stylized facts regarding short- and medium-term distribution dynamics. The first is non-stationarity of transition dynamics, in the sense of changing transition kernels, and the second is emergence, disappearance, and re-emergence of a stochastically stable middle income group. This middle income group emerges as the gap between rich and poor clubs gets larger, and it changes the dynamics of transition to and from the rich and poor clubs, eventually narrowing the gap between the poor and rich as the middle club vanishes. Analyzing the stochastic stability of middle-income groups is thus a first step toward understanding higher-order dynamics of narrowing or widening of the gap between rich and poor countries.","[El-Gamal, Mahmoud A.] Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Ryu, Deockhyun] Chung Ang Univ, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Rice University; Chung Ang University,"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",dhryu@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,41,4,5,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Firms often use bonus-based compensation plans, such as group bonuses and firm-wide profit sharing, that induce considerable uncertainty in how much workers are paid. Exposing workers to a compensation scheme based on random bonuses makes them cheat more but has no effect on their productivity. We also find that more productive workers behave more dishonestly.

Such trading was touted as a more cost-effective alternative to traditional forms of regulation, such as specific technology requirements or performance standards. The principal form of trading in pollution rights is a cap-and-trade system, whose essential elements are few and simple: first, the regulatory authority specifies the cap-the total pollution allowed by all of the facilities covered by the regulatory program; second, the regulatory authority distributes the allowances, either by auction or through free provision; third, the system provides for trading of allowances. Since the 1980s the use of cap and trade has grown substantially. In this overview article, I consider some key lessons about when cap-and-trade programs work well, when they perform less effectively, how they work compared with other policy options, and how they might need to be modified to address issues that had not been anticipated.","[Goulder, Lawrence H.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Goulder, Lawrence H.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Goulder, Lawrence H.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Resources for the Future; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Goulder, LH (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",goulder@stanford.edu,,,,,,,44,69,79,1,67,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

If a demagogue shifts the intolerance curve upward, a multiplier process ensues: intolerance causes inequality, and inequality causes intolerance. Religious nationalism, right-wing control of the media, or a facade of democracy will shift the resistance curve rightward.

One aspect of such research concerns the impact of polarisation on economic growth. Analyses in this field are usually focused on econometric modelling. However, for a broader assessment of the relationship between polarisation and economic growth more detailed analysis is needed - taking into account areas of income concentration and possible consequences for the economic behaviour of individuals and households. The empirical results indicate the presence of polarisation in the distribution of income in 2000-10 in Poland and the dominance of the upper over the lower polarisation. While the lower polarisation is a clearly negative phenomenon, its impact is not directly considered in this study. The upper polarisation - in the situation of Poland - proved to involve positive changes in the economic behaviour of households in the area of saving, loans and labour supply.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Kosny, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",marek.kosny@ue.wroc.pl,"Kosny, Marek/P-5292-2018","Kosny, Marek/0000-0003-3629-2183",,,,,25,7,7,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,DEC 1,2013,25.0,4,,,,,512,528,,10.1080/14631377.2013.844931,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,267OT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328107900005,0

Adapting concepts from the public finance literature, I explore the impact of school spending on the vertical and horizontal equity and its impact relative to other types of public spending on social programs and taxation. Conventionally, vertical equity refers to the size of the income gaps between households. Horizontal equity refers to the ranking of households along the income distribution with any change in ranks producing horizontal inequity. My main findings show that school spending, when converted into a component of income, served to reduce extended-income inequality through improvements in vertical equity without the discriminatory implications of exacerbating horizontal inequity across households. Additionally, this impact was at least as large as that of spending on other social programs.

It generates the disappearance of the procyclical response of labor productivity to non-technology shocks and the reduction of the contractionary effects of technology shocks on hours. Moreover, it is conducive to a drop in the volatility of output, a parallel increase in the volatility of wages and to changes in unconditional correlations consistent with what documented in the U.S. between the pre- and post-1984 periods.

It uses a series of variables to express these effects, which are analysed with a principal component analysis and a regression analysis, in the context of a Solow-Romer augmented growth framework. Cultural background variables are divided in two main groups: Efficiency Orientation and Social Orientation variables. We formulate the hypothesis that within the well-known growth framework Efficiency Orientation variables significantly affect economic growth, while Social Orientation influences are unpredicted in principle. The results confirm that cultural background positively affects annual growth rates. However, Social Orientation plays the main (positive) role. Furthermore, performing a sensitivity analysis on the cultural background, the conclusions confirm that cultural background has a strong interpretive role in annual growth rates. The,deterioration of the Social Orientation cultural background negatively affects annual GDP growth.

The overall topic of the SEM-PLS approach is controversially debated in the literature.

By examining the effects of a set of indicators, economic theory often emphasizes the need for lower taxes and less regulation, but many other factors, such as administrative quality, are frequently neglected. Policy implications are discussed. Estimates for the SE as a percentage of GDP can be calculated and European countries are clustered according to the obtained results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The numerical model features government taxes and spending and a multi-sectoral production structure including intermediate production, specific detail on the energy sector both in terms of primary energy carriers and energy-intensive industries, and sector- and fuel-specific carbon inputs. In contrast to revenue-neutral carbon tax swaps, using the carbon revenue for deficit reduction implies a relaxation of future public budgets as debt repayment results in lower future interest obligations. While intergenerational welfare impacts depend importantly on what tax recycling instrument is used, we find that combining public debt consolidation with a carbon policy entails the possibility of sustained welfare gains for future generations. If social discount rates are sufficiently low or if social preferences exhibit a large aversion with respect to intergenerational inequality, combining fiscal consolidation and climate policy may offer the chance for societal gains even without considering potential benefits from averted climate change.

Several indicators capturing different dimensions of early development in 1500 AD are used to remove the endogenous component of the variations in institutions. These indicators are adjusted with large-scale movements of people across international borders using the global migration matrix of Putterman and Well (2010) to account for the fact that the ancestors of a population have facilitated the diffusion of knowledge when they migrate. The exogenous component of institutions due to historical development is found to be a significant determinant of current output.

Tri-variate GARCH-BEKK models of returns in mature, regional emerging, and local emerging markets are estimated for 41 emerging market economies (EMEs). Wald tests suggest that mature market volatility affects conditional variances in many emerging markets. Moreover, spillover parameters change during turbulent episodes. In the majority of the sample EMEs, conditional correlations between local and mature markets increase during these episodes. While conditional variances in local markets rise as well, volatility in mature markets rises more, and this shift is the main factor behind the increase in conditional correlations.

Specifically, we pay attention to the evolution of budget deficit, taxes and capital spending around elections. Using a sample of the Spanish largest municipalities in 1994-2009, we find that the balanced budget rule has not dampened the political budget cycle in budget deficit. Therefore, our results indicate that although governments are constrained by such rule they engage in electoral-induced fiscal manipulation. In non-electoral years, they create room for manoeuvre to implement expansionary fiscal policies in electoral years. Specifically, there is saving in the pre-electoral year and deficit increase in the electoral year. This has been achieved largely through tax and fee increases during the pre-electoral year and by shifting the bulk of the capital spending increased from the pre-electoral year to the election year.

For realistic parameterizations of our model, certainty equivalent welfare gains from fully tax-optimized portfolio decisions are less than 2% of present financial wealth and lifetime income compared to a heuristic portfolio policy ignoring the taxation of profits (capital gains, interest and dividend payments). Compared to a heuristic portfolio policy that only ignores the realization-based feature of capital gain taxation and instead assumes mark-to-market taxation, these gains are less than 0.5%. That is, our work provides a justification for ignoring taxes in life cycle portfolio choice problems - a wide-spread assumption in that literature.

Starting with a standard experiment, in which the economist has access to precise budget sets, we show that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a utility function rationalizing the experiment, namely, the cyclical consistency of the associated feasibility matrix, is equivalent to the existence, for any budget sets compatible with the deduced essential experiment, of a utility function rationalizing them (and typically depending on them).

Phase 1 required firms to reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions. Enacting procedures to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions (using lower sulfur content coal or other fuel sources) could lead to higher cost, and impact the substitution between fuel and non-fuel inputs. Using a 1992-2000 panel of 34 U.S. electric utilities, empirical results indicate that the procedures electric utilities enacted to comply with Phase 1 contributed to small increases in both marginal cost and total cost. Firms having to comply with Phase 1 were more willing, than firms not subject to Phase 1, to substitute from fuel to non-fuel (labor, capital) inputs following an increase in the price of fuel. Utilities subject to Phase 1 that had a fuel clause were more willing, than Phase 1 firms without a fuel clause, to substitute from non-fuel inputs to fuel when the price of the non-fuel input increased.

We use these conditions to characterize benchmark results on the irrelevance of cooperation and commitment established in recent literature.

Both the OECD regulatory indicator and the TIP growth index have been decomposed in order to bring to light a complex picture of interrelations in which the negative impact of the overall regulation on productivity is the result of opposite forces. Estimation results tell us that only the stringency of entry regulation significantly reduces technological change, whereas vertical integration exhibits a negative and significant impact only on the catching up process (pure efficiency change). Lastly, we found an interesting result concerning the explanatory variables of the scale efficiency change: in this case only public ownership matters, in other terms high levels of public in the structure ownership of electric companies guarantee improvements in reaching the optimal scale of production. These heterogeneous effects are also confirmed when we use a different measure of efficiency, that is, the distance of the actual from the optimal reserve margin. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I find that the urban-rural gap accounts for 40% of mean country inequality and much of its cross-country variation. One out of every four or five individuals raised in rural areas moves to urban areas as a young adult, where they earn much higher incomes than nonmigrant rural permanent residents. Equally, one out of every four or five individuals raised in urban areas moves to rural areas as a young adult, where they earn much lower incomes than their nonmigrant urban cousins. These flows and relative incomes are suggestive of a world where the population sorts itself geographically on the basis of its human capital and skill.

The MNMCPI method allows for the incorporation of group heterogeneity and non-radial slack into the previously introduced Malmquist CO2 emission performance index (MCPI). We derive the MNMCPI by solving several non-radial data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. We decompose the MNMCPI into an efficiency change (EC) index, a best-practice gap change (BPC) index, and a technology gap change (TGC) index, and based on the proposed indices, we examine the dynamic changes in CO2 emission performance and its decomposition of fossil fuel power plants in China for the 2005-2010 period. The empirical results show a 0.38% increase in total-factor CO2 emission performance as a whole and a U-shaped MNMCPI curve for the sample period. Because companies owned by the central government lack innovation and technological leadership, the results suggest a missing link in the role of the central government in promoting CO2 emission performance.

The increase is because of GDP's shift to less volatile services production. VS trade has a negligible impact. VS causes trade to fall more in recession but also increases the share of output that is traded, leaving volatility unaffected.

First, there is a wide variety across autocracies in terms of economic performance: some do much better and some much worse than democracies. Second, economic performance of a given autocracy is more sensitive to leader quality, and exhibits higher volatility. Third, all autocracies, good or bad, tend to have weaker civil societies than democracies do. We attribute these features to the core of the autocratic political institution: the incumbent leader selects the future leader as opposed to citizens at large selecting the future leader under democracy. We deliver our analysis in an overlappinggenerations model where two kinds of dynamic free-riding problems arise. The first arises among different generations of citizens in implementing far-sighted policies. Political leaders come in two types, good ones aim to correct this first kind of dynamic free-riding problem, while bad ones do not care and only aim to steal public assets. Both types need a weak civil society to achieve their goals, but a second dynamic free-riding problem arises among different leaders when it comes to weakening the civil society. The autocratic leader-selection mechanism helps resolve this second dynamic free-riding problem, results in a continuously weakened civil society, and generates large variations of economic performances both within a given autocracy and across different autocracies. A rich set of comparative statics is derived. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM.

Our results show that the DITM procedure generates an after-tax income distribution less unequal and superior in terms of social welfare. Moreover, the assumption (for comparison purposes) of identical total tax revenues leads to the corollary that the flat tax rate under the DITM is necessarily larger than the one under the SITM; being thus, the former taxmethod is more progressive than the latter. These results imply an obvious paradox considering the commonly accepted principle that basic necessities are the same for everyone (Rousseau, 1755).

Our key findings are as follows. First, if the true model can be appropriately characterized as a set of linear equations, then linearity tests that utilize univariate autoregressions of the real exchange rate suffer from an omitted variables problem, which leads them to overestimate the true incidence of nonlinearity. Consequently, studies that fail to control for this problem may spuriously find evidence of nonlinearities in the data, despite the fact that the data generating process may be linear. Second, we propose a strategy that can largely eliminate this distortion. Finally, we find that DSGE models solved using higher order approximations are capable of generating true structural nonlinearities in real exchange rates both asymptotically and in short samples.

The US unemployment insurance financing is such that firms are taxed proportionately to their layoffs to finance unemployment benefits. Using DSGE methodology, we investigate how policy instruments should interact with labor market imperfections. It is shown that wage rigidities in a search and matching environment cause welfare costs, especially in the absence of an incentive-based unemployment insurance. This cost is mainly due to the distorting effect of wage rigidities which generate inefficient separations. We show that the optimal unemployment benefits financing scheme - corresponding to the Ramsey policy - offsets labor market imperfections and allows implementation of the Pareto allocation. The second-best allocation brings the economy close to the Ramsey allocation. The implementation of the optimal policies clearly highlights the role of labor market institutions for short-run stabilization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Willingness to abort reduces miscarriage risk. Because abortions are favourably selected among pregnant teens, those miscarrying are less favourably selected than those giving birth or aborting but more favourably selected than those giving birth.

Furthermore, the percentage increase in bilateral trade is higher for South-South agreements than for North-South agreements. The results are robust across a number of gravity model specifications in which we control for the endogeneity of FTAs (with bilateral fixed effects) and also take account of multilateral resistance in both estimation (with country-time fixed effects) and comparative statics (analytically). Our analytical model shows that multilateral resistance dampens the impact of FTAs on trade by less in South-South agreements than in North-South agreements, which accentuates the difference implied by our gravity model coefficients, and that this difference becomes larger as the number of signatories rises. For example, allowing for lags and multilateral resistance, a four-country North-South agreement raises bilateral trade by 53% while the analogous South-South impact is 107%.","[Behar, Alberto] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Cirera-i-Criville, Laia] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",International Monetary Fund; University of Oxford,"Behar, A (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Room HQ1-6-302A,700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",abehar@imf.org; laia.cirera.criville@gmail.com,,"Cirera Criville, Laia/0000-0002-1133-487X",,,,,57,27,28,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The empirical distribution function (EDF) is by far the most commonly used estimator in practice. It is, however, not the only available consistent estimator and there may be situations in which a different estimator would be able to provide more accurate results. An alternative is to use a smooth estimator of the population income distribution. Two types of such estimators are available: parametric and nonparametric ones. In the first case, one has to chose a particular parametric form for the distribution function and estimates its parameters. The main drawback is the difficulty associated with the selection of the functional'form. The nonparametric approach sidesteps this functional form issue by using kernel density estimators that only impose mild restrictions on the distribution function. This is obviously an important advantage, but its cost is that the accuracy of these estimators typically depends to a large extent on the bandwidth used in the kernel function. Another advantage is that it nests the EDF as a special case. We propose to extend the work of Boccanfuso et al. (2008) in two ways. First, we consider a larger set of parametric functions, including the 5 parameter generalized beta distribution and some of its special cases. Second, we use non-parametric kernel estimators and study their accuracy under different bandwidth selection schemes. Lastly, we provide Monte Carlo comparisons of the accuracy of these methods with the widely used EDF. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

According to the standard New Keynesian (NK) model of a small member of a currency union, policy intervention at country level is not necessary to ensure adjustment to country-specific shocks. Self-stabilization of shocks takes place through the adjustment of prices and wages to ensure that the real exchange rate returns to equilibrium. That this did not happen in the Eurozone appears to be related to the presence of non-rational wage setters in a number of member countries. A related second departure from the NK model was the transmission of non-rational inflation expectations to the real interest rate, propagating easy credit conditions in countries with inflation above target. Problems of real exchange rate misalignment among members were exacerbated by the ability of Germany's wage-setting institutions to deliver self-stabilization. The implications for policy focus on using fiscal policy to target the real exchange rate and/or on reforms to labour markets that deliver real exchange rate oriented wage setting.

This was at least the case in Italy and Britain where central banks provided long-term finance to ailing firms and banks, becoming important industrial players in their countries. This article explores this episode in a comparative setting, and concludes that intervention did not stem from a grand design of policy or from anti-market ideologies. It was, rather, piecemeal and a consequence of financial austerity. It is also argued here that intervention was the outcome of the over-expansion of the heavy industries more than the consequence of the weakness of one particular financial system. Moreover, this history also seems to indicate that the direct management of ailing firms and banks proved less expensive for central banks than the continuous provision of funds to concerns whose managers were alien and therefore unaccountable to the central banks' bureaucracy.","Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Cerretano, V (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,"cerretano, valerio/JFJ-3727-2023",,,,,,25,1,1,0,3,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In June 2010, the Dutch government signed a new pension agreement with the employer and employee organizations that entailed an increase in the statutory pension age from 65 currently to 66 in 2020 for all inhabitants born after 1954. Given the expected increase in average life expectancy, it was also decided that in 2025 the pension age would be further increased to 67 for those born after 1959. This new pension agreement received huge media coverage. Using representative matched administrative and survey data of public sector employees, we find that the proposed policy reform increased the expected retirement age by 3.6 months for employees born between 1954 and 1959 and by 10.8 months for those born after 1959. This increase is reflected in a clear shift in the retirement peak from age 65 to ages 66 and 67 for the respective treated cohorts. Men respond less strongly to the policy reform than women, but within couples we find no evidence that the retirement expectations of one spouse are affected by an increase in the statutory pension age of the other. Furthermore, we show that treatment effects are largely driven by highly educated individuals but are lower for employees whose job involves physically demanding tasks or managerial and supervisory tasks.","[de Grip, Andries] Maastricht Univ, ROA, IZA, GSBE,NETSPAR, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Fouarge, Didier] Maastricht Univ, ROA, GSBE, NETSPAR, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Montizaan, Raymond] Maastricht Univ, ROA, GSBE, IZA, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Fouarge, D (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, ROA, GSBE, NETSPAR, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",a.degrip@maastrichtuniversity.nl; d.fouarge@maastrichtuniversity.nl; r.montizaan@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"De Grip, Andries/A-6021-2009","Montizaan, Raymond/0000-0002-6758-2522",,,,,50,24,25,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2013,161.0,3,,,,,225,251,,10.1007/s10645-013-9205-5,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,206DG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323496800002,0

It finds that in emerging market countries there is a significant correlation between spreads and debt levels. This correlation, however, is not statistically significant in countries where most public debt is denominated in local currency. In advanced economies, the magnitude of the correlation between debt levels and spreads is about one-fifth of the corresponding correlation for emerging market economies. In eurozone countries, however, the correlation between spreads and debt ratios is similar to that of emerging market countries. The paper also shows that the financial crisis amplified the relationship between spreads and debt levels within the eurozone but had no effect on the relationship between spreads and debt in stand-alone countries. Finally, the paper shows that the relationship between debt levels and spreads is amplified by the presence of large net foreign liabilities. This amplifying effect of net foreign liabilities is larger in the eurozone than in stand-alone advanced economies. The paper concludes that debt composition matters and corroborates the original sin hypothesis that, rather than being a mere reflection of institutional weakness, the presence of foreign currency debt increases financial fragility and leads to suboptimal macroeconomic policies.","[Dell'Erba, Salvatore; Panizza, Ugo] Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Hausmann, Ricardo] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Dell'Erba, S (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.",salvatore.dellerba@graduateinstitute.ch; ricardo_hausmann@harvard.edu; ugo.panizza@graduateinstitute.ch,"Panizza, Ugo/AAU-2064-2021","Panizza, Ugo/0000-0002-7354-1583",,,,,39,40,43,2,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In addition, the statistical characteristics of profit rates are analysed. Both of the theoretical arguments are much in line with the empirical observations, because there is only a slight transformation tendency and at the same time profit rates and capital intensity are negatively correlated.

I find that such a policy would have generated a sizeable increase in unemployment and resulted in an undesirably low rate of inflation. Around mid-2004, when the counterfactual deviates the most from the actual series, the model indicates that the probability of an unemployment rate greater than 8% would have been as high as 80%, whereas the probability of an inflation rate above 1% would have been close to zero.","[Groshenny, Nicolas] Reserve Bank New Zealand, Wellington 6011, New Zealand",Reserve Bank of New Zealand,"Groshenny, N (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank New Zealand, Dept Econ, Res Team, 2 Terrace, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.",nicolas.groshenny@rbnz.govt.nz,,,,,,,25,5,5,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

International finance literature is therefore concerned with how institutional factors like property rights and corruption affect foreign capital inflows. We investigate the determinants of the absolute volumes and composition of foreign capital stocks in South Africa, focusing on the role played by institutional quality (property rights), domestic default risk and neighbourhood effects as potential determinants. The empirical results show that secure property rights and low default risk in the host country positively affect the absolute volumes of both long-term foreign capital and short-term foreign capital, but tilt the composition in favour of long-term foreign capital. Empirical results also demonstrate the existence of neighbourhood effects where the institutional environment in Zimbabwe significantly impacts on South Africa's foreign capital inflows. In this regard, weak property rights in Zimbabwe lead to an increase in South Africa's foreign direct investment (FDI), but a reduction in South Africa's portfolio investment. This suggests that Zimbabwe and South Africa compete for foreign direct investment in similar sectors, and present two alternative investment destinations to foreign investors. By contrast, weak property rights in Zimbabwe appear to raise the perceived risk for portfolio investment in South Africa. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Oil-market specific demand shocks account for 31% of conditional variation in economic policy uncertainty and 22.9% of conditional variation in CPI forecast interquartile range after 24 months. Positive oil shocks due to global real aggregate demand for commodities significantly reduce economic policy uncertainty. Structural oil price shocks appear to have long-term consequences for economic policy uncertainty, and to the extent that the latter has impact on real activity the policy connection provides an additional channel by which oil price shocks have influence on the economy. As a robustness check, structural oil price shocks are significantly associated with economic policy uncertainty in Europe and energy-exporting Canada. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The bifurcation diagrams summarizing the dynamic behavior reveal complex cycles and in particular also abrupt changes in the nature of these cycles. We apply new insights from the mathematical theory of piecewise smooth dynamic systems-in particular, results from the theory of border collision bifurcations-and show that the very existence of borders such as capacity constraints or nonnegativity constraints may lie behind abrupt changes in the dynamic behavior of economic variables.","[Kubin, Ingrid] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Gardini, Laura] Univ Urbino, Dept Econ Soc & Polit, I-61029 Urbino, Italy",Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of Urbino,"Kubin, I (通讯作者)，WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria.",ingrid.kubin@wu.ac.at; laura.gardini@uniurb.it,,"Kubin, Ingrid/0000-0002-0974-0174",,,,,29,8,8,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Using a new dataset of S&P 900 companies' choice of benchmarking firms during two fiscal periods (2007 and 2008), I investigate what determines the choice of comparison firms. I find that companies have a preference for choosing higher-CEO-compensation firms as their benchmark. Though I find that companies prefer to choose as their benchmark peers with similar firm characteristics, for CEO compensation, this effect is countered by a preference for firms with higher-than-own CEO compensation. Using the complete map of firms' choices, I implement an instrumental variable strategy that uses the characteristics of peers-of-peers to estimate the effect of others' compensation on own compensation.

First, when firms price discriminate on one and the same dimension, uniform price lies in between discriminatory prices and price discrimination raises profits relative to uniform pricing. This is in contrast to common findings in existing one-dimensional models featuring best-response asymmetry, suggesting that price discrimination can have qualitatively different implications in one- and multi-dimensional models. Second, price discrimination on one and the same dimension is the likely outcome when price discrimination decisions are endogenized using a two-stage discrimination-then-pricing game. Correspondingly, an observation of one-dimensional price discrimination in practice does not necessarily indicate that the underlying model should be one-dimensional. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, non-governors, who rotate voting rights, exaggerate their forecasts: they aggressively deviate their forecasts from previous consensus. The former is herding behavior and the latter is anti-herding behavior.

However, corresponding research on learning about growth persistence is completely lacking. Hidden persistence is a novel way to introduce long-run risk into standard business-cycle models of asset prices because it tightly intertwines the cyclical and long-run frequencies. Hidden persistence magnifies endogenous changes in the forecast variance of the long-run dividend growth rate despite homoscedastic consumption innovations.

The employment level is determined according to different methods of financing unemployment benefits: a wage tax or the revenue from a pollution permit auction. We show that a permit market weakens the trade unions' market power. Furthermore, whatever the method of financing unemployment benefits, the choice of the pollution cap is always neutral for employment, and the level of employment always increases as the pollution abatement technology becomes more efficient. Depending on the value of the wage tax, the employment level can be higher or lower when unemployment benefits are financed by pollution permits rather than wage tax. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By explicitly incorporating and modelling endogenous price series in competing housing markets, our empirical model is able to capture the existence of long-run equilibrium relationships and important short-run dynamics and price structures such as price leadership, price transmission lag and asymmetric price responses. Such multi-market analysis has generalized implications and can easily be applied to analyse the pricing dynamics among other real estate markets in the world. Our major contribution lies in two aspects. First, we employ an Error-Correction Model (ECM) with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) to study the price dynamics in the four largest and key housing markets in China. Second, we uncover a price transmission among these housing markets in China and provide an insightful understanding of price adjustment across markets. The revealed effective price transmission and high correlation among these different markets actually is not a good thing for a stable financial system and for the defence against price bubbles in the housing market.","[Yang, Juan; Liu, Huawei] Peking Univ, HSBC Sch Business, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Leatham, David J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Peking University; HSBC Holdings; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Leatham, DJ (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",d-leatham@tamu.edu,,,,,,,36,14,16,0,117,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These trends resulted in a crisis in the system, and it thus underwent a major transformation as reforms moved the traditional pay-as-you-go (PAYG) scheme significantly toward privatization and personal responsibility for assuming risk. These changes reflect the interests of business (e.g., ITO, 1999; TISK, 1995; TUSIAD, 1997, 1999, 2004) and international financial institutions (e.g., Government of Turkey, 2004; ILO, 1995; World Bank, 1994). This article establishes the overlooked underlying causes of the crisis by analyzing the Turkish pension data from a post Keynesian macroeconomic perspective. It argues that the problems of the Turkish pension system do not lie in the design of the traditional system (i.e., PAYG) but in the changes that have taken place in industrial relations (i.e., increasing unemployment, informal employment, and low wages) and social policy (i.e., narrowing the base and extent of social protection and financing health care and education via market mechanisms) in line with neoliberal policies pursued since the 1980s.","Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Yasar, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",,,,,,,,43,4,4,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

However, in a real investment process, the investment horizon is usually multi-period and the investor needs to rebalance his position from time to time. Hence it is natural to extend the single-period fuzzy portfolio selection to the multi-period case based on the possibility theory. In this paper, we propose the possibilistic expected value and variance for the terminal wealth with fuzzy forms after T periods by using the central value operator. Classes of multi-period possibilistic mean-variance models are formulated originally under the assumption that the proceeds of risky assets are fuzzy variables. Besides, we apply a particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the proposed multi-period fuzzy portfolio selection models. A numerical example is given to illustrate the performance of the proposed models and algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We model firms having the opportunity to engage (or not) faulty management. In case of default, the firms may escape costly bankruptcy by reaching a private agreement with the bank. We show that such renegotiation process may depend on the level of severity of bankruptcy law. Our approach helps in answering the following key questions: can bankruptcy costs always be internalized? Who benefits from accrued severity? Should the creditors accept a certain level of moral hazard from their debtors? Should bankruptcy law be extremely severe in order to ensure ex-ante efficiency? Does such severity depend on the financial environment? The model focuses on three equilibriums. The first equilibrium describes honest firms that choose the best investment project (ex-ante efficiency). Here, we show that bankruptcy costs can be avoided through private renegotiation (ex-post efficiency). Yet, the legislator cannot directly implement this equilibrium as it does not depend on the level of legal sanctions. A second equilibrium describes tricky firms turning to the less profitable and riskiest project. Here, default is still privately resolved: the occurrence of such equilibrium can be avoided owing to a minimal amount of legal sanctions that depend on the level of interest rate. Last, we consider firms that adopt mixed strategies regarding their investment policy. Here, two post-default bargains prevail (pooling or separating) and costly bankruptcy may occur. Simulations illustrate how the bank finally chooses between these equilibriums while the legal environment becomes more severe. For moderate levels of legal sanctions, banks may accept a certain level of faulty management, expecting to take advantage of bankruptcy punishment. An increase in sanctions, however, has a compelling effect on the companies towards honoring their commitments. Once the optimal equilibrium prevails, any additional increase in sanctions is ineffective as the players' strategies no longer depend on the legal environment As a result, extreme severity is not required to ensure both ex-ante and ex-post efficiencies. Last, we find that a more severe bankruptcy law increases the protection of banks and may result in reduction of the contractual interest rate, which on the other hand benefits the debtors.

However, most of the literature on time-varying beta is motivated by econometric estimation using various latent risk factors rather than explicit modelling of the stochastic behaviour of betas through agents' behaviour, such as momentum trading. Misspecification of beta risk and the lack of any theoretical guidance on how to specify risk factors based on the representative agent economy appear empirically challenging. In this paper, we set up a dynamic equilibrium model of a financial market with boundedly rational and heterogeneous agents within the mean-variance framework of repeated one-period optimisation and develop an explicit dynamic behaviour CAPM relation between the expected equilibrium returns and time-varying betas. By incorporating the two most commonly used types of investors, fundamentalists and chartists, into the model, we show that there is a systematic change in the market portfolio, risk-return relationships, and time varying betas when investors change their behaviour, such as the chartists acting as momentum traders. In particular, we demonstrate the stochastic nature of time-varying betas. We also show that the commonly used rolling window estimates of time-varying betas may not be consistent with the ex-ante betas implied by the equilibrium model. The results provide a number of insights into an understanding of time-varying beta.","[Chiarella, Carl; He, Xue-Zhong] Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, POB 123 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Dieci, Roberto] Univ Bologna, Dept Math Econ & Social Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Technology Sydney; University of Bologna,"He, XZ (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, POB 123 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",tony.he1@uts.edu.au,,"He, Xue-Zhong (Tony)/0000-0003-1446-9996",,,,,82,7,7,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

It is also widely acknowledged that an early death is a serious disadvantage, and that attention should be paid to the compensation of short-lived individuals. This paper re-examines the compatibility of those two concerns: prevention against early death and compensation for early death. We show that, under mild conditions, no social ordering on allocations can satisfy a concern for prevention and a concern for compensation. The reason is that if it is socially desirable to raise the number of survivors through prevention, it must also be, under costly prevention, desirable to deteriorate the living standards of the short-lived. We then explore two approaches to the prevention/compensation dilemma, and study the associated optimal allocation of resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This article investigates the domestic government's antidumping duty choice in an asymmetric information framework, in which the foreign firm's cost is observed by the domestic firm, but not by the government. We show that by designing a tariff schedule contingent on firms' cost reports and accompanied by a threat to collect additional information for report verification, the domestic government may not only be able to extract the true cost information, but also succeed in implementing the full-information, governmental welfare-maximizing duty. The antidumping framework within GATT/WTO may thus not only offer the means to pursue strategic trade policy disguised as fair trade policy; but it also helps overcome informational problems with regard to correctly determining the optimal strategic trade policy.","[Matschke, Xenia] Univ Trier, Fachbereich IV VWL, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Matschke, Xenia] CESifo, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Schoettner, Anja] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",Universitat Trier; Ifo Institut; University of Konstanz,"Matschke, X (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Fachbereich IV VWL, Univ Ring 15, D-54296 Trier, Germany.",matschke@uni-trier.de; anja.schoettner@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,14,2,3,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The basic intuition for the model is that a consumer who may be misperceiving the price of the green good (the active transportation mode) would be willing to pay a positive amount from her income in the current period to resolve the misperception going forward. We posit that the basis for the price misperception in the active transportation context is misperception of the relative risks involved in taking that mode. The compensating variation that aligns perceived and objective risk is derived. We show how raising green consumption via price misperception correction can be superior to traditional economic policy instruments.

These subsidies generally emerge through selling public resources such as gas, oil, and water at a lower price to one or more sectors. They are not considered in government payments and national accounts. Hence, it is expected that any change in the size of these subsidies influences the price of the relative sectors through the intermediate expenditures. This paper aims at developing the Table Adjusting Price (TAP) and Standard Leontief Price (SLP) models to measure the effect of an exogenous change in the size of implicit subsidy on the price indices of all sectors.

Skill acquisition is measured directly through subjective assessments. We find that higher educated workers are more likely to acquire additional skills. While this is primarily explained by between-occupation effects, also within-occupation effects are revealed. Undereducated workers have lower overall skill acquisition probabilities than adequately educated workers in similar occupations; overeducated workers with a vocational degree acquire fewer transferable or general skills than their adequately educated colleagues. Overeducated workers also acquire fewer additional skills than adequately educated workers with similar educational backgrounds.","[Verhaest, Dieter] Hgsk Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium; [Verhaest, Dieter; Omey, Eddy] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Verhaest, D (通讯作者)，Hgsk Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.",,"Verhaest, Dieter/W-8288-2018","Verhaest, Dieter/0000-0002-4787-6427",,,,,44,9,9,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

For professional stock analysts and fund managers, how to select necessary technical indicators to forecast stock trends is important. Traditionally, stock analysts have used linear time series models for stock forecasting. However, the results would be in doubt when the forecasting problems are nonlinear. Further, stock market investors usually make short-term decisions based on recent price fluctuations, but most time series models only use the last period of stock prices in forecasting. In this paper, the proposed hybrid model utilizes an adaptive expectation genetic algorithm to optimize adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for predicting stock price trends, and four proposed procedures are included in the hybrid model for forecasting: (1) select essential technical indicators from popular indicators by a cited paper (Cheng et al., 2010); (2) use subtractive clustering to partition technical indicator values into linguistic values based on an objective data discretization method; (3) employ fuzzy inference system (FIS) to build linguistic rules from the linguistic technical indicator dataset and optimize the FIS parameters by adaptive network; and (4) refine the proposed model using the adaptive expectation model, which optimizes parameter by genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified with performance evaluations and root mean squared error (RMSE), and a 6-year period of TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) is selected as the experimental datasets. The experimental results have shown that the proposed model is superior to the three listing forecasting models (Chen's model, Yu's model, and Cheng et al.'s model) in terms of RMSE.

In Japan in particular, with its aging population, cultural expenditures have low priority. This paper examines whether or not local governments strategically influence each other with respect to cultural spending, using data from Japanese local governments. By estimating the reaction functions for local cultural expenditures, we find that there exists free-rider behaviour between local cultural expenditures that produce beneficial spillover effects. We also find a larger free-rider incentive the shorter the distance between neighbouring regions, the shorter the travel time between neighbouring regions, and the larger the neighbouring region's population. Furthermore, our results reveal that the provision of cultural services through intergovernmental strategic behaviours is more elastic with respect to the relative change of the distance or the travel time among neighbouring regions than to that of the population size among neighbouring regions.","[Akai, Nobuo; Suhara, Miki] Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan",Osaka University,"Akai, N (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.",,,,,,,,23,9,9,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

The use of typical experimental economics recruitment procedures made the first two groups substantially self-selected. Because the context reduced the opportunity cost of participating dramatically, 91 % of the adult trainees solicited participated, leaving little scope for self-selection in this sample. We find no differences in the elicited other-regarding preferences between the self-selected adults and the adult trainees, suggesting that selection is unlikely to bias inferences about the prevalence of other-regarding preferences among non-student adult subjects. Our data also reject the more specific hypothesis that approval-seeking subjects are the ones most likely to select into experiments.

We provide two dynamic models. First, we assume non-separable utility function between effort and both of a perk good and money, extending Bennardo, Chiappori and Song (2010). There are two forces affecting the incentive compatibility constraint: higher promised utility makes the incentive compatibility constraint more binding, and if the higher promised utility is too costly then a principal may reduce the implemented effort. When the first effect is stronger than the second, the principal gives more perk good as successful outcomes accumulate. In the second model, an agent can save money privately (i.e. hidden saving), but not a perk good. Increasing monetary payment today makes it more difficult to satisfy the today's hidden saving constraint, but makes it easier to satisfy the yesterday's hidden saving constraint. When the second effect is larger than the first, the principal gives more perk as successful outcomes accumulate.","[Chien, YiLi] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Kim, Minseong; Song, Joon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Song, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",yilichien@gmail.com; minseong@skku.edu; joonsong.econ@gmail.com,"Chien, Yili/I-5741-2016","Chien, Yili/0000-0002-6820-1197",,,,,30,1,1,2,10,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

The analyses are performed using data from the Survey of Income Program Participation extending from six years before to 11 years after the passage of the ADA. The results indicate that employment and wage gaps between disabled and nondisabled men have risen sharply over time.

I discuss the underlying drivers of opportunity that generate the relationship between inequality and intergenerational mobility. The goal is to explain why America differs from other countries, how intergenerational mobility will change in an era of higher inequality, and how the process is different for the top 1 percent. I begin by presenting evidence that countries with more inequality at one point in time also experience less earnings mobility across the generations, a relationship that has been called The Great Gatsby Curve. The interaction between families, labor markets, and public policies all structure a child's opportunities and determine the extent to which adult earnings are related to family background -- but they do so in different ways across national contexts. Both cross-country comparisons and the underlying trends suggest that these drivers are all configured most likely to lower, or at least not raise, the degree of intergenerational earnings mobility for the next generation of Americans coming of age in a more polarized labor market. This trend will likely continue unless there are changes in public policy that promote the human capital of children in a way that offers relatively greater benefits to the relatively disadvantaged.","[Corak, Miles] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Corak, Miles] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Ottawa; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Corak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,59,740,910,53,389,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Moreover, we find signs of increased stress and anger among cohorts for whom access to the technologies is new. We also explore whether increased financial inclusion - through cell phones and mobile banking - has additional effects on well-being in Sub-Saharan Africa. We show that well-being levels are higher in the countries with higher levels of access to mobile banking, but so are stress and anger.

In order to choose whether or not to hide funds from taxation, agents need to know policy choices that each government would make should it come to power. But each government, before it could make its decision, would need to know the choices of the agents who would, for example, produce tax revenues. This informational tension is resolved endogenously. We derive the resulting level of tax evasion in society and the optimal choices made by the potential governments. We examine how changes in governmental structure would affect the level of tax evasion, and how that, in turn, would affect a particular form of capital flight. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We employ a dynamic latent factor model that decomposes excess job reallocation fluctuations into national, regional and state-specific allocation components. We found that the national allocation component accounted for a sizeable fraction of the excess job reallocation volatility across the states for the period 1977-2009, which is in line with the economic theory prediction proposed by Mortensen (1994) and Campbell and Fisher (2000). Some interesting patterns emerged while we investigated the roles played by the national, regional and state-specific allocation components in driving the evolution of small and large businesses across states. Our results suggest that the national allocation component for smaller businesses (1-99 employees) explains a larger fraction of the excess job reallocation variance than it does for large businesses across regions. In contrast, the regional allocation component contributes to a smaller fraction of the excess job reallocation variance irrespective of the plant size category used. Finally, the state-specific allocation component is the main driving force for large businesses. These findings imply that both national and state allocation factors are an essential constituent in job flow dynamic theories. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Permanent residents from countries outside the EU15, temporary residents and undocumented immigrants are, respectively, 12, 29, and 33 percentage-points less likely to own a home than permanent residents from the EU15.

As a consequence, under asymmetric information, the design of these policies is problematic. We propose screening menus consisting of different instruments (tariff vs. quota) designed to solve this informational issue. We first use a simple model that examines a Cournot duopoly between a domestic firm and a foreign firm with linear demand and cost functions, with both firms supplying a homogeneous good on the domestic market. In this scenario, if the government does not have information regarding the demand parameter, which is known by both firms, a menu consisting of a rent-extracting tariff for a low demand parameter and a rent-extracting quota for a high demand parameter maximizes the government's objective function. This menu leads the domestic firm to reveal private information. We then generalize this framework to a scenario with imperfect information regarding the firms' marginal cost. Finally, we discuss the issue of quotas generating public revenues and study the case of a menu consisting of a tariff and a free quota. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we first uncover the patterns of the skill premium for a subset of transition economies, and then we turn our focus to the case of Slovenia, where we highlight the negative correlation between the skill premium and international trade after 2000, when Slovenia's trade with its largest partner, the European Union (EU), increased and intensified. To conduct our analysis, we develop an applied general equilibrium model, and combining a Social Accounting Matrix, Household Budget Surveys, and the EU KLEMS Growth and Productivity Accounts database, we calibrate it to match the Slovenian data. We next perform a numerical experiment that consists of Slovenia joining the EU and quantify the impact of this trade integration process on the skill premium. We also conduct additional sensitivity experiments to quantify how our model's predictions vary with some of the model's parameters, including the role of sectoral productivity growth. We find that trade liberalization leads to a fall in the skill premium of roughly up to 4.5%. This implies that our model is able to account for approximately 46% of the actual decrease in the skill premium observed in Slovenia for our period of analysis.

Thus integration in global innovation networks is becoming more and more important for competitiveness and growth. However, the fact that international collaboration is organizationally demanding raises important questions concerning the relative importance of international collaboration and intramural R&D for innovation performance, and how they interact in determining it. These questions are particularly relevant in the context of SMEs due to the narrower internal knowledge bases of smaller organizations. In the following they are investigated using Norwegian innovation survey data and quantile regression. Firms in the upper quantile of the innovation performance distribution face a trade-off between engaging in global innovation collaboration and engaging in systematic R&D, where both individually have a positive effect. This is consistent with baseline OLS findings. By contrast, firms in the lower quantiles of the distribution are found to strengthen their performance by means of R&D only. Consequently, the baseline OLS regression results fail to capture the determinants of innovation performance for the population of SMEs that are not already strong innovation performers. This leads to a risk of excessive SME innovation policy emphasis on inducing international collaboration.","[Ebersberger, Bernd] MCI Management Ctr Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Herstad, Sverre J.] NIFU Nord Inst Studies Innovat Res & Educ, N-0167 Oslo, Norway",,"Ebersberger, B (通讯作者)，MCI Management Ctr Innsbruck, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",bernd.ebersberger@mci.edu,,"Ebersberger, Bernd/0000-0002-2279-4003",,,,,21,55,59,6,160,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Our results show that, on average, asset market correlations have increased, albeit moderately, during turbulent periods as compared to more tranquil times. The selected financial crises are found to vary in terms of their contagiousness. Interestingly, the level of development in a given country is not shown to significantly influence the susceptibility to contagion. Our testing of CEE transition economies indicates that, relative to the sample average, they are less susceptible to financial contagion. An interesting finding relating to CEE transition countries is that they seem to have been affected mostly by crises originating in the United States, even though we have also considered crises originating in Russia and the Czech Republic in the sample.","[Kuusk, Andres; Paas, Tiiu] Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Kuusk, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tartu, Estonia.",,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,7,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Anecdotes of emigrants with over-optimistic expectations about the incomes they can earn abroad suggest excessive migration pressure. Yet there is almost no statistical evidence on how accurately emigrants predict the incomes that they will earn working abroad. In this paper, we combine a natural emigration experiment with unique survey data on would-be emigrants' probabilistic expectations about employment and incomes in the migration destination. Our procedure enables us to obtain moments and quantiles of the subjective distribution of expected earnings in the destination country. We find significant under-estimation of both unconditional and conditional labor earnings at all points in the distribution for males, but reasonably accurate expectations for females. This under-estimation appears driven in part by inaccurate information flows from extended family, by basing expectations on older cohorts, and by differences in the gender wage premium between source and origin countries.

It is not obvious that sellers benefit from those services. On the one hand, brokers offer potentially useful knowledge and expertise. On the other hand, because the relationship between the homeowner and the broker resembles a classical principal-agent problem, the broker may not deploy services in ways that promote the seller's interests. Yet as long as valuable MLS listings are bundled with brokerage services, homeowners may use brokers even if the agency costs exceed the benefits of brokers' knowledge and expertise. Thus, quantification of the net value of brokerage services other than MLS listings bears directly on the recent policy debate over the desirability unbundling of MLS listings. We estimate the effect of a seller's decision to use a broker on list prices, selling prices, and speed of sale for a real estate market with an unusual and critical characteristic: it has a single open-access listing service that is used by essentially all sellers, regardless of whether they employ brokers. Our central finding is that, when listings are not tied to brokerage services, a seller's use of a broker reduces the selling price of the typical home by 5.9% to 7.7%, which indicates that agency costs exceed the advantages of brokers' knowledge and expertise by a wide margin.

RC requires members to adhere to codes of conduct on production safety and pollution prevention. Using our author-constructed database of 1,867 firms that own 2,963 plants between 1988 and 2001, we instrument for firms' self-selection into RC using pollution-related regulatory pressure on firms that influences their probability of joining RC, but not plant-level accidents. We find that participation in RC reduces the likelihood of accidents by 2.99 accidents per 100 plants in a given year, or by 69.3%. Participation in RC also reduces the likelihood of process safety accidents and accidents related to violations of RC codes by 5.75 accidents per 100 plants in a given year, or by 85.9%. Alternatively, estimates using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) methods indicate that participation in RC reduces the likelihood of accidents by 0.66 accidents per 100 plants in a given year. The reduction in the likelihood of accidents, due to participation in RC, contributes to economically significant averted losses, with savings, even based on the smaller PSM estimates, totaling $180 million per year.","[Finger, Stephen R.] Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Gamper-Rabindran, Shanti] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Pittsburgh, PA 15217 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Gamper-Rabindran, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 3205 Posvar Hall,230 S Bouquet St, Pittsburgh, PA 15217 USA.",stephen.finger@moore.sc.edu; shanti1@pitt.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1127223] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,86,16,18,1,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

This essay is an attempt to rethink that narrative in light of the continued significance of the pyramidal business group as a governance structure around the world. I argue that business groups arise in response both to inadequacies in arm's-length markets and to the needs of what North et al. (2009) call the natural state. In this view, the quality of markets and the demands of the state are tightly interconnected phenomena. Such a perspective explains the emergence of business groups in developing countries as well as their persistence even in wealthy and sophisticated polities apart from the U.S. and the U.K. In the end, moreover, I endorse the view that the much-discussed and oft-misunderstood exceptionalism of the U.S. in corporate governance arises not only from the sophistication of American markets but also importantly from government policies toward corporate taxation and securities regulation policies that arose from the unique Public Choice problem posed by the differential effect on the U.S. of the collapse of globalization during the middle years of the twentieth century.

Information about the higher moments-equivalently, cumulants-of consumption growth is encoded in the cumulant-generating function. I use the framework to analyse economies with rare disasters, and argue that the importance of such disasters is a double-edged sword: parameters that govern the frequency and sizes of rare disasters are critically important for asset pricing, but extremely hard to calibrate. I show how to sidestep this issue by using observable asset prices to make inferences without having to estimate higher moments of the underlying consumption process. Extensions of the model allow consumption to diverge from dividends, and for non-i.i.d. consumption growth.","Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Martin, IWR (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,51,61,72,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

With this novel approach, the elasticity of substitution, associated with the terrorists' production function, becomes a key determinant of the effectiveness of deterrence. If this elasticity is large, then countermeasures have very limited effectiveness when directed at a single mode of attack. If, in contrast, attack modes are complements, focused countermeasures can completely eliminate terrorists' gains. Counterterrorism measures are more effective when terrorist campaigns display little diversity of attacks. The article also identifies when proactive policies are more effective than defensive policies. The supply-side perspective gives a new pessimistic view to benevolence, which reduces the cost of nonterrorist activities.","Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Dept Econ, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Sandler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Dept Econ, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",tsandler@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

A key feature of our solution procedure is the reduction of a three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional problem through a coordinate transform designed to combine the two time derivatives into one. Compared with some previous analytical solutions, which still require a numerical inversion of Laplace transform, our solutions, written in terms of double integral for the case of Parisian options but multiple integrals for the case of Parasian options, are both of explicit form; numerical evaluation of these integrals is straightforward.

We built a simple macroeconomic model which considers an endogenous allocation of aid mixed between the public and the private channels. We derive a non-cooperative interaction-game involving the private sector, the donor and the recipient government. We compare the equilibrium of the game to the optimal level of health aid allocation, showing a gap between both. The empirical analysis is based on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and World Health Organization (WHO) data sets using dynamic panel data model with fixed effects (system-GMM). Our results show that health aid actually reduces adult mortality in developing countries. Furthermore, we show that the actual allocation of aid-mix between government and private channels is not health efficient and there is room for reallocation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical findings based on the gravity model indicate that Oman's imports from Asia are strongly determined by Asian population, Asian per capita gross domestic product (GDP), real exchange rates, distance and Oman's per capita GDP. The results also provide strong evidence that Oman's oil exports to Asia are strongly and equally determined by Asia's and Oman's population. Our findings reveal that while distance is not a friction to Oman's oil exports, it has a weak regressive effect on non-oil exports. Our results also indicate a negative but statistically insignificant effect of trade liberalisation on non-oil exports. These findings certainly have policy implications in terms of Oman-Asia trade relationship and in particular the need for more policy intervention to liberalise the non-oil exports sector so as to facilitate its wider integration within Asia.

I revisit important contributions of these two authors, paying attention to the immediate relationship of the major traits and treated issues between their works. With reference to qualitative change, their joint approach provides answers as to (i) why an evolutionary analysis has to necessarily apply a varied less formal set of methods as compared with modern static and dynamic analysis, (ii) why an evolutionary analysis is a necessary component of economic analysis and (iii) how it can be seen as complementary to modern statics and dynamics. They argued for methodological pluralism, where the choice of methods shall derive from close observation of the subject matter under scrutiny. Georgescu-Roegen's reasoning shows the necessity of interdisciplinary contributions and the interrelation of economic activity and environmental impact and constraints, putting environmental issues immediately on the evolutionary economics agenda.

We apply a framework developed by Schaumburg and Tambalotti (2007) and Debertoli and Nunes (2010) to a standard New Keynesian model with government debt. We demonstrate the existence of expectation traps under limited commitment and identify the minimum degree of commitment which is needed to escape from these traps. We find that the degree of precommitment which is sufficient to generate uniqueness of the Pareto-preferred equilibrium requires the policy maker to stay in office for a period of two to five years.

This is despite the fact that selective institutions typically cost them less, owing to generous financial aid, than the two-year and nonselective four-year institutions to which they actually apply. Moreover, low-income high achievers have no reason to believe they will fail at selective institutions since those who do apply are admitted and graduate at high rates. We demonstrate that low-income high achievers' application behavior differs greatly from that of their high-income counterparts with similar achievement. The latter generally follow experts' advice to apply to several peer, a few reach, and a couple of safety colleges. We separate low-income high achievers into those whose application behavior is similar to that of their high-income counterparts (achievement-typical) and those who apply to no selective institutions (income-typical). We show that income-typical students are not more disadvantaged than the achievement-typical students. However, in contrast to the achievement-typical students, income-typical students come from districts too small to support selective public high schools, are not in a critical mass of fellow high achievers, and are unlikely to encounter a teacher who attended a selective college. We demonstrate that widely used policies college admissions recruiting, campus visits, college mentoring programs are likely to be ineffective with income-typical students. We suggest that effective policies must depend less on geographic concentration of high achievers.","[Hoxby, Caroline] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Avery, Christopher] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Harvard University,"Hoxby, C (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,12,197,298,0,27,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

To this end, we use a multisectoral model including capital goods and the stochastic emergence of new products. We show that faster demand saturation tends to accelerate the growth of employment but decelerate the growth of the real wage. Furthermore, we show that faster demand saturation tends to increase the profit share and the share eventually converges irrespective of the difference in the speed of demand saturation. Finally, it is argued that our model has a critical implication for the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Generically, given a nonsunspot equilibrium, there are Pareto improving (and Pareto worsening) sunspot equilibria associated with an increase in the volatility of the future exchange rates.

D.",,,Energy policy and regional inequalities in the Brazilian economy,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy policy; Regulation; Spatial concentration; CGE modeling,,"The objective of this paper is to evaluate the long-run regional impacts of the tariff policy of the Brazilian electric power sector. This sector has undergone a reform process that started in the 1990s. Since the beginning of the reform, two spatial trends of distribution of electric power tariffs have emerged among the Brazilian states, one of convergence and another of spatial divergence. These trends have been guided by the new electric power tariff policy and by the spatial features of the Brazilian economy, which is marked by a high degree of spatial concentration and hierarchical distribution of large markets. In addition, because of the presence of strong economies of scale, the recent electric power prices differentials might be caused by differentials in market size that provide better conditions for the achievement of economies of scale for electric power utility companies located in larger markets. Given the role of electric power as an important intermediate input in the production process and the interdependence between sectors, an Energy Interregional Computable General Equilibrium model was used to simulate the long-run regional impacts of electric power tariff policy in Brazil. The simulations showed that the heterogeneity of energy-intensity and the differentials of energy substitution drive the spatial impacts of changes in electric power prices. On the other hand, the recent trend of spatial dispersion of electric power prices might contribute to a decrease in the long-run economic growth and to an increase in the regional inequalities in Brazil.

The empirical results show that the nominal interest rate reacts not only to inflation and output gap, but also to the changes in RMB exchange rate. Moreover, the indeterminacy in the macro-dynamics indicates the instability in China's monetary policy, and it stems from two sources, the sunspot shock and the indeterminate propagation of fundamental shocks. In addition, we find that the monetary policy shock affects macroeconomic dynamics significantly in the short run, while in the long run, it only influences nominal variables, such as the inflation and the exchange rate, but not the real output.

In contrast to some earlier findings in the conflict literature, we derive conditions under which war dominates settlement as the Nash equilibrium choice in a one-period game without incomplete information or misconceptions. These conditions are shown to depend not only on resources allocated to the production of military weapons, but also on the endogenous destructiveness of weapons used in warfare. We show that contending parties always allocate more resources to arms productions under settlement (in the shadow of conflict) than under war. When total destruction is less than the difference in arms productions between settlement and war, each partys expected payoff is relatively higher under war. As a result, war dominates settlement. But, when total destruction is greater than the difference in arms productions between settlement and war, each partys expected payoff is relatively higher under settlement. In this case, settlement dominates war and the larger scale of destructiveness associated with higher arms levels generates an effective deterrence for armed peace. One implication of the positive analysis is that, under the threat of conflict, arms reductions for promoting peace can never be voluntary.","[Chang, Yang-Ming; Luo, Zijun] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Chang, YM (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 319 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",ymchang@ksu.edu,,"Luo, Zijun/0000-0003-0046-7666",,,,,51,11,12,1,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

For instance, Austrian firms must provide at least one job to a disabled worker per 25 nondisabled workers and are subject to a tax if they do not. This threshold design provides causal estimates of the noncompliance tax on disabled employment if firms do not manipulate nondisabled employment; a lower and upper bound on the causal effect can be constructed if they do. Results indicate that firms with 25 nondisabled workers employ about 0.04 (or 12%) more disabled workers than without the tax; firms do manipulate employment of nondisabled workers but the lower bound on the employment effect of the quota remains positive; employment effects are stronger in low-wage firms than in high-wage firms; and firms subject to the quota of two disabled workers or more hire 0.08 more disabled workers per additional quota job.

The study of innovation has been addressed from different perspectives. Recently, the literature on knowledge management and intellectual capital has provided new insights (Subramaniam and Youndt, 2005). Along these lines, the aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of different organizational conditions - i.e. structural capital - on innovation capability and innovation performance, from an intellectual capital (IC) perspective. As regards innovation capability, two dimensions are considered: new idea generation and innovation project management. The population subject to study is made up of technology-based Colombian firms. In order to gather information about the relevant variables involved in the research, a questionnaire was designed and addressed to the CEOs of the companies making up the target population. The sample analysed is made up of 69 companies and is large enough to carry out a statistical study based on structural equation modelling (partial least squares approach) by means of PLS-Graph software (Chin and Frye, 2003). The results obtained show that structural capital explains to a great extent both the effectiveness of the new idea generation process and of innovation project management. However, the influence of each specific organizational component making up structural capital (organizational design; organizational culture; hiring and professional development policies; innovation strategy; technological capital; and external structure) varies.

Two out-of-sample measures of skill - a winner and a loser ranking test and a top and a bottom decile test - are used to analyse the ability of traders to consistently perform well at monthly, quarterly and annual time horizons. The findings identify significant persistence in rankings - traders in the top half of the profit distribution in a time period tend to stay in the top half in the next period. Differences in magnitude of profitability between the top and bottom deciles also provide support that persistent skill exists among the top 10% of traders. Detailed examination of annual rankings for those traders who were most continuously in the markets further reveals persistence in profits for a smaller subset of traders, as well as an indication of persistence in the face of losses.","[Irwin, Scott H.; Garcia, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Aulerich, Nicole M.] Cornerstone Econ, Washington, DC 20006 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Irwin, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",sirwin@illinois.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848",,,,,26,6,8,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on these measurements, we quantify the production efficiency of the banks. To that end, the total factor productivity is taken as an initial point, and various performance comparisons are made both within the specified three sub-groups and among all deposit banks in TBS. Within the context of performance measurement, we use input and output variables to test technical efficiency index, which represents a combination of change in technical efficiency and in technology, and to test a change in total factor productivity index which comprises a change in pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. In the calculation of these indexes, Malmquist total factor productivity index method is employed. Computed indexes provide us with the opportunity to make performance comparisons in order to assess which group and bank have comparatively highest performance among the groups and banks included in this study. When we consider the effects of 2007-2008 global crises on Turkish economy, notably on TBS, calculating the performance change ratio for previous periods or estimating the same for the following periods becomes vital in terms of enduringly changing and developing banks. The growing competition in TBS forces banks to attach more importance to productivity factor for sustainable growth purposes. In this regard, Malmquist total factor productivity index gives us the opportunity to quantify the changes in total factor productivity over the years. Accordingly, this study applies group analysis to determine which group is working efficiently. To do this, Malmquist total factor productivity index requires the use of panel data and depicts efficiency changes by years, representing crucial information for us to produce policy implications. In brief, the test results obtained by this study indicate that the foreign banks, thanks to positive changes in their technology, technical efficiency and total factor productivity, are more effective than other private and state banking groups.","[Benli, Yasemin Keskin] Gazi Univ, Dept Business Educ, Ankara, Turkey; [Degirmen, Suleyman] Mersin Univ, Dept Econ, Mersin, Turkey",Gazi University; Mersin University,"Benli, YK (通讯作者)，Gazi Univ, Dept Business Educ, Ankara, Turkey.",ykeskin@gazi.edu.tr,"degirmen, suleyman/B-1869-2016; degirmen, suleyman/AAN-5497-2020","degirmen, suleyman/0000-0001-8750-652X",,,,,32,12,14,0,30,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,2,,,SI,,139,159,,10.2298/PAN1302139K,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,148KB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319242400002,0

The preliminary empirical evidence for European countries shows that this bias was negatively correlated with the current account balance in the expansionary years leading up to the 2009 crisis, a period when many EMU members accumulated large external imbalances. Our simulation results point to significant positive effects of a fiscal devaluation on GDP and employment similar to the ones that could be obtained with an exchange rate devaluation. However, although the effects in terms of GDP and employment are similar, the composition effects of fiscal and nominal devaluations are not alike.

Women, particularly when not menstruating, are less susceptible to the paradox. Those born to not-too-young mothers are also less prone to the paradox. The same holds true for men who have fathered children and had been exposed to high levels of prenatal testosterone, people who had experienced many negative life events, and those who were anxious, excited, aroused, happy, active, or fresh at the time of the experiment.

We estimate a trivariate Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and derive causality tests to simultaneously assess the long- and short-term macroeconomic impact of newcomers on wages and unemployment levels in the host country. The results suggest that an increase of migrants is likely to increase wages in the destination countries in the short run but to increase them in the long run.

The optimal size is of crucial importance in this context and we need accurate measurement for sound policies. This article discusses and implements a nonparametric statistical test procedure for organization scale efficiency. This procedure allows us to test whether the observed scale efficiency is optimal or not, using a smooth bootstrap methodology for efficiency measures estimated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methods. Because school principals do not control for the size of their institution, i.e. the capital available at decision time, the scale efficiency measures are defined so as to include quasi-fixed inputs. The results show that scale efficiency measures are subject to sampling variation. We also found that the schools that are scale efficient are usually mid-sized and large schools, when size is measured by the number of students. This contradicts the largely shared view among decision makers that small schools were optimal.","[Vigeant, Stephane] Univ Sci & Technol Lille, IESEG Sch Management, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, Univ Lille, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Vigeant, Stephane] Univ Sci & Technol Lille, EQUIPPE, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, Univ Lille, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Essid, Hedi] Inst Super Gest, Tunis, Tunisia; [Ouellette, Pierre] Univ Quebec, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",Universite de Lille; IESEG School of Management; Universite de Lille; Universite de Tunis; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Vigeant, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol Lille, IESEG Sch Management, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, Univ Lille, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",Stephane.Vigeant@univ-lille1.fr,"Ouellette, Pierre/GSO-0159-2022",,,,,,35,13,14,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, we find that the economic returns to training for low-educated workers are positive and not significantly different from those for high-educated workers.

The strategic thinking is a structured decision making process that requires an assessment and evaluation of a large number of factors, criteria and data. When dealing with innovative approaches to decision making and strategic thinking it is necessary to follow a standardized structure. Contemporary knowledge society is determined by scattered Information that can be accessed by a large number of subjects. This gives a great possibility to an independent subject to gather large intelligence about the business environment and all other related issues. This large quantity of information has to be structured in a hierarchical manner with interrelations. Even with this access to extensive intelligence the decision making process Is always biased by some degree of subjectivity because it is made by people even with high competency. The paper presents an approach to strategic decision making process that uses well known Porter's Five Forces Analysis amplified by application of multiple attribute decision making decomposition methods Analytic Hierarchy Process and Analytic Network Process. The aim of the paper is to present both methods and compare the results of the competitive strategy decision making process using these methods also with the traditional approach.

Structural changes in society's employment were the outcome of privatization and economic modernization processes. New employment groups according to the economic status such as employers, self-employed and employees emerged. The demand of skilled employees increased. Because of the changes in the labor market, the requirements for skills and competences were altered, which encouraged individuals to make a decision to invest in education. The purpose of the paper is to identify the macroeconomic indicators affecting the investment in higher education and to determine their interdependence with the indicators of educational system. In order to determine relation between the indicators of labor market and educational system it Is necessary to estimate the strength of correlation between them. Analysis of macroeconomic indicators and educational system showed that the research of investments in higher education is an important issue. Analysis of statistical data leads to the conclusion that salary and opportunity to find a Job directly depends on education. Lots of people want to acquire higher education and this fact is changing the structure of the labor market The number of people with higher education will increase rapidly, but the number of Jobs with such high qualification will not increase enough. Therefore potential students will be motivated on economic basis, but not psychological incentives or prestige. Examining the effectiveness of investment in education it is necessary to do the investigation, which could be used to predict what expectations individuals have from investments in higher education. It is important to examine the relation between education and increase in salary and their dependency. The research is relevant in Universities analyzing the market, their attitude and the possibility of providing financial resources for education.","[Giziene, Vilda; Zalgiryte, Lina; Guzavicius, Andrius] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Business Econ, LT-44320 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,,vilda.giziene@ktu.lt; lina.zalgiryte@ktu.lt; andrius.guzavicius@ktu.lt,"Giziene, Vilda/HGC-9674-2022",,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,156,165,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300016,0

First, detailed data allows capturing the effect of differences in emission intensities across countries and over time. Second, relying on Johnson and Noguera (2012), the revised PTT index controls for trade in intermediate goods and is based on value-added rather than gross output figures. Applied to a database for SO2 emission intensities for 62 developed and developing countries over the 1990-2000 period, it turns out that the first extension has a larger empirical importance than the second one. The global pattern is one in which the major rich economies exhibit a PTT index below one (higher pollution intensity in imports than in exports). Trade imbalances tend to exacerbate this asymmetry, allowing rich economies to further offshore their pollution through trade. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that firms operating in less financially developed markets offer lower entry wages but faster wage growth than firms in more financially developed markets. This helps firms finance their operations by implicitly raising funds from workers. We control for local market fixed effects and only exploit time variation in the degree of local financial development induced by an exogenous liberalization, so that the effect we find is unlikely to reflect unobserved local factors that systematically affect wage-tenure profiles. We estimate that the amount of credit generated by implicit lending within the firm is economically important and can be as large as 30 percent of the bank lending. Consistent with credit market imperfections opening up trade opportunities within the firm, we find that the internal rate of return of implicit loans lies between the rate at which workers savings are remunerated in the market and the rate that firms pay on their loans from banks.","[Guiso, Luigi; Pistaferri, Luigi; Schivardi, Fabiano] EIEF, Rome, Italy; [Pistaferri, Luigi] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pistaferri, Luigi] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Schivardi, Fabiano] Univ Cagliari, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Cagliari,"Guiso, L (通讯作者)，EIEF, Rome, Italy.",,,"SCHIVARDI, FABIANO/0000-0001-7708-1011",,,,,42,18,23,2,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

It exhibits non-stationary movements over the sample period 1982Q1 to 2009Q4, allowing us to identify a permanent markup shock. We provide evidence that oil price movements are important for understanding the behavior of the markup, and separately identify both oil price shocks and permanent non-oil markup shocks. Our key findings are: (1) oil price shocks and non-oil markup shocks account for 50 to 80 percent of the variation in the markup, with the former dominating at shorter horizons; (2) the role of oil price shocks is prominent in accounting for the upward trend in the markup since the mid-1990s; (3) the direct effects of oil prices on the markup in the mining sector (which includes the oil-producing sector) have contributed the most to the upward trend in the aggregate markup; and (4) other explanations such as market structure shifts, trend inflation movements and the falling relative price of investment do not appear to account for the behavior of the markup.

Here we put forward a Malthusian model of violence where these trends can be interpreted as a response to easing population pressure, following an acceleration in technological progress. The idea is that agents rationally risk dying in violent resource competition in order to make more of their children survive starvation. Violence carries a positive externality, because those who die free up resources for survivors. This generates a socially optimal level of violence, which can be implemented with the right amount of property rights protection. It is shown that faster technological progress can lead to a decline in violence and improved property rights protection, similar to the path followed by Europe. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that management is more likely to issue cash flow forecasts when a firm has external financing needs or when a firm has more executive stock option compensation. However, management is less likely to disclose cash flow forecasts when a firm has more earnings management. Consistent with the prior research, we document that a firm with high dividend payout, large asset value and high profitability tends to disclose cash flow information to convey good news. Further, if analysts have released earning forecasts, management is likely to issue cash flow forecasts to complement those analyst earnings forecasts. If analysts release cash flow forecasts, management is less likely to disclose cash flow forecasts to avoid issuing repeat forecasts. Our results, therefore, suggest that different incentives drive management disclosure decisions regarding cash flow forecasts in actual practice.","[Lin, Yi-Mien] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Accounting, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Liao, Woody M.] Univ Calif Riverside, A Gary Anderson Grad Sch Management, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Liu, Yen-Yu] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accountancy, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University; University of California System; University of California Riverside; National Cheng Kung University,"Lin, YM (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Accounting, 250 Kuo Kuang Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan.",ymlin@dragon.nchu.edu.tw,"Liu, Yen-Yu/AAZ-2300-2021","Liu, Yen-Yu/0000-0003-1228-017X",,,,,42,1,1,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The research uses inductive approach in which a theory is emerged from the empirical data and observations. The data collection phase benefits from a trade-off based design questionnaire, which was used to collect the comparative data from end customers for each pair of customer value dimension. Due to the pair-wise format of collected data, Friedman test is employed in data analysis phase, in order to prove the validity of dataset in generating meaningful results. Findings are categorized for each dimension of customer value, where the importance of each dimension in comparison with others is discussed. The study results in customer value coefficient for each value dimension in each industry. The proposed coefficient clarifies the priority of value dimensions in different industries based on the dataset. This coefficient enables practitioners to list the corresponding industry customer values in order of importance and support the decision making process in trade-off situation, when improvement of one customer value dimension causes in reduction of the others. The developed coefficient quantitatively states how to sacrifice one and improve another dimension in favour of customer value. In a nut shell, the authors suggest to apply the customer value coefficient for the analysis of customer preferences when trade-off among value dimensions is involved.","[Maleki, Meysam; Cruz-Machado, Virgilio] Univ Nova Lisboa, P-2829 Caparica, Portugal; [Shevtshenko, Eduard] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Tallinn University of Technology,"Maleki, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, P-2829 Caparica, Portugal.",maleki@fct.un.pt; eduard.shevtshenko@ttu.ee; vcm@fct.unl.pt,"Shevtshenko, Eduard/G-7337-2016; Shevtshenko, Eduard/AAX-9827-2020; Maleki, Meysam/J-8583-2012; Shevtshenko, Eduard/AAH-4780-2019; Machado, Virgilio/Q-6959-2016","Shevtshenko, Eduard/0000-0002-1389-3245; Maleki, Meysam/0000-0002-1111-0358; Machado, Virgilio/0000-0002-1165-4339",,,,,27,8,8,1,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Monthly data for euro and U.S. dollar based real exchange rate time series are considered covering the period: January, 2000 - August, 2011. Given significant changes in these economies in this sample it seems plausible to assume that real exchange time series are characterized by more than one time structural break. In order to endogenously determine the number and type of breaks while testing for the presence of unit roots we applied the Lee-Strazicich approach. For two euro based real exchange rate time series (in Hungary and Turkey) the unit root hypothesis has been rejected. For the U.S. dollar based real exchange rate time series in Poland, Romania and Turkey the presence of unit root has been rejected. To assess the adjustment dynamics of those real exchange rates that were detected to be stationary with two breaks, the impulse response function is calculated and half-life is estimated. Our overall conclusion is that the persistence of real exchange rate in Emerging Europe is still substantially high. The lack of strong empirical support for PPP suggests that careful policy actions are needed in this region to prevent serious exchange rate misalignment.","[Mladenovic, Zorica] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ Belgrade, Belgrade 11001, Serbia; [Josifidis, Kosta; Srdic, Sladana] Univ Novi Sad, Dept European Econ & Business, Fac Econ Subot, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Novi Sad,"Mladenovic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ Belgrade, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",zorima@eunet.rs; josifidis@gmail.com; srdicsladja@gmail.com,"Mladenovic, Zorica/AAY-8964-2020","Mladenovic, Zorica/0000-0003-1579-4205",,,,,27,2,2,2,13,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,2,,,SI,,179,202,,10.2298/PAN1302179M,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,148KB,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319242400004,0

Aim of this paper is to find up how economic factors explain migration flows between Czech regions. For testing, we used two types of models: i) the economic one, which omits distance and restrains the influence of population size, and ii), the gravity one, where distance and population are included. In both models, we use as the regressors economic factors that are frequently mentioned in migration literature i.e. average wage differences, registered unemployment rate differences, job vacancy differences. The dependent variable is the inter-regional migration flow, which is in the economic model divided by average population of involved regions (in thousands). Both models are tested on complete dataset for the whole Czech Republic and also for each particular region. The results show that the economic factors play some but not very important role in migration flows in the Czech Republic as a whole. In the case of emigration from each particular region, economic factors are statistically significant in most cases, but in case of immigration, the results are mostly not significant or not in line with our hypotheses.","[Paleta, Tomas; Jandova, Monika] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Paleta, T (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",paleta@econ.muni.cz; jandova@econ.muni.cz,"Paleta, Tomáš/AAB-3319-2021; Jandová, Monika/IZD-5698-2023","Paleta, Tomáš/0000-0001-6690-7906;",,,,,32,1,1,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-248-3095-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,270,282,,,,,,13,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393737200026,0

Financial frictions create volatility. They add an additional, almost acyclical, entry cost to procyclical job creation costs, thus increasing the elasticity of labor market tightness to productivity shocks by a factor of five to eight, compared to a matching economy with perfect financial markets. We characterize a dynamic financial multiplier that is increasing in total financial costs and minimized under a credit market Hosios-Pissarides rule.
