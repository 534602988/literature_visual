Our theoretical model shows that an incumbent politician has an incentive to employ an external advisor as a commitment device for fiscal discipline before being aware of his own competence level. The advisor acts as a restraint on public expenditure, which works to control the incumbent politician's ex post overspending to buy votes. Our empirical analysis supports this hypothesis in the Japanese case where governments with directors from the central government tend to spend less.","[Bessho, Shun-ichiro; Terai, Kimiko] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Bessho, S (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",bessho@econ.keio.ac.jp; kterai@econ.keio.ac.jp,"Bessho, Shun-ichiro/S-1224-2019","Bessho, Shun-ichiro/0000-0003-0667-4834; Terai, Kimiko/0000-0002-3309-175X","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780190, 22530304, 23530382, 24000003] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,61,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Investments in human rights, however, usually do not yield immediate benefits. Rather, they are expected to improve the reputation of the firm over time as a good corporate citizen. As one of the most effective takeover defences, a staggered board insulates managers from the takeover market. Secured in their positions, managers are less likely to be myopic and are more likely to adopt policies that yield long-term benefits, such as investments in human rights. Consistent with this notion, our results show that firms with a staggered board exhibit much better human rights performance.

In the long run, however, overall regulations as measured by DB scores are significantly adversely associated with job growth, while the evidence for a negative effect of EPR seems rather weak.

Then, we pursue a quantitative assessment of this empirical finding using a dynamic competitive equilibrium model in which households do home production as well as market production. The model is able to generate the empirical facts regarding the unemployment benefits and home production.

These studies have typically estimated the returns to education in terms of changes in wages rather than employment, effectively ignoring the fact that during globalization not only wages but also employment patterns are affected. In this paper we use four large-scale representative household surveys from the transition economy Vietnam for the period 1998-2006 to estimate the returns to education taking into account both changes in wages and employment. The results show that the estimated increases in returns to education are lower once changes in employment patterns are taken into account. Journal of Comparative Economics 41 (3) (2013) 923-938.

For those not inclined to adopt, science has provided another option, one based on assisted reproduction through artificial insemination, commonly known as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Under this framework a woman, designated as a surrogate, bears a baby on behalf of the intended parents with the objective of relinquishing her rights to the child after birth. The subcontract for the services of a surrogate or more specifically for the use of her womb can be viewed as part of the literature on outsourcing of production by a vertically integrated family. The lack of universal enforcement of surrogacy contracts in the USA creates a demand for outsourcing of surrogacy services.

Among several key explanations is the fiscal burden imposed by immigration on native-born. The paper focuses on a central tension faced by policy makers in countries that receive migrants from lower wage countries. Such countries are typically high productivity and capital rich, and the resulting high wages attract both skilled and unskilled migrants. A generous welfare state may attract low-skill migration deter skilled migration, since it is likely to be accompanied by higher redistributive taxes. Assuming that a group of host countries faces an upward supply of immigrants, the analysis demonstrates that tax competition does not indeed lead to a race to the bottom; competition may lead to higher taxes than coordination. There exists a fiscal externality (fiscal leakage) that causes tax rates (on both labor and capital), and the volume of migration (of both skill types), to be higher in the competitive regime than in the coordinated regime.","[Razin, Assaf] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Uris 422, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Razin, Assaf] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Cornell University; Tel Aviv University,"Razin, A (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Uris 422, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Ar256@cornell.edu,,,,,,,29,7,7,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In the absence of risk-sharing arrangements such as a credit market, monetary policy serves to provide ex post insurance to smooth consumption. Specifically, issuing interest-bearing bonds restores credit transactions on money through bond-money exchanges. Such a policy has a positive distribution effect, but the resulting inflation hampers production efficiency. It is demonstrated that the trade-off between distribution efficiency gain and production efficiency loss would result in net welfare enhancement if consumers are relative-risk-averse enough.","Kwantlen Polytech Univ, Dept Econ, Richmond, BC, Canada",,"Xiang, HT (通讯作者)，Kwantlen Polytech Univ, Dept Econ, Richmond, BC, Canada.",tony.xiang@kwantlen.ca,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The 2 'corner' regimes, in which only one policy rule is used, are particular cases. The model is calibrated and implemented in Dynare for simple and optimal simple policy rules, and optimal policy under commitment. Numerical losses are obtained for ad-hoc loss functions for different sets of central bank preferences. The results show that the losses are lower when both policy rules are used. This is due to the central bank's enhanced ability, when it uses the two policy rules, to influence private capital flows through the effects of its actions on the endogenous risk premium in the risk-adjusted uncovered interest parity equation.","Cent Bank Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Escudé, GJ (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",gescude@bcra.gov.ar,,,,,,,31,1,1,1,23,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 18,2013,7,,,,,,,,201330.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-30,0.0,,,110,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,185KW,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321967600001,0

However, empirically identifying the effect of social networks on human capital investment is usually problematic because households self-select their networks in ways that may be correlated with their abilities to make these investments. In Northern Ugandan Internally Displaced Persons Camps, networks were not entirely self-selected. Rebel activity, which forced households into camps in 2002, disrupted pre-existing social networks in ways that were exogenous to household human capital preferences.

These efficiency models are used in numerous studies published in this journal and other energy-related outlets. Recent studies, however, have found key limitations of the weak-disposability assumption in its application to environmental efficiency analysis. It is found that efficiency scores obtained from non-additive efficiency models can be non-monotonic in pollution quantities under the weak-disposability assumption which is against common intuition and the principle of environmental economics. In this paper, I present taxonomy of efficiency models found in the energy economics literature and illustrate the above limitations and discuss implications of monotonicity from a practical viewpoint. Finally, I review the formulations for a variable returns-to-scale technology with weakly-disposable undesirable outputs, which has been misused in a number of papers in the energy economics literature.

The test uses an alternative measure of consumption that excludes some problematic expenditure items from the conventional measure and finds strong evidence for the presence of the precautionary motive.

B has private information about whether it is committed to the project or a free-rider. We show that under fairly general conditions, a breakup date in the contract is a (second-best) optimal screening device for firm A to screen out free-riders. With the additional constraint of renegotiation proofness.

There are several interesting findings. First, the gender (male) and academic degree of the chairperson in the SMEs have a positive and significant effect on firm value. Second, social capital (measured by political connections, managerial business association networks and technology association networks) and R&D have a positive effect on SME firm value. Third, the effect of political connections on firm value for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is stronger than for non-SOEs, while the effect of business and technology networks on firm value for non-SOEs is stronger than for SOEs.

Because marginal likelihood based tests are said to perform well in the presence of unavoidable nuisance parameters, this paper compares the performance of marginal likelihood based APO tests and classical tests using a testing problem which has been largely overlooked by econometric practitioners, namely testing for a static linear regression model with AR(1) errors against a dynamic linear regression model with white noise errors. It is well known that the classical tests are specifically designed for nested testing, they are applied to test for the significance of the dynamic coefficient of a dynamic linear regression model with AR(1) errors. A testing procedure is proposed, where the size and power comparisons used are based on near-exact non-similar critical values of tests obtained using the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, as the near-exact non-similar critical values control the sizes of the tests well overall. Among marginal likelihood based classical tests, the likelihood ratio (LR) test and Lagrange multiplier (LM) test seem to perform well under the alternative hypothesis, particularly when the dynamic parameter is large and the sample size is reasonably big. The Wald (W) test is the worst performer overall. This concurs with previous observations that the W test performs poorly in small samples. Compared to the classical approach, APO tests appear to have good power properties, particularly in the neighborhood of the chosen parameter point under the alternative hypothesis. This finding may advance the use of PO and APO tests. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the case when the countries want to cooperate and agree to act so that an international optimum can be achieved. For the cooperative scheme to be upheld throughout the game horizon, both group rationality and individual rationality are required to be satisfied at any point in time along the optimal trajectory. A payment distribution scheme is formulated to guarantee time consistency. We conclude that a payoff transfer is not necessary to ensure cooperation given that the countries are different only in environmental efficiency. However, if the countries differ in terms of damage parameters, a payoff transfer from the country with higher damage parameters to the country with lower damage parameters is required for the time-consistent cooperative solution.

The two approaches have considerably different implications for how human wellbeing might be improved. Research in psychology, prevention science, and neuroscience is converging on an evolutionary account of the importance of two contrasting suites of social behavior-prosociality vs. antisocial behaviors (crime, drug abuse, risky sexual behavior) and related problems such as depression. Prosociality of individuals and groups evolves in environments that minimize toxic biological and social conditions, promote and richly reinforce prosocial behavior and attitudes, limit opportunities for antisocial behavior, and nurture the pursuit of prosocial values. Conversely, antisocial behavior and related problems emerge in environments that are high in threat and conflict. Over the past 30 years, randomized trials have shown numerous family, school, and community interventions to prevent most problem behaviors and promote prosociality. Research has also shown that poverty and economic inequality are major risk factors for the development of problem behaviors. The paper describes policies that can reduce poverty and benefit youth development. Although it is clear that the canonical economic model of rational self-interest has made a significant contribution to the science of economics, the evidence reviewed here shows that it must be reconciled with an evolutionary perspective on human development and wellbeing if society is going to evolve public policies that advance the health and wellbeing of the entire population.

Within technological activities a distinction is made between those supporting either technological competitiveness or cost competitiveness strategies. Demand variables allow identifying the special role of intermediate demand. Job creation in business services appears to be driven by efforts to expand technological competitiveness and by the fast growing intermediate demand coming from other industries; conversely, process innovation leads to job losses and wage growth has a negative effect that is lower than in other industries.

The evaluation of stability and soundness of banks is a complex task, involving a considerable number of multidimensional criteria. It is an idiosyncratic task because of a complicated internal business structure of banks, intertwined cash flows and strong influence of market conditions on soundness levels. In this paper, soundness and stability dynamics of commercial banks registered in Lithuania was evaluated by using several multiple criteria methods from simpler ones to the more sophisticated PROMETHEE method. The results obtained indicate that the levels of soundness and stability of banks operating in the developing Lithuanian market of commercial banks noticeably fluctuate. A comparison of the obtained results reveals the causes of the fluctuations. A simultaneous use of different multiple criteria methods for evaluating the soundness and stability of commercial banks increases the robustness of the evaluation.","[Ginevicius, Romualdas; Podviezko, Askoldas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-12230 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Ginevicius, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekioave 11, LT-12230 Vilnius, Lithuania.",romualdas.ginevicius@vgtu.lt; askoldas.podviezko@vgtu.lt,"Podviezko, Askoldas/F-6197-2010","Ginevicius, Romualdas/0000-0003-2067-4398",,,,,30,33,34,3,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

AHEAD data from 1993 and 1995 and a two-party choice model are used to guide the estimation of OLS and binary logit models of the amount and likelihood of inter-vivos transfers to children and informal care of parents. Results suggest that both parents' characteristics and their offspring's characteristics affect parental gifts to children and children's time assistance to their parents, highlighting the interdependent nature of these decisions. Furthermore, though state policies did not consistently affect parental gift giving, the availability of state respite care support -short-term breaks for informal family caregivers- (1 % significance level) and adult day care centers (5 % significance level) were positively related to the amount and likelihood of children's time assistance to their parents. These findings highlight the importance of some state programs such as respite care support in encouraging intra-family support for the elderly.

I begin by pointing out the strengths and limitations of existing data sources. I then describe six striking patterns in graduation rates. They include stagnation over the last three decades of the twentieth century, significant race-, income-, and gender-based gaps, and significant increases in graduation rates over the first decade of the twenty-first century, especially among blacks and Hispanics. I then describe the models economists use to explain the decisions of individuals to invest in schooling, and examine the extent to which the parameters of the models explain recent patterns in graduation rates. I find that increases in the nonmonetary costs of completing high school and the increasing availability of the GED credential help to explain stagnation in the face of substantial gaps between the wages of high school graduates and school dropouts. I point out that there are several hypotheses, but to date, very little evidence to explain the increases in high school graduation rates over the first decade of the twenty-first century. I conclude by reviewing the evidence on effective strategies to increase high school graduation rates, and explaining why the causal evidence is quite modest.","[Murnane, Richard J.] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Murnane, Richard J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Murnane, RJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,148,116,211,0,60,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Contrary to the established post-Keynesian, or evolutionary, view, this paper argues that money has always been endogenous, irrespective of the historical period. Instead of the evolutionary theory of money and banking that can be traced back to Chick (1986), this paper puts forward a revolutionary definition of endogenous money consistent with many aspects of post-Keynesian economics as well as with the monetary circuit approach. This alternative starting point leads to the conclusion that money is indeed 'always and everywhere' an endogenous phenomenon.

This result stems from a trade-off between the government's shadow costs of financing the construction and the operation of the facility and the excessive usage price that the consumer may face during the concession period.

Our innovative approach consists on carrying out a wavelet decomposition of return time series before investigating the correlation dynamics across stock markets during the recent financial crisis. It thus enables us to show how the contagion dynamics between international stock market returns are changing across time scales corresponding to investors with heterogeneous time horizons. Moreover, our results reveal that the contagion dynamics depends on the bull or bear periods of stock markets, on stock markets maturity, and on regional aspects. Therefore, all these finding should be considered from an international portfolio diversification perspective. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The idea that law shapes finance implies that the legal system can be clearly differentiated in theoretical terms from the economy, and that the independent causal influence of the law on financial outcomes can be measured empirically. It will be argued that this can best be achieved by placing empirical research on law and finance in an evolutionary-theoretical perspective, which draws on related developments in game theory and systems theory, in the statistical study of law ('leximetrics'), and in time-series econometrics.

As a result, the intermediation margin on bank loans increases with the changeover from non-risk to risk-based capital requirements, thereby making lending more expensive. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Shanghai has experienced a major breakthrough in its export-driven economy and in industrial upgrading since the opening of the Pudong area in the 1990s. Shanghai has also ramped up its efforts to catch up with Hong Kong and has already become one of the world's foremost manufacturing and export hubs. At the same time, and particularly following the 1997 Asian economic crisis, Hong Kong has redoubled efforts to identify shortcomings in its economic architecture; and has explored plans to transcend its traditional role as a financial hub, to attract entrepreneurial hi-tech talent, and to overcome inequitable income growth. This paper explores the development trajectories of these two cities and how they depart from the pre-1978 development models.

Combining data from the latest census in Yemen with a weather database as well as other geographic information, we assess the push and pull factors that may drive migration. These factors include climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall and their variability, socio-economic factors such as the attractiveness of the areas of origin and destination among others in terms of employment, education, and irrigation, and cost factors as proxied by the distance between the places of origin and destination.

This paper proposes a transformation of the reserve regime that would cause Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued by the International Monetary Fund to become the main reserve asset.

In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by utilizing new and internationally comparable databases such as those of the Global Fortune 500, the Business Week 1000, and the Forbes 2000 publications, and by using rigorous quantitative methods. We measure big businesses by both the number of these firms and by their sales volumes in each country. The empirical results of all models consistently show four major patterns. First, big businesses have a significant and positive effect on economic growth. Second, such businesses in each nation are positively associated with stability in economic growth. Third, the significant and positive effect of big businesses on economic growth remains even with the inclusion in the estimations of the share of SME employment and the control for possible endogeneity in big businesses and SMEs. Fourth, in considering both the absolute and the relative presence of big businesses within each country, their absolute presence is positively linked to economic growth, whereas the relative presence of big businesses within the national economy is negatively linked to economic growth.

To this end, we have matched information collected from the OECD Health Data 2010 with data gathered from the Scopus database on the papers published and their relative citations. Our empirical results suggest that medical research plays an important role in explaining health care productivity, although various countries are characterized by different velocities in assimilating scientific knowledge. Another important result that emerges from our work is that countries characterized by a faster absorption of academic science, such as the US, have on average a milder impact of scientific research on health productivity, compared with countries with slower absorption. As one would expect, we also find that countries absorbing more scientific research also bear higher health costs. Results from this study may support policy makers in designing incentive mechanisms to improve the impact of medical research on the health care system.

We consider the merger incentive of each firm's owner when the wage level is determined through bargaining between the firm's owner and union. We derive a condition for both the degree of cost asymmetry among existing firms and the relative bargaining power of each firm's owner to her/his union such that each ownership structure can be observed in equilibrium. We also show that although the two types of ownership structures with the merger involving the least efficient firm can be equilibria and socially optimal, these structures are observed only when both the degree of cost asymmetry and the relative bargaining power of each firm's owner are moderate. Finally, we analyse the relationship among the cooperative game approach employed in this paper and two non-cooperative merger formation approaches, and examine the robustness of the results obtained in this paper against the change in the assumption regarding each firm's cost function.","Gunma Univ, Fac Social & Informat Studies, Maebashi, Gunma 3718510, Japan",Gunma University,"Nakamura, Y (通讯作者)，Gunma Univ, Fac Social & Informat Studies, 4-2 Aramaki Machi, Maebashi, Gunma 3718510, Japan.",yasuhiko.r.nakamura@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,0,0,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

We introduce carry traders in a heterogeneous agent model in addition to fundamentalists and chartists. Our model has the ability to produce the stylized facts observed in empirical exchange rates, such as heavy tails, excess volatility, and volatility clustering, as well as the negative relationship between market volatility and carry trade activity. We find that the interaction between carry traders and chartists provides an explanation for the forward premium puzzle. This effect is strengthened by chartists, who extrapolate the trend induced by carry trade. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Spronk, Richard; Verschoor, Willem F. C.; Zwinkels, Remco C.

Less attention has been paid to the revenue side of the government account, even though immediately following the onset of the crisis, government revenues fell after growing at roughly 30% annually pre-crisis. The issue we address in this article is the relative importance of expenditure stimulus and tax stabilization after the onset of the 2008 crisis. We use a Keynesian macroeconomic model of China recast in changes form to quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of the stimulus and automatic tax stabilization components. Our simulation results indicate that without the stimulus package, the economic growth in 2009 would have been only 6.8%, and without slowed growth of government revenues, the growth rate in 2009 would have been only 6.0%. Our conclusion is that while increases in government spending and revenue reduction stimulus from automatic revenue responses both contributed to the speedy recovery of the Chinese economy from the crisis, the tax side may have contributed more than the expenditure side.","[Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Whalley, John] CIGI, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada; [Whalley, John] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhao, Xiliang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xiliang] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ WISE, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Western University (University of Western Ontario); National Bureau of Economic Research; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Whalley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",jwhalley@uwo.ca,,,,,,,11,6,6,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Indeed, the pattern of a market dynamics may cause changes in welfare inequality. Low income consumers benefit more from quantity than high income consumers, who are more interested in enjoying variety. These facts have been usually addressed as consequences of trade liberalization by international trade theory. However, market dynamics are also present within the borders of every country. It is important to understand what forces, unrelated with international trade, affect these dynamics. This paper explores the transmission of different real shocks into market dynamics in a new-Keynesian closed economy.

Unlike most macroeconomic models of search, we endogenize the labor supply along the extensive margin. We find numerically that a model with endogenous labor force participation decision produces a decline in the unemployment rate which is almost three times larger than that in a model with fixed labor force. For a calibration capturing alternatively the European and the US labor markets, a deregulation episode, which lowers the markup by 3 percentage points, results in a fall in the unemployment rate by 0.17 and 0.05 percentage point, respectively, while the labor share is almost unaffected in the long-run.

Bayesian techniques and Peruvian data are used to evaluate two forms of dollarization: currency substitution (CS) and price dollarization (PD). The empirical results are as follow: first, it is noted that the two forms of partial dollarization are important in explaining the significance of the Peruvian data. Second, models with both forms of dollarization dominate models without dollarization. Third, a counterfactual exercise shows that by eliminating both forms of partial dollarization, the response of both output and consumption to a monetary policy shock doubles, making the interest rate channel of monetary policy more effective.

We compare and contrast private with common property in terms of exploitation rates and social welfare, and provide a comparative dynamic analysis with respect to the number of firms in the industry. Contrary to previous studies on oligopolistic exploitation of productive assets, before exploitation begins, the resource is parcelled out: each firm privately owns and manages the assigned parcel over the entire planning horizon. Compared with the common property regime, we find a new set of results, both in the short- and in the long-run. As for social welfare, we provide conditions on the implicit growth rate and the initial asset stock under which the socially optimal allocation of the resource implies a natural monopoly.

If workers are much more productive in one country than in another, restrictions on immigration lead to large efficiency losses. The paper quantifies these losses, using a model in which efficiency differences are labor-augmenting, and free trade in product markets leads to factor price equalization, so that wages are equal across countries when measured in efficiency units of labor. The estimated gains from removing immigration restrictions are huge. Using a simple static model of migration costs, the estimated net gains from open borders are about the same as the gains from a growth miracle that more than doubles the income level in less-developed countries.

Local governments try to push polluting economic activities to the neighboring jurisdictions, while commuting guarantees their residents' labor income. Commuting generates a leakage of the local production benefits of pollution as non-resident commuters take the wages to their home jurisdictions. Jurisdictions may thus face a prisoners' dilemma, in which they all push for pollution levels that are too low (race-to-the-top). Fiercer competition in the common labor market due to a larger number of jurisdictions intensifies this race-to-the-top in environmental regulation; whereas transboundary pollution, local ownership of firms, pollution taxes, and payroll taxes reduce the incentive for overly restrictive pollution policies.","European Commiss, DG Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies IPTS, Seville 41092, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Saveyn, B (通讯作者)，European Commiss, DG Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies IPTS, Edificio Expo,C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",Bert.Saveyn@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We argue that how information is processed within the auction mechanism is crucially important in such circumstances. In our model, the seller uses an intermediary to extract information from the buyers but is not tied to sell the good with terms that the mechanism proposes. Instead, she may reauction the good again via some other intermediary. There are no restrictions on how many times and through which mechanisms the good can be reauctioned. The buyers may also choose their outside option at any stage of the game. We argue that a sequentially rational seller can only implement a version of the English auction, in particular the popular version where bidders employ proxy bids. This is a consequence of the informational properties of the English action: it reveals just the right information for the seller to be able to commit to the mechanism.","[Vartiainen, Hannu] Univ Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,,hannu.vartiainen@helsinki.fi,,,,,,,47,12,12,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The purpose of this paper is to show that, while a government could in principle use such a policy to fully relax borrowing limits, this is not generally optimal. In our economy, agents invest in a short-term asset, a long-term asset, and government bonds. Agents are subject to idiosyncratic liquidity shocks prior to the maturity of the long-term asset. We show that a high public debt policy fully relaxes private borrowing limits and is suboptimal. This is because agents expecting such a policy respond by investing less than is socially optimal in the short asset which can protect them in the event of a liquidity shock. The optimal policy is more constrained and it induces a wedge between the technological rate of return on the long asset and the rate of return on bonds. In such a regime, agents subject to liquidity shocks are also borrowing constrained, and this expectation of being borrowing constrained induces them to invest the optimal level in the short asset.","Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Yared, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",pyared@columbia.edu,,,,,,,20,14,16,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

For male labor earnings, we find that the entire increase in cross-sectional inequality over our sample period was driven by an increase in the dispersion of the persistent component of earnings. For total household income, we find that most of the increase in inequality reflects an increase in the dispersion of the persistent income component, but the transitory component also appears to have played some role.

To do so, we estimate the conditional levels of poverty and deprivation Africans would experience had they the same characteristics as whites. By comparing the actual and counterfactual distributions, we show that the racial gap in poverty and deprivation can be attributed to the cumulative disadvantaged characteristics of Africans, such as their current level of educational attainment, demographic structure and area of residence, as well as to the inertia of past racial inequalities.

In this paper we examine one of the claimed benefits of drug advertising: encouraging the undiagnosed to seek out medical treatment. We measure how advertising affects an undiagnosed individual's decision to visit a physician for a check-up using detailed person-level panel data on more than 30,000 individuals from the Medical Care Expenditure Panel Survey. We find drug advertising is an important determinant of an individual's decision to get a check-up and that this effect of drug advertising appears to differ by demographic group. While the differences between demographic groups are not statistically different, our point estimates suggest that Blacks and the highly educated are the most responsive to drug advertising.

The tests based on the correlation coefficients estimated from the DCC-GARCH and STC-GARCH models lend support to our argument. The contagion occurs mainly during Leman's bankruptcy and the financial market instability in February 2009. The estimation results suggest that exogenous shocks are transmitted to the domestic financial market and they are further facilitated by the structural weakness of domestic financial system. The nature of contagion of the crisis implies that macroeconomic policies that can stabilize the entire financial market may be preferable to microeconomic policies aimed at addressing selected financial institutions' difficulties. The Korean government has implemented strong macroeconomic policies to address the financial distresses, and the present results suggest that they have thus far been successful.

Accordingly, the aim of this paper was to investigate the factors that determine companies' profitability in the Croatian food and beverage industry during the period from 1999 to 2009. The results of the conducted dynamic panel analysis revealed negative and significant influence of company's debt ratio on profitability; and significant positive influence of company's size, concentration ratio and past performance on current profitability.

An existing shortcoming is that previous studies have focused only on detecting the linear effects of income on corruption. We therefore use the hierarchical polynomial regression to evaluate any existence of a non-linear relationship after controlling for socio-economic and institutional factors. Our results challenge some of the findings of a negative income-corruption association in the literature, and provide some new inferences. The findings indicate a quadratic function that best fits the data, and despite an upsurge of corruption among the low-to-medium income countries, the advanced stages of development eventually reduce corruption level substantially. The results persist when per capita income is instrumented for by latitude distance and life expectancy. The policy implications suggest a combination of economic, institutional and social policies that can effectively, in turn, reduce and lower the effects of corruption on the society, economy and development.

The uncertain degree of price stickiness spills over to the endogenous objective function pursued by the central bank. In a min-max approach, the model is solved under discretion and under a Taylor rule which implements the optimal robust equilibrium under discretion. It is shown that with a welfare-based loss function, robust optimal monetary policy can neutralize the uncertainty surrounding the relative weight to assign to output-gap stabilization. Moreover, welfare improves when the endogeneity of the loss function is recognized by the central bank. Under discretion, the central bank reacts more aggressively to uncertainty about the degree of price stickiness and the autocorrelation of the cost-push shock. On the other hand, if the central bank implements the optimal discretionary robust equilibrium with a Taylor rule, under uncertainty the interest rate reacts to inflation in a less aggressive way.

Results obtained in out-of-classification criterion testing are then compared with the classification ability of the Multiple Classification Criteria UTADIS (MCC UTADIS). Finally, an application to country risk evaluation is performed. In this application, classifications of two credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's, are taken as two different classification criteria. Moreover, robustness of MCC UTADIS method is tested through using several data sets. Results indicate that MCC UTADIS involving more than one classification criteria performs very close to standard UTADIS with single classification criterion and performs better than the out-of-classification criterion tests.

The bank's preferences are state-dependent in that the utility function depends on a state variable. We show that the optimal amount of loans extended by the bank depends neither on the state-dependent preferences of the bank, nor on the joint distribution of the marginal cost of funds and the state variable. The bank, however, optimally lends less should it be forced to assume all interest rate risk by exclusively extending fixed rate loans. We show further that a non-positive spread between fixed and variable rate loans is no longer a necessary and sufficient condition for the bank to refrain from extending fixed rate loans should the marginal cost of funds be correlated with the state variable in the sense of expectation dependence. State-dependent preferences as such play a pivotal role in determining the bank's optimal choice between fixed and variable rate loans. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, multi-criteria group decision making problems where there exists a prioritization relationship over the criteria and decision makers are studied. First, the intuitionistic fuzzy prioritized weighted average (IFPWA) and the intuitionistic fuzzy prioritized weighted geometric (IFPWG) operators are proposed. Then, some of their desirable properties are investigated in detail. Furthermore, the procedure of multi-criteria group decision making based on the proposed operators is given under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Finally, a practical example, about talent introduction is provided to illustrate the developed method.","Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Yu, DJ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yudejian62@126.com,,,,,,,42,50,51,2,34,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Building on the model proposed by Harrison et al. (2008), we relate employment to three innovation strategies: make only (R&D), buy only (external R&D, licensing of patents and know-how, technical assistance, and other external innovation activities) and make and buy (mixed strategy). Firms that conduct in-house innovation activities (make only) have the greatest impact on employment; the make and buy strategy comes in second. Similar results are found for small firms. These results highlight the importance of fostering in-house technological efforts not only for innovation per se, but also to promote growth in firm employment. The impact of make only strategies is greater in high-tech industries, whereas make only and make and buy have a similar impact on employment in low-tech industries. Finally, the study provides evidence of the mechanisms through which innovation strategies affect employment. The findings show that innovation strategies enhance technological innovation, but their impact differs between product and process innovation. Product innovation is mainly motivated by in-house technology investments, followed by mixed strategies, whereas process innovation is basically driven by buy strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Legislators decide about the effort they invest in oversight activities depending on their individual control costs and the level of electoral competition. We focus on public servants elected to parliament who face a conflict of interests but also have lower control costs due to their experience and information advantage. If held accountable, oversight becomes a relatively attractive activity for them to win votes. For German Laender, we find that the fraction of public servants in parliament is positively related to the number of submitted parliamentary interpellations. This result holds when instrumenting the fraction of public servants in parliament with its institutional determinants. Moreover, a mixed-member electoral system as well as a tighter race between the two biggest parties is related to more, a larger number of parties in parliament to less minor interpellations.","[Braendle, Thomas; Stutzer, Alois] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Stutzer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",thomas.braendle@unibas.ch; alois.stutzer@unibas.ch,"Stutzer, Alois/A-2302-2013","Stutzer, Alois/0000-0002-7410-5513",,,,,60,10,11,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

This paper provides a survey of financial liberalization in Sub-Saharan African countries over the period 1980 to 2004. Our review of empirical studies showed that financial liberalization has had diverse and contrasting effects on savings, investment and economic growth. Most studies found a significant positive effect of financial liberalization on investment whereas its effect on savings has been largely insignificant. The evidence on the effect on economic growth is inconclusive as different studies find contrasting results. It is found that financial liberalization policies have not had the desired and expected results as both financial and macroeconomic variables have not improved following financial liberalization in these countries. This calls for a rethinking of financial liberalization in Sub-Saharan African countries. It is important that financial liberalization is carried out in a stable macroeconomic environment. In addition to this, there should be a building and reform of institutions and the strengthening of prudential regulation. Following this, financial liberalization can be embarked upon but it must be properly sequenced and not rushed.","Univ Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria",University of Ibadan,"Fowowe, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.",,"Fowowe, Babajide/AAG-5207-2019","Fowowe, Babajide/0000-0001-8402-4867",,,,,59,16,18,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In the experiment, one individual is selected based on a particular procedure. This individual is allowed to propose how to allocate a pie among five group members: herself and four responders. Then each responder in the group can decide whether to offer costly resistance to the proposed allocation. Resistance is modeled as a threshold public good. If the resistance is successful, the proposer receives nothing. If resistance is unsuccessful, the pie is distributed according to the proposer's decision. We find that resistance increases with (a) the size of the proposal, with (b) subjectively perceived unfairness of the selection procedure for the proposer's role, and with (c) the individual procedural preferences being unsatisfied. Surprisingly, resistance is not affected by whether the group's majority vote on the selection procedure is respected.

Government fails to establish efficient institutions by favoring corruption. On its side, civil society exerts pressure to constrain government to cease corruption. I distinguish between an authoritarian government and an unrestrictive one: the latter does not repress protests from the civil society while the former implements punishment mechanisms. I demonstrate analytically the existence of a unique locally stable equilibrium by solving a linear quadratic differential game for three regimes: respectively, the optimal control problem, noncooperative, and cooperative game. Everything remaining constant; numerical assessment indicates that both civil monitoring and government pressure always increase as the governments ability to extract rents and the effectiveness of institutions increases. The government pressure also increases with an increase in the marginal utility of rent.

The article documents this at various levels of disaggregation for a large sample covering more than 100 countries over recent decades. The result is highly robust to changes in the sample and specification. The coefficient of unconditional convergence is estimated quite precisely and is large, at between 2-3% in most specifications and 2.9% a year in the baseline specification covering 118 countries. The article also finds substantial sigma-convergence at the two-digit level for a smaller sample of countries. Despite strong convergence within manufacturing, aggregate convergence fails due to the small share of manufacturing employment in low-income countries and the slow pace of industrialization. Because of data coverage, these findings should be as viewed as applying to the organized, formal parts of manufacturing.","Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Rodrik, D (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,27,306,346,0,77,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

The empirical model, which we formally derive from an expected utility maximization problem, allows us to test for risk aversion as well as competitive conduct in loan and the deposit markets. The model also yields an expression showing that the effect of concentration on margins is the sum of its respective effects on market power, marginal cost of intermediation and marginal cost of uncertainty. The expression allows us to test whether concentration is welfare enhancing, reducing or neutral. We find Islamic banks to be risk-averse and conventional banks to be risk-neutral. We also find that concentration is welfare-neutral in Islamic loans and deposits, welfare-enhancing in conventional loans and welfare-neutral in conventional deposits.

The data envelopment analysis was employed to estimate efficiency in terms of an output indicator (value added) and input indicators (intermediate consumption, capital consumption, and remunerations). Furthermore, the decomposition of the Malmquist productivity index enabled to describe the impact of frontier shifts and catch-up effect on the overall change in efficiency. The multi-criteria decision making method MULTIMOORA aggregated different indicators of efficiency and productivity and thus resulted in the ranking of the economic sectors.

Larger banks and banks with strong competitive standing and high income invest less in a deeper relationship with the network. Moreover, bank's own trustworthiness is a relevant component in building trust. The banks are more willing to trust if they believe that they can influence the banking group's decisions.

This assumption permits us to prove the existence of a Cournot-Nash equilibrium of the Shapley's window model - called Cobb-Douglas-Cournot-Nash equilibrium - without introducing further assumptions on atoms' endowments and preferences previously used by Busetto et al.

Using a large sample of developing countries and mobilizing a dynamic panel data framework, it uncovers a diminishing macroeconomic destabilizing consequence of natural disasters as remittance inflows rise. It appears that the effect of natural disasters disappears for a remittance ratio above 8% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, remittances aggravate the destabilizing effects of natural disasters when they exceed 17% of the GDP.

A dynamic model of schooling and employment choices is estimated and used to simulate educational attainment, employment history, and wages. Estimations of the Mincer wage equation using simulated data appear to validate the model. Ability selection is found to be the major source of bias in the OLS estimates of schooling returns. Although the IV estimates lie within the support of true returns to schooling if a strong and strictly exogenous instrument is used and if dynamic employment selection is controlled, these conditions may be easily violated in practice.

What drives this phenomenal convergence, and is the experience unique in recorded economic history? In order to quantify the process, we explore a novel representation for the dynamics in evolving wage distributions and hypothesize that the growth distribution of wages can be generated by a single stochastic process in which the logarithm of the quantity in question follows a Brownian motion. A linear stochastic model driven by white Gaussian noise is presented, to describe the dynamics of the cross-country distribution of real wages. The model is mechanical and descriptive in nature. It provides a useful way to summarize wage distribution dynamics in a way that is usable for models that focus on underlying microbehavior of labor markets. An empirical application to the evolution of the distribution of real wages across global labor markets going back to the 19th century validates the proposed model and suggests that diffusion may be a preferable technique for the analysis of dynamics in labor markets.

The national representative sample used includes 16,570 statistical observations. Surprisingly, the largest impact on Romania's income is determined by gender. Male income (log) is 26.58% higher than that of females, although data shows, that, on average, women in the sample have more years of education than men. This shows a highly discriminatory phenomenon, which can be solved probably by educational and awareness raising programs, aimed at combating gender-based (wage) discrimination. As regards to the importance of education as a determinant of earnings, we conclude that it is a key determinant of individual income. If in 1995 the coefficient of the variable years of education was -0.0019 and in 2000 0.0061, in 2009 it was, according to this study, 0.081652. It shows that in Romania the importance of education has increased, and consequently, the importance of people's knowledge and skills in their wage level, has soared too, which, in turn, may be an indicator of the transformation of Romania into a knowledge based society.","Bucharest Univ Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ion, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",irinazgreaban@yahoo.com,"Ion, Irina Elena/A-2340-2017; Irina, Ion C/C-6063-2011",,,,,,9,3,3,0,8,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We identify two forces that shape our results. On the one hand, the government has an incentive to concentrate tax distortions on events that it considers unlikely relative to the pessimistic public. On the other hand, the endogeneity of the public's expectations gives rise to a novel motive for expectation management that aims toward the manipulation of equilibrium prices of government debt in a favorable way.

Because a fundamental postulate in neoclassical theory is that with small income effects and many available substitutes, the willingness to accept (WTA) and WTP measures of value for a commodity should be roughly equivalent, this finding has vast implications in both a positive and normative sense. This study advances, and experimentally tests, a new explanation of the WTP/WTA disparitya dynamic theory based on the presence of commitment costs. Although to date neoclassical models have not explained the observed data patterns well, we find that the commitment cost theory combined with a simple behavioral anomaly is able to lend insights into the causes and severity of the WTA/WTP disparity. Furthermore, we find that market experience attenuates the behavioral anomaly, consistent with the notion that no value disparity exists for agents with sufficient market experience.

In it he outlined a number of suggestions for the conduct of monetary and fiscal policies that he thought would contribute to monetary stability and pari passu to price stability and a greater degree of output/employment stability. In this paper I review some of his policy prescriptions in light of the financial and economic crisis of 2007-2009. From the perspective of financial development the world today is much different from the world that Friedman knew in the late 1950s. In what way would his policy recommendations have to be modified to account for these changes in financial development? To stabilize the banking system we argue that his proposal for 100 percent reserve banking merits serious consideration in current policy discussions. To stabilize asset markets we propose two policies that Friedman would not likely endorse. The first is to reinstate selective credit controls in the areas of the securities markets, the real estate market, and various commodity markets. The second policy designed to dampen excessive variability in the stock market is for the Central Bank to carry out some open market operations in an index fund of equities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Importance of customer loyalty has been widely recognized in business marketing for a long time, and the customer loyalty enhancement strategies for mobile RFID services is of significance to telecommunication carriers in terms of new business value creation. This study identifies the factors affecting customer loyalty for mobile RFID services and presents telecommunication service managers with information useful for improving customer loyalty for related new services. The data was collected from customers with some experience in the use of mobile RFID services through an online survey for an empirical analysis. And the collected data was analysed with structural equation model to verify the cause and effect relationship among perceived quality, switching cost, perceived value, customer satisfaction, switching barrier and customer relationship. The analysis showed that the quality of tag recognition and content quality proved to have a direct impact on the customer satisfaction, whereas connection quality and ease of use would rather indirectly than directly influence customer satisfaction by perceived value. Perceived value and satisfaction affected the loyalty. Adaptation cost affects switching barriers, the higher the switching barriers, the stronger the loyalty. Based on the results of the empirical analysis, practical implications were given. What is more, mobile RFID customers were divided into two groups that are favourably and unfavourably disposed toward the service, and suggested customer loyalty improvement strategies adapted for each group.","[Park, Yong-Jae] Korea Inst Ceram Engn & Technol, Seoul, South Korea; [Rim, Myung-Hwan; Lee, Seung-Koog] ETRI, Technol Strategy Res Div, Taejon 305700, South Korea",Korea Institute of Ceramic Engineering & Technology; Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute - Korea (ETRI),"Rim, MH (通讯作者)，ETRI, Technol Strategy Res Div, 218 Gajeong Ro Yuseong Gu, Taejon 305700, South Korea.",mhrim@etri.re.kr,,,,,,,39,2,2,3,28,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

However, this study identified some important new concepts and limitations/defects of traditional MADM for solving the real-world problems. First, the traditional MADM model assumes that criteria considered are independent and hierarchical in structure; however, the real-world problems often involve interdependent criteria, and thus interdependent models are required. Second, relatively good solutions from existing alternatives are replaced by the aspiration levels. Third, the trend has shifted from how to rankor select the most preferable alternatives, to how to improve their performances. Fourth, information fusion/aggregation, such as fuzzy integrals, basically, a non-additive/super-additive model, has been developed for performance aggregation. Therefore, to overcome the defects of the conventional MADM method and solve complex and dynamic real world problems, a Hybrid Dynamic Multiple Criteria Decision Making (HDMADM) method is needed. Finally, this study presented real cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the HDMADM method for overcoming the defects of the conventional MADM method.","[Peng, Kua-Hsin] Kainan Univ, Inst Leisure & Recreat Management, Tao Yuan 338, Taiwan; [Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung] Natl Taipei Univ, Grad Inst Urban Planning, Coll Publ Affairs, San Shia 237, Taiwan; [Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Management Technol, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan",Nan Kai University Technology; National Taipei University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Tzeng, GH (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, Grad Inst Urban Planning, Coll Publ Affairs, 151 Univ Rd, San Shia 237, Taiwan.",ghtzeng@mail.ntpu.edu.tw,"Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung/B-2775-2009","Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung/0000-0003-1856-7497",,,,,53,86,86,0,43,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The aim of this paper is to find a possible space for innovative approach to sources of business financing in the Czech Republic Could the use of innovative source of financing bring additional profit for the company? Would be the innovative approach to the corporate capital structure more profitable? The article analyses selected sources of financing from the two perspectives: first perspective is the examination of various sources of financing as of products suitable for Innovation, and the second perspective includes exploring of possible changes in the corporate capital structure with increased or a reduced utilization of the particular source of financing, which would represent an innovative approach of companies to financing. The article focuses on selected traditional (bank loans and borrowings, leasing) and Innovative sources of financing (share and bond issues, factoring, export financing). Findings of this paper indicate substantial potential for innovations of capital structure of Czech companies, which rely primarily on own sources of financing (owner's equity, profit and reserve funds), and among external sources prevail bank loans and other long-term liabilities. An increased use of the capital markets for financing, while it is more expensive for companies, may bring significant benefits for the companies and the whole economy as well in the long term.","[Stryckova, Lenka; Hojna, Radana] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,lenka.stryckova@tul.cz; radana.hojna@tul.cz,"Stryckova, Lenka/L-2467-2015","Stryckova, Lenka/0000-0003-1108-4193",,,,,19,3,3,0,4,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,522,531,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300054,0

Second, during the crisis period, we detected significant causality-in-variance from the Greek sovereign CDS spreads to the bank CDS, implying that the deteriorated Greek sovereign solvency might have triggered contagion effects on the banking sector in the area.

A piece of informatics system security is the software application which must be designed to prevent any attack known at that time. Over time, new attacks are imagined and applied, threatening the security of applications and, thus, of the systems themselves. Almost all applications require data from the user by the means of some electronic forms. Because forms are the gateway for attacks from the malicious users, it is highly advisable to filter input data coming from the user in order to preserve the system integrity and the privacy of data stored by the system. In Web-based applications, data filtering may be done either by client-side, either by-server-side or both. It is considered that filtering input data by server-side application is safest solution. This paper presents a study case on the web based applications which uses client-side scripting for validation of end-user data inputs. We propose a solution that avoids the validation by server-side software of all data contained by the forms. The solution is very simple and it is suitable for the inherited sites which don't have implemented data validation by the server.","[Tiliute, Doru E.] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ Informat, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,,dtiliute@seap.usv.ro,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2013,,,,,,,89,95,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BGV43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324282200018,0

A popular approach in applied welfare analysis is to approximate the expected compensating variation (cv) for an amenity change as the cv of a representative consumer whose indirect utility is given by the expected maximum utility. However, this approach can be misleading in the case of nonmarginal changes as it implies that changes in income do not affect the consumer's choice. In this case the true expected cv can be obtained via simulation. Empirical applications to recreational demand find that the bias from the representative approach is small. This article re-evaluates the accuracy of the representative consumer approximation in the context of measuring the general equilibrium welfare impacts of large environmental changes. Our findings suggest that, though the representative consumer approximation could lead to biased point estimates of the expected cv, this bias is overwhelmed by the size of the confidence intervals that result from the empirical estimation of household preferences.","Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Tra, CI (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, 4505 S Maryland Pkwy,Box 456002, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",constant.tra@unlv.edu,,,,,,,11,6,6,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The fact that symmetrization fails when there are more than two bidders has been observed before, but we also provide the direction: weaker bidders are less likely to win than stronger ones. For a special class of distributions and three bidders, we prove that the bid distributions are more symmetric with resale than without. Numerical simulations suggest that the more bidders there are, the more similar the allocation is to the case without resale, and thus, the more asymmetric the bid distributions are between strong and weak bidders. We also show in an example that the revenue advantage of first-price auctions over second-price auctions is positive, but decreasing in the number of bidders.","Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada",University of Toronto,"Virág, G (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",gabor.virag@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,14,13,13,2,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

One-sided error terms considered include the half-normal, truncated normal, exponential and gamma distributions. Results are compared for homoscedastic and doubly heteroscedastic models, where we also introduce a doubly heteroscedastic variable mean model, and examine the sensitivity of the nested models to a stronger heteroscedasticity correction for the one-sided error component. The results support three conclusions regarding the sensitivity of efficiency rankings to distributional assumptions. When four standard distributional assumptions are applied to a homoscedastic stochastic frontier model, the efficiency rankings are quite consistent. When those assumptions are applied to a doubly heteroscedastic stochastic frontier model, the efficiency rankings are consistent when proper and sufficient arguments for the variance functions are included in the model.

Numerical results show that the IFE approach is quite accurate and efficient, and can be easily extended to multi-asset or stochastic volatility pricing problems. The key contribution of this paper to the literature is that we have managed to provide a comprehensive convergence analysis for the IFE approach, including not only an error estimate of the adopted discrete scheme but also the convergence of the adopted iterative scheme, which ensures that our numerical solution does indeed converge to the exact one of the original nonlinear system.

An analysis of public spending in OECD countries (1980-2005) suggests countercyclical social protection is constrained by the limits to public borrowing and the degree of political polarization.

We systematically consider alternative designs for such tariffs, and analyze their effects on global welfare within a multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of global trade and energy. Our analysis shows that systems more likely to comply with international law yield very little in terms of carbon leakage and efficiency. Generally, the effectiveness increases substantially with complexity. However, regionalising the tariffs seems not to be worthwhile. Also, the most effective system we identify is not based on fully input-output-corrected carbon contents, but on direct plus electricity emissions, only. This reflects the more general problem of finding systems that are both feasible and well-targeted in a real global economy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In most computable general equilibrium models, this fossil fuel supply is derived from a constant elasticity of substitution production function, in which a natural resource is treated as a fixed factor. We show that this leads to endogenously decreasing supply elasticities and sharply increasing marginal leakage rates for large coalitions that have ambitious emissions targets, particularly when fuel exporters participate in the coalition. We propose an alternative production function that has a constant elasticity of fuel supply, which results in more stable leakage rates and a different share of trade-related leakage. The role of this model variation for the assessment of border measures in climate policy turns out to be limited. In those cases where the model versions differ most (i.e. large coalition, ambitious targets), border measures have a small effect anyway. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The history of the commodity world is that of the irreversible order of three measures: use-measure, exchange-measure and temporal exchange-measure. According to that order, sets of capitalist systems have 'grown' up to the present day. This process of capitalist 'growth' is a transformation process from the real-economic world or space-time of use-measure to the rational space of null sets dominated by money.

More specifically, heuristics that are defined by the local choice context, such as the gains or losses of an attribute value relative to the other attributes, seem to matter significantly. Recent empirical findings also demonstrate that previous choices made by respondents and previous choice tasks shown to respondents can affect the current choice outcome, indicating a form of interdependence across choice sets. This paper reviews some of the key findings about heuristics and decision rules across the psychology, marketing, transport and environmental disciplines. Using experimental data in the context of a proposed toll road, we find that for certain components of the time and cost attributes, allowing for non-linearity and for referencing to the least desired attribute level in the local choice set offers improvement over the standard linear-in-the-attributes and linear-in-the-parameters specification. Other heuristics, including the majority of confirming dimensions and reference point revision can also be embedded into the model. An alternative approach to identifying and weighting multiple heuristics in a utility function by means of a logit-type specification for the weights is then introduced. While acknowledging the need for more work in this area, we suggest that such an approach may be a useful way of testing what happens when multiple heuristics are mixed in the model.

On the other hand, greater FW use in the hotel industry is associated with higher firm-level productivity. This suggests that FWs represent a critical input that supports more productive firms in this tradable sector.

This paper suggests a simple adaptive modification of the basic ARFIMA model, which uses a flexible Fourier form to allow for a time varying intercept. Simulation evidence suggests that the model provides a good representation of various forms of structural breaks and also that the new model can be efficiently estimated by a QMLE approach. We investigate monthly CPI inflation series for the G7 countries and find evidence of stable long memory parameters across regimes and also of significant nonlinear effects. The estimated adaptive ARFIMA models generally have less persistent long memory parameters than previous studies, with the estimated time dependent intercept being an important component. The model is also supplemented with an adaptive FIGARCH component, yielding a double nonlinear long memory model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the redistribution of labour and changes in regional labour supply, the ultimate question raised is whether there are additional gains or losses as a result of immigration flows. This paper therefore focuses on the impact of migrants on regional Gross Domestic Product per capita for European regions. Does the proportion of foreigners in the labour force increase or lower regional income? Does the composition of non-natives with respect to their countries of origin matter? We provide evidence that immigration and a higher degree of cultural diversity raise regional income, while controlling for endogeneity. We show that cultural diversity promotes income gains for destination countries. Whereas the presence of dominant groups reduces the costs of interaction and integration, diversity among foreign-born people increases the supply of different skills, knowledge and tasks. Thus, in general immigration has a positive net effect on regional performance and the costs of immigration in destination regions are balanced out. The regions of origin within the EU face a rise or a decline in income, depending on the labour market status of movers.","[Brunow, Stephan; Brenzel, Hanna] Inst Employment Res, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Brunow, S (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",stephan.brunow@iab.de,"Brunow, Stephan/AAI-9991-2020; Brunow, Stephan/U-7341-2019; Kunitsyna, Natalia/B-9626-2017","Brunow, Stephan/0000-0001-9179-4464; Kunitsyna, Natalia/0000-0001-9336-8100",,,,,32,5,6,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2012,39,4,,,SI,,461,485,,10.1007/s10663-012-9201-z,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,026BZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310247300003,0

Most of the spreads' asymmetric adjustments generally occur during narrowing. The three ethanol pairs that contain the eCBOT futures with each of Chicago spot, New York Harbor spot and Western European (Rotterdam) spot show different long-run adjustments, arbitrage profitable opportunities and price risk hedging capabilities. The asymmetric spread adjustments for the three grains are also different, with corn spread showing the strongest long-run widening adjustment, and sugar showing the weakest narrowing adjustment. Among others, the empirical analysis indicates the importance of potentially hedging the spot prices of agricultural commodities with ethanol futures contracts, which sends an important message that the ethanol futures market is capable of hedging price risk in agricultural commodity markets. The short-run asymmetric adjustments for individual prices in the nine pairs, with the exception of the corn own pair, underscore the importance of futures prices in the price discovery and hedging potential, particularly for ethanol futures.

The purpose of this paper is to explicate and model captive bank lending to dealers and determine the loan-risk default probability in equity returns of the captive bank under government capital injections during a financial crisis. The lending function of the captive bank necessitates modeling equity return as a capped barrier option. Numerical exercises show that a decrease in the discount rate of the floorplan financing or an increase in the amount of government capital injection decreases the default probability in equity returns of the captive bank. Floorplan or government assistance enables the captive bank to be much less prone to loan risk, specifically with large-scale dealers which can substantially affect the stability of the banking system.

Optimality requires the use of state contingent inflation taxes to smooth and reduce firms' rents. Hence, under optimal (Ramsey) policy PPI deviates significantly from zero.

Modular and decomposable systems are both composed of subsystems, but in the former, these subsystems are connected via interface standards, while in the latter, subsystems are completely isolated. We derive the optimal level of modularity, which minimizes the time required to globally optimize a system, both for the case of two-layered systems and for the general case of multi-layered hierarchical systems containing modules within modules. This derivation supports the hypothesis of modularity as a mechanism to increase the speed of evolution.

An example of such a practice is airline codesharing, in which allied carriers engage in the cooperative marketing of certain flights. We empirically test for the presence of competitive motives behind such alliances by identifying an incumbent airline's use of codesharing in response to the threat of future entry by a competitor. Using within-flight segment, fixed-effects regressions on panel data from 1998 to 2010, we estimate the impact of exogenous threats of entry on an airline's decision whether to codeshare with a partner on a specific segment. Estimates show that when an incumbent carrier's segment is threatened by a low-cost competitor it is approximately 25% more likely than average to be codeshared with its partner. Further tests show that this effect depends strongly upon the level of market share that the airline has on the segment in question. We interpret this as evidence of a strategic alliance being used to preemptively act in anticipation of future competition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We use a sample of over 1600 blacks and whites drawn from the universe of registered voters in three states merged with information on neighborhood income and racial composition. We experimentally vary proposed divisions as well as the implied race of the proposer. We find that acceptance in both groups is strongly influenced by the level of inequity in a proposed division, but blacks are also influenced by the offer amount while whites are not. This is driven by the lowest income group in our sample, which represents the 10th percentile of the black income distribution.

We show that both knowledge spillovers and market competition affect the incentives given to scientists, and these effects interact. First, high knowledge spillovers lead firms to soften incentives when product market competition is high, and to strengthen incentives when competition is low. Second, the relationship between the intensity of competition and the power of incentives is U-shaped, with the exact shape depending on the degree of knowledge spillovers. We also show that the performance-contingent pay for both applied and basic research increases with the non-pecuniary benefits that scientists obtain from research, while the fixed component decreases.

We argue that effective criminal justice institutions must satisfy three conditions: they must be accessible to citizens, incentivize judicial administrators to pursue justice instead of private ends, and generate useful information about accused criminals' guilt or innocence. Liberia's formal criminal justice institutions fail to satisfy these conditions. Sassywood does a better job of fulfilling them. Sassywood is more accessible than Liberia's formal criminal justice institutions. It provides judicial administrators stronger incentives to pursue justice. And, unexpectedly, it is capable of generating useful information about criminal defendants' guilt or innocence where Liberia's formal criminal justice institutions didn't. The theory this paper provides offers a plausible explanation of why sassywood is a sensible institutional substitute for formal Liberian criminal justice.

The Amnesty Plus program has been adopted as part of the US Corporate Leniency Policy in 1999 and is now vigorously advertised as one of the most compelling tools in generating successful cartel investigations. Amnesty Plus is aimed at attracting amnesty applications by encouraging firms, convicted in one market, to report their collusive agreements in other markets. We show that Amnesty Plus has two opposite effects on firms' ability and incentives to collude which are both increasing in the fine reduction granted.

Second, it can reduce the expected duration of cartels or delay their formation by increasing firms' incentives to self-report after a first cartel detection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Along with unconditional beta-convergence, we use sigma-convergence criterion and a simple model of conditional beta-convergence. The exploration is done for the entire period and several subperiods. In addition to OLS for the global sample, beta-convergence is studied for top and bottom deciles through quantile regressions. Ten points are noted. First, global convergence in energy consumption is generally weak. Second, convergence in electricity usage is strong in most cases. Third, despite some variations, the patterns are fairly similar across the four periods. Fourth, energy convergence in both top and bottom deciles is generally weak, but there are some variations. Fifth, for electricity, convergence is noted in the top, but not in the bottom, decile. Sixth, unconditional beta-convergence patterns are consistent with sigma-convergence scenarios. Seventh, as is usually noted, convergence is more marked in conditional beta-format than in the unconditional models. However, interpretation of conditional convergence in usage of energy or electricity is somewhat ambiguous. Eighth, weak convergence in energy usage might reflect a modestly larger increase in low-usage contexts relative to high-usage cases, and might not be of concern from the sustainability perspective. Ninth, strong convergence in electricity usage is associated with a much higher rate of global increase than the weakly-convergent energy usage. Last, the difference in convergence patterns for energy- and electricity-usage seems to merit further exploration. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the tendency for the Japanese economy and its external trade to stagnate not only has immediate consequences for global performance but also foreshadows a path to industrial transition for other key Asian economies.

We allow the contest organizer to design the contest structure using two instruments: contest sequence (the number of stages, and the number of contestants remaining after each stage), and prize allocation. When the contest technology is sufficiently noisy, we find that multi-stage contests elicit more effort than single-stage contests. For concave and moderately convex impact functions, the contest organizer should allocate the entire prize purse to a single final prize, regardless of the contest sequence. Additional stages always increase total effort. Therefore, the optimal contest eliminates one contestant at each stage until the finale when a single winner obtains the entire prize purse. Our results thus rationalize various forms of multi-stage contests that are conducted in the real world.","[Fu, Qiang] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Business Policy, Singapore 117592, Singapore; [Lu, Jingfeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 119260, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Fu, Q (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Business Policy, 1 Business Link, Singapore 117592, Singapore.",bizfq@nus.edu.sg; ecsljf@nus.edu.sg,"Lu, Jingfeng/R-2868-2019; Fu, Qiang/D-4900-2016",,,,,,22,81,90,2,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The macrovariate is interpreted as a (time) mean of the average (on all elements) of the individual study-property at time t. The micro-derivation looks unproblematic if means and averages tend to constant values in the limit n -> a. If this property, defined self-averaging in some recent papers by Aoki, holds, it would separate a deterministic result from fluctuations; consequently well defined macroeconomic deterministic relations prevail. However it is easy to show that in most cases in economy this property does not hold, due to long-range correlation existing among economic agents. If individual agents are not independent but exchangeable, also in the limit n -> a the coefficient of variation of the macrovariable is finite, which tends to a random limit rather than a constant. Finally the term indistinguishable agent is criticized, and the alternative exchangeable agent is discussed.","[Garibaldi, U.] IMEM CNR, I-16146 Genoa, Italy; [Viarengo, P.] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto dei Materiali per l'Elettronica ed il Magnetismo (IMEM-CNR); University of Naples Federico II,"Garibaldi, U (通讯作者)，IMEM CNR, Via Dodecaneso 33, I-16146 Genoa, Italy.",garibaldi@fisica.unige.it,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Ostensibly uniform assets, including cash, are perceived differently according to their originating source. In this study we examine assumptions of fungibility by using scenarios within a factorial survey to compare the effects of four specific factors on individuals' willingness to trade a specified possession that varies according to its relational source, dollar value, uniqueness and the potential buyer's identity. Two measures of willingness to trade are used; a composite distress measure and the minimum price that the participant is willing to accept in exchange for the possession. In addition, data are analyzed to explore relationships between willingness to sell, the four defined characteristics of the possession and participant's characteristics including age, gender, education and income. The possession's source and the buyer's identity dominate effects over the possession's value and uniqueness. The strength of the effects varies significantly depending on how distress is measured and between identifiable population groups. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Diffusion is modeled as the result of idiosyncratic adoption thresholds, local network effects and information diffusion (broadcasting and demonstration effect from previous adopters). A high social cohesion decreases the probability of one innovation cornering the market. Nonetheless, with imperfect information, in small-world networks the higher speed of diffusion produced by the low average distance increases this probability. A low social cohesion also increases the probability of falling into traps of under-adoption. However, such probability is significantly lower with imperfect information, because such regime is characterized by higher levels of market concentrations and this reduces the frictions due to the coexistence of non-compatible product innovations.","[Pegoretti, Giovanni; Rentocchini, Francesco] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Rentocchini, Francesco] Polytech Univ Valencia UPV, Inst Innovat & Knowledge Management INGENIO, Spanish Council Sci Res CSIC, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Vittucci Marzetti, Giuseppe] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Sociol & Social Res, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Trento; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; CSIC-UPV - Instituto de Gestion de la Innovacion y del Conocimiento (INGENIO); University of Milano-Bicocca,"Rentocchini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",giovanni.pegoretti@unitn.it; francesco.rentocchini@economia.unitn.it; giuseppe.vittucci@unimib.it,"Marzetti, Giuseppe Vittucci/AAG-2246-2020; Rentocchini, Francesco/A-5399-2009","Marzetti, Giuseppe Vittucci/0000-0003-3093-8000; Rentocchini, Francesco/0000-0002-6414-0577",,,,,51,15,24,0,61,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

We show that the width and degree of overlap in the product lines is greater in large markets and when the products are more differentiated. Distance costs affect not only the firms' product lines but also firms' choices of the products that are to be supplied to the distant market. Product lines are broader and more overlapped when distance costs are low and when they are high; while product lines are narrower, with less overlap, when distance costs are moderate. Consumers generally gain and firms lose from a reduction in distance costs. However, consumers may lose and firms gain from reduced distance costs if these lead to firms adopting narrower product lines. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The imbalances were connected with the increase in world savings emanating from the osavings glut' countries, notably China. This increase in savings led to a decline in world interest rates, and thus to greater borrowing, especially in the United States. This borrowing was for financing consumption, wars, and unwise rather than fruitful investment, especially in housing. The failure to invest in fruitful investments led to the financial crisis, and thus the decline in US and world-wide aggregate demand. This was the indirect paradox of thrift. It is to be contrasted with Keynes's paradox of thrift, where the decline in aggregate demand and output would have resulted directly from the rise in world savings. The paper also discusses why there was not more borrowing for fruitful investment, especially in developing countries, hence avoiding the financial crisis.","Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Corden, WM (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",m.corden@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,14,6,6,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

It looks at the coordination problem facing G-20 economies with respect to the need for global rebalancing of demand. While a classic ocoordination failure' has some appeal, a more compelling case for policy cooperation is based on the role of spillovers and interdependence. In this context, the G-20 MAPuas a coordination vehicleuhas the potential to build shared understanding, enhance mutual trust, and galvanize action among members. Simulated gains from collective action are potentially sizeable. However, key conditions that engendered remarkable global cooperation at the height of the crisis are now more diffuse, posing challenges to what the MAP might achieve going forward and providing some initial lessons for international policy coordination.","[Faruqee, Hamid; Srinivasan, Krishna] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Faruqee, H (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",hfaruqee@imf.org; ksrinivasan@imf.org,,,,,,,14,11,11,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The focus of the analysis is on the relevance of the quarter of birth and the school entrance age. The data, collected in 2005, covers children attending 2nd, 4th and 6th grade in a random sample of 191 schools. We find that children born late in the year, close to the December 31st cutoff date, display lower academic performance than those born in the first two quarters, but no difference in social behavior appears by quarter of birth. The maturity gap does not seem to disappear as children advance into later grades. Children who attended nursery school generally do better than those who started school either at preschool (around 3 years old) or later. This relationship weakens when origin and family education controls are included in the analysis. Among other demographic characteristics, children raised in non-nuclear families, with low educated parents, with little exposure to after school activities or born outside Spain tend to underperform others at school.","[Adsera, Alicia] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,,,"Goodstein, Nancy/AAA-6597-2021","Goodstein, Nancy/0000-0001-7146-2825",,,,,48,8,9,0,11,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

They find their way around the most modern methodological schools, yet they know significantly less about the workings of the social systems. To the younger generations, the socialist system, whose heritage still lives with us and whose characteristic behavioural forms and attitudes have not yet disappeared at all from the economic practices of the post-socialist countries, seems like the distant past, just like the Turkish occupation or the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. The target audience of Kalligram Publishing House is this generation, to the majority of whom Janos Kornai's works will probably come as a revelation. The years of crisis - whose end is still far off - has made even those uncertain about the workings of economic systems, who have personal experiences of the decades of socialism. Therefore, it would be quite important for them to re-read Kornai's works written during the socialist era in order to be able to grasp the workings of economic systems through the help of balanced and objective analyses. Moving beyond the momentary shocks and nostalgias, the older ones also have a great need to evaluate the roles of the market and the state in a bias-free manner resting on a solid theoretical foundation, to realistically see the mechanisms of shortage and surplus economies. This way it is perhaps possible to avoid going down the same river twice, which disappears somewhere underground and never reaches the sea.","Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Comparat Econ, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Hámori, B (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Comparat Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",bhamori@uni-corvinus.hu,"Hamori, Balazs/O-9997-2015","Hamori, Balazs/0000-0001-9833-5818",,,,,35,0,0,0,12,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We find that although political discourse expressed in books did become more polarized in the late 1990s, polarization remained low relative to the late 19th and much of the 20th century. We also find that polarization of discourse in books predicts legislative gridlock, but polarization of congressional language does not. Using a dynamic panel data set of phrases, we find that polarized phrases increase in frequency in Google Books before their use increases in congressional speech. Our evidence is consistent with an autonomous effect of elite discourse on congressional speech and legislative gridlock, but this effect is not large enough to drive the recent increase in congressional polarization.","[Jensen, Jacob] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kaplan, Ethan] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Naidu, Suresh; Wilse-Samson, Laurence] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Stanford University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Columbia University,"Jensen, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,49,31,41,1,30,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

While there has been a lot of debate regarding the choice of expected rate of return, the choice of expected capital gain, and the treatment of taxes in the user cost estimation when estimating capital, not much attention has been paid to the issues of appropriate price indices of assets. The use of inappropriate asset price indices results in a biased estimate of capital services index and, consequently, influences the estimate of the impact of capital on economic growth. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework of the impact of asset price indices on capital services and to test the impact by the sensitivity analysis.

In the wake of the global financial crisis in 2007-08, the strategic role of finance and its capacity to destabilize the real economy and push it to the brink of economic depression has rekindled debates over the historical causes and institutional forms which have characterized this phase of capitalist evolution. In other words, to what extent have the neoliberal policies pursued by most OECD countries over the past 30 years contributed to the emergence of this finance-led regime of accumulation? More specifically, what are the implications of the extraordinary build-up of private debt, which has financed private consumption and fuelled successive asset price and stock market euphoric bubbles over this period? At the same time, the problem of growing global imbalances between the surplus countries/regions and the deficit countries/regions has emerged as a major source of financial instability.

Using the WTI oil spot price, the S&P500 index, the Shanghai stock market composite index and the Shenzhen stock market component index returns, evidence was found for a significantly increasing dependence between crude oil and stock markets after the failure of Lehman Brothers, thus supporting the existence of contagion in the sense of Forbes and Rigobon's (2002) definition. Moreover, increased tail dependence and symmetry characterize all the paired markets. This indicates that significant increases in tail dependence are an actual dimension of the contagion phenomenon and that crude oil and stock prices are linked to the same degree regardless of whether markets are booming or crashing during the sample period. Finally, the contagion effect is found to be much weaker for China than the US. The empirical results have potentially important implications for risk management. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that exposure to disease in early childhood significantly increases the incidence of diabetes and is associated with worse socioeconomic status and maternal behaviors. We also find evidence of intergenerational transmission of maternal health shocks: among whites, higher exposure increases the probability of low birth weight infants.

First, we emphasize that the evidence supports both 'expected utility-like' theory and 'Bayesian-like' information acquisition theory. Second, we explain that inferences and representations are subject to physiological limitations that affect decision making. We report in particular two 'mechanical' models developed in neuroscience to represent neural data and choices. We then propose two economic models that incorporate physiological limitations into an expected utility framework. Interestingly, these two models provide foundations for those developed in neuroscience (which emerge endogenously in our framework) and provide further predictions that can be tested in principle.

We find that when we broadly define migration, households with better land rights are slightly less likely to send out migrants. However, this finding does not hold when restricting the focus to employment migration. Although improved land transferability rights have a modest negative effect on migration, understanding the barriers to migration is of utmost importance given recent work that highlights the high earning potential in the non-agricultural sector in Ethiopia.","[Mueller, Valerie] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [de Brauw, Alan] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Mueller, V (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",v.mueller@cgiar.org,,,,,,,41,43,48,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

With no evidence of a significantly declining graduate female-male wage differential, this suggests that the relative demand for graduate women must have increased in order to accommodate the faster increase in their relative supply. However, gender clustering in degree subjects suggests that male and female graduates may not be perfect substitutes in production and therefore that gender biases may exist in the relative demand and supply of graduate labour. Consequently, this paper investigates whether industry level skill demand shifts have differed for men and women, focussing specifically on the role of technical change and job task inputs. The paper shows that, despite the large growth in the percentage of women obtaining a degree, overall women lost out from technical change between 1997 and 2006. This was most likely as a consequence of their lower quality numeracy and literacy skills, as well as other skills required to undertake the tasks that are correlated with technical change, especially in highly computerised private sector industries like finance and machine manufacturing.

One of the applications is integrated with the DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) model. However, a question that arises concerns whether the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution can be directly applied, without considering the underlying social network structure more seriously, even though the social network structure is an important factor of social interaction. Therefore, this paper proposes two kinds of agent-based DSGE models. The first one belongs to mesoscopic modeling in formulating the social interaction with the Boltzmann-Gibbs machine, and the other one belongs to microscopic modeling in that it is augmented by the network-based ant machine. By comparing the population dynamics generated by those different agent-based DSGE models, we find that the Boltzmann-Gibbs machine offers a good approximation of herding behavior. However, it is difficult to envisage the population dynamics produced by the Boltzmann-Gibbs machine and by the network-based ant machine as having the same distribution, particularly in popular empirical network structures such as small world networks and scale-free networks. Thus, the social interaction behavior may not be replaced by the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution.","[Chang, Chia-Ling] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 11605, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Chang, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, 64,Sec 2,Zhi Nan Rd, Taipei 11605, Taiwan.",Cutesphinx6@yahoo.com.tw,,"Chen, Shu-Heng/0000-0003-4584-7646",,,,,40,0,0,0,9,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 9,2012,6,,,,,,,,201226.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-26,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,972PK,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306289100001,0

We build an oligopolistic model assuming that the market is saturated, which is able to explain the overemployment of intermediaries and the high commissions involved.

The resulting model characterised mathematically by a system of stochastic delay differential equations provides a unified approach to deal with adaptive behaviour of heterogeneous agents and market stability impact of lagged price used by chartists to form their expectations. For the underlying deterministic model, we show not only that the result of Brock and Hommes on rational routes to market instability in discrete-time holds in continuous-time but also a double edged effect of an increase in lagged price used by the chartists on market stability. For the stochastic model, we demonstrate that the interaction and boundedly rational behaviour of heterogeneous agents can generate various market phenomena such as bubbles and crashes and replicate stylised facts including volatility clustering, and long range dependence in volatility.

Heterodox accounts of factor-share movements include both profit-squeeze arguments (procyclical wage share) and underconsumption arguments (countercyclical wage share). Empirical evidence gives no decisive support for either account: factor shares may be procyclical and countercyclical at different stages of the business cycle. If factor shares vary in such a complex way, then Kaleckian models cannot have a stable distributive curve. The economy instead follows a distributive loop, with different adjustment paths during an upswing and a downswing.","Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Jackson, WA (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",william.jackson@york.ac.uk,,"Jackson, William Anthony/0000-0001-5194-7307",,,,,69,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,JUL,2012,63,3,,,,,493,511,,10.1111/j.1467-999X.2012.04152.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,951HP,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304711800005,0

However, as these models are developed to describe the stochastic behaviour of electricity prices, they are extended by a separate data treatment for the deterministic components (trend, daily, weekly and annual cycles) of electricity spot prices. Furthermore price jumps are considered and implemented within a regime-switching model. Since 2008 market design allows for negative prices at the European Energy Exchange, which also occurred for several hours in the last years. Up to now, only a few financial and time series approaches exist, which are able to capture negative prices. This paper presents a new approach incorporating negative prices. The evaluation of the different approaches presented points out that the mean reversion and the ARMA models deliver the lowest mean root square error between simulated and historical electricity spot prices gained from the European Energy Exchange. These models posses also lower mean average errors than GARCH models. Hence, they are more suitable to simulate well-fitting price paths. Furthermore it is shown that the daily structure of historical price curves is better captured applying ARMA or ARIMA processes instead of mean-reversion or GARCH models. Another important outcome of the paper is that the regime-switching approach and the consideration of negative prices via the new proposed approach lead to a significant improvement of the electricity price simulation.

We construct a dynamic general equilibrium model in which technology adoption is costly and agents are heterogeneous in their initial holdings of resources. We interpret the adoption cost as the resources expended in acquiring skills associated with new technologies. Endogenous growth occurs in our model largely as a result of human capital deepening. The analytical results of the model characterize three growth outcomes associated with the technology adoption process depending on productivity differences between the technologies. These outcomes are labeled 'poverty trap,' 'dual economy,' and 'balanced growth.'

Convergence is caused by endogenous adjustments of the conventional rates to their respective realized rates which is theoretically justified by hysteresis effects. Using a dynamic linear specification of the Kaleckian investment function in state-space form and by the aid of the Kalman filter, this paper studies the endogeneity of the normal utilization rate and the expected secular rate of sales growth empirically for the US manufacturing sector and its sub-sectors.

Cooperation raises the utility of both parents, and of each child, but does not guarantee efficiency. In the presence of credit rationing, a cooperative equilibrium may not exist outside marriage, because the main earner cannot credibly promise to compensate the main childcarer at some future date, and may not be able or willing to do so at front. By allowing the main childcarer to credibly threaten divorce if the main earner does not deliver the promised compensation when the time comes, marriage makes that promise credible, and thus increases the probability that a cooperative equilibrium will exist. In a separate-property jurisdiction, a reduction in the cost or difficulty of obtaining a divorce increases married women's participation in the labour market. In a community-property one, it has no such effect.","Univ Florence, I-50132 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Cigno, A (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Via Pandette 21,D5, I-50132 Florence, Italy.",cigno@unifi.it,,,,,,,34,31,32,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

First, we separately examine those who do and those who do not experience a job loss to reveal generally increasing entry rates through the wealth distribution for both groups, and show why these groups should be separately analyzed. Second, we use a two-period simulation of the Evans and Jovanovic model to shows how exogenous wealth shocks can accurately identify the presence of liquidity constraints. Third, we provide new evidence from matched Current Population Survey data to show that housing appreciation measured at the MSA-level is a significantly positive determinant of entry into self-employment, after controlling for changes in local economic conditions.","[Krashinsky, Harry A.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 2E8, Canada; [Fairlie, Robert W.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of Toronto; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Krashinsky, HA (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, 121 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 2E8, Canada.",harry.krashinsky@utoronto.ca,,"Krashinsky, Harry/0000-0002-9452-6462",,,,,58,110,144,3,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The optimal level of discretion left to the agency results from the following trade-off: the agency can tailor discretionary policies to its expert knowledge about potential harm, but it implements policies that are too pro-industry. The agency should be given full discretion when the firm is solvent; partial discretion is preferred otherwise.

We estimate value of the invention patents based on SIPO records in China and compare values of patents between local owners and owners from the U.S., Japan and European countries. The study reveals that patent value from Chinese owners is much lower than that of overseas owners. This larger value gap implies important difference in motive of the patenting and R&D quality between China and those technology intensive sources usually from economically advanced countries and regions. The model developed in this study is also applied to patent data in different technical fields, successfully differing technical sectors with higher value (e.g., machinery) and those with lower value (e.g., pharmaceuticals), in terms of China market based patent records. Both applications prove that the newly developed model can be an important analytical tool for providing classified patent value on different purposes, especially in case of China.

Derivatives can be used for managers' self-interest, for hedging or for speculative purposes. We hypothesize that investors can appeal to a firm's intemal (firm-level) and external (country-level) corporate governance to draw inferences on a firm's motive behind the use of derivatives, since well-governed firms are more likely to use derivatives to hedge rather than to speculate or pursue managers' self-interest. Consistent with this explanation, we find strong evidence that the use of currency derivatives for firms that have strong internal firm-level or external country-level governance is associated with a significant value premium.

The theoretical part shows that establishment size has not only a discouragement effect on the level of individual rent seeking but also a quantity effect as the number of rent seekers increases. The interplay of both effects - together with technological considerations - determines whether the employer chooses an inefficiently small or large establishment size. Introduction of a works council restores efficient establishment size although it is purely used as rent-seeking device. Whether the employer benefits from a works council or not depends on the degree of contract incompleteness and the degree of worker coordination via a works council. The empirical part indicates dominance of the discouragement effect over the quantity effect in establishments without works council. As theoretically predicted, works councils are beneficial by disentangling rent-seeking and production issues, thus eliminating the influence of the two rent-seeking effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, drawing on data from the Survey on Living Conditions and Habits of the Catalan Population (2006), we quantify the expected earnings differential between individuals who are proficient in Catalan and those who are not, taking into account the potential endogeneity between knowledge of Catalan and earnings. The results indicate the existence of a positive return to knowledge of Catalan, with a 7.5% increase in earnings estimated by OLS. When we account for the presence of endogeneity, monthly earnings are around 18% higher for individuals who are able to speak and write Catalan. We also find that language and education are complementary inputs for generating earnings in Catalonia, given that knowledge of Catalan increases monthly earnings only for more educated individuals.","[Di Paolo, Antonio] Univ Rovira & Virgili URV, Dept Econ, Reus 43204, Tarragona, Spain; [Lluis Raymond, Josep] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fonaments Anal Econ, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Di Paolo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili URV, Dept Econ, Avda Univ 1, Reus 43204, Tarragona, Spain.",antonio.dipaolo@urv.cat; josep.raymond@uab.cat,"Di Paolo, Antonio/F-1800-2015; Raymond, Josep/K-1698-2014","Di Paolo, Antonio/0000-0003-0000-7301; Raymond, Josep/0000-0002-4310-8471",,,,,32,39,41,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

We discover numerous discrepancies between the data reported in their article and their cited data sources. We replicate their results using their reported data and verify that their finding of no effect of race on card prices holds after corrections of data errors. Using their parsimonious metric of player performance, our extensions show that neither race nor Hispanic ethnicity has a significant effect on card prices and that our results are robust to alternative price and card availability measures. We also improve the ability of the Hewitt et al model to explain card prices when we use price and availability data that are more precisely matched to categories of card quality.

We estimate a heterogeneous agent model on the survey forecasts and show that the weight attached to the three forecast rules is adjusted over time in response to the relative importance of the rules in the actual foreign exchange market.

New exporters enter large countries and destinations with characteristics similar to their domestic market. Less similar, distant or less developed countries are entered by firms already exporting to other destinations. I formulate a dynamic general equilibrium model to test if these patterns are due to firms learning how to export (as other recent empirical findings have suggested) or other factors considered in the literature. In this model, heterogeneous firms experience learning in the form of market entry costs that depend on export history. Using Russian firm level data, I find that learning plays a significant role in explaining the observed entry patterns, which standard trade models cannot account for. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, we identify the exchange rate shock by imposing restrictions on the signs of impulse responses for a small subset of variables. These restrictions are consistent with a large class of theoretical models and previous empirical findings. We find that exchange rate PT is less than one at both short and long horizons. Among three price indexes, exchange rate PT is greatest for import price index and smallest for consumer price index. In addition, greater exchange rate PT is found in an economy which has a smaller size, higher import share, more persistent exchange rate, more volatile monetary policy, higher inflation rate, and less volatile aggregate demand.","[An, Lian] Univ N Florida, Coggin Coll Business, Dept Econ & Geog, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Wang, Jian] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX 75201 USA",State University System of Florida; University of North Florida; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"An, L (通讯作者)，Univ N Florida, Coggin Coll Business, Dept Econ & Geog, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",lian.an@unf.edu; Jian.Wang@dal.frb.org,,,,,,,30,39,46,2,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Profit-making private enterprises remained small and ephemeral, hindering the formation of stable coalitions capable of bargaining with the state.

Several key coefficients in the model-such as the slopes of the Phillips and IS curves, the sensitivities of domestic inflation and output to global output, and so forth-are allowed in the estimation to depend on the extent of globalization (modeled as the changing degree of openness to trade of the economy), and, therefore, they become time-varying. The empirical results indicate that globalization can explain only a small part of the reduction in the slope of the Phillips curve. The sensitivity of U.S. inflation to global measures of output may have increased over the sample, but it remains very small. The changes in the IS curve caused by globalization are similarly modest. Globalization does not seem to have led to an attenuation in the effects of monetary policy shocks. The nested closed-economy specification still appears to provide a substantially better fit of U.S. data than various open-economy specifications with time-varying degrees of openness. Some time variation in the model coefficients over the postwar sample exists, particularly in the volatilities of the shocks, but it is unlikely to be related to globalization.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Milani, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",fmilani@uci.edu,,,,,,,39,14,17,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This emphasis has been prompted by a growing recognition that the benefits and opportunity costs associated with such services are frequently given cursory consideration in policy analyses or even completely ignored. The valuation of biodiversity and ecosystem services is therefore increasingly seen as a crucial element of robust decision making and this has been reflected in a growing body of related research. We provide a critical review of some of this research, considering the valuation methods applied to date and focussing upon their limitations in respect to certain categories of ecosystem services (particularly cultural services) and the applicability of the extant literature to new settings. Substantial questions also remain at the interface of natural science and economics and we consider the potential contribution of the conceptualization of ecosystems as assets as a response to this challenge. As part of this review we also highlight the role which large scale oecosystem assessments' have played as an impetus to extending the valuation evidence base and the way in which frameworks and assessments of how ecosystems contribute to human wellbeing might be translated into policy thinking and decision analyses.","[Atkinson, Giles; Mourato, Susana] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Atkinson, Giles; Mourato, Susana] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Bateman, Ian] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Bateman, Ian] Univ E Anglia, Ctr Social & Econ Res Global Environm CSERGE, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Atkinson, G (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.",g.atkinson@lse.ac.uk; i.bateman@uea.ac.uk; s.mourato@lse.ac.uk,"Atkinson, Giles/H-3009-2013; Bateman, Ian J/F-8011-2010","Bateman, Ian/0000-0002-2791-6137; Atkinson, Giles/0000-0001-6736-3074","ESRC [ES/G035989/1, ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1, ES/G035989/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,119,93,107,1,183,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

When this is not the case we find that one firm (not always the public firm but sometimes also the private one) behaves as a leader in the choice of location and location decisions are made sequentially.

The model captures two main features of China-US trade: China's fixed exchange rate regime and the use of the US dollar as the international medium of exchange. The main conclusions of this paper are threefold. First, an improvement in the productivity of China's tradable sector would benefit both China and the US. Second, a RMB appreciation would reduce consumption in the US and increase consumption in China, and would likely reduce China's trade surplus. It would also lead to a contraction in China's tradable sector and an expansion in US's tradable sector. Third, a monetary expansion in the US would hurt China because it would lead to a transfer of wealth from China to the US, a fall in China's relative wage rate and terms of trade, and an artificial expansion in China's tradable sector. A US monetary expansion would also increase China's trade surplus. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In our model, managers decide whether or not to integrate their firms, trading off the pecuniary benefits of coordinating production decisions with the private benefits of operating in their preferred ways. The price of output is a crucial determinant of this choice, since it affects the size of the pecuniary benefits. Organizational choices also depend on the terms of trade in supplier markets, which affect the division of surplus between managers. We show that, even when firms do not relocate across countries, the price changes triggered by the liberalization of product markets can lead to changes in ownership structures within countries. The removal of barriers to facto: mobility can also induce widespread restructuring, which can lead to increases in product prices (or declines in quality), hurting consumers worldwide.

Two countries sharing identical characteristics may end up in either a low poverty-low brain drain equilibrium or in a high poverty-high brain drain equilibrium. In this paper, we build a model which endogenizes high-skilled emigration and economic performances in order to derive the conditions under which multiplicity occurs. After identifying country-specific parameters, we find that in the majority of developing countries, the best equilibrium is selected and that the observed brain drain is inevitable. In 22 small developing countries however, the worse equilibrium prevails, implying that poverty and brain drain are increased by coordination failure. These countries require appropriate development policies, such as a temporary subsidization of the repatriation of their high-skilled expatriates.

This paper introduces a hybrid framework developed to assess future household energy demand in France. Res-IRF, a bottom-up module of energy consumption for space heating, has several distinctive features: (i) a clear separation between energy efficiency, i.e. investment in energy efficient technologies, and sufficiency. i.e. changes in the utilization of energy consuming durables which allows the rebound effect to be assessed; (ii) the inclusion of barriers to energy efficiency in the form of intangible costs, consumer heterogeneity parameters and the learning-by-doing process; (iii) an endogenous determination of retrofitting which represents trade-offs between retrofit quantity and quality. Subsequently, Res-IRF is linked to the IMACLIM-R computable general equilibrium model. This exercise shows that, compared to a 37% reduction in final energy demand achievable in business as usual in existing dwellings in 2050, an additional reduction of 21% could be achieved if relevant barriers to efficiency and sufficiency were overcome.

Led by China and India, the share of developing economies in global exports more than doubled between 1994 and 2008. One feature of new trade patterns is greater South-South trade. China and India have booming demand for imported raw materials, which they use to build cities and factories. Industrialization throughout the South has deepened global production networks, contributing to greater trade in intermediate inputs. A second feature of new trade patterns is the return of comparative advantage as a driver of global commerce. Growth in low- and middle-income nations makes specialization according to comparative advantage more important for the global composition of trade, as North-South and South-South commerce overtakes North-North flows. China's export specialization evolves rapidly over time, revealing a capacity to speed up product ladders. Most developing countries hyper-specialize in a handful of export products. The emergence of low- and middle-income countries in trade reveals significant gaps in knowledge about the deep empirical determinants of export specialization, the dynamics of specialization patterns, and why South-South and North-North trade differ.","[Hanson, Gordon H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Emerging & Pacific Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hanson, Gordon H.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hanson, GH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Emerging & Pacific Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",gohanson@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,48,94,108,0,39,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Applying a cross-sectional portfolio approach we find evidence that the largest pension funds outperform the smallest funds.","[Huang, Xiaohong] Univ Twente, Sch Management & Governance, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Huang, Xiaohong] Netspar, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Mahieu, Ronald J.] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Mahieu, Ronald J.] Netspar, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Twente; Tilburg University,"Huang, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Sch Management & Governance, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands.",x.huang@utwente.nl; r.j.mahieu@uvt.nl,"Huang, Xiaohong/AAA-5035-2020",,,,,,27,8,8,2,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2012,160,1,,,,,17,34,,10.1007/s10645-011-9176-3,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,892LQ,,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300288100002,0

They and many subsequent studies observe that bubbles are robust to many treatment changes. Instead, bubbles are avoided only when subjects are experienced in the same setting, when the dividend-process is experienced by subjects beforehand, or when the fundamental value-process (FV) is presented in a well understandable context to reduce subjects' confusion. We extend this line of research and show that even marginal changes in the experimental instructions/procedure can eliminate bubbles in the SSW-model. In particular, we show that mispricing is significantly reduced and overvaluation is eliminated completely (i) when the fundamental value process is displayed in a graph instead of a table or (ii) when subjects are asked about the current fundamental value at the beginning of each period. From a questionnaire conducted at the end of the experiment we infer that these treatment changes help to improve subjects' understanding of the FV-process. We conclude that all bubble reducing factors have one common feature: they allow subjects to understand the non-intuitive declining FV-process of the SSW-model better and thus reduce subjects' confusion about the FV-process.","[Huber, Juergen; Kirchler, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Banking & Finance, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Kirchler, Michael] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Ctr Finance, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Innsbruck; University of Gothenburg,"Kirchler, M (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Banking & Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",juergen.huber@uibk.ac.at; michael.kirchler@uibk.ac.at,,"Huber, Juergen/0000-0003-0073-0321",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 22040] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),,,17,36,37,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Earnings response coefficients tend to be the largest in recession and lowest in expansion, but in most cases the differences between them are not big enough to be statistically significant. The results indicate some support for overreaction to bad news in expansion and underreaction to good news in recession. However, due to limitations of this paper arising from the naive earnings expectations models used and differences in results reported using different state of the economy measures, more powerful tests on more developed markets with better data availability are needed to verify reported tendencies.","[Laidroo, Laivi] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Grigaliuniene, Zana] Siauliai Univ, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Tallinn University of Technology; Siauliai University,"Laidroo, L (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Akad Tee 3, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",laivi.laidroo@tseba.ttu.ee; zana@smf.su.lt,"Laidroo, Laivi/J-5996-2013","Laidroo, Laivi/0000-0002-4860-890X",,,,,45,4,4,1,17,EUROBALTIC CENTRES EXCELLENCE,RIGA,"RAINA BLVD 19, RIGA, LV-1586, LATVIA",1406-099X,,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

First, his presentation of class struggles and institutions as contractual relations, understood in economic terms, is highly questionable.

This introduces concerns regarding wage-and profit-led economies that change the comparative static properties.

One unique contribution of the paper is that we model China as a large open economy in one structural VAR model with the U.S. by utilizing combinations of short-and long-run identification restrictions and relax the small open economy assumption usually imposed on China. Using monthly data for the period of 1990: 4 to 2007: 12, we find the following. First, U.S. shocks do not explain much of the output fluctuations in China, indicating that the two economies are subject to asymmetric shocks. Optimum currency area theory suggests that more flexibility of the RMB relative to the dollar may be desirable. Second, U.S. shocks explain little of the fluctuations in China's CPI, suggesting that the benefits of importing inflation from the U.S. by pegging to the dollar are minimal, thus more flexibility in the RMB relative to the dollar is feasible. Third, U.S. shocks do not influence China's international competitiveness ( REER) to a noticeable extent, suggesting that moving toward more flexibility relative to the dollar may be in China's interest.","[Sun, Wei] Grand Valley State Univ, Seidman Coll Business, Dept Econ, Grand Rapids, MI 49504 USA; [An, Lian] Univ N Florida, Dept Econ & Geog, Coggin Coll Business, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA",Grand Valley State University; State University System of Florida; University of North Florida,"Sun, W (通讯作者)，Grand Valley State Univ, Seidman Coll Business, Dept Econ, 401 W Fulton St, Grand Rapids, MI 49504 USA.",sunw@gvsu.edu,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,17,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We match the World Bank enterprise-level data on bribes with a unique cross-country telecom regulation dataset collected by Wallsten et al. (2004), finding that (1) strong regulatory substance (the content of regulation) and regulatory governance reduce corruption; (2) competition and privatization reduces corruption; (3) the effects of regulatory substance on corruption control are stronger in countries with state-owned or partially state-owned telecoms, greater competition, and higher telecommunication fees; and (4) bureaucratic quality exert substitution effects to regulatory substance in deterring corruption. Overall, our results suggest that regulatory strategies that reduce information asymmetry and increase accountability tend to reduce illegal side-payments for connections.

It examines beta- and sigma-convergence of the most important financial instruments: deposits, debt securities, shares and insurance products. The analysis is conducted on two panels of OECD countries, using data gathered from the flow of funds and from the Financial Development and Structure Database (Beck et al., 2009). In both data sets, strong evidence supports the existence of beta-convergence of shares and insurance products, confirming an increasing importance of capital markets all over the developed world. In contrast, mixed results are obtained for debt securities and deposits due to differences across countries in the weight of national public debts and in the role of banks.

Survey evidence from 28 post-communist countries Studies of mass support for economic reform reveal a simple conclusion: Everyone hates privatization. Yet whether respondents hold this view due to a preference for state property or concerns about the legitimacy of privatization is unclear. We test these arguments using a 2006 survey of 28,000 individuals in 28 post-communist countries and find that a lack of human capital affects support for revising privatization primarily via a preference for state property over private property; whereas transition-related hardships influence support for revising privatization due to both a preference for state property and concerns about the legitimacy of privatization. These results suggest the value of analyses that not only link respondent traits with support for policy, but that also probe the motivations that underpin this support. They also indicate that opposition to privatization should not be equated with support for renationalization. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (1) (2012) 44-61.

In particular, I develop a two-sector monetary growth model in which a group of agents is exposed to liquidity shocks and money is essential. Banks insure depositors against such risk and invest in the economy's assets. In this setting, I compare an economy with a perfectly competitive banking sector to an economy with a fully concentrated financial sector. Unlike previous work, banks can have market power in both deposits and capital markets. Compared to a perfectly competitive financial sector, I demonstrate that a monopolistic banking system can have substantial adverse consequences on capital formation, assets prices, and the degree of risk sharing. Furthermore, multiple steady-states can emerge and the economy becomes subject to poverty traps. More importantly, market power in financial markets may overturn the Tobin effect present under a perfectly competitive financial sector. This necessarily happens in economies with high degrees of liquidity risk and low levels of capital formation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

First, across firms selling a given product, exporters that charge higher prices earn greater revenues in each destination, have bigger worldwide sales, and enter more markets. Second, firms that export more, enter more markets, and charge higher export prices import more expensive inputs. Third, across destinations within a firm-product, firms set higher prices in richer, larger, bilaterally more distant and overall less remote countries. Fourth, across destinations within a firm-product, firms earn bigger revenues in markets where they set higher prices. Fifth, across firms within a product, exporters with more destinations offer a wider range of export prices. Finally, firms that export more, enter more markets, and offer a wider range of export prices pay a wider range of input prices and source inputs from more origin countries. We propose that trade models should incorporate two features to rationalize these patterns in the data: more successful exporters use higher quality inputs to produce higher quality goods (stylized facts 1 and 2), and firms vary the quality of their products across destinations by using inputs of different quality levels (stylized facts 3, 4, 5, and 6).","[Manova, Kalina] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Manova, K (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,62,356,423,8,109,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The results point to the key role of policies that stimulate growth in the less developed countries.

This paper uses the adaptive Lasso estimator to determine variables important for economic growth. The adaptive Lasso estimator is a computationally very efficient procedure that simultaneously performs model selection and parameter estimation. The computational cost of this method is negligibly small compared with standard approaches in the growth regressions literature. We apply this method for a regional dataset for the European Union covering the 255 NUTS2 regions in the 27 member states over the period 19952005. The results suggest that initial GDP per capita (with an implied convergence speed of about 1.5% per annum), human capital (proxied by the shares of highly and medium educated in the working age population), structural labor market characteristics (the initial unemployment rate and the initial activity rate of the low educated) as well as being a capital region are important for economic growth.","[Wagner, Martin] Inst Adv Studies, A-1060 Vienna, Austria; [Schneider, Ulrike] Univ Gottingen, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany; [Wagner, Martin] Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway",University of Gottingen,"Wagner, M (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Studies, Stumpergasse 56, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.",martin.wagner@ihs.ac.at,,"Wagner, Martin/0000-0002-6123-4797; Schneider, Ulrike/0000-0002-3759-0011",,,,,34,16,17,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Given the limited stock of land and the infant/unorganized manufacturing sector, increased demand for food has to be satisfied by improving production efficiency. This article examines how this could be achieved. Stochastic distance function and data envelopment analysis models identify the existence of a high degree of technical inefficiency in Nepalese agriculture, suggesting that there is a substantial prospect of increasing agricultural productivity using the existing level of inputs and resources more efficiently. Among the three farm sizes in the data set, medium size farmers achieve a higher technical efficiency than large and small farm sizes, suggesting that productive efficiency can be increased with the encouragement of creating medium size holdings. The observed decreasing returns to scale also implies that productivity gains could be achieved by breaking up of large farms into small family farms. The technical inefficiency model suggests the potential for shifting the production frontier upwards by providing ownership of land, increasing farmers' education and knowledge, and increasing land quality, including irrigation facilities.","[Bjorndal, Trond] Univ Portsmouth, CEMARE, Portsmouth PO1 2HY, Hants, England; [Adhikari, Chandra Bahadur] Tribhuvan Univ, CNAS, Kathmandu, Nepal",University of Portsmouth; Tribhuvan University,"Bjorndal, T (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, CEMARE, 141 High St, Portsmouth PO1 2HY, Hants, England.",Trond.Bjorndal@port.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,27,28,4,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

They do not validate, however, the assumption that the marginal impact of financial development on the steady-state growth rate is more favorable Than the degree of financial development is low.

A politician who admits to wrongdoing will likely suffer some loss of popularity, but probably not as great as if he denied wrong doing and was subsequently discovered to have lied. This simple observation has a number of implications. For example, a politician in a marginal seat may have little choice but to risk lying as admitting will lose him too much popularity to survive. On the other hand, a politician in a relatively safe seat might survive the loss from admitting, but not from lying and being caught. Therefore we might predict the likelihood that a politician admits to a scandal to be positively related (over some range at least) to the security of his seat.

They are side effects of human and economic activities (e. g. road transport, telecommunication) and they affect individuals' well being negatively without compensation. In recent years, the increased number of mobile phone antennas in residential areas, and thus the increased intensity of radiated power, has aroused public concern, discussions and protests. The view of an antenna is annoying an increasing number of inhabitants. In this article, the stated Choice Experiment (CE) is used to estimate the Willingness To Pay (WTP) residents in the cities of Zurich and Lugano place on the reduction of these three environmental loads. Estimation results reveal that there is a positive and significant WTP for a reduction of air pollution and traffic noise levels to those limit values fixed by the government. Respondents also show WTP for reducing electrosmog and removing mobile phone antennas from their view, however to a lesser extent. In addition, this is the first study that estimates the benefit of a reduction of electrosmog using a CE.","[Banfi, Silvia; Filippini, Massimo; Horehajova, Andrea] CEPE, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Filippini, Massimo] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Ist Microecon & Econ Pubbl, Lugano, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Horehájová, A (通讯作者)，CEPE, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",ahorehajova@ethz.ch,"Filippini, Massimo/K-8155-2013","Filippini, Massimo/0000-0002-5972-4439",,,,,26,12,12,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

What is immediately apparent as we get better measures is that, between countries, health differences amongst those at older ages are real and large. Countries are ranked differently according to whether one considers life expectancy, prevalence, or the incidence of a specific condition. Moreover, the magnitude of international disparities may vary according to whether measures utilize doctor-diagnosed conditions or biomarker-based indicators of disease and poor health.

We base these decompositions on an estimated on-the-job search model that incorporates latent ability, search frictions, firm-worker match quality, human capital accumulation, and endogenous migration between large, medium, and small cities. Counterfactual simulations of the model indicate that variation in returns to experience and differences in wage intercepts across location type are the most important mechanisms contributing to observed city size wage premia. Variation in returns to experience is more important for generating wage premia between large and small locations, while differences in wage intercepts are more important for generating wage premia between medium and small locations. Sorting on unobserved ability within education group and differences in labour market search frictions and distributions of firm-worker match quality contribute little to observed city size wage premia.

Real shocks, in contrast, can have permanent as well as temporary effects on both nominal and real commodity prices. When nominal and real shocks are decomposed in this manner, real shocks are found to be of much greater importance to the observed movements in commodity prices. We use the Blanchard and Quah (BQ, 1989) decomposition to obtain the permanent and temporary components of the real commodity price series and relate this to the rate of growth of world industrial production as an indicator of business cycle movements. The results suggest that the impact of the business cycle is self-stabilizing in that there is an initial positive effect on growth in commodity prices followed by a fully offsetting negative effect.","[Bloch, Harry; Fraser, Patricia; MacDonald, Garry] Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Fraser, Patricia] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",Curtin University; University of Aberdeen,"MacDonald, G (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",MacDonaldG@cbs.curtin.edu.au,"Bloch, Harry/A-9591-2008; Bloch, Harry/O-1058-2019","Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925; Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925",,,,,29,1,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our participation model is derived using the Deletion, Substitution and Addition (DSA) algorithm, a method used in epidemiology for model selection. We find that the asthma programme in question has no significant effect on participants that distinguishes them from matched nonparticipants, but it is not clear whether this is due to the effectiveness of the programme, heterogeneity of effects or barriers outside the programme's control.

The conceptual provisions are foremost focused on the measurement of a totality of the national macro surrounding advantages based on the generalized model which reflects the interdependencies of primary macro factors in a system with account of the impact (vector) of each of them. This study is intended to reveal the deterministic measurement possibilities oriented to the reasoned multiple criteria evaluation methods on the basis adopted for the particular task models. The technique supposes the following procedures: the identification of essential primary macro factors, their quantifiable assessment (in points) as primary criteria allowing the different weights of the impact on economic competitiveness and the composition of task pillars. When examining the primary macro factors, the indicators of global country's competitiveness index established by the World Economic Forum were taken into account. The whole of the typical primary macrofactors selected by three task pillars (those of specific business infrastructure, common economic surroundings, fiscal and monetary policy macrofactors) is presented. The favorability indexes of each pillar (as partially integrated criteria having different significance) and, in its turn, the generalized measure - macro surroundings favorability index have been determined by applying, in particular, Simple Additive Weighting method.

The results indicate that faster economic growth increases the short-run likelihood that leaders will remain in office. The results are robust to controlling for a host of leader-, party-, and country-level variables. The effect of growth on the likelihood of leader exits appears to be generally similar across both democracies and autocracies.

We further decompose net offshoring into net inter-industry substitution and intra-industrial offshoring (replacement of domestic inputs for imported ones from the same sector). This last measure quantifies better the concept of delocalization of production to other countries looking for lower costs, the original idea behind offshoring. This decomposition allows us to further investigate on whether technical change or net offshoring is the main factor in recent Spanish industrial employment changes.","[Cadarso Vecina, Maria Angeles; Gomez Sanz, Nuria; Lopez Santiago, Luis Antonio; Tobarra Gomez, Maria Angeles] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales Albacete, Albacete 02071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Sanz, NG (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales Albacete, Plaza Univ 1, Albacete 02071, Spain.",nuria.gomez@uclm.es,"Cadarso, Maria Angeles/AAB-5700-2019; Tobarra-Gomez, Maria-Angeles/F-7301-2015; Lopez, Luis Antonio/S-4183-2018; Gomez, Nuria/F-8557-2015","Cadarso, Maria Angeles/0000-0002-5165-7729; Tobarra-Gomez, Maria-Angeles/0000-0002-4913-2544; Lopez, Luis Antonio/0000-0002-9733-7106; Gomez, Nuria/0000-0001-8583-4095",,,,,25,8,10,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We model the choice of the household's credit requirement using an unordered choice model, namely, a multinomial logit model. Our results reveal that the rural households are considerably credit constrained. The households who do not have an account in a FI have a lower chance of obtaining the loan and households who are credit constrained have relatively lower land holding and they do not possess livestock. Households who borrow for nonfarm purpose exhibit a lower chance of obtaining credit compared to those households who borrow for farm business.

By contrast, we argue in this article that the interrelationships between energy and emissions markets shall be modelled in a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Multivariate GARCH (MGARCH) framework, so as to reflect the dynamics of the correlations between the oil, gas and CO2 variables overtime. Using the Baba-Engle-Kraft-Kroner (BEKK), Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) and Dynamic Conditional Correlation MGARCH (DCC-MGARCH) models on daily data from April 2005 to December 2008, we highlight significant own-volatility, cross-volatility spillovers, and own persistent volatility effects for nearly all markets, indicating the presence of strong Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) and GARCH effects. Besides, we provide strong empirical evidence of time-varying correlations in the range of [-0.3; 0.3] between oil and gas, [-0.05; 0.05] between oil and CO2, and [-0.2; 0.2] between gas and CO2, that have not been considered by previous studies.

I exploit variation in the timing of implementation by exporting countries and in the level of corruption of importing countries to quantify the Convention's effects on bilateral exports. I use a large panel of country pairs to control for confounding global and national trends and shocks. I find that, on average, the Convention caused a reduction in exports from signatory countries to high corruption importers relative to low corruption importers. In particular, we observe a 5.7% relative decline in bilateral exports to importers that lie one standard deviation lower on the Worldwide Governance Indicators corruption index. This suggests that by creating large penalties for foreign bribery, the Convention indirectly increased transaction costs between signatory countries and high corruption importers. The Convention may have induced OECD firms to divert their exports to less corrupt countries; while non-OECD firms not bound by the Convention may have increased their exports to corrupt countries. I also find evidence that the Convention's effects differed across product categories.

To examine this, using the theoretical model, the paper examines whether the globalization of home-located tradable goods firms provides a benefit to the home country from the perspective of welfare. Specifically, since globalization is thought to have begun based on the difference in production costs of the home and the foreign country, we examine how an increase of productivity in the foreign non-tradable goods sector, which is the principal factor in the difference in production costs between the two countries, affects the welfare of the home country. We show that such an increase of productivity not only induces enterprise relocation, but also improves the welfare of the home country. In particular, the latter is demonstrated by an increase in the real flow of dividends that results from holding equities in tradable goods firms located abroad, i.e., the improvement in the income account. Hence, since the prediction of the model indicates that the globalization of firms is not a problem, it can be said that the globalization of Japanese firms is not a problem for the Japanese economy.

This paper investigates experimentally the importance of inducing a correct common prior in a two-person signaling game. Equilibrium selection arguments predict that different equilibria may be selected depending on whether the common prior is induced or not. Indeed, for a specific probability distribution of the sender's type, the long-run behavior without an induced common prior is shown to be different from the long-run behavior when a common prior is induced, while for other distributions long-run behavior is similar under both regimes.

To answer this question we consider a model of ecological discounting, where the representative consumer has a utility function defined over two attributes, consumption and environmental quality, which evolve stochastically over time. We characterize the determinants of the social discount rate and its behavior over time using a preference structure that disentangles attitudes towards intertemporal inequality, attitudes towards risk, and tastes over consumption and environmental quality. We show that the degree of substitutability between consumption and environmental quality, the degree of risk aversion, the degree of inequality aversion, and the rate at which these attitudes change as natural and man-made resources evolve over time are all important aspects of the ecological discount rate and its term structure. Our analysis suggests that over medium and long term horizons the ecological discount rate should be below the rate of time preference, supporting recent proposals for immediate action towards climate change mitigation.","[Echazu, Luciana; Nocetti, Diego] Clarkson Univ, Potsdam, NY 13676 USA; [Smith, William T.] Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",Clarkson University; University of Memphis,"Echazu, L (通讯作者)，Clarkson Univ, Potsdam, NY 13676 USA.",lechazu@clarkson.edu; dnocetti@clarkson.edu; wtsmith@memphis.edu,,,,,,,50,5,5,0,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In this model, there are two education stages: the first is compulsory, while advanced education is optional. Parents decide on the education policy by a majority vote, children attend schools and then decide whether to get advanced education. This paper shows that even in a simple scenario where only public education is available, children's college-attendance decisions may lead the single-crossing condition to fail, which indicates that a majority voting equilibrium may not exist. In a scenario where individuals can opt for private education services, the model provides necessary and sufficient conditions for an equilibrium of the ends-against-the-middle type, where the poor are decisive. An implication of this result is that the opting-out feature of education may improve the welfare of the poor.","Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Romero, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile.",gabriel.romero@usach.cl,"Romero, José Gabriel/AAE-1999-2020","Romero, José Gabriel/0000-0002-4142-4331",,,,,25,1,1,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In levels, for every $ 1 increase in real gross domestic product, net flows from various government programmes shrink by 45 cents, whereas net flows from 401(k) plans increase by 4.6 cents. In other words, 401(k) plans reduce the automatic stabilisation impact of government programmes by 10%-15%. Moreover, we find that Social Security has a net negative effect on household consumption, while 401(k) retirement accounts work the opposite way. In fact the destabilising effect of 401(k) plans on consumption is twice as strong as the one attributed to Social Security. These results highlight a significant problem with 401(k) retirement plans and any retirement plan that is dependent on financial markets.","[Ghilarducci, Teresa] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",The New School,"Ghilarducci, T (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, Room 1124A,6 E 16th St, New York, NY 10003 USA.",ghilardt@newschool.edu,,,,,,,16,11,11,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The model parameters are estimated through Maximum Likelihood (ML) and numerical solution of the transient probability density functions for the resulting stochastic process. The model's success is assessed with respect to its out-of-sample forecasting performance relative to univariate Time Series (TS) models of the Autoregressive Moving Average model, ARMA(p, q) and Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average, ARFIMA(p, d, q) varieties.

Identification and solution of individual problem solving results in innovation which in turn enables organizations to gain competitive position and improve the overall performance. The study constructs a model which measures the effect of conflict management approaches on innovation and the impact of innovation on organizational competitive position and performance.

Under the existing patent system of granting patents sequentially to successful innovators, the commercialization can be achieved by an inefficient firm (called control loss) and duplicative R&D efforts may occur through competitive innovation race. This study shows that the problems of control loss and duplicative R&D efforts can be prevented if the patent office grants a patent with a mandatory contingent delegation fee only to the first innovator. A carefully designed contingent fee function can induce the first innovator to internalize the patent office's objective function, leading to efficient commercialization by a lower cost firm.","[Kim, Weonseek] Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Koo, Bonwoo] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Chung Ang University; University of Waterloo,"Kim, W (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",wnsk65@cau.ac.kr; bonkoo@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

All of the above variables are accounted for in the model proposed by the author to describe the functioning of employees in the labour market. The model has been verified by the empirical analysis conducted on a group of economically active persons seeking employment in the labour market. The proposed model can complement the existing economic models used to explain the principles of competitive labour market. The model has also an applicable dimension, because it makes clear what attributes a successful modern employee should have to cope with the dynamic and competitive environment.","Uniwersytet Ekon, Katedra Teorii Organizacji & Zarzadzania, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Kowalczyk, E (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon, Katedra Teorii Organizacji & Zarzadzania, Poznan, Poland.",e.kowalczyk@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,4,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2012,,1,,,,,53,77,,,,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,902FH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301023500005,0

The paper's authors made great efforts to summarize MCDM methods but may have failed to consider several important new concepts and trends in the MCDM field for solving actual problems. First, the traditional model assumes the criteria are independently and hierarchically structured; however, in reality, problems are often characterized by interdependent criteria and dimensions and may even exhibit feedback-like effects. Second, relatively good solutions from the existing alternatives are replaced by aspiration levels to fit today's competitive markets. Third, the emphasis in the field has shifted from ranking and selection when determining the most preferable approaches to performance improvement of existing methods. Fourth, information fusion techniques, including the fuzzy integral method, have been developed to aggregate the performances. Finally, the original fixed resources in multi-objective programming are divided such that both decision and objective spaces are changeable. In this paper, we add new concepts and provide comments that could be thought of as an attempt to complete the original paper.","[Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung] Kainan Univ, Sch Commerce, Tao Yuan 338, Taiwan; [Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Management Technol, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; [Liou, James J.

They expand the ranking data to various implied choices in subsets and fit the expanded data in various ways; they do not present models of the original rank data, except in one case (that of the rank ordered logit). We build on that work by constructing models of the original rank data that are consistent with the weights implied by the data expansions. This results in two classes of models: the first includes the reversible ranking model and has useful score properties; the second includes the rank ordered logit model and has natural process interpretations. We summarize known and new results on relations between the two classes of models and present fits of the models to the data of a case study concerning micro-generation of electricity using solar panels - that is, where individual households generate electricity using a renewable energy technology.","[Marley, A.

Recession strengthened the position of highest-educated workers, penalizing the segment of youngest workers, in their early stage have necessitated further expansion of self-employment to the prejudice of dependent work. Recession in some cases reinforced the structural changes in employment, which were already present even before the recession (expansion of self-employment, share increase of the tertiary educated employed persons), in other cases, the recession has brought new structural changes (increase in the proportion of part-time work).

The purpose of the paper is to find out whether the Chinese financial markets in the last decade were a source or the result of the risk. Much attention has been paid to the period of the last financial crisis. One of the important findings is that the risk, generated locally, is transmitted via sequent markets to the absorbing one. This process may last up to 40 trading days. To detect whether the risk was transmitted between two markets or not, the Granger causality tests have been applied in connection with the causality in variance as well as causality in risk.

Whereas the lengthening of life opens huge opportunities for individuals if extra years are spent in prosperity and good health, it is however often regarded as a source of problems for policy-makers. The goal of this paper is to examine the key policy challenges raised by increasing longevity. For that purpose, we first pay attention to the representation of individual preferences, and to the normative foundations of the economy, and, then, we consider the challenges raised for the design of the social security system, pension policies, preventive health policies, the provision of long term care, as well as for long-run economic growth.","[Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Liege, CORE, TSE, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Ponthiere, Gregory] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Ponthiere, Gregory] Ecole Normale Super, F-75014 Paris, France",University of Liege; Paris School of Economics; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Pestieau, P (通讯作者)，Univ Liege, CORE, TSE, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",p.pestieau@ulg.ac.be; gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,,,,,,,98,3,3,2,13,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2012,,200,,,,,41,74,,,,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,980QL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306908000002,0

In this paper, the HII-I approach is applied to model the mode choice between a regional train, a (hypothetical) regional bus and a car (only available for car users). Test results show that process equality is given when analysing only the data of the bi-modal sub-experiments whereas the assumption of process equality is rejected for data of the tri-modal sub-experiments, where differences in error variances between the sub-experiments are found.

The methodology is based on Re-centred Influence Functions (RIF), as suggested by Firpo et al. (2009). The advantage of this methodology is that it not only decomposes the unconditional wage change at any quantile of the wage distribution, but also allows the characterization of the contribution of any single covariate on each component. I find that real earnings of males in the Philippines declined and the decline along the earnings distribution is generally higher at higher deciles for all males and higher at lower deciles in Manila. Decomposition results are driven by the wage structure component, while the composition effect is small and generally positive with education as the main contributor. Within the wage structure effect, the main determinants are associated with changes in the rewards of experience and occupation, along with residual change (change in intercepts).","Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Econ, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Sakellariou, C (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Econ, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",acsake@ntu.edu.sg,,"Sakellariou, Chris/0000-0003-3299-4348",,,,,29,10,10,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Moreover, omitting spatial FDI leads to a serious misspecification of the model explaining FDI location and biases estimation of the coefficient of the foreign market potential variable, which is found to be a non-robust determinant of FDI location. The spatial complementarity is stronger for disaggregated data such as bilateral FDI and sector level FDI. There is substantial heterogeneity of spatial FDI spillovers across sectors.

Using a choice experiment, our results suggest that perceived complexity of the task has a significant impact on cheap talk's effectiveness in reducing hypothetical bias.

Despite the progress that the EU has achieved so far in improving the governance of the euro, we argue, that the German strategy of authoritarian austerity is hindering economic growth in Europe. This, in turn, could undermine the legitimacy of the European project and force the collapse of the common currency.

Individuals' adoption choices are affected by profit and risk considerations and by credit and biophysical constraints. New technologies spread gradually, reflecting heterogeneity among potential adopters, processes of learning and technological improvement, and policies and institutions. Adaptation is the response of economic agents and societies to major shocks. We distinguish between reactive and proactive adaptation. The latter is important in the context of climate change and consists of mitigation, reassessment, and innovation that aim to affect the timing and location of shocks. Adaptation strategies also include adoption of innovation and technology transfer across locations, insurance and international trade, and migration and invasions. Recent research emphasizes multidisciplinary collaborations; historical analysis; and the roles of returns to scale of key technologies, social networks, behavioral economics, path dependency, and ex ante adjustment in explaining patterns of adoption and adaptation.","[Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Jinhua] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Heiman, Amir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Michigan State University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Zilberman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",zilber11@berkeley.edu,"Zhao, Jinhua/GYV-4433-2022; heiman, Amir/S-1377-2016","heiman, Amir/0000-0002-8469-5211",,,,,186,92,105,2,125,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4704-8,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

A direct implication of our framework is that the strong bank's equity will be priced as a standard call option, while the weak bank's equity will be priced as a down-and-out call option. We find that an increase in either bailout (i.e. distressed loan purchases and direct equity injections) directly decreases the weak bank's default risk but indirectly increases the strong bank's default risk. Accordingly, either bailout contributes to banking stability since the indirect positive effect insufficiently offsets the direct negative effect, giving an overall negative response of default risks to an increase in either bailout. Higher competition by shifting to quasi-competition from collusion increases banking stability under either bailout. Our analysis suggests that competition is aligned with the regulatory objective of improving stability.","[Tsai, Jeng-Yan; Lin, Jyh-Horng; Cheng, Chu-Yun] Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei City, Taiwan",Tamkang University,"Tsai, JY (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",tsaij@mail.tku.edu.tw,"Cheng, Chu-Yun/IYS-3848-2023",,,,,,33,0,0,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The new point system increased the points earned from wins in singles matches significantly if the two thirds or more of players in their sex/age group chose to play doubles. We examine three types of potential responses to the new system: (1) a 'positive' response of playing doubles more by singles winners, (2) a 'subversive' response of playing doubles less by singles losers, and (3) a 'slack' response of playing loosely in their doubles matches by singles winners.

We derive formal expressions for revenue and welfare effects, which can be quantified with a minimum of information about behavioral effects. Using VAT statistics as well as national accounts, we provide quantitative estimates of the effects of repealing the VAT exemption in Germany. Our baseline estimate indicates that tax revenues would increase by some a,not sign1.7 billion or 1.3 % of VAT revenues (excluding import turnover tax).

In order to show that, we adopt a Schumpeterian growth model where the resources allocated to science are endogenously determined within the economy and science is organised according to the institution of Open Science. This latter consists in a self-reinforcing code of conduct, which comprises an incentive scheme based on the priority rule, and on the presence of both real rewards and social rewards. Social rewards take two main forms according to the source concerned: one is the social reward deriving from major innovations; another consists in high reputation enjoyed by researchers who put a high level of effort into their job, and devote themselves to the advancement of science. This set of rules causes the emergence of two locally stable steady-states: a low equilibrium, where the economy is endowed with a small science sector; and a high equilibrium, where the economy has a large science sector with rapid knowledge advancement. The two equilibria can account for the huge differences currently existing between scientific sectors of more developed and less developed countries. Comparative static results further characterise the two equilibria, since monetary and social rewards have different effects according to the type of equilibrium that emerges. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using household-level data from the European Community Household Panel covering eight countries over the period from 1994 to 2001, this study applies a dynamic probit model that incorporates both state dependency and individual fixed effects. Exploiting a latterly enhanced bias-corrected fixed-effects probit model, I address the persistent nature of subjective financial inadequacy by directly estimating fixed effects while correcting for incidental parameters and avoiding the initial conditions problem of dynamic models. The results reveal that employing time-invariant individual effects to model subjective monetary perception is essential. However, by controlling for household heterogeneity, income, indebtedness, and health status, I find that in addition to the major differences across European households, country-specific factors can have adverse effects on the persistent nature of perceived financial inadequacy.","[Kaya, Orcun] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Kaya, O (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bank Res Banking Financial Markets & Regu, Taunusanlage 12, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",orcun.kaya@db.com,,"Kaya, Orcun/0000-0003-3592-5268",,,,,44,7,7,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Agents in our model are randomly matched to interact in finitely repeated games. They form beliefs by learning from past behavior of others and then best respond to these beliefs looking k periods ahead. We establish almost sure convergence of our stochastic process and characterize absorbing sets. These can be very different from the predictions in both the fully rational model and the adaptive, but myopic case. In particular we find that also Non-Nash outcomes can be sustained whenever they satisfy a local efficiency condition. We then characterize stochastically stable states in a class of 2 x 2 games and show that under certain conditions the efficient action in Prisoner's Dilemma games and coordination games can be singled out as uniquely stochastically stable. We show that our results are consistent with typical patterns observed in experiments on finitely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games and in particular can explain what is commonly called the endgame effect and the restart effect. Finally, if populations are composed of some myopic and some forward looking agents, parameter constellations exist such that either might obtain higher average payoffs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Main hypothesis in this research was that barriers to export for Serbian exporters have been similar to those faced by exporters in other countries, and that the level of their influence depends on firm's characteristics. The empirical research has been conducted through a survey, using a questionnaire with 178 exporters taking part in it. Collected data have been analysed by descriptive statistics, differences among groups and correlation tests. The results imply that most export barriers refer to domestic business environment and that there is a correlation among firm's size, length of export experience and capital ownership with certain factors that may cause problems for exporting business.","[Radojevic, Predrag D.] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia; [Marjanovic, Darko] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Radovanov, Tatjana] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, Seoul, South Korea",University of Belgrade; University of Novi Sad; KDI School of Public Policy & Management,"Radojevic, PD (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",predrag.radojevic@open.telekom.rs,"Marjanović, Darko/CAG-7328-2022; Radojevic, Predrag D/ADN-0324-2022","Marjanović, Darko/0000-0001-7336-1964; Radojevic, Predrag D/0000-0003-3832-0184",,,,,43,3,3,0,14,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

It argues that while these economists acknowledge that social costs exist, and are rooted in the way the economy functions, they do not frame their economic inquiries accordingly. This is because they believe that scientific dialogue is possible only by accepting a commonly shared ground for scientific inquiry that focuses on restricted, but generally accepted goals. This behavior obscures a major implication of systemic openness: The choice of goals and the way scientific inquiry is carried out do not depend on once-and-for-all criteria, but require the explicit formulation of a range of value judgments. The conclusion of the paper is that it is possible to deal with social issues while pursuing scientific dialogue, but this requires framing the dialogue in a twofold manner: identifying the shared grounds of inquiry and identifying the specific issues to be investigated","Univ Macerata, Macerata, MC, Italy",University of Macerata,"Ramazzotti, P (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Macerata, MC, Italy.",,,,,,,,53,2,2,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

J,"Rodrik, D",,,,"Rodrik, Dani",,,"When Ideas Trump Interests: Preferences, Worldviews, and Policy Innovations",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMICS; POLITICS,"Ideas are strangely absent from modern models of political economy. In most prevailing theories of policy choice, the dominant role is instead played by vested interests-elites, lobbies, and rent-seeking groups which get their way at the expense of the general public. Any model of political economy in which organized interests do not figure prominently is likely to remain vacuous and incomplete. But it does not follow from this that interests are the ultimate determinant of political outcomes. Here I will challenge the notion that there is a well-defined mapping from interests to outcomes. This mapping depends on many unstated assumptions about the ideas that political agents have about: 1) what they are maximizing, 2) how the world works, and 3) the set of tools they have at their disposal to further their interests. Importantly, these ideas are subject to both manipulation and innovation, making them part of the political game. There is, in fact, a direct parallel, as I will show, between inventive activity in technology, which economists now routinely make endogenous in their models, and investment in persuasion and policy innovation in the political arena. I focus specifically on models professing to explain economic inefficiency and argue that outcomes in such models are determined as much by the ideas that elites are presumed to have on feasible strategies as by vested interests themselves. A corollary is that new ideas about policy-or policy entrepreneurship-can exert an independent effect on equilibrium outcomes even in the absence of changes in the configuration of political power. I conclude by discussing the sources of new ideas.","Inst Adv Study, Sch Social Sci, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Institute for Advanced Study - USA,"Rodrik, D (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Study, Sch Social Sci, Olden Lane, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",drodrik@ias.edu,,,,,,,56,144,153,4,95,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

By using recent developments in data mining, it is a question of the classification of heterogeneous data in order to sort hedge funds by risk class. In practical terms, risk levels relative to measures of histogram-valued data on VaR are calculated as an aid to decision-making. The empirical study was carried out on 1023 HFR-based hedge funds, where we had estimated monthly ARMA-GARCH or asymmetric GARCH VaR and CVaR measures between 01 January 2003 and 31 December 2008. We identify two sub-periods: from 2003 to 2005, and from 2006 to 2008 in order to identify a recovery period after the 2001-2002 crisis and the impact of the 2007-2008 crisis. First, the symbolic approach allows us to construct the measures of histogram-valued data on VaR by optimizing the definition of categories. A symbolic principal component analysis shows that the indices coming from the VaR of the GARCH and asymmetrical GARCH are the most pertinent. Second, we apply a criterion of inter-class inertia and retain a partitioning of hedge funds into three classes by dynamic K-means cluster analysis. For each of our sub-periods and for each class, a risk level is defined on the basis of the categories of the most discriminating variable.","[Toque, Carole] SYROKKO, Roissypole, France; [Terraza, Virginie] Univ Luxembourg, Ctr Res Econ & Management, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",University of Luxembourg,"Toque, C (通讯作者)，SYROKKO, Roissypole, France.",toque@syrokko.com,,"terraza, virginie/0000-0002-1967-4596",,,,,23,4,4,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A weighted social network describes how children are influenced not only by their parents but also by other role models within the society. Parents can invest into the purposeful socialization of their children by strategically displaying a cultural trait (which need not coincide with their true cultural trait). We observe a cultural substitution effect when parents choose their behavior optimally. Based on Nash equilibrium behavior, we then study the dynamics of cultural traits throughout generations. These converge if parent's influence on their children is large enough compared to the social environment's influence. Under convergent dynamics, closed subgroups fully assimilate, while heterogeneous traits prevail in the other groups. Speed of convergence is low when parents' incentives to socialize their children to the own trait are high. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In both cases there was an immediate and persistent effect on product availability. The number of goods available for sale fell 32 percent in Chile and 17 percent in Japan from the day of the disaster to its lowest point, which occurred 61 and 18 days after the earthquakes, respectively. Product availability recovered slowly, and a significant share of goods remained out of stock after six months. By contrast, prices were relatively stable and did not increase for months after the earthquakes, even for goods that were experiencing severe stockouts. These trends are present at all levels of aggregation, but appear strongly in non-perishable goods and emergency products. Our findings shed light into the determinants of sticky prices in conditions where traditional adjustment costs are less important. In particular, we look at the frequency and magnitudes of price changes in both countries and find that the results in Chile are consistent with pricing models where retailers have fear of customer anger. In Japan, by contrast, the evidence suggests a bigger role for supply disruptions that restricted the ability of retailers to re-stock goods after the earthquake.","[Cavallo, Alberto; Rigobon, Roberto] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cavallo, Eduardo] IDB, Washington, DC USA; [Rigobon, Roberto] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Inter-American Development Bank; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cavallo, A (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Mass Ave E62-512, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",acavallo@mit.edu,,,,,,,24,51,63,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

One form of policy was simply to require lenders to report on foreclosure prevention activities. Such policies represented a shift from the status quo for mortgage loan servicing firms operating under incomplete information doing nothing with non-paying loans while waiting for more information to be revealed to either foreclosing on the borrower or offering the borrower a modification of loan terms. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences empirical strategy, we exploit one policy implemented in Maryland for a subset of mortgage servicers and find evidence that firms perform more loan modifications, as well as file more foreclosures. Increasing foreclosure filings was contrary to the intent of the policy, suggesting that policymakers should be aware of how firms exhibit systematic biases, much like individuals.

In this paper, we use a relatively large lab-in-the-field experiment to explore risk preferences related to sweet potato production among a sample of farmers in northern Mozambique. A unique feature of this experiment is that it includes a large subsample of husband and wife pairs. After exploring correlations between husband and wife preferences, we explicitly test whether preferences follow the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function, and whether farmers follow expected utility theory or rank dependent utility theory in generating their preferences. We reject the null hypothesis that farmers' preferences follow the CRRA utility function, in favor of the more flexible power risk aversion preferences. If we make the common CRRA assumption in our sample, we poorly predict risk preferences among those who are less risk averse. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We derive age-profiles of detailed tax and expenditure categories from micro data and microsimulation models, and plug them into a long run demographic projection. We assess fiscal long term sustainability under current fiscal and budgetary policy for the base year 2010, and perform simulations of counterfactuals to determine the relative contribution of the most important factors of the long run unsustainability. This update of the generational accounts for Belgium shows that, not unexpectedly, the budgetary situation in Belgium violates the intertemporal budget constraint and hence is unsustainable in the long run. The current level of explicit debt, however, only plays a minor role in explaining this sustainability problem. Ageing and the related increase in age related expenditures are the main drivers of the long run fiscal imbalance and the high level of implicit debt. We disentangle the Belgian generational accounts into their regional components and show that the major explanation for regional differences in generational accounts is not divergent demographic projections, but the wide differences in socio-economic situations, as revealed by the region specific age-profiles.","[Decoster, Andre; Vanleenhove, Pieter] KULeuven, Dept Econ, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Flawinne, Xavier] Univ Liege, CREPP HEC, B-4000 Liege, Belgium",KU Leuven; University of Liege,"Vanleenhove, P (通讯作者)，KULeuven, Dept Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",andre.decoster@kuleuven.be; xflawinne@ulg.ac.be; pieter.vanleenhove@kuleuven.be,"Decoster, André/S-9719-2017","Decoster, André/0000-0002-0521-8610",,,,,32,3,3,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2014,41,4,,,,,663,686,,10.1007/s10663-013-9223-1,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS6BC,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344348900004,0

Changes in micro marginal income tax rates at both the personal and corporate levels yield statistically robust GDP responses of modest size.

Additionally, high supply-side concentration may expose countries to market power in different ways. To evaluate the strategic position of importing countries with regard to gas supplies, we disentangle the import price into different components and characterize each component as price increasing or price decreasing. Because of the complexity of the interrelations in the global gas market, we use an equilibrium model programmed as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP) and simulate the blockage of liquefied natural gas (LNG) flows through the Strait of Hormuz. This enables us to account for the oligopolistic nature and the asymmetry of the gas supply. We find that Japan faces the most severe price increases, as the Japanese gas demand completely relies on LNG supply. In contrast, European countries such as the UK benefit from good interconnection to the continental pipeline system and domestic price taking production, both of which help to mitigate an increase in physical costs of supply as well as in the exercise of market power.","[Growitsch, Christian; Hecking, Harald; Panke, Timo] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, D-50827 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Growitsch, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, Vogelsanger Str 321, D-50827 Cologne, Germany.",christian.growitsch@ewi.uni-koeln.de; harald.hecking@ewi.uni-koeln.de; timo.panke@ewi.uni-koeln.de,,,,,,,45,11,12,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In the euro area, inflation rates diverged after the creation of the single currency, but started to converge again from mid-2002. Against this background, we assess the convergence of inflation rates and business cycles and study the relationship between them. The analysis is made using an unobserved component model estimated with the Kalman filter. In general, from 1980 to 2008 inflation rates and business cycles became more aligned in the euro area, but inflation rates converged more quickly than business cycles. The output gap is found to be a better indicator of the business cycle than unit labour cost when studying convergence. By looking at the causality between the convergence of inflation and output gap, it is found that inflation divergence has a limited destabilising economic impact.","[Hall, Stephen G.] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England; [Lagoa, Sergio] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal",University of Leicester; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Lagoa, S (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE, Ave Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",s.g.hall@le.ac.uk; sergio.lagoa@iscte.pt,"hall, stephen George/AAR-7607-2021","Lagoa, Sergio/0000-0003-2790-6518",,,,,18,4,4,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

It uses voting data from Japanese local referenda to identify preferences of specific individual municipalities, thus allowing a richer examination of local government behavior.

Acknowledging that many real/social switching costs need to be created early while many contractual/pecuniary switching costs are set up late during the competition, we show that firms are better off minimizing real/social switching costs while maximizing contractual/pecuniary switching costs. The results highlight the importance of timing of creation that is embedded in different types of switching costs. We also show that switching costs can actually benefit consumers when firms practice behavior-based price discrimination because consumers can enjoy benefits of deep price discounts without the hassle of actually switching.

Sectors are not the units of Marxian economic analysis, but thinking through the meaning of sectors in Marxian terms allows for an analysis of the meaning and implications of a change in sectoral structure. Deindustrialisation is the sectoral shift that has been most prominent in recent decades and which is likely to have significant implications for the future of capitalism. This article develops an original Marxian theorisation of deindustrialisation. This conceptualisation includes a distinction between two forms of deindustrialisation. As well as taking into account changes in sectoral structure, the proposed typology considers whether such changes are associated with a shift between those activities that produce surplus value and those that do not or only a shift in the composition of surplus-value-producing activities. The distinction between different forms of deindustrialisation allows for an arguably richer analysis of this phenomenon than in more narrowly sector-based approaches.","[Tregenna, Fiona] Univ Johannesburg, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Tregenna, F (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",ftregenna@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,27,33,37,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Members who consider co-operatives to be an efficient business form value social ties to other members, even though the leadership does not enjoy much social capital.","[Golovina, Svetlana] Kurgan State Agr Acad, Kurgan, Russia; [Hess, Sebastian; Nilsson, Jerker] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; [Wolz, Axel] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe, Halle, Saale, Germany",Kurgan State Agricultural Academy; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Nilsson, J (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala, Sweden.",Jerker.Nilsson@slu.se,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Hess, Sebastian/ADS-1491-2022; Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019; Golovina, Svetlana/D-2949-2014","Hess, Sebastian/0000-0002-4597-7654; Golovina, Svetlana/0000-0002-1157-8487",,,,,42,7,7,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,OCT 2,2014,26,4,,,,,522,536,,10.1080/14631377.2014.964465,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AR8LT,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343827400005,0

This can delay the observation by traders of the exact capital charges and constraints of their institution. During this delay, traders face preference uncertainty. In this context, we study optimal trading strategies and equilibrium prices in a continuous centralized market. We focus on liquidity shocks, during which preference uncertainty is likely to matter most. Preference uncertainty generates allocative inefficiency, but need not reduce prices. Progressively learning about preferences generate round-trip trades, which increase volume relative to the frictionless market. In a cross section of liquidity shocks, the initial price drop is positively correlated with total trading volume. Across traders, the number of round-trips is negatively correlated with trading profits and average inventory.","[Biais, Bruno] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Hombert, Johan] HEC Paris, Paris, France; [Weill, Pierre-Olivier] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Weill, Pierre-Olivier] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Biais, B (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",,,,,,,,46,14,15,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Individuals face longevity risk, as there is a positive probability of passing away before the retirement period. We find nonpathological cases where it is better for long-run welfare to waste accidental bequests than to give them to the elderly. Next we study the introduction of a perfectly competitive life insurance market offering actuarially fair annuities.

The study further found that unemployment rate has a significant positive impact on the number of cigarettes smoked by the daily smokers. However, unemployment rate has no impact on the probability of being a smoker.

The model embeds a ritual-based religious organization in which signaling arises through the use of costly rituals, and a discipline-based religious organization in which such signaling occurs through the monitoring of past behavior. We use this framework to contrastpositively and normativelythese two forms of social signaling. We show that ritual-based religions, while using a costly and wasteful signal, also imply a higher level of coordination of behavior in social interactions and a higher incidence of mutual cooperation. Our welfare analysis suggests that communities are more likely to support a switch to a discipline-based religion if strategic complementarities are high, and if there is sufficiently high level of public information about social behavior. This accords with the success of Calvin's Reformation in Switzerland and France, a process characterized by the reduction of rituals along with the creation of institutions to monitor and publicize individuals' behavior, such as the Consistory.","[Levy, Gilat; Razin, Ronny] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Levy, G (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",g.levy1@lse.ac.uk; r.razin@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,13,15,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Therefore, for improving operational management and budget planning decisions, it is essential to understand the inherent relevance between freight rates and crude oil prices. Taking time-dependent features into account, this paper focuses on the multiscale correlation between freight rates and oil prices. Given the complexity and mutability of tanker freight rate process, this paper first extracts the intrinsic mode functions from the original data using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition model and then reconstructs two separate composite functions: high-frequency and low-frequency components, plus the residual as the long-term trend. Secondly, correlations of the multiscale components of freight rates and oil prices are examined based on relevance structure. Empirical results show that tanker freight rates and oil prices exhibit different multiscale properties with true economic meaning and are significantly correlated in the medium and the long term when taking the relevance structure into account. These findings offer some useful information to better understand the correlations between these two markets and more importantly, propose a novel perspective to investigate the dynamic relationship between two markets.

We show that the standard portrayal of the BRICS as economic success stories as well as the emphasis placed on economic growth in the reduction of deprivation must be qualified to some extent.","[Anderson, Edward; Esposito, Lucio] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Esposito, L (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",Edward.anderson@uea.ac.uk; lucio.esposito@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,81,8,8,3,32,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

This paper provides two reasons for this false signal. First, while the Reserve Bank never actually officially declared the start of a downswing, by alternative measures a downswing did actually occur. It is this severe weakness in economic activity at that time that the yield curve pointed to. Second, short-term interest rates in 2003 were higher than they should have been because of a mistake made in measuring consumer price inflation. Because South Africa had recently introduced an inflation-targeting regime, policy interest rates were, as a result of this error, kept too high for too long. This policy mistake was rectified as soon as the error in the Consumer Price Index was discovered. Thus, the yield curve in 2003 pointed to the reality that short-term interest rates were too high and risked pushing the economy into full blown recession. This is demonstrated by the fact that it was a fall in long bond interest rates that caused the yield spread to turn negative, indicating expectations that short-term interest rates would need to be cut - as indeed they were.","[Botha, Ferdi; Keeton, Gavin] Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Botha, F (通讯作者)，Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",f.botha@ru.ac.za,,,,,,,19,5,5,1,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

As far as is known this is the first paper explicitly quantifying both effects together. By doing so we offer a more complete picture of when and how oil shocks impact stock returns, thus allowing investors to make more informed responses to oil shocks.

Assuming that the latter serves as a transit country for undocumented immigrants, a key question is how much aid should D provide to T for the purpose of strengthening its immigration controls. The problem for T is to determine what proportion of aid to use strictly for immigration control rather than trying to meet other border-security objectives. We examine the Nash equilibrium values of the policy instruments of both countries and compare them with those which are optimal when international cooperation on immigration control extends to maximization of joint welfare.

If the goods produced in the countries are substitutes (complements), capital stock grows (declines) in the reformed country relative to the neighbouring country. Social security reform makes goods produced in the reformed country cheaper; this has an additional negative effect on the old generation in the reformed country, but compensates the old generation in the neighbouring country with cheaper imports due to a reduction in the tax base arising from emigration.","[Fedotenkov, Igor] Vilnius State Univ, Fac Math & Informat, Dept Econometr, LT-03225 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Fedotenkov, Igor] Bank Lithuania, Dept Econ, LT-01121 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Fedotenkov, Igor] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy",Vilnius University; Bank of Lithuania; University of Verona,"Fedotenkov, I (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Fac Math & Informat, Dept Econometr, Naugarduko 24, LT-03225 Vilnius, Lithuania.",igor.fedotenkov@gmail.com,"Fedotenkov, Igor/O-8928-2016","Fedotenkov, Igor/0000-0003-3344-4401",,,,,26,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2014,162,3,,,,,247,262,,10.1007/s10645-014-9233-9,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AO1PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341086000003,0

The SPSC model accommodates both continuous and discrete covariates. Various specification tests are conducted to assess the performance of the SPSC model.

This paper evaluates the quality of China's GDP statistics in four stages. First, it reviews past and ongoing suspicions of the quality of GDP data and examines the evidence. Second, it documents the institutional framework for data compilation and concludes on the implications for data quality. Third, it asks how the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics could possibly go about credibly falsifying GDP data without being found out. Fourth, it examines if the first- and second-digit distributions of official GDP data conform to established data regularities (Benford's Law). The findings are that the supposed evidence for GDP data falsification is not compelling, that the National Bureau of Statistics has much institutional scope for falsifying GDP data, and that certain manipulations of nominal and real data would be virtually undetectable. Official GDP data, however, exhibit few statistical anomalies (conform to Benford's Law) and the National Bureau of Statistics thus either makes no significant use of its scope to falsify data, or is aware of statistical data regularities when it falsifies data.

There are two channels for possible mutual welfare gains from policy cooperation: First, cooperation can compensate for insufficient changes in the terms of trade when the degree of exchange rate pass-through is intermediate. Second, countries can cooperate in reaction to shocks in the nontradable goods sectors. This second channel is revealed by deriving an analytical condition for welfare gains under full pass-through and this condition is characterized by the weights in the consumption indices and the variances of sector-specific productivity shocks. Numerical evaluation demonstrates that when the two countries are symmetric and equal weights on consumption goods are assumed, welfare gains from cooperation increase as symmetric pass-through elasticity increases, which implies that the second channel dominates the first, whose effect on welfare gains is nonmonotonic in pass-through elasticity.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 100, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Kashiwagi, M (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, 21 Hsu Chow Rd, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",mkashiwagi@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,14,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

How much do intergenerational linkages contribute to current inequality? We address these questions using original survey data on Senegal that include a sub-household measure of consumption for cells within the household. While intergenerational linkages are evident, we find a relatively high degree of mobility across generations, associated with the shift from farm to non-farm sectors and greater economic activity of women. Male-dominated bequests of land and housing bring little gain to consumption and play little role in explaining inequality, though they have important effects on sector of activity. Inheritance of non-land assets and the education and occupation of parents (especially the mother) and their choices about children's schooling are more important to adult welfare than property inheritance. Significant gender inequality in consumption is evident, though it is almost entirely explicable in terms of factors such as education and (non-land) inheritance. There are a number of other pronounced gender differences, with intergenerational linkages appearing through the mother rather than the father.

Law breakers are motivated by the desire to 'make a statement', possibly against majority attitudes in the society. Fighting expressive crime is complicated by this fact in that increasing intervention may have counter effects. In this article, I present a model of expressive crime. Delinquents are motivated to perform the illegal action because it transmits a signal. If the punishment associated with the crime affects the value of this signal positively, an increase in punishment may serve as defiance, and not as deterrence. Accordingly, the number of law violations may increase if those defied outnumber the deterred. Throughout the analysis, I refer to the case of graffiti spraying in Germany.

Using China's household survey data, we break down each household expenditure component into its constituent members. We find consistent and robust age profiles of the composition of personal consumption expenditures. Young people spend larger proportions of their budget on food and education, culture, and recreation services. The middle-aged spend significantly more on clothing and transportation and communication. Lastly, the elderly spend substantially more on food and health care and medical services. After controlling for period and cohort effects as well as other socio-economic factors, we still find age to be a fundamental driver of consumption budget allocation. We also incorporate the estimated results into the population forecast data and predict the evolution of China's consumption budget allocation patterns driven by demographic change.

And yet, empirically, we have seen a decline in the public investment share in most OECD countries since the economic crisis of the 1970s. In this paper we study several issues concerning this decline. First, we draw on a number of different theoretical perspectives, including those of Smith, Marx, and Keynes, to explain the importance of public investment. Second, we show, using an error correction framework, that the levels of net government saving and gross government investment shares are co-integrated. Third, we discuss the various theoretical reasons underpinning this result. Following Kalecki (1943) and Alexander (1948), we argue that the crisis of the 1970s and growing international competition enabled powerful business groups to successfully push for fiscal austerity to increase 'labor market flexibility,' a policy framework that has since become the conventional wisdom. Fourth, building on the view that the state is relatively autonomous; Keynes's cautionary observation that the political context shapes business confidence; and Polanyi's argument that social democratic policies always run the risk of appearing to be a threat to private investment, we discuss the challenges to such policies in the current crisis.","[Moudud, Jamee K.] Sarah Lawrence Coll, Bronxville, NY 10708 USA; [Martinez-Hernandez, Francisco] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA",Sarah Lawrence College; The New School,"Moudud, JK (通讯作者)，Sarah Lawrence Coll, Bronxville, NY 10708 USA.",,,"Martinez Hernandez, Francisco A./0000-0002-1702-2682",,,,,78,0,0,1,12,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Through two examples, we show that arbitrary atomless probability spaces, in particular, the Lebesgue unit interval, may not be appropriate to model the space of players of an idealized limit. This inappropriateness hinges on the fact there is a convergent sequence of exact pure-strategy Nash equilibria in the sequence of finite-player games, while the idealized limit game of the sequence does not have any equilibrium. Instead, a saturated probability space is shown to be not only sufficient but also necessary, to model the space of players in any proper idealized limit. This complements the study of large games with a bio-social typology in Khan et al.

Wage regressions typically suggest an inverted U-shaped age-productivity pattern. However, such analyses confuse age, cohort and year effects. Deaton decomposition allows us to disentangle these effects. We apply this method to investigate the age-productivity pattern for the so-called 'talent' occupations. Using data from a transition economy (Poland) we find that talent occupations indeed have a steeper age-productivity pattern.

There are two groups of explanations: The first, closer to the government's position, considers the cause to be the lack of completion of structural reforms, in particular: liberalization of the labor market and foreign investment, and full privatization of the oil sector. The second, proposed by academics and independent economic research centers underlines the negative effect of the neoliberal fiscal and monetary policy applied in the Mexican economy for the past thirty years. In the academic debate held by this second group of economists there is a belief that, directly or indirectly, poverty and the income concentration are related to Mexico's weak growth performance. This article, grounded in post Keynesian and Kaleckian theory, uses econometric models to provide evidence that the principal cause of the slow growth of the Mexican economy is income concentration, and concludes that the strategy of neoliberal policies applied in the past thirty years have been self-defeating: By favoring corporate profits and high income classes, it neglected the domestic market and social welfare. The result is that the growth capacity of domestic effective demand has deteriorated, which explains the low level of the national growth rate.","[Vargas Sanchez, Gustavo; Luna, Albino] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Sánchez, GV (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",,,,,,,,15,11,16,0,13,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

I characterize the direct effects that changes in that price index would have on retirees who differ in their initial wealth at retirement and in their mortality rates after retirement. I propose a simple but flexible theoretical framework that converts benefits reform first into changes to retirees' consumption paths and then into a net effect on social welfare. I calibrate that framework using recently produced data on Social Security beneficiaries by lifetime income decile and both existing and new survey evidence on the normative priorities Americans have regarding their Social Security benefits.

Several centralized data envelopment analysis (DEA) models are introduced to study the optimal allocation of CO2 emissions under spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal allocation strategies, respectively. The models have been used to determine the optimal paths for controlling CO2 emissions at provincial and regional levels in China. A sensitivity analysis of the optimal path on the emission control coefficient under spatial-temporal allocation strategy is further carried out. Our empirical results show that more developed regions should take emission reduction responsibility earlier than less developed regions in China. Of the three allocation strategies, spatial-temporal allocation strategy seems to be a better choice for achieving the optimal control of CO2 emissions at country level since it is more encompassing by allowing both timing and spatial substitutions. It is also found that there exists an inverted U-shape relationship between the aggregate optimal GDP and the emission control coefficient, which shows that modest emission reduction policy might be more appropriate for China in order to achieve the joint goals of economic development and CO2 emission reduction.

Its banking system has played a key role in this stellar economic performance. Since 1990, Vietnam's banking system has undergone significant changes which saw its composition transformed from being state banks only to now being both state as well as private banks, and has performed generally well in terms of growth, profitability and stability. But is it efficient? We conduct a dynamic analysis of the level and trend of the cost and profit efficiency of the Vietnamese banking sector over the period 1995 to 2011 taking into account the Asian and Global Financial crises. We use the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Windows Analysis approach and adjust for bank size in calculating the average efficiency score of the banking system. Our empirical findings show that the cost and profit efficiency of the Vietnamese banking system averaged around 0.90 and 0.75, respectively, with the state banks being more efficient than the private banks and with efficiency experiencing an upward trend over the analysis period. Moreover, we find that the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) did not significantly affect the efficiency of the whole Vietnamese banking system.","[Thanh Pham Thien Nguyen; Roca, Eduardo; Sharma, Parmendra] Griffith Univ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Nguyen, TPT (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",thanh.nguyen8@griffithuni.edu.au,"Nguyen, Thanh Pham Thien/C-7405-2015; Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023; Nguyen, Thanh/W-1463-2019","Nguyen, Thanh Pham Thien/0000-0002-5228-1866; Nguyen, Thanh/0000-0002-7348-1381",,,,,52,22,27,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

There seems to be clear evidence of employment polarization between 1997 and 2012 that accelerates over the recession. Changes in the composition of the labour supply cannot explain the increase in the share of occupations at the low end of the wage distribution. Sector reallocation may have partially contributed to explain the polarization process in Spain during the years of expansion (1997-2007) but it is a minor factor during the recession. The polarization of occupations within sectors observed, especially during the recession, appears to be related to a decline in routine tasks which is compensated by an increase in occupations with non-routine service contents, which are found both in the low and high end of the wage distribution. Instead, jobs with a higher degree of abstract contents do not appear to increase their share in total employment during these 15 years. The paper finds that this process has affected males more strongly than females because of their higher concentration in occupations more focused on routine tasks. Among males, for workers under 30 years old, we find a decrease in the share of occupations with more routine tasks which turns into increases in those with more abstract content and particularly with more non-routine service content. Instead, male workers over 30 years old seem to remain in declining occupations to a greater extent. Females of different ages are not affected by the abovementioned changes.","[Anghel, Brindusa; De la Rica, Sara] FEDEA, Madrid, Spain; [De la Rica, Sara] Univ Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain; [Lacuesta, Aitor] Bank Spain, Madrid, Spain",University of Basque Country; Banco de Espana,"De la Rica, S (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain.",banghel@fedea.es; sara.delarica@ehu.es; aitor.lacuesta@bde.es,"Anghel, Brindusa/JXR-7658-2024; De la Rica, Sara/H-6637-2015","De la Rica, Sara/0000-0001-9872-6798; Lacuesta, Aitor/0000-0002-7050-8462",,,,,17,18,19,3,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

In this article, we analyze how party cues (i.e., politicians' party membership acting as a cue towards their characteristics) affect voters' incomplete information in a federal setting. We theoretically show that party cues allow indirect inference regarding politicians using observed policy outcomes, and can alleviate the accountability problem. Empirical evidence from US presidential election results across all 50 US states over the period 1972-2008 supports this proposition.

The novel contribution of the paper is the result that the welfare gain for a given increase in trade openness is higher for reductions in per-unit (additive) trade costs than for reductions in iceberg (multiplicative) trade costs. The ranking derives from differences in intra-industry reallocations and, in particular, from dissimilar impacts on the number of exporters (i.e., the extensive margin of trade).

Robertson claimed that welfare economics should be based on cardinal utility and that the ordinalist revolution in the consumer and welfare theories should be rejected. His claims were based on a careful discussion of what he saw as theoretical inconsistencies of the ordinalist approach.","[Boianovsky, Mauro] Univ Brasilia, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Boianovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",mboianovsky@gmail.com,,,,,,,70,3,3,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

An important example is the frequently studied rejector-becomes-proposer protocol. We focus on subgame perfect equilibria in stationary strategies which are shown to exist and to be efficient. Equilibrium proposals do not depend on the probability to propose conditional on the rejection by another player. We consider the limit, as the bargaining friction vanishes. In case no player has a positive probability to propose conditional on his rejection, each player receives his utopia payoff conditional on being recognized. Otherwise, equilibrium proposals of all players converge to a weighted Nash bargaining solution, where the weights are determined by the probability to propose conditional on one's own rejection.

But many countries face opposition from public opinion, for fear of the distributive consequences of these environmental tax reforms. This paper sheds light on the distributive consequences of environmental tax policies when households are heterogeneous. The objective is to assess whether an environmental tax reform could be Pareto improving, when the revenue of the pollution tax is recycled by a change in labor tax properties. We show that, whatever the degree of regressivity of the environmental tax alone, it is possible to design a recycling mechanism that renders the tax reform more Pareto efficient, by simultaneously decreasing the wage tax and increasing its progressivity.

Subsidies for high technology investment in the weaker region have a positive local output effect and a negative effect on the neighboring region, thereby fostering convergence.

In the case of advanced countries, we find that the income elasticities of money demand are significantly higher if broader definitions of the monetary aggregates are used. In addition, financial reforms and wealth seem to have significantly reduced the estimates of the income elasticity. However, we achieved quite different findings for the developing countries. It appears that the broader definitions of monetary aggregates seem to produce income elasticity estimates that are only marginally higher than the narrower aggregates. While the wealth (financial reform) impacts on income elasticity are statistically insignificant (weakly significant), both seems to have reduced the income elasticity estimates only marginally. Moreover, some contrasting results between advanced and developing countries are also attained with respect to the proxies of cost of holding money.","Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Auckland 1024, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Kumar, S (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Auckland 1024, New Zealand.",kumar_saten@yahoo.com,,,,,,,26,6,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper we consider the consequences of independence for the optimal design of a new Scottish tax system, an analysis which would also be of some relevance for considering the consequences for tax design of independence of other smaller nations. Scotland is different from the rest of the UK in some ways that are important for tax system design. Incomes are more equally distributed, for example. That is one reason why the progressive income tax currently raises less per head in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. It also suggests that there is less to be gained in terms of redistribution from sharply progressive taxation. Independence would create additional complexity for individuals and firms working or trading across borders. It could also put downward pressure on tax rates and our analysis suggests that optimal tax rates in an independent Scotland are likely to be lower than optimal rates in the UK as a whole. At the same time, the context of a substantial budget deficit will continue to put upward pressure on tax rates.","[Adam, Stuart; Johnson, Paul; Roantree, Barra] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Adam, S (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",s.adam@ifs.org.uk; paul_j@ifs.org.uk; barra_r@ifs.org.uk,,"Roantree, Barra/0000-0002-8738-8225",ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,11,2,2,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

For symmetric perfect-information games, any number of players may be active and we characterize the unique (mixed-strategy) equilibrium in which active contributors use the same strategy. Increasing the number of active players leads to stochastically lower individual efforts and level of the public good. When information is private, the symmetric equilibrium is in pure strategies. Increasing the number of players yields a pointwise reduction in the equilibrium contribution strategy but an increase in equilibrium payoffs. Comparative statics with respect to costs and levels of risk aversion are derived.

Three model specifications are used: the conventional 'approximate' interest differential model specified in first differences of exchange rates and the two unconventional 'precise' models specified in levels of exchange rates. Results obtained from the former model are consistent with UIP, since the coefficient on the interest differential is positive in all cases. These results imply that the CIS currencies offering a significant interest differential tend, on average, to depreciate over the sample period as UIP predicts. Results from the latter two models are strongly supportive of UIP in the long run in all cases, except for Armenia when a restricted specification is used. and Armenia. Moldova and Georgia when an unrestricted specification is used. Yet the deviations from UIP that are allowed in the short run may lead to the profitability of carry trade in the CIS currencies offering the significant interest differentials.

We are thereby able to test the validity of real interest rate parity (RIRP) among these countries. The SPSM can be used to decompose a panel of real interest rate series into two groups: a group of stationary series and a group of non-stationary series. We identify the stationary processes in the panel and demonstrate that RIRP holds for 10 of the 12 countries studied. Our findings show that real interest rate convergence among these 10 countries exhibits non-linear mean reversion toward RIRP equilibrium.

Our study takes a step back from this literature to examine how suggestions-a direct ask for a certain amount of money-affect giving rates.

The effects of these factors are estimated by using the Chamberlain's two stage Box-Cox quantile regression approach. One of the main contributions of this paper is that it relaxes the linearity assumption of the conditional quantile function to estimate the counterfactual wage distribution function consistently. This paper also shows that the proposed method provides better estimates of capturing the effects of human capital variables in the two tails of the wage distribution while the results of other parts of the distribution are comparable with the estimates of the previous study which used the linear quantile regression approach. To summarize, these results suggest that this proposed approach is more applicable in cases where the behavior of the tails of the distribution bear much importance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When stakes are raised, effort increases when individuals work for themselves but not when they work for others and, as a result, the difference in provided effort disappears.

Unlike most studies, this inquiry draws attention to thinking of social control that is aimed, not at changing, but rather at retaining institutions. In this vein, I argue that the retention of institutions can and does indeed play a crucial role in the economic and social development of selected nation-states. I accept the notion that institutions are constantly evolving. However, new institutions both inherit from the past and move forward, evolving into foundational institutional structures. This is what I shall define as institutional matrices that could be thought of as preexisting. These institutional matrices suggest that later emerging institutions do not necessarily pose dramatic and opposing challenges, but rather contribute to the continuity of evolutionary institutional developments. My understanding of institutional matrices includes an analysis of a dominant institutional structure defined by X-and Y-matrices. Attempts at changing historically established institutional structures have, in many cases, resulted in catastrophic aftermaths for selected nations under consideration here. For contrast, I explore some successful national examples of relying upon social control to maintain an effective balance between dominant and complementary institutional matrices.","Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Subdiv Evolut Social & Econ Syst, Moscow, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences","Kirdina, S (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Subdiv Evolut Social & Econ Syst, Moscow, Russia.",,"Kirdina-Chandler, Svetlana/J-3642-2017","Kirdina-Chandler, Svetlana/0000-0002-9234-8308",,,,,33,13,14,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

For our sample of higher socioeconomic status mothers, we find a joint decision process for three sets of decisions modeled: work leave duration and duration of any, as well as of exclusive, breastfeeding, and daily work hours and daily breastfeedings at infant age 3 months. We find that returning to paid work 1 week earlier reduces any breastfeeding duration by about two-thirds of a week while extending breastfeeding by a week delays work participation by about one-third of a week. We find larger elasticities for decisions involving daily work hours and number of breastfeedings at 3 months than for work leave duration and any breastfeeding duration and the smallest elasticities for duration of exclusive breastfeeding and work leave. This marks the first study to find a joint decision-making process for postpartum work and breastfeeding decisions and suggests that, in addition to increased leave impacting breastfeeding behaviors, successful breastfeeding promotion policies can have nontrivial impacts on the US labor market.","[Mandal, Bidisha] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Roe, Brian E.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Fein, Sara B.] US FDA, Ctr Food Safety & Appl Nutr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",Washington State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; US Food & Drug Administration (FDA),"Mandal, B (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, POB 646210,Hulbert 103F, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",bmandal@wsu.edu; roe.30@osu.edu; Sara.Fein@fda.hhs.gov,"Roe, Brian/A-7386-2009","Roe, Brian/0000-0003-4228-2889",,,,,35,7,8,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Contrasting hypothetical and real-money choice experiments,JOURNAL OF CHOICE MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Choice experiment; Non-compensatory behaviour; Heuristics; Cut-offs; Scale parameter,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; COMPENSATORY CHOICE; TASK COMPLEXITY; DECISION-MAKING; INFORMATION; THRESHOLDS; MODEL; PREFERENCES; DESIGN; ENVIRONMENT,"The use of threshold values (cut-offs) is a well-recognized simplifying strategy in real life decision-making processes. Recent stated preference studies show that strategies used by respondents in hypothetical settings are consistent with how they normally process information in real markets. Of the different discrete choice models using cut-offs, the Swait (2001) model allows different heuristics to be captured. The few applications of this soft cut-off approach mainly focus on the effects of cut-offs on attribute estimates and willingness to pay, but scant attention has been paid to the consequences of cut-off elicitation. We focussed our investigation on the effects of self-reported cut-offs on choice consistency. In line with studies on context and complexity effects in choice modelling, we parameterize the scale parameter on the basis of two alternative measures related to the stated cut-offs: (1) the number of potential violations included in the choice cards, and (2) the number of cutoffs stated at the most severe level. Moreover, we investigated whether different treatments (hypothetical vs. real-money) affect cut-off elicitations, violations and choice consistency. We tested our models using an empirical dataset generated by a field choice experiment on consumers' preferences for apples. The data show that most respondents stated they had cut-off values in mind when buying apples, but, as expected, in most cases they violated them in their actual choices. Estimation of heteroskedastic logit models shows that the proposed measures related to stated cut-offs have a systematic effect on the variance of the error term, but only in the hypothetical treatment. That is, respondents were found to be less consistent as the number of potential violations or the number of cut-offs stated at the most severe level increased. In the real-money treatment, neither of the coefficients of the two measures was statistically significant. This may indicate that when choices are binding, consumers put necessary effort into each choice card, regardless of the number of potential violations, and they are more consistent.

Furthermore, social entrepreneurship can undermine support for state-led development and democratic reforms that are the preconditions necessary for structural transformation and long-term, large-scale development. Thus, social entrepreneurship is best seen as a useful microeconomic strategy that can contribute to development in small ways, but that cannot possibly replace a democratic developmental state.","[Nega, Berhanu; Schneider, Geoffrey] Bucknell Univ, Dept Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Nega, B (通讯作者)，Bucknell Univ, Dept Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",,"PENG, Xiao-bao/J-4466-2012; Schneider, Geoffrey/ABB-6945-2021",,,,,,26,31,34,3,61,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

To answer that question, this paper focuses on the issue of food and energy subsidies in Egypt. In 2012, over 13 percent of Egyptian GDP - roughly one-third of the overall government spending - was allocated to subsidies of prices of consumer goods including fuels and food. This paper offers an explanation of the resilience of commodity subsidies to reform, which relies on the inability of the government to credibly commit to a reform path. As a dictatorship, Egypt had a small number of veto players, making policy reversals easy. When opened to a competitive political process after 2011, Egypt lacked political groups that could make credible promises about policy changes.

In contrast, a structure with two prizes may dominate a winner-takes-all contest in both dimensions if participants are risk-averse.

Our findings point towards the fiscal synchronization hypothesis, supporting evidence of asymmetric interactions between the two fiscal components in both the long- and the short-run time horizon.

We use these data to test whether medieval universities played a causal role in expanding economic activity, examining the foundation of Germany's first universities after 1386 following the papal schism. We find that the trend rate of market establishment breaks upward in 1386 and this break is greatest where the distance to a university shrank most. There is no differential pre-1386 trend associated with the reduction in distance to a university, and there is no break in trend in 1386 where university proximity did not change. These results are robust to estimating a variety of specifications that address concerns about the endogeneity of university location. Universities provided training in newly rediscovered Roman and canon law; students with legal training served in positions that reduced the uncertainty of trade in the Middle Ages. We argue that training in the law, and the consequent development of legal and administrative institutions, was an important channel linking universities and greater economic activity in medieval Germany.","[Cantoni, Davide] Univ Munich, CEPR, D-81377 Munich, Germany; CESIFO, Munich, Germany; UC Berkeley Haas Sch Business & Nber, Berkeley, CA USA",University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Cantoni, D (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, CEPR, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",cantoni@lmu.de,,,,,,,103,80,101,8,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Upon entry, they receive a commonly observed signal which is updated over time. Jointly with partial irreversibility of investment, this generates heterogeneity in effective discount rates and, thus, in the cost of finance. In line with evidence, the model predicts a negative correlation between firms' financing costs and their age. Over a firm's life cycle, per period net profits and the export participation probability grow. Exporters are less likely to exit than purely domestic firms. Belief updating entails excessive financing of incumbents relative to entrants and too much exporting. Asymptotically, trade liberalization reduces overall general equilibrium exit rates, but it does not necessarily increase welfare. With multiple asymmetric export markets, firms gradually expand their market coverage and total sales. A confidence crisis modeled by belief reversion causes an over-proportional decrease in exports, thereby offering a novel interpretation of the trade slump in 2008/09.","[Felbermayr, Gabriel] Univ Munich, LMU Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst,CESifo,GEP Nottingham, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Spiegel, Gilbert] Univ Munich, LMU Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, D-81377 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Felbermayr, G (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, LMU Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst,CESifo,GEP Nottingham, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",felbermayr@ifo.de; gilbert.spiegel@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,"Felbermayr, Gabriel/0000-0003-4984-9745",,,,,28,1,1,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This investigation is important because the amount of mortgages outstanding in Japan is huge, yet the study on their prepayments is very limited. This period from 1996 to 2005 was characterized by two distinct features of the evolution of interest rates that might have significant effects on mortgage refinancing. First, interest rate fluctuations were limited to a narrow range of a little over 1%. Surprisingly, full prepayments of Japanese mortgages were sensitive to small changes in interest rates. Second, long-term refinance rates did not fall well below the contract rates of most mortgages in our sample during the ten-year period, while short-term refinance rates did. With this interest rate relationship, if mortgagors ever refinanced, it was likely that they rolled over short-term mortgage rates several times until they repaid mortgages completely. Hence, we examine the sensitivity of full prepayments to short-term vs. long-term interest rates, mortgagors' expectation of future course of interest rates (by the slope of yield curve), and that of interest rate volatility. Our analysis shows that short-term interest rates have a slightly greater explanatory power for full prepayments than long-term interest rates. In addition, our analysis confirms that full prepayments are sensitive to both the slope of yield curve and interest rate volatility. Other issues we look into are the patterns of full prepayments in relation to loan age and seasonality. We find that the pattern of full prepayments relative to loan age is comparable to that of mortgages in the U.S., and that the seasonal pattern of full prepayments is attributable to relevant institutional arrangements in Japan.

We compare three approaches to incorporate the size of distribution networks in discrete choice models of product differentiation: as an extra product characteristic, as a new dimension of product differentiation in a nested logit framework, or as a measure of the expected travel cost under a spatial Poisson distribution of locations. We obtain robust conclusions across all three approaches: distribution networks play an important role in explaining car producers' market shares, but they only appear to explain part of the bias towards domestic brands in the car market. We also report on an ongoing research project where we analyze the role of distribution networks at a much more detailed local market level, and investigate the specific role of exclusive dealing as a possible entry barrier.

The research contributes to the previous work by making a novel use of error correction model in a dynamic panel context which is extended by adding several important omitted variables related to the trade structure and policy coordination. We find that an increase in trade intensity, intra-industry trade and financial integration leads to less frequent asymmetric shocks. On the other hand, divergent fiscal policies are estimated in some model specifications to increase the shock divergence process, although the estimated impact is rather small to counteract the positive effects associated with trade and financial integration. The identified relationships in this research are affected by the significant trade and growth slowdown in the crisis period; while the global economic turmoil has boosted a demand shock convergence, its impact on the supply shocks is in the opposite (diverging) direction.","[Velickovski, Igor] Natl Bank Republ Macedonia, Skopje 1000, Macedonia; [Velickovski, Igor] Univ Amer Coll Skopje, Skopje 1000, Macedonia; [Stojkov, Aleksandar] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Skopje 1000, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Velikovski, I (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Republ Macedonia, Kuzman Josifovski Pitu 1, Skopje 1000, Macedonia.",velickovskii@nbrm.mk; astojkov@pf.ukim.edu.mk,,"Stojkov, Aleksandar/0000-0003-3993-6108",,,,,48,4,4,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2014,41,2,,,SI,,287,321,,10.1007/s10663-014-9247-1,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AG6UT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335554700008,0

In this paper, I argue that it is the political and economic transparency that arises out of democracies that leads to this relative stability in output growth, because the ability of a country to adjust and adapt to shocks, be they internal or external, is more pronounced in countries where the flows of information are better. Using data from 1980-2009, I show that once transparency is incorporated into the analysis democracy actually appears to increase volatility, whilst transparency is seen to have a significant dampening effect on volatility.

This paper addresses this question by evaluating the impact that intra-regional income distribution has on regional growth in Europe. By using a spatially augmented Solow growth model, we investigate the convergence process among 188 EU regions between 1991 and 2004 and extend the traditional growth models to account for the impact of regional inequality on growth, as well as the effects of interaction among regions. Our assumption is that existing levels of inequality between sub-regional territorial units could positively contribute to regional economic growth in Europe, through the positive effects generated by the emergence of agglomeration economies. Our results show that while we cannot find any overall significant relationship in Europe between agglomeration and growth, once we distinguish between Objective 1 and Non-objective 1 regions we are able to find that agglomeration positively impacts subsequent growth, but only in the less developed regions.","Commiss European Communities, JRC IPTS, Seville 41010, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre,"de Dominicis, L (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, JRC IPTS, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41010, Spain.",Laura.de-dominicis@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,68,42,42,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

The results show that real interest rates over the full sample period do not fit a covariance-stationary or unit-root model, nor a fractionally integrated, near-unit-root or local-level model.

Testing Credit Constraints Using a Directed Lending Program,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Banking; Credit constraints; India; misallocation,,"This article uses variation in access to a targeted lending program to estimate whether firms are credit constrained. While both constrained and unconstrained firms may be willing to absorb all the directed credit that they can get (because it may be cheaper than other sources of credit), constrained firms will use it to expand production, while unconstrained firms will primarily use it as a substitute for other borrowing. We apply these observations to firms in India that became eligible for directed credit as a result of a policy change in 1998, and lost eligibility as a result of the reversal of this reform in 2000, and to smaller firms that were already eligible for the preferential credit before 1998 and remained eligible in 2000. Comparing the trends in the sales and the profits of these two groups of firms, we show that there is no evidence that directed credit is being used as a substitute for other forms of credit. Instead, the credit was used to finance more production-there was a large acceleration in the rate of growth of sales and profits for these firms in 1998, and a corresponding decline in 2000. There was no change in trends around either date for the small firms. We conclude that many of the firms must have been severely credit constrained, and that the marginal rate of return to capital was very high for these firms.","[Banerjee, Abhijit V.; Duflo, Esther] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Banerjee, AV (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,18,177,236,5,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

For example, our model accounts for 18 percent of the volatility in the labor market wedge in the data; it was 43 percent in CK.","[Chang, Yongsung] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Chang, Yongsung] Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kim, Sun-Bin] Yonsei Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",University of Rochester; Yonsei University; Yonsei University,"Chang, YS (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Harkness Hall, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",yongusng.chang@gmail.com; sunbin.kim@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,6,5,5,0,10,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

For the purpose of reducing stock holding cost, this paper combines an improved multi-delivery policy into a single-producer multi-retailer integrated inventory system with scrap in production. We extend a study by Chiu et al. (2013a) by augmenting an alternative n + 1 product distribution policy to their integrated inventory system. An initial delivery of finished items is shipped to multiple retailers to meet demand during the production unit's uptime. After the remaining production lot is produced and screened, fixed quantity n installments of the finished products are delivered to retailers at a fixed time interval. With the help of a mathematical model along with Hessian matrix equations, the closed-form optimal operating policies for the proposed system are derived. Further, the study demonstrates, through a numerical example, significant savings in stock holding cost for both the production unit and retailers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

First, we identify the effect of recessions on beliefs exploiting time and regional variation in macroeconomic conditions using data from the 1972 to 2010 General Social Survey. Our specifications control for nonlinear time-period, life-cycle, and cohort effects, as well as a host of background variables. Second, we rely on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 to corroborate the age-period-cohort specification and look at heterogeneous effects of experiencing a recession during early adulthood.

Second, we find that if the signal-to-noise ratio and capacity in the SE and RI problems are fixed, respectively, the two theories generate the same policy implications in the univariate case, but different policy implications in the multivariate case. We also show that our results do not depend on the presence of correlation between fundamental and noise shocks.

I employ a model-based approach proposed by Bohn (1998) to test for sustainability. In this approach, a positive and significant reaction of the ratio of primary surplus ratio (s) to lagged debt constitutes a sufficient condition for sustainability. Based on a panel of 48 contiguous states (1961-2008) and several model specifications, I find robust evidence in favor of sustainability. Further analysis suggests that the adjustment of the components of s to debt is asymmetric with the revenue side bearing a heavier burden than the spending side. The response of s is also found to be asymmetric with respect to the level of debt. Finally, the magnitude of the response is larger in states with a higher degree of fiscal stringency in general and own-revenue and no-deficit-carryover provisions in particular.","Univ Texas San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Mahdavi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",smahdavi@utsa.edu,,,,,,,57,17,19,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We investigate this question using three datasets for Russia's bilateral trade relations for goods, services and investment at disaggregated level with its partner countries over the world. Our empirical analysis shows that the deterioration of the rule of law in Russia since 2003 has affected the long-run trade performance of Russia in sophisticated and technology-intensive manufactured goods, as well as its inward investments with advanced economies. It is precisely this type of trade that Russia should nurture to diversify away from hydrocarbons export dependence. Our statistical analysis also shows that Russia remains to a large extent an outlier within the multilateral trading system. It exports disproportionately less to partner countries which are or had become members of the WTO over our period of analysis. Russia's trade appears to have been negatively affected by the accession of these countries to the WTO. Russia itself finally acceded to the WTO in July 2012 amidst signs of a modest improvement of its rule-of-law indicators.","[van der Marel, Erik] ECIPE, Brussels, Belgium; [Dreyer, Iana] EU Inst Secur Studies, Paris, France",,"van der Marel, E (通讯作者)，ECIPE, Brussels, Belgium.",erik.vandermarel@ecipe.org; iana.dreyer@iss.europa.eu,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

In May 2011, the Portuguese Government set an agreement with the Troika (a supranational institution composed by the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)), through which, in exchange for external help, the Portuguese authorities committed to an Economic Adjustment Program (EAP). In order to assess the impacts of the EAP on welfare and, in particular, on inequality, this paper simulates the debt consolidation strategy proposed by the Troika using a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents. The model enables to explore the impacts of the fiscal adjustment on the endogenous cross-section distribution of income, wealth and welfare. Our results predict a positive net welfare gain, despite the existence of significant transition costs in terms of output losses and inequality, especially during the first years of implementation. Overall, the net positive welfare gains are biased towards the poorer, which means that the consolidation plan will be, in the end, equality-enhancing. These results reflect the instruments involved in the consolidation strategy: productive and unproductive expenditure cuts combined with a slight increase in social transfers. Furthermore, the simulation predicts a positive impact on the Portuguese net foreign asset (NFA) position. Assuming this prediction is correct, this strongly supports the motivation for the adoption of the Economic Adjustment Program which considers the large external indebtedness of Portugal as a central issue in the economic diagnosis.","[Viegas, Miguel] Univ Aveiro, DEGEI, GOVCOPP, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Ana Paula] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEFUP, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade do Porto,"Viegas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, DEGEI, GOVCOPP, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal.",mlbv@ua.pt; aribeiro@fep.up.pt,,"Ribeiro, Ana Paula/0000-0002-8974-7420; Viegas, Miguel/0000-0003-1390-4992",,,,,29,3,4,0,28,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

We focus on predictability in distribution by asking whether ethanol returns can be used to forecast different parts of field crops and cattle returns distribution, or vice versa. Density forecasts are constructed using Conditional Autoregressive Expectile models estimated with Asymmetric Least Squares. Forecast evaluation relies on quantile-weighed scoring rules, which identify regions of the distribution of interest to the analyst. Results show that both the centre and the left tail of the ethanol returns distribution can be predicted by using field crops returns. On the contrary, there is no evidence that ethanol can be used to forecast any region of the field crops or cattle returns distributions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First, the cross-correlation analysis indicated that oil price-exchange rate correlations were negative and low, having in general lower values for longer time scales. Second, negative dependence between oil and the US dollar increased after the onset of the global financial crisis for all time scales, thereby providing evidence of both contagion and interdependence.

Focusing on Taylor-type rules, we find evidence of asymmetric interest rate responses for all the countries considered, with monetary policy reacting more strongly to inflation when interest rates are high than when they are low. This is consistent with previous research suggesting that central bankers place more weight on positive deviations of inflation from its target than negative ones.

The theoretical value of participating in the vote is therefore zero if subjects have only instrumental reasons to vote and form correct beliefs. Yet, we find that experimental subjects are willing to pay for the vote and that they do so for instrumental reasons. The observed voting premium in the main treatment is high and can only be accounted for if some subjects either overestimate their pivotality or do not pay attention to pivotality at all.

Despite an impressive decline in the gender gap in employment, females are still less likely to work than males: about 76% of working age males and 63% of working age females were employed in 2010. If females work they are more likely to be employed part time and with temporary contracts. The large increase in female employment, from 28% in 1977 to 63% in 2010, was accompanied by a significant decline in fertility. The gender gap in wages, after controlling for worker and job characteristics as well as for selection, is high. It was about 20% in 2010, quite close to its value in 1994. Furthermore, the gender gap in wages is driven mainly by differences in returns to individual characteristics. While women are more qualified than men in observable labor market characteristics, they end up earning less. There have been several important policy changes that try to help families reconcile family responsibilities with market work. The existing literature suggests that households do react to incentives generated by different policies and policy changes are at least partly responsible for changes in female labor supply. In recent decades, the large inflow of immigrants, who provided relatively cheap household services, allowed more educated women to enter the labor market. Policy challenges, however, remain.","[Guner, Nezih] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICREA MOVE, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Guner, Nezih] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Kaya, Ezgi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia] Univ Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain",ICREA; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universidad de Cantabria,"Guner, N (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICREA MOVE, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",nezih.guner@movebarcelona.eu; kayaez@gmail.com; virginia.sanchez@unican.es,"Guner, Nezih/L-8382-2014; Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/H-2543-2015","Guner, Nezih/0000-0003-4604-4159; Kaya, Ezgi/0000-0003-1909-2649; Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/0000-0001-9260-4327",ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,76,30,30,3,35,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Pure non-work trips within the peak period represent a significant portion of peak period traffic. In the case of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), the study area of this investigation, around 11 percent of peak period trips are pure non-work trips and auto driving is the dominant mode. Also more peak period non-work trips are made using the auto passenger mode than all transit modes combined. This heavy auto dependency for pure non-work trips in the peak period, when transit service is at its highest throughout the day, requires an improved understanding of such mode choice behaviour. This paper uses data from a household travel survey collected in the GTHA to investigate peak period pure non-work trip mode choice in the context of household mobility tool ownership (auto and transit pass ownership). The paper also proposes an advanced econometric modelling approach for capturing preference heterogeneity as well as scale heterogeneity (heteroskedasticity). The model involves systematic parameterization of the scale parameter of a GEV model. Empirical models highlight the superiority of the proposed model over a homoskedastic model. Empirical model also explains the influence of household mobility tool ownership on peak period pure non-work trip mode choices in terms of explaining both preference heterogeneity and scale heterogeneity.

This paper provides a novel theoretical treatment of the efficiency consequences of such 'partial expenditure decentralization.' It develops a political agency model in which two levels of government are involved in the provision of a local public good, with voters imperfectly informed about each government's contribution to the public good. A central result of the model is that partial decentralization is desirable only if the benefits of vertical complementarity in public good provision outweigh the costs of reduced accountability, which result from detrimental vertical strategic interactions operating through the electoral process. Through variants of the model, the interplay between decentralization and democratization is analyzed. From a positive point of view, the model predicts a relationship between electoral incentives and equilibrium decentralization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Under the priority dispatch policy, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) must accommodate all wind energy produced, which thus has the priority over energy produced by conventional plants; in the no priority dispatch policy, TSOs can decide not to inject all potential wind power in the grid in order to limit congestion problems. The effects of these two wind policies are measured by developing simple stochastic programming models that consider cases with different wind penetration levels, existing capacities and endogenous investments, as well as assumptions on the EU-ETS. Our computational experiments show that, when there is priority dispatch, Nodal Pricing and Market Coupling evolve in a similar way as long as wind penetration is not too high. In contrast, a significant increase of wind penetration causes the collapse of the Market Coupling organization while Nodal Pricing continues to perform well. On the other hand, no priority dispatch removes most of the problems resulting from Market Coupling, which still exhibits a slightly lower efficiency than Nodal Pricing. These outcomes do not depend on the contextual assumptions (fixed capacities vs. investment; EU-ETS vs. non EU-ETS) that characterize the several cases analyzed. This suggests that our policy conclusions are robust. Furthermore, our models overestimate the flexibility of conventional plants, which means that these conclusions would likely be reinforced with a more detailed model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the (equilibrium) allocation of residual claimancy may be affected by production externalities across hierarchies in a non-trivial manner. Specifically, although revenue-sharing contracts foster agents' (non-contractible) surplus enhancing effort, we show that principals dealing with exclusive and privately informed agents might still prefer to retain a share of the surplus from production when dealing with inefficient (high-cost) types. This is because reducing the surplus share of those types reduces the information rent given up to efficient (low-cost) types by means of a 'generalized competing contracts' effect.

Recent empirical evidence has suggested that the Federal Reserve may have followed an asymmetric policy towards the stock market in the pre-crisis period. According to these findings, monetary policy in the US before the crisis involved a reaction to stock price drops, but no reaction to increasing stock prices. The present paper studies the effects of such a policy in a DSGE model. The asymmetric policy rule introduces an important non-linearity into the model: Booms in output and inflation tend to be amplified, while recessions are dampened. Moreover, such a policy gives rise to expectations-driven booms in asset prices. We further investigate to what extent an asymmetric stock price reaction could be motivated by the desire of policymakers to correct for inherent asymmetries in the way stock price movements affect the macroeconomy.

The most telling finding is that median wealth plummeted over the years 2007-10 by 47 per cent. The inequality of net worth, after almost two decades of little movement, was up sharply between 2007 and 2010. Relative indebtedness continued to expand during the late 2000s for the middle class, though the proximate causes were declining net worth and income, rather than an increase in absolute indebtedness. The sharp fall in median net worth and the rise in its inequality from 2007 to 2010 are traceable to the high leverage of middle-class families and the high share of homes in their portfolio. The racial and ethnic disparity in wealth holdings, after remaining more or less stable from 1983 to 2007, widened considerably between 2007 and 2010. Hispanics, in particular, got hammered by the Great Recession in terms of net worth and net equity in their homes.

Among immigrants, Latin Americans enjoy an initial linguistic advantage, which, however, does not help them to catch up faster. The rate of improvement is such that students who stay almost all their lives in Spain still perform worse than natives in all domains analyzed by PISA. To better understand this achievement gap, we decompose it into parts attributable to school quality and to family characteristics. We observe that most of the gap is explained by individual and family characteristics and that less than 15% of it can be attributed to differential school attendance. Overall, the evidence suggests that policies that do not target the learning environment in disadvantaged families are likely to have a limited impact on the native-immigrant achievement gap.","[Zinovyeva, Natalia] Spanish Natl Res Council IPP CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies, Madrid 28037, Spain; [Felgueroso, Florentino] Univ Oviedo, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain; [Felgueroso, Florentino] FEDEA, Oviedo 33071, Spain; [Vazquez, Pablo] Univ Complutense, Madrid 28001, Spain; [Vazquez, Pablo] FEDEA, Madrid 28001, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); University of Oviedo; Complutense University of Madrid,"Zinovyeva, N (通讯作者)，Spanish Natl Res Council IPP CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies, Calle Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain.",natalia.zinovyeva@cchs.csic.es; ffelgue@uniovi.es; pvazquez@fedea.es,,"Zinovyeva, Natalia/0009-0002-8449-6519",,,,,26,27,28,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Under price elasticity estimates that are consistent with previous results in the literature, efficiency costs represent around 8 million euros of welfare losses for 2008.

The first is that countries in the South of the Eurozone were fiscally irresponsible and failed to implement pro-competitive supply side policies. The second view holds that the crisis reflects a deep divide between the external surpluses of the North and external deficits of the South. Basic stylized facts cast doubt on the explanation based on the first thesis alone. A relatively simple model shows how poor fundamentals can create a debt problem independently of fiscal responsibility. The empirical analysis of the determinants of government bond yield spreads relative to Germany suggests that both views in fact provide useful insights into the roots of the current sovereign crisis. However, differences in growth and competitiveness and capital flows between North and South have assumed a much more dominant role since the onset of the global crisis.","[Alessandrini, Pietro; Fratianni, Michele; Presbitero, Andrea F.] Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy; [Alessandrini, Pietro; Fratianni, Michele; Presbitero, Andrea F.] MoFiR, Ancona, Italy; [Fratianni, Michele] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA; [Hallett, Andrew Hughes] George Mason Univ, Arlington, VA USA",Marche Polytechnic University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; George Mason University,"Fratianni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy.",p.alessandrini@univpm.it; fratiann@indiana.edu; ahughesh@gmu.edu; a.presbitero@univpm.it,,"Presbitero, Andrea/0000-0003-4622-941X",,,,,70,28,28,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Suppose that a higher investment level makes the realization of high quality more likely. Then, if consumers observe the investment (but not the realization of product quality) before purchase, they can infer the probability distribution of high and low quality that may be put on the market. We uncover two effects that may lead the firm to overinvest in quality compared to a market with full information: first, an adverse selection effect according to which a sufficiently large investment can avoid adverse selection and, second, an efficiency effect according to which a larger investment reduces the probability of having in the market low quality products that are not socially valuable.

This model provides a few contrasting predictions to those in Tax Competition with Parasitic Tax Havens by Slemrod and Wilson. Slemrod and Wilson model tax sheltering as a production process which uses up scarce resources in the tax haven providing it. Here, multinational firms can transfer some of their income costlessly to an offshore tax haven, which charges a fee for this privilege. (So there are no real resource costs to tax sheltering activity in this model.) But the tax havens must commit credibly to honor their implicit promise to keep tax rates low. The cost of sheltering income, the number of tax havens, and the extent to which multinational firms shelter income there are all determined by this credibility requirement Although the tax rates in the rest of the world (the larger countries which are not tax havens) will affect the number of tax havens, they will have little or no effect on the amount of income which multinationals choose to shelter.

I construct a new data set that combines information on banking relationships and employment at 2,000 nonfinancial firms during the 2008-9 crisis. The article first verifies empirically the importance of banking relationships, which imply a cost to borrowers who switch lenders. I then use the dispersion in lender health following the Lehman crisis as a source of exogenous variation in the availability of credit to borrowers. I find that credit matters. Firms that had precrisis relationships with less healthy lenders had a lower likelihood of obtaining a loan following the Lehman bankruptcy, paid a higher interest rate if they did borrow, and reduced employment by more compared to precrisis clients of healthier lenders. Consistent with frictions deriving from asymmetric information, the effects vary by firm type. Lender health has an economically and statistically significant effect on employment at small and medium firms, but the data cannot reject the hypothesis of no effect at the largest or most transparent firms. Abstracting from general equilibrium effects, I find that the withdrawal of credit accounts for between one-third and one-half of the employment decline at small and medium firms in the sample in the year following the Lehman bankruptcy.

Our main findings are as follows: (1) compared to stateowned enterprises (SOEs), both foreign-owned firms and domestic public-listed firms exhibit less intensive pollutant emissions; (2) firms in regions with less local protection have lower pollution intensity; (3) better property rights protection is negatively correlated with pollutant discharge over and beyond the national standards; and (4) larger firms, firms in industries that export more, and firms with more educated employees pollute less.

The model finds that the main shocks hitting China in the crisis were international and that domestic banking shocks were unimportant. However, directed bank lending and direct government spending was used to supplement monetary policy to aggressively offset shocks to demand. The model finds that government expenditure feedback reduces the frequency of a business cycle crisis but that any feedback effect on investment creates excess capacity and instability in output.","[Vo Phuong Mai Le] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Matthews, Kent; Meenagh, David; Minford, Patrick] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales; [Xiao, Zhiguo] Fudan Univ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University of Sheffield; Cardiff University; Fudan University,"Matthews, K (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",MatthewsK@cardiff.ac.uk,"Matthews, Kent/AAE-5927-2020","Matthews, Kent/0000-0001-6968-3098; Meenagh, David/0000-0002-9930-7947; Minford, Anthony Patrick L./0000-0003-2499-935X",,,,,48,11,13,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We suggest that a simple explanation for the puzzle is the use of the root mean square error (RMSE) to measure forecasting accuracy, presenting a rationale as to why it is difficult to beat the random walk in terms of the RMSE. By using exactly the same exchange rates, time periods and estimation methods as those of Meese and Rogoff, we find that their results cannot be overturned even if the models are estimated with time-varying coefficients. However, we also find that the random walk can be outperformed by the same models if forecasting accuracy is measured in terms of the ability to predict direction, in terms of a measure that combines magnitude and direction and in terms of profitability.","[Moosa, Imad; Burns, Kelly] RMIT, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Burns, K (通讯作者)，RMIT, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",kelly.burns@rmit.edu.au,,"Burns, Kelly/0000-0003-4031-3442",,,,,30,18,18,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In one of the most important developments in this area, in 2001 when the Commission of the European Communities brought the Green Paper for Promoting a European framework for Corporate Social Responsibility, the main definitions about CSR and external and internal dimension have been explained. Inside the internal dimension human resource management (HRM) was emphasized as an area which is primarily included in the CSR practices. Since employees and managers are usually seen as very important factors of successful CSR implantation, in this paper the relations between these two concepts are analyzed. Based on the above mentioned, the aim of this study was to explore the existence of CSR in organizations from the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region and the relationship between CSR and HRM. The analysis was done trough the exploration of the differences between organizations that have or not CSR statements in relation to the level of environmental matters and existence of the HRM action plans. Subjects of the research are the concepts of CSR and HRM, as well as the empirical analysis of data from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and Serbia related to the implementation of CSR in organizations. Based on data obtained in the Cranet research project from 2008 to 2010, it has been explored whether companies from CEE and Serbia have statements on social responsibility, or doing business based on some unwritten standards, and if there is a connection between these statements, the level of environmental matters and HRM practices in the organizations. Statistical techniques as descriptive statistics, crosstabs, chi-square tests and ANOVA test were used in SPSS Version 17.0. Based on the literature review on CSR and HRM, as well as on data analysis the authors attempted to explain the connection between these management concepts.","[Berber, Nemanja; Susnjar, Gizela Stangl; Slavic, Agnes] Univ Novi Sad, Subotica, Serbia; [Baosic, Milan] Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Baosic, Milan] NIS GAZPROM NJEFT, HR Dept, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad; Gazprom,"Berber, N (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Subotica, Serbia.",berber@ef.uns.ac.rs; susnjarg@ef.uns.ac.rs; slavica@ef.uns.ac.rs; milan.baosic@nis.eu,"Slavić, Agneš/AAM-3260-2020; Slavic, Agnes/ABB-9227-2021; Berber, Nemanja/JFS-1642-2023; Berber, Nemanja/C-8235-2018","Slavić, Agneš/0000-0001-8730-9884; Berber, Nemanja/0000-0002-1433-6416",,,,,52,27,29,1,72,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Within this context, we wonder whether there is an alternative strategy aiming at bringing back the debt ratio to 60% of GDP in 2032, meanwhile lowering output losses. To this end, we report simulations realized from a simple model describing the Eurozone and the timing for consolidation.

Seven macroeconomic indicators were selected and the most accurate forecasts are those for exchange rate, the less accurate being export rate predictions. Unlike the rest of the forecasts, these are biased. The best improvement in accuracy for the seven types of forecasts was obtained by applying Hodrick-Prescott filter and Holt-Winters adjustment. Most of the NCP forecasts are available from 2004. Therefore, a comparison of accuracy was made for 2004-2012 using Diebold-Mariano test. Dobrescu model provided more accurate forecasts on the horizon 2004-2012 compared to NCP for GDP deflator; index of private consumption, index of consumer prices, export rate and exchange rate. NCP outperformed Dobrescu anticipations on the same horizon for GDP index and unemployment rate. During 2004-2012, Dobrescu model offered forecasts with a higher degree of efficiency compared to NCP for GDP deflator, consumer index of prices and exchange rate. Using a fixed-effects model based on three scenarios of the Dobrescu model for GDP deflator, index of private consumption, GDP index and index of consumer prices, the weak efficiency was checked only for GDP deflator and index of private consumption.","Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Simionescu, M (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaela_mb1@yahoo.com,"Simionescu, Mihaela/L-1249-2016; Simionescu, Mihaela/AAP-7639-2021","Simionescu, Mihaela/0000-0002-6124-2172;",,,,,32,2,2,0,13,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The WTO regulates its members' subsidies by defining subsidies that are permissible, as well as by providing means to retaliate against subsidies of partner countries if these subsidies hurt one's interest. However, these subsidy rules might have an unintended effect. As both subsidies and tariffs are substitute instruments of protection, tighter subsidy rules might lead to a decrease in the pace of tariff liberalization. In this paper, we present first empirical evidence in support of this prediction. Using China's accession to the WTO in 2001 as a case study, we show that China's accession to the WTO was associated with a relative increase in its tariffs for products that faced a higher threat of retaliation against subsidies. More importantly, we also show that increases in tariff were larger in products with higher potential costs imposed by retaliation. Finally, we include several robustness tests as well as conduct two counterfactual exercises to verify that the results we obtain are indeed due to perceived threat of retaliation against subsidies.","Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Chandra, P (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",pchandra@colgate.edu,,,,,,,33,3,3,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The equilibrium is characterized under the fixed costs and variable costs of quality improvement, respectively. It is shown that the uncertainty is a differentiation force, and the quality differentiation increases more under variable costs than under fixed costs. In addition, an increase in uncertainty leads to higher profits and higher social welfare regardless of whether under fixed or variable costs. This result contrasts with the lower welfare in the Hotelling model with uncertainty. Finally, an analysis of the case of partial market coverage with uncertainty completes this paper.

Our new tests often have better power than the parametric-bootstrap version of the traditional IMT; when they do not, they nevertheless perform respectably.","[Cho, Jin Seo] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [White, Halbert] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Yonsei University; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Cho, JS (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",,"Cho, Jin Seo/R-5296-2019","Cho, Jin Seo/0000-0002-9705-0199",,,,,36,11,11,1,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0731-9053,,978-1-78441-182-4; 978-1-78441-183-1,ADV ECONOMETRICS,,,2014,33,,,,,,491,556,,10.1108/S0731-905320140000033014,0.0,,,66,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360559300015,0

The emergence of a centreperiphery system posed specific problems to growth and distribution in laggard economies, which LAS discusses in a systematic way. In this paper we present a model that, first, captures key insights of the LAS school, such as the persistency of technological asymmetries and structural heterogeneity; second, it can be used to analyse the impacts of shocks and policies based on how they affect the supply-side and demand-side parameters of the model; third, it links more closely (post-)Keynesian macroeconomics based on the BOP constraint with the evolutionary microeconomics concerned with the dynamics of learning; last, it can be used as a toolbox and a teachable model in the analysis of interactions between structural change, technological catching up and long-term growth.","[Cimoli, Mario] Univ Venice, I-30123 Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Porcile, G (通讯作者)，Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Div Desarrollo Prod & Empresarial, Av Dag Hammarskjold 3477, Santiago, Chile.",jose.porcile@cepal.org,,,,,,,69,65,77,2,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We illustrate that while the level of public expenditure in France is larger than in the Euro Area, its trend is comparable to its neighbours. French net debt is comparable to Eurozone's while French net wealth remains positive. However, the French tax system is not progressive with only 6% of compulsory levies raised that way, and too complex. The paper then acknowledges the efficient debt management of French authorities.

The basic information of Asian countries where the cultural landscapes are situated is to ground a foundation for readers to understand the location of the site, its population and density, ethnic majority, governance system and subsequently the nominated criteria of UNESCO. The sites are then linked to the contemporary backdrop to reveal the great diversity of interactions between humans and their environment. This is to find out whether they are sustaining their traditional living cultures and also to examine how the current politics, socio and economic circumstances influence the sites. The analysis is based on four categories: (i) Early human settlement and spiritual sites (Grottos and sacred sites), (ii) Economy and cultural activity prove (plantation, mining and trading route), (iii) Ancient township and empire remains, and (iv) Intentional human intervention landscape. Out of the 18 cultural landscapes in Asia, 16 are considered highly relevant with its modernity except Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape (Azerbaijan). A key question in this study touches on whether the result would vary if the continent was different.

Because processing imports are inputs for exports, the link between such imports and China's exchange rates are ambiguous. We estimate export functions that include China's RMB real effective exchange rates (REER) along with bilateral real exchange rates (BRER) using Johansen's cointegration method and find that the RMB REER significantly affects Japanese and Korean exports to China, even more so than BRER in most cases examined. These two exchange rates appear in the export equations with opposite signs. Subsequently, we use the estimated model to illustrate the importance of accounting for a concurrent change in BRER when analyzing the effects of a hypothetical RMB revaluation on China's trade balances despite the apparently weak imports-BRER linkage.","[Huh, Chan-Guk] Chungnam Natl Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Int Trade, Taejon, South Korea; [Zhu, Guangyao] KPMG & KPMG Huazhen Special Gen Partnership, Dept Audit, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Chungnam National University,"Huh, CG (通讯作者)，Chungnam Natl Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Int Trade, Taejon, South Korea.",chanhuh@cnu.ac.kr; zhuguangyao311@hotmail.com,,,,,,,29,1,1,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2014,22,1,,,,,45,66,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12052.x,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AJ0RS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337364000003,0

A network analysis,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,BRICS; Globalization; Trade intensity indices; Network analysis,INTENSITIES; WORLD,"In this paper, the authors start from the observation of two apparently contradictory trends: the increasing regionalization of trade and the proliferation of regional trade agreements, on the one hand, and the increase of the average number of trading partners of each country and of the trading distances over time due to decreasing transportation and communication costs, on the other, pointing to more globalization. They are brought together to better understand the characteristics of the process of internationalization which is involving so many emerging countries. In particular, by considering the extent of regionalization in trade or the preferentiality of regional trade, as well as the structure of some existing trade agreements in terms of influence of individual countries on intra-regional trade flows, they address the following questions: is internationalization of emerging countries starting at a regional level and eventually evolving to make them global players? Is the growing export strength of many low- or mid-income and size economies due to their linkages to some increasingly important traders in the world market, or is it an autonomous development of their economies? The authors start from a particular specification of bilateral trade intensity indices which allows for measuring revealed trade preferences, overcoming several statistical shortcomings of traditional indicators. They then apply the tools of network analysis, in order to take into account whether local trade structures and preferential agreements affect the overall system of international trade.

It aims to observe the hawking scenario and its effect on the urban environment as well as to examine several inclusive planning approaches to recognize the contributions of hawking to urban development. For sampling, qualitative data was used to analyze the results of the focus group discussions and interviews to create profiles, categories and patterns. The findings show that dominant hawker groups have mostly migrated from rural areas and have low skills. They sell various products in different locations in public places. The negative effectsof hawkers on society include encroachment on sidewalks, over-urbanization, overcrowding of citiesand unrelenting traffic jams. This study concludes that street hawkers locate themselves without any guidelines. Therefore, an approach was developed to solve problems associated with street hawking by recognizing street hawkersand including them in urban planning. Attention was also given on certification and public management systemsas well as on the positivecontributionsof street hawkers to communities.","[Israt, Abontika Sara] Ahsanullah Univ Sci Technol, Dept Architecture, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Adam, Mastura] Univ Malaya, Dept Architecture, Fac Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology (AUST); Universiti Malaya,"Israt, AS (通讯作者)，Ahsanullah Univ Sci Technol, Dept Architecture, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",abontikasara@gmail.com; mastura@um.edu.my,"ADAM, MASTURA/ABG-9275-2021","ADAM, MASTURA/0000-0002-9110-6905",,,,,22,0,0,0,1,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-206-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,167,174,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0OB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366474600022,0

Previous research on PBC in Albania reveals clear evidence of fiscal expansion before elections, but no significant changes in GDP and inflation as theory predicts. One possible explanation of this result could be economic agents' expectations, which is the subject of this paper. We analyse consumers' expectations before elections, the main factors underlying expectations, and the way in which these expectations influence their behaviour toward spending, and consequently the macroeconomic outcomes, deploying standard econometric methods widely applied in PBC related research. According to our research results, households' consumption spending decreases before elections because of the higher uncertainty about their future economic situation due to the highly politicised public employment.","[Imami, Drini] Agr Univ Tirana, Fac Econ & Agribusiness, Tirana, Albania; [Kaechelein, Holger] SECED, Tirana, Albania; [Kaechelein, Holger] Bavarian Virtual Univ, Virtuelle Hsch Bayernvhb, Tirana, Albania; [Lami, Endrit] Minist Finance, Tirana, Albania",,,elami@minfin.gov.al; kaechelein@seced-web.org; dimami@ubt.edu.al,"Imami, Drini/Q-6843-2017","Imami, Drini/0000-0002-4716-792X",,,,,42,6,6,0,7,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

In a setting where any kind of risk taking is suboptimal for shareholders, we show that excessive risk taking may occur for one of two reasons: risk preferences or incentives. Even when compensated through restricted company stock, experimental CEOs take large amounts of excessive risk. This contradicts classical financial theory, but can be explained through risk preferences that are not uniform over the probability and outcome spaces, and in particular, risk seeking for small probability gains and large probability losses. Compensation through options further increases risk taking as expected. We show that this effect is driven mainly by the personal asset position of the experimental CEO, thus having deleterious effects on company performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM.

An understanding of psychology can also lead to the development of different policy tools that better motivate desired behavior change or that are more cost-effective than traditional policy tools. The article outlines a framework for thinking about the psychology of behavior change in the context of market failures. It then describes the research on the effects of a variety of interventions rooted in an understanding of psychology that have policy-relevant applications.

In particular, we consider a network with multiple origins and a common destination node, where each link is owned by a firm that sets prices in order to maximize profits, whereas users want to minimize the total cost they face, which is given by the congestion cost plus the prices set by firms. In this environment, we introduce the notion of Markovian Traffic Equilibrium to establish the existence and uniqueness of a pure strategy price equilibrium, without assuming that the demand functions are concave nor imposing particular functional forms for the latency functions. We derive explicit conditions to guarantee existence and uniqueness of equilibria. Given this existence and uniqueness result, we apply our framework to study entry decisions and welfare, and establish that in congested markets with free entry, the number of firms exceeds the social optimum.

Our sample covers all 344 forward-looking communications made in the period May 1999 to May 2004. We find, first, that there is a higher likelihood of newswire coverage for monetary policy reports and speeches by Chairman Greenspan than for testimony and speeches by other Fed members. Furthermore, communications with an explicit monetary policy inclination or tone different from the current interest rate path are particularly likely to be covered. However, the release of important macroeconomic news reduces the likelihood of newswire coverage. Second, speeches by regional Fed presidents are relatively less likely to be reported than speeches by Board members. Nevertheless, newswire coverage of Fed president speeches is more likely if central bank communication is stale. Finally, our results indicate that Ben Bernanke played a distinguished role even before his Chairmanship.","Univ Trier, Dept Econ, D-54286 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Neuenkirch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Dept Econ, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",neuenkirch@uni-trier.de,,"Neuenkirch, Matthias/0000-0002-7451-3613",,,,,22,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Computational issues are discussed together with some proposals for their amelioration. Higher-order and other properties are also addressed in some detail.

The article divides transaction costs into two groups: administrative (expended by the program administrators) and compliance (expended by recipients). Presented results of empirical research clearly show that size of transaction costs is certainly significant. The value of relative administrative costs is between 0.1 and 4%.

For validation of the measurement instrument, we first applied confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL 8.80 software. The hierarchical linear modelling analysis demonstrated a positive relationship between authentic leadership, employees' job satisfaction, and work engagement. In addition, the relationship between authentic leadership and job satisfaction is fully mediated by perceived supervisor support, whereas we have also found support for partial mediation of perceived supervisor support in the relationship between authentic leadership and employees' work engagement. A key originality and the theoretical and methodological contribution of this study lies in a multilevel approach that builds upon a sample of leaders and a number of their followers.

Just two months later Fitch downgraded Greece's debt to BBB+, the lowest credit rating in Europe. The Greek government fries to resolve this historical problem with a loan from a troika (European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund), which requires the country to implement a wide array of austerity measures, from spending cuts and public sector lay-offs to tax rises and the privatization of public assets. But the three-year crisis has left deep scars on the body of society, leaving thousands out of work and plunging them into poverty. According to the official data from the Greek ELSTAT statistic agency reports, unemployment in Greece hit a new record in October 2012 reaching 26,8 %, compared with 2008, when economic decline started in Greece, unemployment has more than tripled. In addition, according to study by ADEDY and GSEE labor unions, approximately one in two Greeks earns less than 4,871 (sic) a year and lives below the poverty line, defined as the minimum income a family of four needs to eat, dress, use transportation, go to school, and pay the rent. Based on the data from the ministry of environment, energy and climate change the Greek government knows that the greatest problem of the Greek fuels market is fuel smuggling, adulteration and cheating, which lead to distortions in the market. In order to solve this problem the government decides to equalize the price of heating oil with petrol pump prices. However, this decision pushes the price of a litre of heating oil to around 1,3 (sic), about 45 % higher than one year ago. With petrol out of the question for the many, attention has turned to alternative forms of heating. On the other hand, collusion among producers in Greece and a thorough lack of competition that allows a favored few to extract economically unjustified profits have as a result the price of natural gas, wood and pellet to climb. The main goal of this work is to estimate the feasibility of a heat pump system as an alternative solution to the common heating diesel which is used in Greece. Based on the long-term meteorological data from 66 stations, the financial feasibility of a heat pump heating system at each site in Greece was estimated. The RETScreen Clean Energy Project Analysis software was used in order to carry out the feasibility analysis and the green house gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Generally Greece has a typical Mediterranean climate which means hot, dry summers and mild rainy winters with snow mainly at higher elevations. The facts that there aren't areas in Greece which are more than 140 kilometers away from water and nearly 80 % of country is mountainous give varying weather patterns across to the country. According to the heating degree-days, Greece can be divided into 4 climatic zones. Sensitivity analysis was realized for four cities, namely Rhodes, Athens/Filadelpeia, Kavala and Kastoria, which are located in the first, second, third and fourth zone respectively. In accordance with the financial results in the first climatic zone where heating demand is really low, the replacement of heating oil systems with heat pump systems is not very profitable investment. In zone A, based on the results from the RETScreen, the payback period varies between 7-10,5 years, while for the poorest of citizens owing to government subsidy of 0,28(sic)/l the payback period is between 9,8-14,5 years. In the second zone there are several financial benefits from using heat pump system instead of heating oil, the payback period fluctuates from 5,1 up to 6,9 years (without government grant) or from 7,3 up to 9,8 years (with government grant). In the climatic zone C, heat pump system seems provides considerable economic benefits, the relevant results showed that the payback period varies between 4,2-5 or 6-7,1 years without and with government subsidy. In the fourth climatic zone where the climate is similar with that in central Europe, heat pump system is a sound financial investment and the payback period is really short (3,2-4,2 years without government grant or 4,6-6,0 years with government grant). Last but not least, except from financial benefits, there are environmental benefits as well. Based on the RETScreen environmental analysis, the gross annual GHG emissions reduction was estimated to be 1,5 up to 5 tCO(2).","[Potolias, Constantinos; Fantidis, Jacob G.; Bandekas, Dimitrios V.; Kourtidis, Aggelos] Kavala Inst Technol, St Lukas 65404, Kavala, Greece; [Potolias, Constantinos; Mourmouris, John C.] Democritus Univ Thrace, Komotini, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace,"Potolias, C (通讯作者)，Kavala Inst Technol, St Lukas 65404, Kavala, Greece.",cpotolias@yahoo.gr; jomour@eexi.gr; fantidis@yahoo.gr; dbandek@teikav.edu.gr; aggelos-k@hohnail.com,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,31,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Key experimental results that bear on the relevance of these theories are discussed as well. Five types of models are considered. In the first, an individual's utility function is increasing in the payoffs of other people. The more standard version of these preferences supposes that only consumption leads to payoffs and has trouble explaining prosocial actions such as voting and charitable contributions by poor individuals. If one lets other variables determine happiness as well, this model can explain a much wider set of observations. The second type of model surveyed involves people trying to demonstrate to others that they have prosocial (or altruistic) preferences. In these models, altruistic acts need not have a direct effect on utility. The third class of models includes those of reciprocity in which people's altruism depends on whether others act kindly or unkindly toward them. In the fourth type of model, inequality has a profound effect on altruism, with individuals being spiteful toward people whose resources exceed their own. Finally, I discuss the fifth type of model, in which specifications of altruism might have to be modified to take into account how people behave when they are able to transfer lotteries to others.","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Rotemberg, JJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",jrotemberg@hbs.edu,,,,,,,99,11,13,0,15,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

We employ a dynamic panel model using the Arellano-Bond's Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM). Our findings suggest that a 1% increase in business R&D intensity boosts economic growth by 0.050 (0.213) % in these countries in the short (long) run. Public R&D is found to be statistically insignificant. When introducing human capital in the regression, the contribution of business R&D to economic growth decreases, although it remains significant. We argue that part of its effect may be accounted for by human capital. While various robustness checks are performed (such as adding different control variables, sub-periods and dummies for the entrance years to the EU), most of the results imply significant business R&D coefficient.

Our results indicate that under the guidelines, and after controlling for circumstances such as the severity of the offense and past criminal history, judicial preferences strongly favor women while also disadvantaging Black men.

We find that students enter school quite optimistic about obtaining a science degree, but that relatively few students end up graduating with a science degree.

Sectors are classified by the author into groups of high value-added, medium value-added and low value-added; by OECD into high-technology industries, medium-high technology industries, medium-low technology industries and low technology industries. Furthermore, all sectors are labelled either modern or traditional. Intentions to restructure national economy with priorities in high-technology, knowledge-intensive and high value-added sectors call for formation of a new national specialization. It is important to thoroughly analyse possible effects and influences of these processes to the national economy and welfare of society. With current interconnections of economies and processes of globalization, it is very important to evaluate sensitivity of different sectors (of different technological intensity and value-added) to general fluctuations of economy. Small open economies, such as Lithuania, are especially susceptible to this problem. Although this problem may seem to be narrow at first glance, it is in fact quite complex and has not been sufficiently studied in scientific literature. Available research of separate segments is inconclusive due to rapid changes in circumstances, interconnections between segments and contradictions between technological intensity and creation of value-added. In this article, a correlation and regression analysis of fluctuations in gross value-added and GDP of different sectors of Lithuanian economy during 2000-2010 is presented. Although no concrete conclusions were reached, important tendencies were revealed and a basis for further research was established. Some proposed goals are as follows: evaluation of relevance of factors of production to value-added, fluctuations of value-added in markets for services and products, and evaluation of impact of economic policy to cyclicity of different sectors.","Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Umbrasiene, G (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Nemunas Str 33, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania.",gema.umbrasiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It is of great theoretical and practical significance to gain a deeper understanding of extreme value statistics of the volatility of energy futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). We investigate the statistical properties of the recurrence intervals of daily volatility time series of four NYMEX energy futures, which are defined as the waiting times tau between consecutive volatilities exceeding a given threshold q. We find that the recurrence intervals are distributed as a stretched exponential P-q(tau)similar to e((a tau)-gamma), where the exponent gamma decreases with increasing q, and there is no scaling behavior in the distributions for different thresholds q after the recurrence intervals are scaled with the mean recurrence interval (tau) over bar. These findings are significant under the Kolmogorov-Smimov test and the Cramer-von Mises test. We show that the empirical estimations are in nice agreement with the numerical integration results for the occurrence probability W-q(Delta t vertical bar t) of a next event above the threshold q within a (short) time interval after an elapsed time t from the last event above q. We also investigate the memory effects of the recurrence intervals. It is found that the conditional distributions of large and small recurrence intervals differ from each other and the conditional mean of the recurrence intervals scale as a power law of the preceding interval (tau) over bar(tau(0))/(tau) over bar similar to(tau(0)/(tau) over bar)(beta), indicating that the recurrence intervals have short-term correlations. Detrended fluctuation analysis and detrending moving average analysis further uncover that the recurrence intervals possess long-term correlations. We confirm that the clustering of the volatility recurrence intervals is caused by the long-term correlations well known to be present in the volatility. Our findings shed new lights on the behavior of large volatilities and have potential implications in risk management of energy futures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While fiscal policy accounts for about 15% of output variance at business cycle frequencies, this mostly derives from anticipated government spending shocks. Tax shocks, both anticipated and unanticipated, contribute little to the fluctuations of real variables. However, anticipated capital tax shocks do explain a sizable part of inflation fluctuations, accounting for up to 12% of its variance. In line with earlier studies, news shocks in total account for about 50% of output variance. Further decomposing this news effect, we find permanent total factor productivity news shocks to be most important. When looking at the federal level instead of total government, the importance of anticipated tax and spending shocks significantly increases, suggesting that fiscal policy at the subnational level typically counteracts the effects of federal fiscal policy shocks.

Employee effort (controlling for wages) is unaffected by allowing messages, but wages dramatically increase. Messages affect wages because employees give managers advice to set higher wages, usually explaining that this will result in higher effort. This advice prompts managers to try higher wages, helping them learn that raising wages increases their payoffs. In a follow-up experiment, we directly provide managers with additional information about the relationship between wages and effort. This too causes wages to increase, but to a lesser extent than allowing messages. Our results highlight the critical role of learning in generating gains from positive gift exchange.","[Cooper, David J.] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Cooper, David J.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Lightle, John P.] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",University of East Anglia; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Lightle, JP (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",jlightle@fsu.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0924772] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,32,8,10,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

We derive the optimal tax treatment of housing capital vis-a-vis business capital allowing for relatively general household preferences. In the first-best, the tax treatment of business and housing capital should always be the same. In the second-best, in contrast, the optimal tax treatment of housing capital depends on the elasticities of substitution between nonhousing consumption, housing, and leisure. This is because housing taxation may be used to alleviate the distorting effect of taxing labor. As a result, the optimal tax treatment of housing capital may be different from that of business capital.

Second, it analyzes how the use of revenues from a carbon tax or from a cap-and-trade system involving auctioned emissions allowances influences these policies' economic costs. Third, it addresses the question whether carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs represent more efficient sources of government revenue than other, more traditional revenue sources such as income, sales, or payroll taxes. Finally, it analyzes how fiscal interactions affect the choice between CO2 emissions-pricing instruments (carbon taxes and cap and trade) and other climate policy instruments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In a laboratory experiment we investigate this prediction by comparing frequent and infrequent auctioning as well as two different grandfathering schemes under market rules that closely resemble those of the European Union Emission Trading System. Our experimental results suggest that, contrary to theoretical predictions, the initial allocation procedure has the potential to affect efficiency of the final permit allocation. While we do not identify an effect of the initial allocation procedure itself (auction vs. grandfathering), we observe higher final efficiency after infrequent auctioning of permits than for frequent auctioning. Surprisingly, for a grandfathering scheme that distributes permits proportional to expected needs the high initial efficiency is substantially reduced by secondary market trading. An analysis of behavioral patterns shows that permit prices and abatement levels are initially substantially higher if permits are allocated by auction and we also find more over-banking as compared to the grandfathering treatments. Treatment differences diminish in the course of the experiment.","[Grimm, Veronika] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Ilieva, Lyuba] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Cologne,"Grimm, V (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",veronika.grimm@fau.de; lyuba.ilieva@uni-koeln.de,,,,,,,29,15,18,0,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In our model, agency problems call for wage contracts with deferred compensation. At the same time workers do on-the-job search. Deferred compensation improves workers' incentives to exert effort but distorts their on-the-job search decisions. We show that deferred compensation is less attractive when the value to the worker-firm pair of on-the-job search is high. Moreover, the interplay between search frictions and wage contracts creates feedback effects. If firms in equilibrium use contracts with deferred compensation, fewer firms with vacancies enter the on-the-job search market, and this in turn reduces the distortions created by deferred compensation. These feedback effects between the incentive contracts used and the activity level in the search markets can lead to multiple equilibria: a low-turnover equilibrium where firms use deferred compensation, and a high-turnover equilibrium where they do not. Furthermore, the model predicts that firms are more likely to use deferred compensation when search frictions are high and when the gains from on-the-job search are small.","[Moen, Espen R.] Norwegian Sch Management BI, Oslo, Norway; [Rosen, Asa] Stockholm Univ SOFI, Stockholm, Sweden; [Rosen, Asa] Oslo Univ ESOP, Oslo, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School,"Moen, ER (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Management BI, Oslo, Norway.",espen.r.moen@bi.no; asa.rosen@sofi.su.se,,"Rosen, Asa/0000-0001-8470-2859",,,,,48,3,5,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

This paper highlights duopoly innovation under the Hotel ling model with game theory approaches. This paper argues that market power, as measured by the cost advantage of a dominant firm over its rival, serves to enhance the incentive to innovate in a Hotel ling model of spatial competition. This result implies that a firm with cost advantage will have a larger incentive than its rivals to further its cost advantage as new opportunities for innovation arise thereby implying that innovation increases concentration. This result is in contrast to the result obtained by Holmes et al. (2012) who use the Betrand model to show that market power lowers the incentive to innovate.

Then, the limits of this understanding of class struggle are pointed out from the standpoint of Karl Marx's conceptual distinction between labor and labor-power. Finally, a reinterpretation of Kalecki's 'Political aspects of full employment' is provided, indicating the broader conception of class struggle implicit in this work and its usefulness to a better understanding of capital labor conflicts in contemporary capitalism.","[Rugitsky, Fernando M.] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Rugitsky, Fernando M.] Brazilian Ctr Anal & Planning Cebrap, Sao Paulo, Brazil",The New School,"Rugitsky, FM (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA.",,"Rugitsky, Fernando/K-1051-2013","Rugitsky, Fernando/0000-0002-4803-7270",,,,,63,8,8,1,14,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The law focuses on external imbalances as impediments to growth and does not consider the case where internal imbalances (budget deficits or public debt) can also constrain growth. The recent European public debt crisis shows that when internal imbalances are out of control they can constrain growth and domestic demand in a severe way. Recently, Soukiazis, Cerqueira, and Antunes (2012a) developed a model-hereafter the SCA model-that takes into account both internal and external imbalances but in which relative prices do not play any role on the pace of economic growth. The aim of this paper is to extend the SCA model by relaxing this assumption and introducing explicitly relative prices into it. The model is tested for Portugal, which recently (2011) fell into a public debt crisis with serious negative consequences for growth. It is shown that our new model makes a significant improvement in explaining actual growth in Portugal. Our empirical analysis reveals that Portuguese growth is balance-of-payments constrained and that policies aimed at reducing external imbalances and changing the share of imports and exports toward trade equilibrium will help the economy to grow faster. Competitive devaluations and lower costs of financing the economy also produce an important stimulus to growth.","[Soukiazis, Elias; Cerqueira, Pedro Andre; Antunes, Micaela] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Soukiazis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal.",,"Cerqueira, Pedro/K-6899-2019; Antunes, Micaela/GQZ-8240-2022; Antunes, Micaela/AAD-8220-2020","Cerqueira, Pedro/0000-0002-3155-188X; Antunes, Micaela/0000-0002-2113-2139; Antunes, Micaela/0000-0002-2113-2139",,,,,23,14,15,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

It compares the outcomes of aid poured into the economies of the Third World for decades without any visible effect and remittances transferred by emigrants to their countries of origin which proved to be quite effective. We find that remittances have a stronger net positive effect on the increase of GDP per capita in developing economies than development aid. In addition, remittances tend to be higher than ODA funds, they are absorbed by 80-90 per cent (in comparison with 50 per cent of aid budgets spent on administrative and other costs) and do not hinge on institutional quality. The paper advocates the importance of remittances over ODA and supports the wide usage of coherent development policies executed by the developed Western economies with an aim to enhance transparent and efficient remittance transfers as one of the best methods to promote development in less-developed countries (e.g. economies in Africa, Asia or Latin America).","[Stojanov, Robert; Strielkowski, Wadim] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Dept Adaptat Res Strategies, Global Change Res Ctr, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Stojanov, Robert] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Fac Sci, Prague 12843, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Stojanov, R (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Dept Adaptat Res Strategies, Global Change Res Ctr, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.",stojanov@centrum.cz,"Strielkowski, Wadim/J-6112-2017; Stojanov, Robert/F-4280-2012; Strielkowski, Wadim/I-4374-2019","Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Stojanov, Robert/0000-0002-0471-7055; Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841",,,,,53,10,10,3,29,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

This unification enables us to quantify the relative contributions of each mechanism to life cycle earnings growth, while investigating potential interactions between human capital investment and job search. Within the unified framework, the expectation of rising rental rates of human capital through job search gives workers more incentive to invest in human capital. In addition, unemployed workers reduce their reservation rental rates and increase their search effort to leave unemployment quickly to take advantage of human capital accumulation on the job. The results show both forces are important for earnings growth and the interactions are substantial: human capital accumulation accounts for 50% of total earnings growth, job search accounts for 20%, and the remaining 30% is due to the interactions of the two.

Since 1980 the relative participation in higher education has increased more than twice the initial level. We investigate possible reasons for that dramatic increase in association with the overall economic conditions, the financial conditions of individuals, the expected benefits from undergraduate higher education, the proportion of the relevant population who fulfilled the enrollment requirements, the changing personal and social values related to higher education, and the supply side variables of higher education.

The two admissible values correspond to bad and good risk states of an individual. The risk correlation is captured by introducing a dynamic frailty, whereas the contagion passes through the effect of the lagged number of individuals in the bad risk state. We study carefully the dynamic properties of the joint process. Then, we focus on the limiting case of large populations (portfolios). The difficulty to identify risk correlation and contagion in finite samples is illustrated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Further, double-dipping necessarily leads to default and inefficiency, and moreover, borrowers who face relatively higher transactions costs optimally decide to double-dip. Interestingly, an increase in MFI competition can increase the extent of double-dipping and default.

The channels through which the creation of the euro led to increased cross-border banking among the original members of the EMU help but do not fully explain the increased flow of cross-border banking from the EMU to the NMS. This indicates that for the NMS, joining the European Union and eventually the EMU changes the perceptions of EMU banks regarding the benefits of expanding.

Some are imposed at the data collection level, leaving some for the estimation level. When data are collected, the implicit assumption underlying the aggregation is perfect substitutability: one gallon of gasoline is viewed by consumers as equivalent to another gallon; hence, the two are added together. While such aggregation can be carried out further by the data analyst, it is difficult to incorporate perfect substitutability into the estimation of direct demand systems. Perfect substitution in that context implies discontinuous demand functions, which are not nested within standard empirical demand systems. Perfect substitution is much more easily handled in a system of inverse demands, though an empirical method to impose perfect substitutability in an inverse demand system has not previously appeared in the literature. In this article, we develop such a method, which allows perfect substitutability to be imposed as a prior restriction. We use Leamer's information contract curve as a tool to flexibly impose the substitution restriction and to investigate consistency between the data and prior. We illustrate the method with an application to inverse demands for fish in Korea.","[Park, Hoanjae] Calif State Univ Fresno, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Park, Hoanjae] Catholic Univ Daegu, Gyongsan, South Korea; [Thurman, Walter N.] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",California State University System; California State University Fresno; Catholic University of Daegu; North Carolina State University,"Park, H (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fresno, Fresno, CA 93740 USA.",parkhj@cu.ac.kr,,"Thurman, Walter/0000-0002-6106-7685",,,,,30,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Among many survey participants, such a link exists and is positive; that is, these survey participants enjoy working at firms that promote gender balance at the top. The positive link is explained in part by worker personality/attitudes and firm characteristics, and in part by the result that participating workers often enjoy higher job satisfaction because they perceive the lack of glass ceiling' as a signal of improved own career opportunities.

The growth of Indian manufacturing is characterized by joblessness', and during the post-1991years, by large yearly and industry-wise variations. While a few capital- and skill-intensive industries recorded fast rates of growth of value added, employment generation occurred largely in the unorganized sector, mainly in export-oriented industries such as garments and textiles. The frequently cited argument that the major barrier to manufacturing-employment growth in India is the rigidity' in the country's labour regulations rests on very thin empirical evidence. With the rising share of contract workers even within the organized segments of manufacturing since the 1990s, the very argument that India's labour market is rigid is questionable. Power shortages, insufficient availability of credit and the volatility in exchange rates and raw material prices are some of the important factors that constrained the growth of Indian manufacturing, especially the small-scale sector.","Indian Inst Technol, Humanities & Social Sci Dept, Delhi, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Thomas, JJ (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Humanities & Social Sci Dept, Delhi, India.",jayanjthomas@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,12,13,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Using these indices we investigate the risk premiums of Chinese commodity futures and verify that the commodity futures can act as an effective diversification tool for Chinese asset management. It is found that the commodity futures can hedge both expected and unexpected inflation in China, and agricultural commodity futures are found to signal inflation 2 months beforehand. Finally, we explore the relationship between Chinese and US commodity futures markets in the years 2000 and 2010, and find that their interactions strengthen over time. Our research reveals an increasingly important role of the Chinese commodity futures market in both the domestic and the global economy. Some policy changes are suggested in response to this trend.","[Tu, Zhiyong; Zhang, Liang] Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Song, Min] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Peking University; University of Hong Kong,"Tu, ZY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",zytu@phbs.pku.edu.cn; fmsong@econ.hku.hk; leonardolzhang@live.com,,,,,,,25,4,4,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV,2013,21,6,,,,,79,99,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12047.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,291TN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329853000005,0

This way, we are able to investigate dynamics of correlations in time and across scales (frequencies) with a model-free approach. We show that correlations indeed vary in time and across frequencies. We find two highly correlated pairs which are strongly connected at low frequencies - ethanol with corn and biodiesel with German diesel - during almost the whole analyzed period (2003-2011). Structure of correlations remarkably changes during the food crisis - higher frequencies become important for both mentioned pairs. This implies that during stable periods, ethanol is correlated with corn and biodiesel is correlated with German diesel mainly at low frequencies so that they follow a common long-term trend. However, in the crisis periods, ethanol (biodiesel) is led by corn (German diesel) even at high frequencies (low scales), which implies that the biofuels prices react more rapidly to the changes in their producing factors.

Our key interest is to better understand which of these two remedies is more effective at enhancing competition. Allaz and Vila (1993) theorized that forward markets can have a pro-competitive effect under linear production costs. Le Coq and Orzen (2006) and Brandts et al. (2008) investigated this and related issues experimentally. All three experiments (including ours) support the prediction by Allaz and Vila (1993) that introducing a forward market does indeed intensify competition. The results of the present study, however, differ from previous experimental results in that we find the forward market to be the more effective remedy. Brandts et al. (2008) increase the number of competitors by entry, which thus increases the aggregate stock of production assets and makes output cheaper. In contrast, we increase the number of competitors by divestiture, which leaves the aggregate stock of production assets constant. Our results address an important policy issue and provide tentative evidence on the competition-enhancing effect of forward markets, which can be considered a behavioral remedy.

Studies on tariff-mediated network effects suggest this is due to large operators using on-net discounts to damage smaller rivals. Alternatively, research on strategic discounting suggests that small operators use on-net discounts to advertise with low on-net prices. We test the relative strength of these effects using data on tariff setting in German mobile telecommunications between 2001 and 2009. We find that large operators are more likely to offer tariffs with on-net discounts but there is no consistently significant difference in the magnitude of discounts.

We consider these observed characteristics of immigrant employment with regard to the question of how immigration affects a nation's pattern of production and trade. We model an economy producing three goods; one is non-traded. Domestic labor and capital are domestically mobile but internationally immobile. Allowing that some new immigrants will become specific to the non-traded goods sector, the model indicates that the effects of immigration on output and trade depend importantly on the sectoral pattern of employment of both new and existing immigrants. Empirical investigation in a panel data set of OECD countries supports the model's prediction that immigration raises the output of non-traded goods. Consistent with the model, we also find that immigration and trade are complements.

Over a 5-year period with IMF-supported programmes, spending for education increases by about 3/4 percentage point of Gross Domestic Product (GDP); and for health, by about 1 percentage point of GDP.

In order to account for the adjustments and to capture the relevant transmission mechanisms of changes in trade costs, such as market size, entry and exit, as well as productivity changes of firms, we base our trade policy analysis on a dynamic new trade theory model. This approach has two advantages. (i) It allows us to take account of the transitional process after a change in tariffs. (ii) It allows us to take account of the shortsightedness of policy makers. We show that Nash-equilibrium tariffs based on a dynamic trade model are lower than Nash-equilibrium tariffs based on a static model. We also show that shortsighted politicians tend to set lower tariffs than politicians with a longer planning horizon. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In the context of the spatial Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma, the resistance to learning has become a key mechanism for the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in a wide range of cost regimes. We extend the model to the case in which different individuals may have different levels of resistance. From non-cooperative initial states, the existence of heterogeneity in the resistance affects the cooperative behavior of unconditional imitators. These unconditional imitators, i.e., fast learners or individuals without resistance can achieve due to their interactions with gradual learners significant levels of cooperation. Our results confirm in one of its form the impact of heterogeneity and its role as a fundamental mechanism in promoting the emergence of cooperation.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Quantitat Econ Dept, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Lugo, H (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Quantitat Econ Dept, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid, Spain.",hlugo@ccee.ucm.es,"Lugo, Haydee/AAA-4639-2019","Lugo, Haydee/0000-0001-5971-2086",,,,,33,0,0,0,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

It provides experimental evidence in support of sequential equilibrium behavior in a finitely repeated investment/trust game where information asymmetry raises the possibility of voluntary disclosure. I define two regimes, namely disclosure regime and no-disclosure regime and it is only in the disclosure regime that such disclosure of private information is a possibility. I compare investment levels across two regimes and find the startling result that investment is lower in disclosure regime. I find that this lower investment is attributable to the fact that the prior probability with which an investor in the disclosure regime believes that a manager is trustworthy is significantly lower than the prior probability with which an investor in the no-disclosure regime believes that a manager is trustworthy. I introduce a two-stage experimental design to homogenize prior beliefs about managers' trustworthiness and find that after such homogenization, investment is higher in disclosure.

I develop a model in which there are two groups, one of whom benefits from a regulation, and one of whom bears the costs. A potentially biased government sets the level of the regulation and also redistributes income across the two social groups via the tax system. When taxes are nondistortionary, the government chooses the efficient level of the regulation to maximize wealth and then uses the tax system to distribute this wealth according to its preferences. If the government is forced to pay compensation for the costs of the regulation, it simply undoes this via the tax and transfer system. When taxes are distortionary, societal wealth is monotonically decreasing in the degree of compensation to be paid, so that the optimal level of compensation is zero.","Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Pecorino, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",ppecorin@cba.ua.edu,"Pecorino, Paul/AAA-9292-2019","Pecorino, Paul/0000-0002-7659-7873",,,,,32,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Endogenous childbearing ages is shown to affect the optimal policy through the redistribution across the earnings dimension and the internalization of fertility externalities. Contrary to common practice, children benefits differentiated according to the age of parents can be part of the optimal family policy.

We alter the transparency of exchanges between non-adjacent parties. We find transparency of the exchanges between the investor and intermediary does not significantly affect welfare.

Federal governments can implement compensation payments between domestic regions and matching grants prior to the international negotiations between the polluting regions. The subgame-perfect transfer schemes fail to fully internalize the environmental externality, leading to an inefficient international environmental agreement. As the international spillover increases, the intracountry compensation rates increase while the matching rates decline, distorting the incentives for the regional governments in opposing directions.

A total of 162 undergraduates - Africans, Caucasians, Singaporeans and Chinese - are recruited for this study. From the risk choices that students take, we can see how Singaporeans differ from their counterparts elsewhere. The results show that Singaporeans are less risk averse than African or Caucasian exchange students. In terms of risk seeking behavior, when using Caucasians as a reference group, Singaporeans and Chinese undergraduates are also relatively more risk seeking as well. The majority of the players are risk neutral in this experiment. Singaporeans, like the Caucasians and Chinese in the sample, are all more likely to favor risk neutral strategies if their default gamble is one with higher expected payoffs.","Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China",Shandong University,"Cheo, R (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",blangah@live.cn,,"Cheo, Roland/0000-0001-5654-2624",,,,,9,0,0,0,17,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Using a novel dataset from Lithuania, the UK and Ireland for the calibration of a structural model of labor demand, I find that over the period of five years emigration increased the wages of young workers by 6%, while it had no effect on the wages of old workers.

To measure behavioral responses to anti-drug policies, we conducted a framed field experiment with farmers living in one of the most important coca growing areas. Our experimental design allows identifying heterogeneous producer types and measuring their behavioral response to carrots and sticks. We provide an example on how knowledge on distribution types can be used to design an optimal anti-drug policy. We find that about one third of the farmers have moral costs that are high enough to deter them from investing in coca and hence, would require no external incentives. Yet destroying coca completely is prohibitively costly for two fifths of the participants who would require an extremely high compensation or risk of eradication. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By exploring a vast firm-level panel dataset, this study aims to test empirically whether the horizontal and vertical FDI spillover effects are different among industries classified by their technological levels. Key findings are as followings: First, foreign investments in the same industry are more likely to engender negative influences on the local Chinese firms. Second, these negative horizontal effects are particularly prominent in low technology sectors. Third, the effects of foreign investments in other industries appear to be positive and significant relatively evenly across industries with different technological levels.

The higher rate of convergence reflects how fast the spatial root converges to unity. In contrast to near unit root in time series, the estimators are all asymptotically normal.

This article studies the differences in the perceptions of corruption and satisfaction across subjects, utilizing the technique of vignettes for the correction of the bias that follows from the differences in the response scale across individuals. The evidence comes from a sample of citizens in Spain, who are asked about their perceptions of corruption and personal satisfaction. The results show that there exists a response scale bias, both for corruption and satisfaction. These results are utilized to approximate the social cost of corruption.","[Leon, Carmelo J.; Arana, Jorge E.; de Leon, Javier] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev TIDES, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Arana, Jorge E.] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Study Choice CenSoc, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Technology Sydney,"de León, J (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev TIDES, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain.",jleon@defc.ulpgc.es,"DE LEÓN LEDESMA, JAVIER/AAF-8194-2021; Suárez, Beatriz/L-6377-2014; Araña, Jorge E./D-1139-2011","DE LEÓN LEDESMA, JAVIER/0000-0002-4648-8924; Suárez, Beatriz/0000-0001-7132-9346; Araña, Jorge E./0000-0003-0878-9934",,,,,28,12,12,0,84,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

As such, the paper examines what kind of monetary policy and transmission mechanisms are relevant to the Eritrean economy. It also addresses which channels are effective and which are not and why. Vector Autoregressive modelling is employed over the study period 1996Q1-2008Q4. This paper addresses the argument that the bank lending is the sole functioning channel in low income economies. We find that interest rate and official exchange rate channels are inoperative. However, effective exchange rate and credit channels exist through the black foreign exchange market and credit issued to the government sector. The main policy implication of this study is that the Bank of Eritrea might be able to control inflation through manipulating the reserve requirement ratio. (C) 2013 Society for Policy Modeling.

In particular, we focus on the difference between the inequality in the U.S. and in continental Europe. Many studies have indicated a rise in wage inequality in the U.S. over the past three decades. On the other hand, there has been little change in wage inequality in continental Europe. By introducing human capital investment into the model by Acemoglu (Am Econ Rev 89:1259-1278, 1999), we show that ex ante homogeneous economies would have distinct ex post wage distribution. The strategic complementarity between human capital investment and firms' hiring strategies yields the possibility that multiple equilibria exist, which explains the difference in wage distribution between the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we show that differences in tax or education systems can explain the difference in wage distribution between the U.S. and Europe.","Osaka Univ, Japan Soc Promot Sci, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"Okazawa, R (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Japan Soc Promot Sci, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, 1-31 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",rokazawa@osipp.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Okazawa, Ryosuke/0000-0002-2456-2812","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245040, 10J03000] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,35,7,7,1,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

A Fisher-type interest rate equation is analysed using the PMG panel data estimator, with an early attempt to employ the Harmonised European Consumer Surveys in quantifying inflation expectations and uncertainty. The output gap is also considered as an explanatory variable. The results of the Hausman poolability test unambiguously confirm that, despite the differences in their monetary regimes and the development levels of their financial markets, all the countries observed are homogeneous in terms of the Fisher effect. It is shown that both inflation uncertainty and expectations positively and significantly feed into nominal interest rate fluctuations. The post-communist central banks seem to be the most strongly concerned about inflation uncertainty shocks, while their interest rate elasticity with regard to expected inflation is below unity. On the other hand, they do not significantly adjust their interest rates in response to demand-side pressure, assigning only a secondary role to boosting economic activity. As a robustness check, the results obtained remain rather similar when Sweden and the UK (as the remaining non-eurozone EU members) are included in the sample.","[Peric, Blanka Skrabic] Univ Split, Split, Croatia; [Soric, Petar; Arneric, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Split; University of Zagreb,"Peric, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Split, Croatia.",bskrabic@efst.hr,"Arneric, Josip/AAI-6473-2021; Arneric, Josip/AAE-2023-2022; Soric, Petar/AAB-9026-2019; Skrabic Peric, Blanka/D-4976-2017","Arneric, Josip/0000-0002-2901-2609; Arneric, Josip/0000-0002-2901-2609; Soric, Petar/0000-0002-6773-264X; Skrabic Peric, Blanka/0000-0002-7448-3821",,,,,45,1,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,SEP 1,2013,25,3,,,,,309,324,,10.1080/14631377.2013.813138,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,205XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323478800003,0

The study reveals the extent to which corporate debt choices are politically or economically driven. We test if central government ownership, flotation costs, asymmetries of information, and renegotiation and liquidation costs influence the choice of debt. We find evidence in favor of the influence of central government ownership on the financing choices of firms because Central State owned firms are more likely to issue bonds and to borrow uniquely on the bond market, rather than tapping both debt markets. Overall, our findings show that financial factors play a much more minor role in corporate debt choices compared to other countries, whereas central government ownership is a key determinant of preference for the bond market.

The costs and benefits of deceptive and honest communication options may lie in very different domains, making direct comparison cognitively challenging. In this study, we use everyday scenarios to assess people's sensitivity to various aspects of such choices, including the probability that a deception will be detected and the costs and benefits associated with successful or failed deception. Factor analysis yields three composite determinants, which we interpret as sensitivities to (1) justifiability of deception, (2) benefit of successful deception, and (3) personal utility of honesty. We show that the relative strengths of these determinants differ in loss- vs. gain-facing scenarios: decision makers facing a probabilistic or certain loss take account of all three factors, while those facing a gain do not appear to make significant use of information about the magnitude of the potential benefit from deception. We discuss several potential explanations for this asymmetry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This regularity condition is violated in all belief-free equilibria. Indeed, with an individual full rank condition, every interior belief-free equilibrium is robust.

West Churchman. The distinct Veblenian approach to defining instrumental value is in terms of the generic ends of life implicated in the development of technological knowledge. Based on Luhmann's work, the paper argues that the complexity of technological knowledge would overburden the individual human mind. Consequently, it needs to be reduced through the institution of the business firm, the meaning of which is shown to be in substituting private ownership and profit-seeking motivation for those segments of technological complexity that cannot be grasped by the individual mind. Churchman's work is utilized to discuss the possibility of attaining instrumental value by sweeping-in the complexity that has been reduced by the business firm. This sweeping-in is the task of the Deweyian public manifesting itself in law and comparable forms of public regulation. Thus, the proposed systems theory perspective explains pecuniary value as a complexity-reducing device, and instrumental value as the human capacity to preserve sensitivity to those aspects of complexity that are suppressed by pecuniary value.",,,,,"Valentinov, Vladislav/V-2932-2019; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646;",,,,,51,21,23,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We survey the growing literature investigating the causes and consequences of China's urban pollution challenges. We begin by studying how urban population and industrial growth impacts local pollution levels and greenhouse gas production. As the urban population grows richer, its demand for private transportation and electricity sharply increases. Such privately beneficial activity exacerbates urban pollution externalities. Facing these severe environmental challenges, China's urbanites increasingly demand quality of life progress. We survey the emerging literature investigating the demand for environmental progress in China. Progress in mitigating externalities hinges on whether the powerful central and local governments choose to address these issues. We analyze the political economy of whether government officials have strong incentives to tackle lingering urban externalities.

This behavior is particularly prevalent among financially constrained firms.","[Baum, Christopher F.] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Baum, Christopher F.] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Caglayan, Mustafa] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England; [Talavera, Oleksandr] Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Boston College; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Sheffield; Durham University,"Baum, CF (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",baum@bc.edu,"Baum, Christopher F/A-9424-2008; Talavera, Oleksandr/ABE-1913-2021","Baum, Christopher F/0000-0003-4766-3699; Talavera, Oleksandr/0000-0002-4799-778X; Caglayan, Mustafa/0000-0002-1606-6501",,,,,33,11,13,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We test and confirm Schelling's conjecture in a simple take-it-or-leave-it bargaining experiment where the proposer can choose between two possible offers. Option A always gives the proposer a higher payoff than option B. The payoff of the responder depends on the (randomly determined) state of nature. In one state payoffs of the two players are aligned whereas they are not aligned in the other state. The responder is always informed about the actual state. The proposer knows the actual state in our first treatment but not in the second. We find that proposers indeed benefit from ignorance because the responders accept almost all offers (even the unfavorable ones) if the payoffs are not transparent for the proposer. In additional treatments we investigate bargaining situations where the proposer can deliberately remain ignorant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Ample research studies made in this field suggest that social networks are one of the key determinants of informal credit supply. However, such network effects are limited simply because supplier-buyer relationships based on such networks are, in reality, quite rare. In an environment without effective formal sanction mechanisms, suppliers face significant risks in granting trade credit to buyers particularly in a competitive market with large numbers of suppliers and homogeneous products, as is the case in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Therefore, monitoring of buyers' behaviour becomes important, but as such activities are costly to suppliers as it discourages and adversely affects suppliers to establish new trade relationships and expand businesses. As such, the development of formal institutions such as information sharing mechanisms and establishing formal sanctioning mechanisms, including effective courts, will prove effective to stimulate business opportunities and growth.","Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, Osaka, Japan",Kansai University,"Goto, K (通讯作者)，Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, Osaka, Japan.",gotoken@kansai-u.ac.jp,"Goto, Kenta/B-1670-2017","Goto, Kenta/0000-0002-5825-1924",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21530281] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,24,4,5,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

I decompose traders' average portfolio risks into two components: the uninsurable variance, defined as portfolio risks that would obtain without belief disagreements, and the speculative variance, defined as portfolio risks that result from speculation. My main result shows that financial innovation always increases the speculative variance through two distinct channels: by generating new bets and by amplifying traders' existing bets. When disagreements are large, these effects are sufficiently strong that financial innovation increases average portfolio risks, decreases average portfolio comovements, and generates greater speculative trading volume relative to risk-sharing volume. Moreover, a profit-seeking market maker endogenously introduces speculative assets that increase average portfolio risks.

On observing that this parameter may be weakly identified, we propose likelihood-ratio-type tests as well as Fieller-type procedures based on a Hotelling-HAC statistic, which are robust to weak identification and allow for non-Gaussian distributions including parametric GARCH structures. The Fieller-Hotelling-HAC procedure also accounts (asymptotically) for general forms of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. We propose confidence sets for the zero-beta rate based on inverting exact tests for this parameter; for both procedures proposed, these sets can be interpreted as multivariate extensions of the classic Fieller method for inference on ratios. The exact distribution of likelihood-ratio-type statistics for testing efficiency is studied under both the null and the alternative hypotheses. The relevant nuisance parameter structure is established and finite-sample bound procedures are proposed, which extend and improve available Gaussian-specific bounds. Finite-sample distributional invariance results are also demonstrated analytically for the HAC statistic proposed by MacKinlay and Richardson (1991). We study invariance to portfolio repacking for the tests and confidence sets proposed. The statistical properties of the proposed methods are analysed through a Monte Carlo study and compared with alternative available methods. Empirical results on NYSE returns show that exact confidence sets are very different from asymptotic ones, and allowing for non-Gaussian distributions affects inference results. Simulation and empirical evidence suggests that likelihood-ratio-type statistics-with p-values corrected using the Maximized Monte Carlo test method-are generally preferable to their multivariate Fieller-Hotelling-HAC counterparts from the viewpoints of size control and power.","[Beaulieu, Marie-Claude] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Dufour, Jean-Marie] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Khalaf, Lynda] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Laval University; McGill University; Carleton University,"Beaulieu, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,,,,,,,74,32,33,1,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The model does not employ large support, special regressor, or control function restrictions; indeed, it is silent about the process that delivers values of endogenous explanatory variables, and in this respect it is incomplete. Instead, the model employs instrumental variable restrictions that require the existence of instrumental variables that are excluded from latent utilities and distributed independently of the unobserved components of utilities. We show that the model delivers set identification of latent utility functions and the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity, and we characterize sharp bounds on these objects. We develop easy-to-compute outer regions that, in parametric models, require little more calculation than what is involved in a conventional maximum likelihood analysis. The results are illustrated using a model that is essentially the conditional logit model of McFadden (1974), but with potentially endogenous explanatory variables and instrumental variable restrictions. The method employed has wide applicability and for the first time brings instrumental variable methods to bear on structural models in which there are multiple unobservables in a structural equation.","[Chesher, Andrew; Rosen, Adam M.] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Chesher, A (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England.",andrew.chesher@ucl.ac.uk; adam.rosen@ucl.ac.uk; konrad_s@ifs.org.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1, ES/F015879/1, ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1, ES/F015879/1, ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,51,24,28,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The present study is based on the experience of members of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD-DAC). It supports previous findings related to the United States and shows that the influence of domestic poverty on donor decision-making regarding the foreign aid budget is shared by other countries, strengthening support for the povertyaid relationship. However, this positive result refers to only half of the sample considered and an opposite relationship can be detected in a few other cases.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"De Matteis, A (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",a.de-matteis@uea.ac.uk,,"de matteis, alessandro/0000-0003-1903-1440",,,,,11,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We use annual hospital discharge data to investigate whether CAP laws are associated with decreased nonfatal gun injuries. Results from Poisson regressions that control for various hospital, county, and state characteristics, including state-specific fixed effects and time trends, indicate that CAP laws are associated with reductions in nonfatal gun injuries among children under age 18.

Individuals derive utility from the pure Veblen good based solely on how much they consume relative to others. In equilibrium, consumption of the pure Veblen good is the same for everyone, so the Veblen good contributes nothing to utility. Hence, resources devoted to the Veblen good provide us with a measure of deadweight loss. We ask: Under what preference conditions does the proportion of productive capacity devoted to the pure Veblen good increase as an economy becomes more affluent? In a relatively general preference framework we derive a sufficient condition for which the Veblen good crowds out standard forms of consumption and leisure, resulting in an inverse relationship between affluence and utility. With additional structure on the model we are able to fully characterize the behavior of deadweight loss and utility as an economy becomes more affluent. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The stock markets exhibit asymmetry in the conditional variances and to a certain extent in the conditional correlations as well, pointing to the importance of applying a sufficiently flexible econometric framework.

The two financial regimes are: (i) an investment demand constraint regime; and (ii) a bank liquidity trap regime. The time adjustment of output and inflation given a change in mark-up lending rate and monetary easing depends on the financial regime in which the economy finds itself. Adjustments owing to stochastic output shocks do not depend on the financial regime.

This question focuses on relative stability, but can be a sceptical or contrarian form. From a realist perspective, any stability expressed in events as regularity is highly conditional. As such, underlying the question form is an invitation to explore the instability or vulnerability of order with a view to the ways that order might break down.

Furthermore, considering the asymmetric effects of the portfolio flows, we have generally found a direct and strong relation between the net positive flows and the degree of informational efficiency. Our panel results also show that market capitalization represents a significant explanatory factor for the presence of short run dependence, while liquidity is associated with the presence of long run dependence.

Although true, the deeper determining forces of wage stagnation and dramatically increasing inequality in the USA over the preceding 35 years have received less notice. Wage stagnation and heightened inequality generated three dynamics that made the economy vulnerable to systemic dysfunction. First, consumption was constrained, reducing profitable investment potential in the real economy and encouraging an ever-wealthier elite to flood financial markets with credit, helping keep interest rates low, stimulating the creation of new credit instruments, greater indebtedness and speculation. The second dynamic is that consumption externalities were generated, forcing households to struggle harder to maintain the welfare of their families and their relative social status, resulting in plummeting household saving, ever-greater indebtedness and longer work hours. The third dynamic is that as the rich took larger shares of income and wealth, they gained more command over ideology and hence politics, resulting in tax cuts for the rich, reduced welfare for the poor and deregulation.","[Wisman, Jon D.] American Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Wisman, JD (通讯作者)，American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",jdwisma@american.edu,,"Wisman, Jon D./0000-0001-7563-3150",,,,,132,95,112,0,73,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The novelty of the model is that it allows not only for endogenous labour supply but also for the intersectoral allocation of resources, which may together lead to indeterminacy.

This departs from the tradition of computing the optimal tax rate when households suffer from some type of behavioral bias yet possess the ability to solve dynamic optimization problems.

First, we describe some new empirical evidence on informality, the formal/informal wage gap and trade openness in Latin American countries. Then we present a simple model characterized by three (empirically based) assumptions: (1) agents consume both formal and informal goods; (2) the government uses tariff revenues to purchase formal goods; (3) informality is a voluntary phenomenon. The model predicts that tariff reduction increases informality and wage inequality and that the maximization of income requires a positive level of tariff protection.

The effects were estimated with gravity models using alternative techniques to check for robustness. Freight forwarders provided information on freight charges (price), average duration of shipment (time) and variability in time. The new transportation variables and the more commonly used distance variable appear to have smaller effects overall than some previous research indicated, although our distance coefficient is identical to that of Coulibaly and Fotagne for West Africa. In contrast to other research critical of distance as a proxy for transport impediments, we find similar effects from distance and our measure of transport time, but both of these variables have significantly larger coefficients than price and variability. Landlocked ESA countries are twice as dependent on trade as the whole region after accounting for control variables, but they are not significantly more affected by changes in price and time, and they are less affected by distance and variability. The relative size of the time coefficients suggests that measures to lessen delays in shipping, for instance, faster border clearance, might encourage more trade than cost cutting measures that lowered price proportionately.","[Cook, Peter] Nathan Associates, Olympia, WA USA; [Sattayanuwat, Wanasin] Srinakharinwirot Univ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",Srinakharinwirot University,,cmacphee@unl.edu; pcook99@hotmail.com; wanasin@yahoo.com,,,,,,,59,0,1,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

This paper uses a novel identification strategy and data from birth and administrative records over 2005-2009 to provide causal estimates of the effects of geographic access to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). My empirical approach uses within-ZIP-code variation in WIC clinic presence together with maternal fixed effects, and accounts for the potential endogeneity of mobility, gestational-age bias, and measurement error in gestation. I find that access to WIC increases food benefit take-up, pregnancy weight gain, birth weight, and the probability of breastfeeding initiation at the time of hospital discharge. The estimated effects are strongest for mothers with a high school education or less, who are most likely eligible for WIC services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A growing body of new empirical work focuses on the measurement and estimation of the effects of historical variables on contemporary income by explicitly taking into account the ancestral composition of current populations. The evidence suggests that economic development is affected by traits that have been transmitted across generations over the very long run. This article surveys this new literature and provides a framework to discuss different channels through which intergenerationally transmitted characteristics may impact economic development, biologically (via genetic or epigenetic transmission) and culturally (via behavioral or symbolic transmission). An important issue is whether historically transmitted traits have affected development through their direct impact on productivity, or have operated indirectly as barriers to the diffusion of productivity-enhancing innovations across populations.","[Spolaore, Enrico] Tufts Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Wacziarg, Romain] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Natl Bur Econ Res, Los Angeles, CA USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Tufts University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Spolaore, E (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",,"Wacziarg, Romain/F-1110-2011","Wacziarg, Romain/0000-0002-2394-7593",,,,,130,316,350,3,143,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

We estimate identically specified empirical models using comparable enterprise data from France, Germany, and the UK. Our findings show that exporters are on average more productive and pay higher wages in all three countries. However, results for profitability differ across borders, where profitability of exporters is significantly smaller in Germany, significantly larger in France, and does not differ significantly in the UK. The results for wages and productivity hold in the years before firms start exporting, which indicates self-selection into exporting of more productive services firms that pay higher wages. The surprising finding of self-selection of less profitable German services firms into exporting does not show up among firms from France and the UK. In all three countries we do not find evidence for positive effects of exporting on firm performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

I apply a dynamic factor model borrowed from business cycle analysis that for the first time allows me to fully exploit the cross-sectional and time-series dimensions of my large wheat price data set. It treats national and international market integration as conditional, and provides unique evidence on the integration of single cities as well as of countries and country groups. Three main results emerge from this: (i) The strongest push toward globalization happened in the first half of the century, not the second. This contradicts conventional wisdom emphasizing a transport revolution after 1850. (ii) After 1880, protectionist countries experienced a globalization backlash despite their well-developed transportation networks. (iii) National differences matter even when controlling for geography and trade policy. Some countries integrated domestically after some single cities, while others first developed a well-functioning domestic market and then globalized as a nation. The latter coincide with countries that have a long history as a unified nation.

Despite the fact that the European Union (EU) represents a historical experiment of a region of gradually strengthening internationalization, a wide range of EU studies reject the convergence hypothesis, showing an unclear development of standard deviation in time. Many of the studies find that something went wrong in the 1980s, yet they describe it as the result of a temporary effect. In the present paper, we show that the puzzle of the 1980s is not a short-term break in a continuous trend, but a complete alteration of the process, a structural shift toward a persisting period of continuous divergence! The previous trend of closing the gap among the member countries was reversed completely: in 2010, the coefficient of variation returned to higher levels than those of 1960. Second, all previous gains of labor vanished: in the period 1980-2005, real wages lost about 35 percent against per capita gross domestic product (GDP). The empirical findings we provide support our main suspicion: apart from confirming the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) observation of growing and persisting inequality in all Western economies, the gradual transition of the European free trade area into an economic and monetary union, accompanied by the prevalence of a specific policy, explains the prevalence of a period of deepening divergence since the beginning of the 1980s.","[Zarotiadis, Grigoris] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Zarotiadis, G (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece.",,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

If a number of country characteristics are held constant, then regression results indicate that the impact effects from an increase in average inflation by 10 percentage points per year are a reduction of the growth rate of real per capita GDP by 0.2-0.3 percentage points per year and a decrease in the ratio of investment to GDP by 0.4-0.6 percentage points. Since the statistical procedures use plausible instruments for inflation, there is some reason to believe that these relations reflect causal influences from inflation to growth and investment. However, statistically significant results emerge only when high-inflation experiences are included in the sample. Although the adverse influence of inflation on growth looks small, the long-term effects on standards of living are substantial. For example, a shift in monetary policy that raises the long-term average inflation rate by 10 percentage points per year is estimated to lower the level of real GDP after 30 years by 4-7%, more than enough to justify a strong interest in price stability.","[Barro, Robert J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 120, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Barro, Robert J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Barro, RJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 120, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,22,50,50,3,23,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

This paper develops a political economy model of trade policy under imperfect competition to provide a positive explanation for the prevalence of free trade areas. In a three-country setting, a representative from each prospective member is elected to determine the tariffs to be applied on imported goods. Under a customs union, the necessity to coordinate tariffs leads voters to strategically delegate power to more protectionist representatives. We show that strategic delegation may imply that free trade areas increase the prospective member countries' welfare compared to customs unions. Moreover, the model also indicates conditions under which free trade areas are more likely to be politically viable than customs unions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Through simulations, we demonstrate the superiority of the bootstrap procedure in the sense that it can yield desirable size and power properties for the CPT tests when the Akaike's information criterion is used. Moreover, we show the empirical relevance of the bootstrap tests by applying them to inflation in the G-10 countries, and then obtain strong evidence against the unit root hypothesis for most countries at the 5% significance level.","[Lee, Cheng-Feng] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Kaohsiung 80778, Taiwan; [Tsong, Ching-Chuan] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Puli, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Chi Nan University,"Lee, CF (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, 415 Jiangong Rd, Kaohsiung 80778, Taiwan.",jflee@cc.kuas.edu.tw,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

As markets might fail to solve simultaneously those two problems, we construct instead a simple menu of options that trades off the provision of incentives for participating countries and the provision of incentives to participate. With such a mechanism, all countries voluntarily contribute to a fund, although at different intensities, but only the most efficient ones effectively reduce their pollution below its `business as usual' level.","[Martimort, David] Paris Sch Econ EHESS, Paris, France; [Sand-Zantman, Wilfried] GREMAQ IDEI, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Paris School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Martimort, D (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ EHESS, Paris, France.",euwsandz@tse-fr.eu,,"Sand-Zantman, Wilfried/0000-0002-7177-9117",,,,,20,12,12,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We analyze the profit-maximizing recommendation policies of such monitors. In an infinitely repeated game with seller moral hazard and short-lived consumers, a monopolistic monitor with superior information about the seller's past effort decisions sells recommendations about the seller to consumers. We show that the monitor has an incentive to make its recommendations hard to predict, which in general leads to inefficient effort provision by the seller. These results hold under perfect and imperfect monitoring and in a variety of informational setting. When there are multiple competing sellers, the conflict between the monitor's profit-maximization objective and efficient effort provision is mitigated. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Insulation levels vary across the houses in our sample because standard practice in New Zealand was to build houses with no thermal insulation prior to implementation of insulation standards in 1978, and the extent of insulation retrofits varies across the sample. The estimated premium on an otherwise similar house insulated to code levels exceeds the cost of installation at construction: insulating to basic code levels at construction passes the market test.

We study an economy composed of four groups of agents (capitalists, unemployed people, low- and high-skilled workers), each one represented by a politician. Politicians first form political parties and then compete in a winner-takes-all election by simultaneously proposing policy bundles composed of an employment protection level and an unemployment benefit. We first show that, in the absence of parties (i.e., in a citizen-candidate model), low-skilled workers are decisive and support a maximum employment protection level together with some unemployment benefit. We then obtain that, under some conditions, allowing for party formation results in all policy equilibria belonging to the Pareto set of the coalition formed by high-skilled workers together with unemployed people.

In our model, investments in the construction sector allow for higher leverage than investments in the non-durable consumption goods sector. When borrowing constraints bind in both sectors, unit returns in the construction sector are lower due to a positive pledgeability premium, and changes in interest rates have a non-monotonic effect in the sectoral composition of investment. Specifically, a fall in interest rates triggers a relative rise in investment in the consumption goods sector when rates are relatively high, whereas the opposite effect obtains when rates are sufficiently low.

In a panel covering 110 (4-digit) NACE industries from 1995 to 2008, instrumental variable estimations document that LWC import competition is associated with strong price effects. More specifically, when Chinese and other Asian LWC exporters capture 1% of a European market, producer prices decrease by about 3%. Next, decomposing the mechanisms that underlie the LWC price effect on European industry, we show that import competition has a pronounced effect on average productivity and only a muted effect on wages. Owing to the exit of firms and the increase in productivity, LWC import competition is shown to have substantially reduced employment in the European manufacturing sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of 1504 fixed capital investment decisions by Japanese multinational firms confirms the prediction that investment is determined not only by total factor productivity, effective demand, and wage levels in the host country, but also by wage levels in other countries in which the firm operates.","[Belderbos, Rene] Belgium Maastricht Univ, Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium; [Belderbos, Rene] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Fukao, Kyoji] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Ito, Keiko] Senshu Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Letterie, Wilko] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",KU Leuven; Maastricht University; Hitotsubashi University; Maastricht University,"Belderbos, R (通讯作者)，Belgium Maastricht Univ, Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium.",,"Ito, Keiko/AAA-6255-2019","Ito, Keiko/0000-0002-2162-2517; Fukao, Kyoji/0000-0002-9471-6653",,,,,53,7,7,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2013,80,318,,,,,274,299,,10.1111/ecca.12014,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,107ID,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316208300004,0

Individual productivity evolves as a Markov process and is private information. We use a first-order approach in discrete and continuous time and obtain novel theoretical and numerical results. Our main contribution is a formula describing the dynamics for the labour-income tax rate. When productivity is an AR(1) our formula resembles an AR(1) with a trend where: (i) the auto-regressive coefficient equals that of productivity; (ii) the trend term equals the covariance productivity with consumption growth divided by the Frisch elasticity of labour; and (iii) the innovations in the tax rate are the negative of consumption growth. The last property implies a form of short-run regressivity. Our simulations illustrate these results and deliver some novel insights. The average labour tax rises from 0% to 37% over 40 years, whereas the average tax on savings falls from 12% to 0% at retirement. We compare the second best solution to simple history-independent tax systems, calibrated to mimic these average tax rates. We find that age-dependent taxes capture a sizable fraction of the welfare gains. In this way, our theoretical results provide insights into simple tax systems.","[Farhi, Emmanuel] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Werning, Ivan] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Farhi, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1062009] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1062007] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,42,85,105,2,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

To address this deficiency, we use the International Social Survey Programme 1998 data on 25,000 individuals from 26 countries to investigate the impact of relative income position on three facets of social capital: horizontal and vertical trust as well as norm compliance. Testing relative deprivation theory, we identify a deleterious positional income effect for persons below the reference income, particularly for their social trust and confidence in secular institutions. Also often a social capital-lowering effect of relative income advantage occurs, while a rise in absolute income almost always contributes positively. These results indicate that a rise in income inequality in a society too large is rather detrimental to the formation of social capital.","[Fischer, Justina A.

We study both the market equilibrium and the social planner allocation in this economy. Investigating the model for its implications on economic growth we find: (i) in the long run, a balanced growth path requires that the returns to radical innovations are at least as large as those of the incremental ones; (ii) the transition need not be monotonic.

In this paper, we suggest that such information could be used to characterize both the size of the digital economy and outsourcing at country level. We analyse the topological structure of the network of trade in digital services (trade in bits) and compare it with the more traditional flow of manufactured goods across countries. To perform meaningful comparisons across networks with different characteristics, we define a stochastic benchmark for the number of connections among each country-pair, based on hypergeometric distribution. Original data are filtered so that we only focus on the strongest, i.e. statistically significant, links. We find that trade in bits displays a sparser and less hierarchical network structure, which is more similar to trade in high-skill manufactured goods than total trade. Moreover, distance plays a more prominent role in shaping the network of international trade in physical goods than trade in digital services.","[Riccaboni, Massimo] IMT Sch Adv Studies, LIME, Lucca, Italy; [Riccaboni, Massimo] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Stategy & Innovat, Louvain, Belgium; [Rossi, Alessandro] Univ Trento, DISA, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Schiavo, Stefano] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Schiavo, Stefano] OFCE DRIC, Valbonne, France",IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; KU Leuven; University of Trento; University of Trento,"Schiavo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",m.riccaboni@imtlucca.it; alessandro.rossi@unitn.it; stefano.schiavo@unitn.it,"Riccaboni, Massimo/D-4102-2009; SCHIAVO, Stefano/B-6147-2012; Rossi, Alessandro/F-4462-2012","SCHIAVO, Stefano/0000-0001-9740-5167; RICCABONI, Massimo/0000-0003-4979-8933; Rossi, Alessandro/0000-0002-2226-2146",,,,,53,16,17,3,47,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

An important limitation of this literature is the relative paucity of modern econometric investigations of the behavior of the rate of profit. The central objective of this paper is to remedy this lacuna. We investigate the properties of the profit rate series utilizing the methods of time series econometrics. The evidence suggests that the rate of profit is non-stationary. We also specify a test of Marx's law of the tendential fall in the rate of profit with a novel econometric model that explicitly accounts for the counter-tendencies and their time series properties.

Recent theories call for new portfolio facts beyond equity home bias. We present new evidence on cross-border asset holdings across different types of assets: equities, bonds and bank lending and new micro data on institutional holdings of equity at the fund level.

Consistent with the existing literature, a polynomial fixed effects model is first presented. Then, a logistic Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) is estimated, obtaining income elasticities. This empirical study yields several important findings. The nexus between water withdrawal per person and per capita GDP is non-linear, showing a peculiar inverted-U with a marked downward limb that dominates the nexus, regardless of the estimation method chosen. On the whole, water use income elasticity clearly decreases throughout the period; nevertheless it exhibits a great variability over the sample, reflecting the divergent patterns of water use depending on the level of income of each country and the time period.

The author has used statistical and soft computing methods to program the prediction models. It compares the effectiveness of twelve different early warning models for forecasting the bankruptcy risk of companies. In the research conducted, the author used data on 185 companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and 60 companies listed on Stock Exchange markets in Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Chile. This population of firms was divided into learning and testing setdata. Each company was analyzed using the absolute values of 14 financial ratios and the dynamics of change of these ratios. The author's developed models are characterized by high efficiency. These studies are one of the world's first attempts at comparing differences in forecasting this phenomenon between the regions of Latin America and Central Europe. Additionally, a comparison of the effectiveness of discriminant analysis, decisional trees, and artificial neural networks models was made. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the data reveals that in most cases (and increasingly so in the 2000s) intervention has been aimed at limiting appreciations rather than depreciations, often motivated by the neo-mercantilist view of a depreciated real exchange rate as protection for domestic industries. As a first step to address the broader question of whether this view delivers on its promise, we examine whether this fear of appreciation has a positive impact on growth performance in developing economies. We show that depreciated exchange rates indeed lead to higher growth, but that the effect, rather than through import substitution or export booms as argued by the mercantilist view, works largely through the deepening of domestic savings and capital accumulation.

Because most developing countries cannot justify the expense of frequent household budget surveys, additional low-cost methods have been developed and used. The prediction method is based on a model linking the proportion of poor households to suitable explanatory variables (consumption proxies). These consumption proxies are variables that can be collected at much lower cost through smaller annual surveys. Several applications have shown that such models can produce poverty estimates with confidence intervals of a similar magnitude to the poverty estimates from the household budget surveys. There is, however, limited evidence of how well the methods perform out-of-sample. A series of seven household budget surveys conducted in Uganda in the period 19932005 allows us to test the prediction performance of the model. We test the poverty models by using data from one survey to predict the proportion of poor households in other surveys, and vice versa. The results are encouraging, as all models predict similar poverty trends. Although in most cases the predictions are precise, sometimes they differ significantly from the poverty level estimated from the survey directly.","Stat Norway, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Mathiassen, A (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Pb 8131 Dep, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",Astrid.Mathiassen@ssb.no,,,,,,,23,14,15,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.
