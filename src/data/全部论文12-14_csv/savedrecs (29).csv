The rationale for this analysis was to assess the interaction dynamics between a specific HIV/AIDS intervention and an area of implementation and the effects of these dynamics on the cost-effectiveness of such an HIV/AIDS intervention. A pair of Markov models was evaluated for each intervention; one model for a HPA and another for an LPA and the cost-effectiveness of that intervention was compared across an LPA and a HPA. The baseline costs and health outcomes in each area were collected from the literature. To depict interaction dynamics between an HIV/AIDS intervention and an area of implementation, baseline health outcomes collected in each area, were adjusted over time based on the patterns of the projections observed in the AIDS model of the Actuarial Society of South Africa (ASSA2008). The study found that the VCT and treatment of STDs were equally cost-effective in an LPA and in a HPA while PMTCT and HAART were more cost-effective in an LPA than in a HPA. As a policy proposal, resources earmarked to non-ARV based interventions (VCT and treatment of STDs) should be equally shared across an LPA and a HPA while more of the resources reserved for ARV-based interventions (PMTCT and HAART) should go in an LPA in order to increase efficiency.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mbonigaba, J (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa.",,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,7,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Where listed companies are owned by so many shareholders that their diffused shareholding results in negligible control over the directors who manage the assets of the company, it is likely that the directors will manage and direct the company to maximise their self-interest to the detriment of the interest of the shareholders. The separation of ownership and control and the maximisation of self-interest are central themes in the agency theory. Researching their validity in a South African context where the market is less liquid and the stock exchange is significantly smaller can add a valuable contribution to the continuing debate on corporate governance in the country. The article analyses 186 listed South African companies using data extracted over four years to test whether there is separation of ownership and control and whether such separation leads to the maximisation of self-interest. Data were extracted for the years 2005 and 2006, using the shareholding in 2006 to determine control, and for the years 2009 and 2010, using the shareholding in 2010 to determine control. Directors' remuneration as a percentage of assets was used as a proxy for the maximisation of directors' interest, and profit attributable to shareholders as a percentage of assets was used as a proxy for the maximisation of shareholders' interest. These proxies were used to test the impact of control during the two controlling periods, namely 2006 and 2010. The article finds that the majority of listed companies in South Africa are controlled by a dominant shareholder. However, there are still a significant number of companies where the directors have de facto control. Contrary to the expectation that companies controlled by directors will aim to maximise directors' remuneration, or companies controlled by shareholders will aim to maximise profit attributable to shareholders, this article finds the opposite to be true. This is possibly an indication that the controlling parties might consider factors other than their direct financial self-interest, or that there is an inherent cost associated with control.","[Steyn, Blanche] Sch Business & Econ, Monash, South Africa; [Stainbank, Lesley] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Steyn, B (通讯作者)，Sch Business & Econ, Monash, South Africa.",,"Stainbank, Lesley J/N-5151-2013; Steyn, Blanche/AAH-8689-2021","Stainbank, Lesley J/0000-0002-4526-091X; Steyn, Blanche/0000-0003-0632-6346",,,,,39,5,8,0,9,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We find that an increase in road capacity or increasing tolls by a chain may increase its port's profit and reduce the rival port's profit. As a consequence, roads are tolled above the marginal external congestion costs, provided that the value-of-time of shippers is sufficiently large relative to that of commuters. When a discriminative toll system is implemented, commuters are tolled at the marginal external congestion costs while truck tolls are much lower. The case of ports' maximising welfare is examined, and the results compared with those of price competition.","[Wan, Yulai] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Wan, YL (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",yulai.wan@sauder.ubc.ca; anming.zhang@sauder.ubc.ca,,"Wan, Yulai/0000-0002-5743-0509; Zhang, Anming/0000-0002-9457-8414",,,,,31,49,56,0,12,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Proponents of an active investment management strategy believe that capital markets are inefficient, and therefore it should be possible to achieve above-average risk-adjusted returns via stock selection and/or timing. On the other hand, passive investment managers do not believe in such opportunities. Next to diverse empirical quantitative studies, there are developed some theories that can support a passive investment strategy by a distinct sequence of logical arguments. Aim of the depiction is to elaborate these existing theories and create a better understanding of employing passive investment management strategies. The paper presents these theories and evaluates their utility for an application of a passive investment approach. Altogether, five specific qualitative arguments could be found which are eligible to be a theoretical proponent for passive portfolio management. The validity to the active versus passive debate is critical interpreted. The novelty is that the detected research models are able to find an adequate answer to the question which investment style is preferable under diverse presumptions by the methodology of a qualitative approach. Other studies often employ tests with success-measurement figures. The weakness of these single quantitative scientific models is their reference only to the past. With the help of an entire qualitative theory, the commitment to one of the above mentioned basic investment strategies can receive a more profound appreciation. The research is embedded in view of the fact that public pension schemes will not be able to guarantee an adequate living standard for the coming pensioners in Europe. The result is that some of the presented theories are indeed very suitable to gain a sophisticated decision for a special investment approach, although some assumptions are not fully congruent with the reality on worldwide financial markets.","[Wingenfeld, Jens] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,jens_wingenfeld@hotmail.com,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,670,680,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100064,0

This study aims to address this gap, first, by proposing a typology of companies based on their perceptions of customers' environmental activeness and deterrents and, second, by analyzing the differences among the obtained groups of companies in their environmental strategies and the motives for and results of these strategies. The paper covers a conceptual background of environmental strategies, the motives for and results of these strategies, and managerial perceptions of customers' environmental activeness and deterrents. The study included all manufacturing companies with more than 50 employees from a business directory in Slovenia. It was administered via mail to 434 CEOs, out of which 153 returned the questionnaires (a 35.3 % response rate). The sample is representative of a population of medium sized and large manufacturing companies from 22 different manufacturing industries, including practically all large polluters in the country. Factor analysis was used for the data reduction/summarization and cluster analysis was performed to identify company segments according to their perceptions of customers' environmental activeness and deterrents. The typology of companies based on managerial perceptions of customers' environmental activeness and deterrents is proposed, and the differences among the obtained clusters in their environmental strategies, motives and results are analyzed. The findings show that three clusters of companies exist, namely eco-believers, eco-disbelievers and eco-hampered companies. These clusters significantly differ in their perceptions of customers' eco-characteristics as well as in their corporate and marketing environmental strategies and the motives and results of these strategies.","[Zabkar, Vesna; Bajde, Domen; Cater, Barbara] Univ Ljubljana, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia; [Cater, Tomaz] Univ Ljubljana, Dept Management, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana,"Zabkar, V (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",vesna.zabkar@ef.uni-lj.si; tomaz.cater@ef.uni-lj.si; domen.bajde@ef.uni-lj.si; barbara.cater@ef.uni-lj.si,"Zabkar, Vesna/H-7030-2018; Bajde, Domen/ITW-2715-2023; Cater, Babara/V-4803-2019","Zabkar, Vesna/0000-0002-9331-9090; Bajde, Domen/0000-0001-7135-6897;",,,,,71,6,6,0,16,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Econometric models for panel data with CO2 emissions as the dependent variable and four different types of macroeconomic aggregates are employed in the study. The EU-27 data used in the study supports the hypothesis of the EKC. As the EU countries are heterogeneous, the countries are further classified into rich and poor (according to the level of their GDP), and further analyses are performed. Considering the rich EU countries the EKC hypothesis holds, but if the poor EU countries are taken into account, the coefficient of the quadratic regressor is positive which relates to the traditional U-shaped curve, not the inverted one. Such a finding is still not in contradiction to the EKC hypothesis, as it assumes that at the low level of economic output, as the development progresses, the emissions increase. The estimated value of the EKC turning point is 19 660 USD (constant 2000 USD) which has not been reached by the poor EU countries yet. As for the position of Slovakia and the Czech Republic in the EU, the results are not unambiguous. The CO2 emissions have been decreasing very slightly in both countries since 1992 (with 1.33 percent mean annual rate of decrease in Slovakia and 1.16 percent mean annual rate of decrease in the Czech Republic). The GDP per unit of energy use (constant 2005 PPP USD per kg of oil equivalent) increased from 3.15 USD to 6.33 USD in Slovakia between 1990 and 2010 (i.e. 3.54 percent mean annual growth rate).

This paper reports findings from a similar experiment conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a larger sample, focusing on mode switching differences between the two experiments. Whereas none of the Swiss participants switched, about 30% of MIT participants switched to public transportation after the intervention (or treatment). An analysis of the underlying reasons for these differences is presented, including individual socio-demographic factors, travel attributes and institutional transportation policies, experiment context, social influences, and psychological variables. The individual and behavioral variables are compared between those who switched to public transportation and those who did not, and pre- to post-treatment changes are analyzed. Those who switched to public transportation were more predisposed to switching, were more cost-conscious, and had more favorable perceptions and attitudes towards public transportation. Those who did not switch became happier with their cars. Implications for mode switching policies employing free public transportation tickets and for institutional transportation policies are drawn.

Area-oriented planning - apparent in various gradations from landscaping, context-sensitive design, area-oriented approaches to integrated area-development - is expected to better incorporate the complex array of needs, demands and opportunities of the area surrounding newly planned road infrastructure. The integration of infrastructure and other spatial policy sectors such as housing, business, water, nature and recreation is expected to lead to better, more sustainable road infrastructure development. This paper explores the shift from line-oriented planning towards area-oriented planning. We conducted a historical analysis of policy developments in Dutch road infrastructure planning and have conceptualized area-oriented approaches in road infrastructure planning. Furthermore, the developments observed in the Netherlands are placed in an international perspective, through an overview of developments and practices in several Western countries.

Several of them show greater support for liberalization than found among economists at large. This is offered as evidence of what I call the forsaken-liberty syndrome.

This paper draws on recent contributions by the authors that accommodate the attitude towards risk within a non-linear utility specification as a preferred framework within which to value travel time savings. The interest in the non-linear form is motivated by the evidence in Hensher et al. (2011) that mean estimates of VTTS in a proposed toll road context are significantly lower when account is taken of risk attitude. The percentage reduction in the estimate of mean VTTS is approximately (coincidentally) equal to the actual percentage error in traffic forecasts associated with the new tollroad two years after opening. If we could show that this evidence of a lower mean estimate under the non-linear treatment is found in other data settings, then we gain confidence in suggesting that the linear-utility assumption to valuing travel time savings might be a potential contributor to over-predicted tollroad traffic forecasts. The non-linear model is applied herein to two other tollroad choice data sets and we find that sampled car commuters tend to be risk taking when decision making is subject to risk (due to the presence of variability in travel times). The model produces lower mean VTTS estimates than the traditional (linear) model, providing additional evidence of a systematic over-prediction of VTTS under the linear assumption. This paper suggests that future empirical studies on valuing time savings (and variability) should address the attitude towards risk. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Stock market volatility matters because stock markets are an integral part of the financial architecture in market economies and play a key role in channelling funds from savers to investors. The focus of this paper is on forecasting stock market volatility in Central and East European (CEE) countries. The obvious question to pose, therefore, is how volatility can be forecast and whether one technique consistently outperforms other techniques. Over the years a variety of techniques have been developed, ranging from the relatively simple to the more complex conditional heteroscedastic models of the GARCH family. In this paper we test the predictive power of 12 models to forecast volatility in the CEE countries. Our results confirm that models which allow for asymmetric volatility consistently outperform all other models considered.

A right of first refusal entitles the right-holder to purchase a subject asset on the same terms as those accepted by a third party. A right of first offer requires a seller to first offer the right-holder to buy a subject asset and prohibits the seller from subsequently selling the asset to a third party on better terms than those offered to the right-holder. We examine when and how such rights yield benefits to, or impose costs, on the right-holder and the seller. We show that a right of first refusal transfers value from other buyers to the right-holder, but may also force the seller to make suboptimal offers. A right of first offer induces the seller to lower his first-period offer, which will tend to increase the net surplus to the seller and right-holder, but also forces the seller to make suboptimal subsequent offers. We find conditions under which it is in the ex ante interest of the seller and the right-holder to contract for a right of first refusal or a right of first offer, respectively.

Both communities have also shown a strong interest in knowledge and 'knowledge bases'. Considering architecture to be based on symbolic and synthetic knowledge, and engineering to be based on analytical and synthetic knowledge, and using a panel dataset, this article examines the different geographies of performance among architecture practices and engineering consultancies active in the UK construction industry. We find that architecture practices are significantly more concentrated in inner London, whereas the engineering consultancies are much more dispersed. Locating in inner London provides significant financial benefits to architects but not to engineers. Ultimately, the various drivers of performance are rather different, with a Christallerian logic applying to architects but not to engineers. We consider that different knowledge bases are fundamental to understanding these differences between architects and engineers and KIBS/PSFs more generally.","[Tether, Bruce S.; Li, Qian Cher; Mina, Andrea] Univ Cambridge, UK IRC, London, England; [Tether, Bruce S.; Li, Qian Cher; Mina, Andrea] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London, England; [Tether, Bruce S.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Tether, Bruce S.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Li, Qian Cher] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Imperial Coll Business Sch, Innovat & Entrepreneurship Grp, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Mina, Andrea] Judge Business Sch, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",University of Cambridge; Imperial College London; University of Manchester; University of Manchester; Imperial College London; University of Cambridge,"Tether, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, UK IRC, London, England.",bruce.tether@mbs.ac.uk; cher.li@imperial.ac.uk; a.mina@cbr.cam.ac.uk,,"Tether, Bruce/0000-0003-2858-4805; Li, Qian Cher/0000-0002-6524-161X",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G042993/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G042993/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,127,37,44,1,92,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

While access and disclosure remedies have been a part of antitrust law since the very earliest days of the Sherman Act, they have become a vital part of litigated cases and settlements only recently in both the United States and the European Union. This has been particularly true for cases involving network industries, telecommunications, broadcasting, software platforms, and other high-technology industries at the forefront of antitrust enforcement. Interestingly, these cases and settlements constitute an informal revival of the essential facilities doctrine and an acknowledgement that the doctrine (and its equivalents) remain an important and needed part of the antitrust toolkit. This article will examine the growing use of complex behavioral remedies in both merger and monopolization cases, which suggest antitrust enforcement has moved far beyond any stated preference for structural remedies. Among the examples I use are the Microsoft and Intel litigation in the United States and the European Union, as well as more recent merger consent decrees involving Google-ITA, Comcast-Universal, and Livenation-Ticketmaster to illustrate these important changes in competition law enforcement and what they portend for the future.","Loyola Univ Chicago Sch Law, Inst Consumer Antitrust Studies, Chicago, IL 60626 USA",Loyola University Chicago,"Waller, SW (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Chicago Sch Law, Inst Consumer Antitrust Studies, Chicago, IL 60626 USA.",swalle1@luc.edu,,,,,,,31,10,10,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Sample selection makes it difficult to obtain valid proxies for severity; for instance, I expect severity to be positively related to the prosecutor's decision to indict, to indict in federal court (versus state court), and to try the suspect. Theoretical and empirical findings indicate that in samples containing only indicted, convicted, or tried suspects, reasonable proxies for severity may be negatively related to actual severity. The assignment of defendants to judges randomizes the severity of punishment in a manner that is unrelated to sample selection. Thus, by examining the effect of these assignments, I find that a 10-month increase in prison sentences raises trial rates by 1 percentage point.","Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA",Rice University,"Boylan, RT (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",,,,,,,,37,6,11,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

In order to rely on a combination of several insights and instruments to achieve this goal this study includes the vision of different stakeholders on a transition to more environmentally friendly vehicles in Belgium. Based on this vision, two policy scenarios were developed and the impact of each scenario was evaluated in terms of the resulting vehicle fleet composition, vehicle kilometres and emissions. Further, the well-towheel environmental impact of the vehicles in the fleet was assessed by means of the 'Ecoscore' indicator. Results in this paper demonstrate that a significant technological change and reduction of the environmental impact of transport in the future can only be obtained in a very ambitious policy scenario including measures like the introduction of a kilometre charge, the support of subsidies to replace older cars and the use of a well-to-wheel environmental indicator to define a clean vehicle. Introducing a package of measures that is accepted by almost all stakeholders tends to result in only small changes compared to a 'business as usual' scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using SLAN (2007) data we estimate the impact on use of general practitioner (GP) services, hospital inpatient and hospital day case services of overweight and obesity. Our modelling approach accommodates potential unobserved heterogeneity associated with utilisation of primary and secondary health care. Controlling for a range of socio-demographic variables, we find that overweight and obesity are significant predictors of GP utilisation and obesity is a significant predictor of inpatient episodes. Translating increased utilisation into costs, primary health-care costs are estimated conservatively to be approximately (sic)17 million higher and secondary health-care costs approximately (sic)24 million higher in the Republic of Ireland as a result of overweight and obesity in adults. Given trends, overweight and obesity are likely to present an increasing challenge to the health service in the future that warrant further investigation.","[Doherty, Edel; O'Neill, Ciaran] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland; [Dee, Anne] Hlth Serv Execut W, Limerick, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"O'Neill, C (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.",ciaran.oneill@nuigalway.ie,"Dee, Anne/AAE-5880-2022","Doherty, Edel/0000-0001-8756-8974",,,,,28,18,18,0,9,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We also find that academic R&D activities increase local human capital levels, suggesting that spillovers from such activities can raise the demand for human capital. Consistent with these results, we show that metropolitan areas with more higher education activity tend to have a larger share of workers in high human capital occupations.

While paradoxically, this project was probably the most controversial, it is now seen as a huge success for all the actors involved. What kind of lessons can we learn from this experience? How may we evaluate the impact of this project on TGV-line planning? How can we characterize this implementation and decision-making process with regard to sustainable development challenges? The construction of the Mediterranean TGV-line was an opportunity to introduce a number of innovations - more dialogue in the decision-making process, more focus on environmental concerns, new project management and technological processes - and this is why it now appears as a showcase example of integrated sustainable development. This paper examines the different kinds of innovations developed during the TGV-Med project by using concepts from the sociology of innovation to understand how these solutions emerged in a controversial situation. Then we analyze the lessons that emerged from this decision-making process (both immediately and subsequently) and the way in which procedures evolved: creation of new tools and devices (public consultation, project management, etc.). Finally, we focus on the impact of these developments on TGV project governance. In particular, new methods of implementation and financing involved a reconfiguration of the system of actors. So the aim of this paper is to define the impact of this reconfiguration on negotiations between stakeholders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Using administrative records and individual survey data spanning the early 1990s to the mid-2000s, we find large positive effects of welfare reform: income gaps in school enrollment and dropout rates narrow by more than 20 percent. Unlike the significant and growing relative gains in the years following state welfare reforms, we find no evidence of relative gains for low-income adolescents in the years preceding the reforms.

The objective of this study is to analyze the channels that transmitted this crisis to the Venezuelan economy. The study is of a descriptive-documentary type, recurring to secondary information sources. Conclusions are that, in the Venezuelan case, from the real channel, decrease in oil prices has a double effect: on one hand, it deteriorates cash flows in the balance of payments and, on the other, the fiscal position. From the financial channel, consequences are shown in the negative evolution taken by sovereign risk perception, with a drop in the net balance of investment in fixed assets coming from the rest of the world.

We find that there is a strong tendency toward market tipping and, subsequently, monopolization, with negative consequences on economic welfare. Therefore, we propose to require search engines to share their data on previous searches.

This paper discusses what conclusions can be drawn from the first five years of operation, until mid-2011. We show that the traffic reduction caused by the charges has increased slightly over time, once external factors are controlled for. Alternative fuel vehicles were exempt from the charges through 2008, and we show that this substantially increased the sales of such vehicles. We discuss public and political acceptability, synthesising recent research and Swedish experience. We conclude that objective and subjective effects on the traffic system, as well as general environmental and political attitudes, formed the basis of the strong public support, while institutional reforms and resolution of power issues were necessary to gain political support.

Unlike the majority of the existing literature, we attempt to tackle endogeneity problems that arise in estimation of the determinants of court output. In addition to controlling for court fixed effects to address endogeneity due to unobserved court-level heterogeneity, an instrumental variables approach based on a plausible assumption of sequential exogeneity of our regressors allows us to address the problem of reverse causality between court output and both caseload and judicial staffing. Our findings suggest that ignoring endogeneity issues may lead to erroneous policy conclusions about the expected impact of resources, as proxied by judicial appointments, devoted to the court system.

I find: (A) Productivity (measured as published opinions per year on the bench) correlates with apparent intellectual ability and effort. The judges who attended the most selective universities, who passed the bar exam most quickly, and who were chosen by the courts for an elite career track publish the most opinions. (B) Adjudicatory speed (measured as time from filing to decision, for published opinions) may correlate with apparent ability and effort too (the evidence is weaker), but institutional experience counts as well.

To do so, we propose, first, an exploratory investigation of the effects of inbound commuter flows on employment in regional labour markets in Germany. Next, we address sustainability issues as a common umbrella for the relationship 'economy-transportation'. In this context, we show that the German production system is faced with negative environmental externalities, which are clearly associated with a specific transport mode, viz, the private car. Negative environmental externalities as a result of modal choices in Germany are confirmed by data from EU-15 countries. Public transport, in particular the train, appears to be more environmentally-benign. Our results bring to light that, on average, commuter flows have a positive and robust effect on employment in the receiving German labour market districts, while, for commuting flows, public transport, especially the train, is a more environmentally-benign mode of transport, compared with the car, in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. In the light of possible policy strategies, the paper argues that sustainability may lead to positive economic effects; in particular, the improvement of the public transport system, which can provide more opportunities for sustainable commuting patterns, may lead to favourable employment perspectives for the local or regional labour force.","[Tedeschi, Federico] Univ Verona, Dept Publ Hlth & Community Med, I-37100 Verona, Italy; [Reggiani, Aura] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy; [Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Verona; University of Bologna; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Tedeschi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Publ Hlth & Community Med, I-37100 Verona, Italy.",federico.tedeschi@univr.it; aura.reggiani@unibo.it; p.nijkamp@vu.nl,,"Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; Reggiani, Aura/0000-0002-8288-2187",,,,,60,0,0,0,21,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

We conducted three years of observations in the derivatives trading room of a major investment bank. We found that traders use models to translate stock prices into estimates of what their rivals think. Traders use these estimates to look out for possible errors in their own models. We found that this practice, reflexive modelling, enhances returns by turning prices into a vehicle for distributed cognition. But it also induces a dangerous form of cognitive interdependence: when enough traders overlook a key issue, their positions give misplaced reassurance to those traders that think similarly, disrupting their reflexive processes. In cases lacking diversity, dissonance thus gives way to resonance. Our analysis demonstrates how practices born in caution can lead to overconfidence and collective failure. We contribute to economic sociology by developing a socio-technical account that grapples with the new forms of sociality introduced by financial models - disembedded yet entangled; anonymous yet collective; impersonal yet, nevertheless, emphatically social.","[Beunza, Daniel] London Sch Econ, Dept Management, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Stark, David] Columbia Univ, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Columbia University,"Beunza, D (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Management, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",d.beunza@lse.ac.uk; dcs36@columbia.edu,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,67,82,89,4,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Legal requirements such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, national legislation etc. exist, but there is no norm such as an industry or quality norm to which companies have to obey yet. Moral norms are necessary as precondition for Compliance Management Systems [1]. Nevertheless certifications are developed. Considering the development of certifications for public organizations such as hospitals, schools, but also private companies in the area of for example environmental, health and security standards or ISO norms a standardized profile could be helpful to reach a minimum level of Compliance Management requirements for organizations. Business organizations and especially audit companies set standards [2]. These need independent evaluation to judge on their pertinence. Similarly the evaluation of Compliance officers or managers who work with and in Compliance Management Systems and who stem from a variety of functions needs a framework. A legal background is not mandatory for the function of a Compliance officer or manager, but often found as legal personnel knows about laws and the legal consequences of wrong business conduct. Furthermore a business understanding is indispensable to guarantee successful Compliance Management. This work elaborates which kinds of certifications are available and evaluates their quality.

Colin Lawson, Juraj Nemec, Vladimir Sagat For 20 years the successor states of the former Czechoslovakia have tried to improve health outcomes in an efficient or at least effective manner. Slovakia and the Czech Republic chose partly different policies, different health delivery and finance systems, and different payment and incentive structures. And yet in both countries better health outcomes emerged, but at great cost, as efficiency proved elusive. The goal of the paper is to examine processes and results of health care reforms in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are both countries after 20 years of changes still on the same track? The paper has four sections. Following the first section of background and introduction, we examine the principles and development of social policy in health care, how political instability neutered reform, yet politicised health issues, sometimes resulting in policy reversals. The third section explores the outcomes of the transition health care policies and how voters have perceived them. A summary of findings concludes, indicating that both systems are still very close, but some important differences emerged during the reforms process. Although there has been progress towards western European outcome standards, there is much to be done. While the costs of health care will continue to rise, it is unclear that the present political, policy-making and implementation systems can deliver either efficiency or a responsiveness to patients' views.","[Lawson, Colin] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Lawson, Colin] Matej Bel Univ, Dept Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Nemec, Juraj] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accountancy, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Sagat, Vladimir] BIVS Prague, Banking Inst, Dept Finance & Accountancy, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Bath; Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Lawson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",hsscwl@bath.ac.uk; juraj.nemec@unnb.sk; vladimirsagat@bivs.sk,"Nemec, Juraj/M-5467-2013","Nemec, Juraj/0000-0002-5881-7422",,,,,24,7,7,0,20,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Government has reinforced these positive economic externalities through policy programmes and designated support structures. Venture capital organisations often galvanise innovative knowledge by entrenching and sustaining nascent businesses through value-creating funding behaviours. In this way, the venture capital industry financially supports entrepreneurial activity for economic growth and governs and nurtures the growth of the SMEs. These show that the venture capital industry embraces value-creating opportunities on the basis of rational partnerships with enterprises that have limited track records and less formal control mechanisms. The tentative factor analysis findings suggest an integrated framework for the venture capital industry from the significant intercorrelations among the variables.

A huge bond buying by the European Central Bank, lower interest rates and a new liquidity in the market still might break a virus, if the steps mentioned above will be started in next few days.","[Paulickova, Alena; Paulicek, Roman] Vysoka Skola Sladkovicove, Sladkovicovo, Slovakia",,"Paulicková, A (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Sladkovicove, Sladkovicovo, Slovakia.",alena.paulickova@vssladkovicovo.sk; pauro@palmsoft.sk,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-171-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,223,226,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393447700036,0

Formal communication directly correlates with employees' productivity, a decrease in coordination costs, successful conflict resolution, diminishing of negative effect of gossips and others. However, it is important to emphasise that employees performance results are conditioned not only by formal but also by informal communication. Informal communication facilitates solving of problems related to performing tasks in groups, individual approaches to goals of organisation and joint assignments are depolarised through informal communication, tolerance towards diverse opinions is developed and similarities in acknowledged values are identified. Under conditions of globalization, members of organisations more and more frequently have to work in virtual workgroups. Therefore, nowadays one more dimension of communication, that is, communication via electronic media and technological channels, has gained significance. The research revealed that the contribution of electronic communication to efficiency of employees' activity and organisation success is diverse. Compared to technologized communication, the priority should be assigned to direct communication while striving for efficiency in organisation activity. It has to be noted, that technological channels limit communication possibilities to some extent, e.g., electronic communication is not favourable for development of informal contacts among employees and for strengthening of the sense of staffs commitment as well as for making of important decisions in groups. It is important to perceive that electronic medium itself is not able to improve communication. Quality of electronic communication to biggest extent depends on personal motivation of contacting individuals and the real need to apply technologies. Pursuing efficiency in organisation activity, it is necessary to employ the widest possible range of communication channels and also to promote direct informal communication among employees.","Mykolas Romeris Univ, Dept Management, Fac Polit & Management, LT-10101 Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University,"Raisiene, AG (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Dept Management, Fac Polit & Management, Valakupiu G 5, LT-10101 Vilnius, Lithuania.",agotar@mruni.eu,"Raišienė, Agota Giedrė/KDM-9085-2024",,,,,,84,3,5,3,69,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

It contains both insurance and medicine technology. The insurance object concerns health care risk and relative financial losses based on diseases, medical expenses, health services etc. Thus, it's difficult to identify and prevent. It is also influenced by government's policy and guide. Compared to life insurance and P&C insurance, it is different among such areas like data requirement, pricing progress, claim handling, and distribution channel. All of them limited the profit margin of health insurance and make it unstable. Due to above reasons market rules always inefficient. In western countries, it is found that government paid enough attention on the properties public goods of health insurance. In some special periods those governments want to be trusted by majority citizens in order to avoid riots. Some social welfare experts do not agree to use financial solution to cover health risk. However, they prefer use social security instead of health insurance. In America, commercial medicine system is the main solution to cover health care risk, but government also play important role in health insurance operating. In this circumstance, market rule can not be absolutely applied. The Chinese health insurance's developing routine and the future are not coherent answer both in theory and practice. This study firstly find some clues through overseas' experience. Secondly, it contrasts the political, economy, culture and social factors along the routine of industrialization, urbanization, and globalization and with the market mechanic reform in china. Meanwhile, it is referring the government's health care policy and analyzing the basic elements and potential ways to help health insurance developing well. This study shows public-private joint is the best way. In public point of view, third party administration (TPA) is the best choice. In private viewpoint, empowering operation is essential. To health insurance product design, company should develop product differently according to the properties public goods. In another words, if the properties public goods become dramatic, it will depend on the government. If the properties public goods become weaker, it could be operated by market rules. To succeed, insurer should integrate the resources in health care provider to develop product, cooperating with health care provider is a key factor, which can not be jumped away.","[Wang Zhijun] China Life P&C Insurance Co, Strategy Dev Dept, Beijing 100140, Peoples R China; [Wang Qin] China Int Capital LTD, Sales & Training Dept, Beijing 100004, Peoples R China",China Life Insurance,,,"Wang, zhijun/G-8543-2015",,,,,,15,0,0,0,10,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89414-036-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,609,625,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316628500055,0

We first investigate how the framework conditions and market structures have developed in both countries. Based on a unique dataset with more than 2000 US and more than 150 German routes including various variables on long-distance coach services, we analyse in a second step the supply and ticket prices in both markets that results from the different regulative settings. The results show that distance, the number of stops and frequency are highly significant determinants explaining the size of ticket price. Regarding competitive behaviour, we identify operators determining significant lower ticket prices in the markets compared to others. Finally, we consider how the spatial structure in the US influences the supply. We find that spatial distribution of the cities as well as demographic attributes such as the size population and the share of white population are determining the supply of intercity bus services in the US.

The Workshop identified six cyclical stages for BRT implementation: policy, frameworks, strategy and planning for implementation of BRT, stakeholder outreach and process management, deployment and operationalization of BRT, and post-deployment assessment. The papers and discussion provided key examples and results in all of the six stages leading to eight key messages. These main points ranged from an optimism that BRT is spreading, but that BRT is not itself the objective; the need for innovation in not just operations, but regulatory, institutional, and participatory frameworks, which requires increased public and private capacities; and recognition of the differences between cities, particularly in the developing and developed world.

J,"Sidak, JG",,,,"Sidak, J. Gregory",,,THE PROPER ROYALTY BASE FOR PATENT DAMAGES,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"How should a court determine the proper royalty base when calculating either reasonable-royalty damages for patent infringement or fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) royalties for infringement of, or licensing disputes over, standard-essential patents (SEPs)? This determination is particularly challenging in the context of a multi-component device, such as a smartphone. It is established patent jurisprudence that a reasonable royalty should reflect the terms of a hypothetical license resulting from a voluntary negotiation between a willing licensor and a willing licensee at the moment just before first infringement. In real-world patent negotiations, firms often calculate royalties with reference to the retail price of the downstream product. Therefore, using that downstream retail price as the royalty base is the most authentic assumption about the royalty base that a court could use for a hypothetical negotiation between a willing licensor and a willing licensee. Nonetheless, as a result of a recent series of confusing and contradictory opinions, the Federal Circuit in all but exceptional cases now decidedly favors using, for purposes of the hypothetical negotiation, a royalty base equivalent to the price of the infringing product's smallest salable patent-practicing component instead of the entire market value of the product. In cases where the downstream product is the smallest salable patent-practicing component and unpatented features constitute a substantial proportion of the product, the Federal Circuit favors subtracting the value of these unpatented elements from the royalty base. This development in the law of the entire market value rule (EMVR) has perverse consequences that the Federal Circuit has yet to recognize. Using the price of the smallest salable patent-practicing component as the royalty base risks undercompensating the patent holder, because it ignores (1) the effects that the patented technology has on the value of the downstream product and (2) the value that synergies between complementary technologies create. A more complete economic approach would account for such complementarity effects by permitting the use of the retail price of the downstream product as the royalty base. The Federal Circuit's choice of royalty base in its EMVR jurisprudence seems based on a theory that juries tend to overcompensate patent holders due to cognitive bias. However, the Federal Circuit fails to explain the logic and limits of its concern over cognitive bias. It therefore fails to justify its preference for the smallest salable patent-practicing component and risks under-compensating patent holders. Finally, I show that risk-averse firms should prefer structuring damages awards in a manner that reduces errors. This analysis of risk bearing indicates that, if a royalty with a low rate and high base is more accurate than one with a high rate and low base, courts should use the EMVR when awarding damages. The Federal Circuit's jurisprudence on patent damages currently ignores this concern.","Criter Econ LLC, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"Sidak, JG (通讯作者)，Criter Econ LLC, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",jgsidak@criterioneconomics.com,,,,,,,0,13,13,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The article's principal conclusion is that these efforts by the FCC were largely ineffectual and that only the removal of regulatory barriers to new network entry could, and indeed did, achieve the Commission's goal.","Charles River Associates Inc, Washington, DC 20004 USA",Charles River Associates,"Besen, SM (通讯作者)，Charles River Associates Inc, 1201 F St,NW, Washington, DC 20004 USA.",sbesen@crai.com,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

J,"Cervero, R; Dai, D",,,,"Cervero, Robert; Dai, Danielle",,,BRT TOD: Leveraging transit oriented development with bus rapid transit investments,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transit oriented development; Bus rapid transit; Place-making; Land use; Urban form,LAND-USE; TRANSPORT; IMPACTS,"Bus rapid transit (BRT) systems have gained prominence worldwide as a cost-effective alternative to urban rail investments. However, some question the city-shaping potential of BRT, in part due to a belief it delivers fewer regional accessibility benefits than rail, but also to the social stigma some assign to bus-based forms of mass mobility. Notwithstanding the successes of cities like Curitiba and Ottawa at integrating BRT and land development (Cervero, 1998. The Transit Metropolis: A Global Inquiry, Island Press, Washington, D.C.), doubt remains over BRT's ability to promote less car-dependent, more sustainable patterns of urban growth in rapidly motorizing and suburbanizing cities. This paper probes the opportunities and challenges of leveraging transit-oriented development (TOD) through BRT investments. The policy context of BRT and urban growth is first described. Evidence on the influences of BRT on urban development and land values is then presented followed by discussions on density and ridership performance of BRT cities. Attention next turns to the fundamental tension of mediating between the logistical and place-making functions of BRT stations. Failure to do so has generally resulted in low-cost, high-performance investments at the expense of suppressing TOD opportunities. Case experiences in Bogota Colombia and Ahmedabad India underscore that near-term mobility gains took precedence over shaping urban growth over the long-term. The paper closes with discussions on implementation. Based on a survey of 27 global cities with BRT systems, tools introduced to date to leverage TOD are reviewed. Survey respondents also commented on barriers that stand in the way of BRT TOD in their cities. While BRT is often viewed as being suited to serving lower density, outlying settings, it is believed that under the right conditions, BRT can also be as influential in inducing urban redevelopment and shaping urban growth in more sustainable formats.

Such analyses have typically been made under the assumption that future demographic developments are deterministic. When stochastic demographics have been considered, the problems have been simplified by assuming that the decision makers in the economic system behave as if they had perfect foresight as regards demographics. More realistically, we assume that the decision makers base their decisions on the forecasts of the future population, but revise their decisions when it turns out that the demographics do not follow the expected path. We contrast the nature of demographic uncertainty with that of financial markets, and argue that it is not realistic to assume that the revisions will occur according to the full rational expectations paradigm. Instead, the decision makers are assumed to revise according to the most recent point forecast. To implement this approach, we tailor standard nonparametric regression techniques to the task of computing the required future conditional expectations. Specifically, we assume that an approximation to the predictive distribution of the future population is available in terms of simulated population counts. The required conditional expectations are then obtained by averaging the future evolution of a set of sample paths that come from the neighborhood of a target path. This is formally equivalent to n-nearest neighbor kernel regression. The degree of smoothing can be chosen via cross-validation. An illustration based on a stochastic forecast of the population of Finland is given. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The estimation shows that at this geographic scale, the definition of distance does not affect the explanatory power of the model significantly. However, time-based definitions of distance have a marginal improvement on the model fit in comparison to length-based measures. When geographic specific fixed effects are unknown, the model shows that distance measured as road network distance is a better predictor. The paper concludes that time-based definitions of distance present several advantages in comparison to traditional length-based definitions. However, at large geographic scales, where relative distances between every geographic unit are long, the use of length-based distance instead of time-based distance to approximate travel costs generates similar results.

This article explores the influence of collaboration motives on the desired proximity characteristics of partnerships in innovation projects based on 50 interviews with representatives from Danish cleantech firms. How search criteria along proximity dimensions differ depends on the purposes of the collaborations. In this way, the analysis distinguishes between the types of collaboration, where geographical proximity is considered highly important and those where geographically distant partners are preferred. Geographical proximity plays an important role in partnerships motivated by interaction around actual product development and knowledge creation, while long-distance relationships appear to be important for partnerships motivated by market access and cost considerations. The insight that the desired proximity characteristics of partnerships are indeed contingent on the motive for collaborating highlights how the proximity framework can be applied in the analysis of firm decision making.","Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Hansen, T (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Teis.Hansen@circle.lu.se,"Hansen, Teis/E-8032-2011","Hansen, Teis/0000-0001-9383-3471",,,,,79,40,42,1,62,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Detailed studies of stock index and FX time series include: multi-period, out-of-sample forecasting, statistical model comparisons, and portfolio performance testing using raw returns, risk-adjusted returns and portfolio volatility. We Find uniform improvements on all measures relative to standard dynamic factor models. This is due to the parsimony of latent threshold models and their ability to exploit between-factor correlations so as to improve the characterization and prediction of volatility.

The results highlight significant differences between travel patterns and their urban form correlates for the older and younger adult populations. Spatial variables such as density and regional accessibility have different and potentially reverse associations with travel among older adults. The car use of older adults is not substituted by other modes in high-density settings, as is the case for younger adults. Older adults do not respond to high regional accessibility by reducing distance traveled, but travel longer and are also more likely to continue using a car in high-access conditions. Spatial structural conditions have the potential to reinforce the need to use private cars among older adults as they attempt to maintain their independent travel and mobility. Older persons are a growing demographic group and thus, the implications of this paper for planning and policies targeting modal shift are significant. How population aging may contribute to car travel saturation or to peak travel requires further investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The situation in which one of the project parties is better informed than another is known as information asymmetry. This problem is addressed by the principal-agent theory. According to this theory, information asymmetries cause three problems: adverse selection, moral hazard, and hold up. The focus here is on strategies for minimizing information asymmetries in the construction phase. A survey of project managers was conducted to establish an understanding of the relative importance of risk-minimization strategies established in the literature: bureaucratic control (contracts), information systems, incentives (bonuses), corporate culture, reputation, and trust. The multi-attribute utility theory was used to analyze the responses. According to the project managers who participated in the survey, trust is the most important strategy in the construction phase, followed by bureaucratic control (contracts) and information systems.","Univ Zagreb, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Econ, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Ceric, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Econ, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",anita@grad.hr,"Ceric, Anita/W-6155-2019",,,,,,42,16,17,3,47,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Because homebuilders in Finland have been providing relatively homogeneous products to an increasingly diverse population, current housing may not represent the occupiers' preferences so a segmentation approach relying on socioeconomic characteristics and expressed preferences may not be sufficient. We use data collected via questionnaire in a principal component analysis followed by a hierarchical cluster analysis to determine whether different combinations of housing attributes are important to groups of residents. We can identify four clusters of housing residents based on important characteristics when looking for a house. The clusters describe Finnish people in different phases of the life cycle and with different preferences based on their recreational activities and financial expenditures. Mass customization of housing could be used to better appeal to these different clusters of consumers who share similar preferences, increasing consumer satisfaction and improving profitability.","[Gibler, Karen M.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Real Estate, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Tyvimaa, Tanja] Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Tampere University,"Gibler, KM (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Real Estate, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",kgibler@gsu.edu; tanja.tyvimaa@tut.fi,,,,,,,39,22,22,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

While not the first HOT lanes in the country, the MnPASS lanes are the first implementation of road pricing in Minnesota and possess a dynamic pricing schedule. Tolls charged to single occupant vehicles (SOVs) are adjusted every 3 min according to HOT lane vehicle density. Given the infancy of systems like MnPASS, questions remain about drivers' responses to toll prices. Three field experiments were conducted on the corridors during which prices were changed. Data from the field experiments as well as two years of toll and traffic data were analyzed to measure driver responses to pricing changes. Driver elasticity to price was positive with magnitudes less than 1.0. This positive relationship between price and demand is in contrast with the previously held belief that raising the price would discourage demand. In addition, drivers consistently paid between approximately $60-120 per hour of travel time savings, much higher than the average value of time. Reasons for these results is discussed as well as the implications these results have on the pricing of HOT lanes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The study integrates prospect theory and strategic reference point theory: strategic choices depend on how the decision maker perceives the situation in relation to the reference and the risk being taken. Applying Rasch models to a sample of firms in the Canary Islands (Spain), the results show that SMEs that are more influenced by external references take higher risks. These enterprises differ in their strategic choices from those that do not focus on external references in the greater importance they attach to market diversification. This study is pioneer in considering the internal and external dimension of references that SME managers have in mind and linking them, via prospect theory (Kahneman, Tversky 1979), to the risk they take in their strategic choices. It also has the added value of applying Rasch Measurement Theory. For managers, the study of the SRPs shows a large number of enterprises with a more internal than external view. Thus, the need for rethinking their SRPs and for designing a greater market orientation of firms in the service sector is worth highlighting. There are also important implications for the public administration and institutions. They should emphasize the promotion of cooperation among enterprises to increase their external orientation and then, the importance of external SRPs. Training, financial and organizational support could be some of the strategies that ought to be implemented.","[Yanes-Estevez, Vanessa] Univ La Laguna, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ, Inst Univ Empresa IUDE, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain; Univ La Laguna, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Direcc Empresas, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de la Laguna,"Yanes-Estévez, V (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ, Inst Univ Empresa IUDE, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain.",angape@ull.es; vayanes@ull.es; joreja@ull.es,"; Yanes-Estevez, Vanessa/F-6965-2016","Garcia-Perez, Ana Maria/0000-0003-4252-8340; Yanes-Estevez, Vanessa/0000-0002-4834-7199",,,,,40,11,16,2,61,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This has the effect of reducing the purchaser-commissioner of the technical merchandise to a determinative factor in the manner of construction of the merchandise in question, given that intervention extends even to description of the individual works to be performed if the study for the technical project is to be transmuted into a material construction. Because of this, there is no relevant bibliography or relevant references which could be used to document the subject matter of this paper. According to Greek legislation, the value of a Greek private sector project functions as an independent variable for determining the value of a Greek public sector project. In this way it can be proved that Greek public works are overpriced. Prior to 2004, to be specific, the contracting agent had secured a profit even before he enters the production process, because of the difference between the exchange value asked by its seller and the exchange value which he would have asked if the buyer were not the state but a private citizen. This fact is demonstrated in this paper by a mathematical model. After 2004, however, with a view to reducing the relevant overprofit, the Greek legislator changed the method of costing for public works projects, with the result that the cost of each project now tended to approximate what it would have been if the project had been constructed for a private individual.","Hellen Open Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Patras, Greece",Hellenic Open University,"Metallinos, P (通讯作者)，Hellen Open Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Patras, Greece.",kpaulosm@netscape.net,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

A poor connection can cause some passengers to stop using the transit service. Service-design criteria always contain postulates to improve routing and scheduling coordination (intra- and inter-agency transfer centers/points and synchronized/timed transfers). However, ostensibly the lack of well-defined connectivity measures precludes the weighing and quantifying of the result of any coordination effort, and thus makes it difficult for the decision makers to draw any firm conclusion. This work provides an initial methodological framework, concepts and tools for detecting weak segments in inter-route and inter-modal chains (paths) for possible revisions/changes. The approach used is based on a description of PT connectivity network involved with attributes and passenger flows. Formulations are developed to detect weak segments of the PT network, and the max-flow algorithm is utilized to find out the locations of the bottlenecks within this network. Two case studies are presented of two major cities undergoing two major sporting events; the city of London in the United Kingdom hosting the XXX Olympic Games in 2012 and the city of Auckland in New Zealand that hosted the 7th Rugby World Cup (RWC) in 2011. These cities are used to offer a comparison of the bottlenecks in their PT networks. The results indicate that in the City of London, the PT lines of Tube (Bakerloo), Rail (London Euston) and Bus (Route 18) leading to the Wembley Stadium Station are the bottlenecks and in the City of Auckland, the bottlenecks are the PT lines of Bus (Routes 212-249) and Rail (Western Line) leading to the Eden Park Stadium. It is evident that improving the capacity and accessibility of these lines will increase the maximum flow (throughput) to their respective sport stadiums. Overall, the PT connectivity measures help to detect the weakest arc, path or node in comparison with other identified arcs, paths, or nodes within the PT network. These tools can assist decision makers in planning for future PT improvements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most of these results are based on analyses of single (scalar) indices of agglomeration. Hence, it is not surprising that industries deemed to be similar by such indices can often exhibit very different patterns of agglomeration-with respect to the number, size and spatial extent of individual agglomerations. The purpose of this article is thus to propose a more detailed spatial analysis of agglomeration in terms of multiple-cluster patterns, where each cluster represents a (roughly) convex set of contiguous regions within which the density of establishments is relatively uniform. The key idea is to develop a simple probability model of multiple clusters, called cluster schemes, and then to seek a 'best' cluster scheme for each industry by employing a standard model-selection criterion. Our ultimate objective is to provide a richer characterization of spatial agglomeration patterns that will allow more meaningful comparisons of these patterns across industries.","[Mori, Tomoya] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Mori, Tomoya] METI, RIETI, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008901, Japan; [Smith, Tony E.] Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Kyoto University; University of Pennsylvania,"Mori, T (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",mori@kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Mori, Tomoya/AAN-7636-2020","Mori, Tomoya/0000-0002-9053-5599","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21243021, 21330055, 25285074] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,30,19,21,1,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

However there is still little empirical knowledge about what specific kind of work emissions trading schemes do. Using the analytical tools provided by science and technology studies, especially developments studying markets and economic practices, this paper looks to contribute to filling this void by exploring three kinds of work that emissions trading schemes might do: performing a textbook market of emissions permits, performing a civilized market in which a multitude of heterogeneous actors participate and as exemplars of the validity of certain economic knowledge. In order to explore the usability of this conceptualization the paper will then analyze one of earliest concrete implementations of this device: an emissions trading scheme introduced to deal with industrial air pollution in the city of Santiago (Chile) in the early 1990s. Through a historical genealogy, it will show this emissions trading scheme working not mainly as a textbook market, but as a civilized one and as a powerful exemplar that helped to mobilize both command-and-control regulation and neoliberal environmental economics to/from Chile and elsewhere.","[Ureta, Sebastian] Tech Univ Berlin, Ctr Technol & Soc, Dept Sociol, Innovat Governance Res Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Ureta, Sebastian] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Sociol, Santiago, Chile",Technical University of Berlin; Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Ureta, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Ctr Technol & Soc, Dept Sociol, Innovat Governance Res Grp, Berlin, Germany.",sureta@uahurtado.cl,,"Ureta, Sebastian/0000-0003-3169-4992",,,,,58,4,5,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We do this using an innovative Australian data set which merges survey and administrative data. The survey data inform us about intergenerational co-residence and financial gifts and the administrative data about the family's welfare receipt history. We find that disadvantaged young people are more likely to be economically independent of their parents than are their more advantaged peers. This disparity is larger for financial gifts than for co-residence and increases with age. Moreover, there is a complex relationship between parental support and participation in study and work. We find no evidence, however, that a lack of parental support is the source of the socioeconomic gradient in either studying or employment.

This paper examines some of the implications of such initiatives from a law-and-economics perspective. We show that increased criminalization does not necessarily lead to higher environmental quality. Budget-constrained regulators mandated with minimizing environmental damages can lose their ability to incentivize violators to report their misconducts in the presence of criminal prosecution. Therefore, some of the damages that otherwise can be remediated go undetected. The mechanism results from the subtle interplay of the current regulatory structure and the incentives of the environmental criminal justice system.","[Goeschl, Timo; Juergens, Ole] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Goeschl, T (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Bergheimer Str 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",goeschl@eco.uni-heidelberg.de,,"Goeschl, Timo/0000-0001-7618-5070",,,,,61,1,1,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Because military personnel have little to no control over their deployments, the military setting offers a unique opportunity to study the causal effect of major disruptions on marital dissolution. In this paper, we use longitudinal individual-level administrative data from 1999 to 2008 and find that an additional month in deployment increases the divorce hazard of military families, with females being more affected. A standard conceptual framework of marital formation and dissolution predicts a differential effect of these types of shocks depending on the degree to which they are anticipated when a couple gets married. Consistent with this prediction, we find a larger effect for couples married before 9/11, who clearly expected a lower risk of deployment than what they faced post 9/11.","[Negrusa, Sebastian; Negrusa, Brighita] Lewin Grp, Falls Church, VA 22042 USA; [Hosek, James] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA",Optum; Lewin Group; RAND Corporation,"Negrusa, S (通讯作者)，Lewin Grp, 3130 Fairview Pk Dr,Suite 500, Falls Church, VA 22042 USA.",sebastian.negrusa@lewin.com; brighita.negrusa@lewin.com; James_Hosek@rand.org,"Negrusa, Sebastian/X-4108-2019",,,,,,28,26,61,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The results indicate that income increases energy consumption in both the long run and the short run. In the long run, urbanization decreases energy consumption, while industrialization increases it. Long-run dynamics are important as evidenced by the estimated coefficient on the error correction term. These results have implications for sustainable development. Economic growth policies designed to increase income and industrialization will increase energy consumption. Since most energy needs in emerging economies are currently met by the burning of fossil fuels, economic growth and industrialization policies will be at odds with sustainable development.","York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Sadorsky, P (通讯作者)，York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",psadorsk@schulich.yorku.ca,"Sadorsky, Perry/AAF-3856-2019","Sadorsky, Perry/0000-0002-1718-6732",,,,,32,82,90,7,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Consistent with the finance-growth literature, financial deepening had a limited impact on growth in Ireland before the crisis and cannot be expected to contribute significantly over the short to medium term. The paper documents that, compared to its benchmark, the Irish banking system is still very unbalanced, with a heavy reliance on international funding, and limited competition. Given its membership in the Eurozone and the EU, Ireland depends very much on global and European regulatory reform trends, some of which are more important for Ireland than other European economies. Critically, the shape and resilience of Irish banking will depend on the shape the Eurozone banking union will take.","[Beck, Thorsten] Cass Business Sch, London, England; [Beck, Thorsten] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Beck, Thorsten] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",City University London; Tilburg University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Beck, T (通讯作者)，Cass Business Sch, London, England.",,"Beck, Thorsten/GRX-3987-2022",,,,,,34,4,5,0,6,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

These assumptions underpinned the 'predict and provide' approach which then characterised transport planning. Twenty years later, the New Deal for Transport White Paper (1998) abandoned 'predict and provide' as unsustainable. This paper argues that the same growth assumptions that Adams took to their logical (absurd) conclusion have re-emerged to define both transport and the drivers of transport demand. While non-aviation transport is supposed to be carbon-neutral by 2050, the implied reductions in emissions rely on an absolute decoupling of transport demand and its drivers for which there is no evidence in current planning. Targets rely on optimistic, narrowly framed technology forecasts and behaviour change assumptions which appear highly unlikely in the present sociopolitical climate. Moreover, such is the cost of mitigating these tensions between economic growth and other concerns, it is argued that the targeted outcomes of current policy are as undesirable as they are unlikely. The paper concludes by calling for a transport policy which considers mobility in an integrated, holistic fashion, rather than merely as a dimension of economic growth. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Activities such as sports, attending parties or religious gatherings, using Internet, and hosting friends and neighbours influence the extent of inter-ethnic contact. The effect of ethnic composition of neighbourhoods and educational qualification on relative frequency of contact with native Dutch is strongly reduced when individual activity and travel patterns are taken into account.

The outstanding value in listed markets - excluding the OTC deals - is estimated to be US$ 1,200 billion in 2013. The growth has accelerated to 42 per cent over 20011 and 2013, especially after firms and institutions (for example, the World bank) started to tap this new debt funding source, which is based on risk-and-profit-sharing debenture terms. Exchange trading is now available in 14 countries while England is making changes to her law to permit public trading of Sukuk bonds in London. Using paired sample tests and Granger (1969) causality tests, evidence is found to show that Sukuk yields are significantly higher than bond yields for identical risk, term and issuer: also bond yields do not Granger cause yields in this new debt market. The paper maps the payoff structure of new debt instruments, and identifies basic valuation approaches to price the new debt instruments.

This paper interprets from the U.S. experience with national highway construction, drawing several lessons that are pertinent both in developing and developed countries. In the U.S., the 1956 Interstate Highway Act codified a national road building program with centralized, federal leadership, financed by fuel taxes and hence designed to serve motorists, with little appreciation for the resulting impacts on cities and metropolitan areas. The U.S. experience illustrates that national transportation planning is best conceived as two systems - one inter-metropolitan and one intra-metropolitan - and that the institutions, goals, methods, and financing instruments for those two systems should differ. The U.S. institutions and policies were well suited to building a national, inter-metropolitan ground transport system, but are ill suited to the era of maintenance, externality management, and urban transportation that followed.

An econometric analysis of the joint effects of 'defensive' and 'strategic restructuring' reveals that, unsurprisingly, downsizing of the physical network has affected financial performance positively. Contrary to widely held beliefs, employment reductions by themselves do not explain improved performance, but controlling for interactions of network reductions and labour downsizing with strategic restructuring measures, employment reductions have a strong positive effect. This suggests a positive revision of the Draconian view that the successful restructuring of the US rail industry is mainly the result of workforce reductions.","[Friebel, Guido] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, CEPR, DE-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Friebel, Guido] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, IZA, DE-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [McCullough, Gerard] Univ Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Angulo, Laura Padilla] Champagne Sch Management, Grp ESC Troyes Champagne, FR-10002 Troyes, France",Goethe University Frankfurt; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Friebel, G (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, CEPR, Gruneburgpl 1, DE-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",gfriebel@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de; gmccullo@umn.edu; laura.padilla@get-mail.fr,"Padilla-Angulo, Laura/P-2543-2019","Padilla-Angulo, Laura/0000-0003-4011-6115",,,,,21,6,7,0,6,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Consequently, these industries discharge large quantities of chromium containing effluents. Since chromium is a known mutagen and carcinogen, the prevalent pollution laws in most countries require its complete removal from waste streams before discharge. There are several methods employed for chromium removal. However, most of these methods are unsustainable in nature and economically unattractive. It is therefore necessary to look for a new practical, economic, efficient and sustainable alternative for the management of chromium bearing industrial effluents. Bio-management approaches are gaining immense creditability world across in the recent years. Chromium being non-renewable and finite natural resource, the argument is not limited only to their removal from the effluents, but also extends to finding an efficient and economical ways of recovery/recycling.

We study the behavior of the experts by comparing their forecasts with those from an automated statistical program, and we report the forecast accuracy over these 12 months. In September 2007 these experts were given feedback on their behavior and they received training at the headquarters office, where specific attention was given to the ins and outs of the statistical program. Next, we study the behavior of the experts for the 3 months after the training session, i.e. October 2007 to December 2007.

EVIDENCE FROM EUROPE,E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cross-border mergers and acquisitions; economic interventionism; strategic industries,PRODUCTIVITY; INVESTMENT; UK,"Although most studies proves that Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions (C-B M&A) cause more benefits than threats, the real economic policy in the EU countries offsets the fear that liberalization of inward C-B M&A would endanger economic position of strategic industries and thus national economic goals. After the adoption of EU Directive 2004/25/EC on Takeover Bids the era of fast growth of inward C-B M&A in the EU and consequently the era of rising interventionism so as to protect national strategic industries and companies has started. Additional stimulus for the European Union's (EU) most developed economies to exercise interventionism was financial and economic crisis starting in 2008. Considering high ranking of employment goals and state-supported social cohesion in continental Europe, it is not surprise that interventionist reactions came from ruling parties and coalitions regardless their political orientation. By the help of the results of their 2009 empirical study on C-B M&A authors tested the relation between the results referring to C-B M&A effects on strategic sectors and the Heritage Foundation Index of Investment Freedom. With combining the results from 2009 study with Index of Investment Freedom from 2009 and in the second equation with index from 2014 authors checked if strategic sectors benefit from incoming C-B M&A when subject to the previous market oriented industrial policy. Both estimated equations proves that unlike with sheltering economic policy, when subject to market conform measures of industrial policy, strategic sectors will benefit from inward C-B M&A. By proving the statistical significant relationship between the results from 2009 study and Index from 2014 authors also proved the statistical and analytical quality of the equation from 2009. By proving statistical significance of the second equation we proved that the judgement of the academic community could be considered relevant also after five years following the real experience as basis of their judgement.","[Macek, Anita] Doba Fac Appl Business & Social Studies Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia; [Ovin, Rasto] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Macek, A (通讯作者)，Doba Fac Appl Business & Social Studies Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia.",anita.macek@net.doba.si; rasto.ovin@uni-mb.si,,"MACEK, ANITA/0000-0003-3966-8721",,,,,22,0,0,0,10,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The paper deals with offering scientific support to decision makers in order to make the best possible decision. If multiple criteria are considered, one of the MCDM methods can be chosen. A simplified decisional situation is presented, deriving of the real case of deciding the winner of the bid for implementing the 112 Emergency Service in Romania. For deciding between a number of 9 bidders - all well known IT companies, a set of criteria was defined, concerning both with the expertise, the technical capability and the structure of the company. The evaluation targeted the design, implementation, maintenance and reliability of the system. Importance of each criterion was evaluated by allocation of specialists. For assisting the decision, Electre method and the appropriate software can be used. On the basis of the decisional matrix, the software builds-up a hierarchy - the top of alternatives. The decisional process ends by assigning the work to one of the 9 bidder companies - the one that proved to best fulfill the criteria. In the specific case of the considered acquisition, the IT system is implemented by the company denoted by A6 and the decision of the public authority is supported by the results of applying the Electre method.","[Nagy, Mariana] Aurel Vlaicu Univ Arad, Arad, Romania; [Negrusa, Adina] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Aurel Vlaicu University of Arad; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Nagy, M (通讯作者)，Aurel Vlaicu Univ Arad, Arad, Romania.",,"Negrusa, Adina Letitia/AAP-1453-2021; Negrusa, Adina Gh/C-1689-2012; Nagy, Mariana/D-4243-2011","Negrusa, Adina Letitia/0000-0002-6164-3822; Negrusa, Adina Gh/0000-0002-6164-3822; Nagy, Mariana/0000-0001-6702-8049",,,,,11,3,3,0,3,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,195,200,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100026,0

In this study, the degree of vertical integration and the presence of asymmetric price transmission are investigated for sawtimber and lumber products in the southern and western United States. The data utilized are quarterly stumpage price, delivered timber price, and lumber price of softwood between 1977 and 2011. Linear and threshold cointegration models are used for long-term price analyses, and symmetric and asymmetric error correction models are used for short-term price analyses. The integration in the early stage (i.e., stumpage/delivered timber price pair) is found to be stronger than that in the latter stage (i.e., delivered/lumber price pair). The South shows slightly stronger market cointegration than the West. Asymmetric price transmission is found along the timber supply chain. In the long term, prices are more responsive when the price margin is increased than decreased. (C) 2013 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, timed.

I argue that the nonmeritocratic nature of capitalist society prevents it from using human talents efficiently and that this fact is obscured by a meritocratic illusion that is systematically generated by the structural logic of capitalist society. After briefly exploring one way in which capitalism's ecological contradictions impinge on the Davis-Moore thesis, I conclude by arguing that it is the mediation of capitalism's contradictions through social struggles that will determine whether a more meritocratic society consistent with the reconceptualized version of the Davis-Moore thesis will ever emerge.","[Panayotakis, Costas] CUNY New York City Coll Technol, New York, NY USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Panayotakis, C (通讯作者)，836 Washington Ave,3B, Brooklyn, NY 11238 USA.",cpanayotakis@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,8,10,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The use of innovation can be beneficial not only to support the negotiation process but also in the preparation phase of the negotiations. In order to properly prepare for negotiations is need to form an effective negotiating team whose analytical work and skills could help to achieve the highest outcome of the negotiations. This is particularly important in the preparation and in the course of intercultural negotiations, which require an understanding of other cultures, other languages, possession of legal knowledge, knowledge of the negotiation context, etc. In preparation for the negotiation phase is needed to know the best way possible about the other side of the negotiation. Knowing the technical communication capabilities of other negotiation side it is possible to prepare effective negotiation support tools. Negotiation's success often depends on the effectiveness of the preparation - the better it will be known the other side of the negotiation and negotiation context, the better results will be achieved.

A variety of questions arise in the process. Why is it that some EU economies overcome the crisis more successful on their development, whereas other economies are in stagnation? What changes, both positive and negative, have taken place in the economies of old and new EU Member States? Is the enlargement of the EU economically justified? This process carries both new threats and opportunities for development. Whether the situation will be favourable for the sustainable and effective development of the EU economy depends on the implementation of the EU's cohesion policy and the response to the new challenges of the pursued cohesion policy in the future. The aim is to achieve balanced development throughout the EU, by reducing structural disparities among countries and regions, and promoting equal opportunities for all. Cohesion policy has a major impact on the economy Member States, reducing economic differences and promoting environmental and social development. EU Member States are characterized by the large disparity in development level - it can be said that EU is a multi-speed Europe: the EU old members' and the EU new members' social and economic development varies significantly.

New companies typically seek alternative financing when their companies have not been in business long enough to establish credit profiles with financial institutions. Access to alternative financing together with traditional financial resources represents one of the most significant challenges for new SMEs not only in the Baltic States but all over the world. Ensurance of new SMEs creation, existence and growth asks understanding of SMEs' financing needs and alternative funding is one of them. Alternative financing for the Baltic States is rather new area as a result there is luck of theoretical and empirical researches in this field. During development of the paper the generally accepted qualitative and quantitative methods of economic research were used including comparative analysis and synthesis, graphical illustration methods. The study results highlight the importance of alternative resources as external financing for small developing countries as the Baltic ones. Conducted empirical analysis confirms that SMEs' access to alternative financing in the Baltic States is improving and hopefully this market segment will be the way for the Baltic States to become innovative driven economies.

This holds true for both male and female siblings.

The purpose of this study is to establish whether an association exists between an entity's BEE elements and its share returns in the short term. Based on prior literature, it appears that the market reacts positively to an announcement of a BEE deal, although the literature also indicates that an entity's BEE score, which includes all seven elements of the BEE score, bears a negative relationship to its share returns. Therefore the association between the various BEE elements and share returns needs to be investigated. The study uses a multivariate regression analysis that controls for factors influencing share returns. The study includes the BEE element data as obtained from the survey of the top empowerment companies carried out by Empowerdex/Financial Mail for the period 2005 to 2011. The results of this study indicate that a significant positive association exists between the management control element of the BEE score and the entity's share returns. Furthermore, a significant negative association exists between the ownership and preferential procurement elements of an entity and its share returns. This study contributes to the literature on BEE in the accounting and finance field in South Africa as well as enhances the understanding and effect of BEE compliance through implementation of the generic scorecard as required by the 2007 codes of good practice.

Private game reserves and game farms which forms part of wildlife tourism constitute most of the wildlife products in South Africa. On these private reserves and game farms, hunting is one of the major income generators for product owners. The aim of this study is to analyse the economic impact of hunting on the regional economies of three of South Africa's most important hunting provinces. The study used economic multipliers, input-output analysis, and related modelling processes through input-output (supply-use) tables and social accounting matrices (SAM). The results differed significantly for the three provinces, with Limpopo receiving the biggest impact (R2.6 billion) and the Free State having the highest multiplier (2.08). The geographical location of the game farms, the number of farms per province and the species available all influenced the magnitude of the economic impact of hunters over and above the traditional determinants of economic impact analysis. The implication of the research is that it will help product owners in the development of game farms or hunting products, contribute to policy formulation, especially for government decisions on what products to offer where, and how to create more jobs.","[van der Merwe, Petrus; Saayman, Melville] North West Univ, Mahikeng, South Africa; [Rossouw, Riaan] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Mahikeng, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa,"van der Merwe, P (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Mahikeng, South Africa.",,"Van der Merwe, Peet/AAH-9204-2020","Van der Merwe, Peet/0000-0002-6640-4062; saayman, melville/0000-0001-9991-0140; Rossouw, Riaan/0000-0003-1761-6488",,,,,43,21,25,0,71,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In this reform, forestland owned by villages or township collective organizations were divided into a great number of small plots and allocated to member households of the collectives. A widespread concern about the reform is that parcelization of forestland might limit farmers' incentives to invest in forest management. This paper examines the factors affecting farmers' investment in forest management using household data collected in four provinces in 2010. The results show that the intensity of a household's investment in forest management is negatively affected by its nonfarm income and the average size of forest plots, but positively affected by the easiness in obtaining loan and the technical assistance the household receives. We argue that the counterintuitive effect of nonfarm income on investment intensity is due to the increasing marginal cost of own labor input. The effects of forest plot size and easiness in obtaining loan suggest that households have limited amount of capital to invest in forest management. Because of this constraint, parcelization of forestland resulted from the recent reform has not yet caused any reduction of the intensity of investment in forest management.

The empirical results show that financial constraints problem is a widespread problem among listed companies.

However, due to the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations carried out by Europe and America, global PV market's demand for China's enterprises slows down and the resistance against the product export of China's enterprises increases. In essence, it is because the China's PV enterprises in the labor division of global value chain occupy the low-value-added link, and provide large trade statistical data while obtaining relatively small profits, resulting in the trade resistance of other countries, and revealing the problems, such as excess dependence of China's PV product market on overseas market demand, excess production capacity of products in low-value-added link, and insufficient production capacity of products in high-value-added link.

The preliminary screening step is examined from the perspective of a failed enterprise's attempt at cooperative innovation to establish the index system for preliminary screening of cooperative innovation partners. The Cluster Analysis Method is used to determine the range in which the alternative partners belong. The evaluation of the cooperative scheme set stage must first establish the cooperative scheme set with the qualified enterprises which are selected in the preliminary screening stage.

First, according to a literature review and expert opinions, quantitative measures for evaluating air cargo competitiveness are derived using the Delphi method. Then the weights and value functions of these measures are obtained through expert questionnaire surveys. Applying the value functions to the operational data of different airports yields the value of each measure. Finally, multiplying the values with their corresponding weights sheds light on the competitiveness of individual and overall measures. Comparison of major Asia-Pacific airports is made in terms of different dimensions of air cargo competitiveness. The analysis results reveal that Hong Kong is the most competitive in terms of airline transport capacity and economic development while Changi is the most competitive with respect to airport facilities and operation. As for overall air cargo competitiveness, Hong Kong ranked top, followed by Changi, Pudong, Incheon, Taoyuan, Bangkok, Narita, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Manila International Airports.

Evaluation of the programme was conducted using self-administered questionnaires completed pre-intervention (before the first training session) and again 3 months after the first training session. Just under half of those responding to both surveys (47%) reported cycling more frequently after the training than beforehand. Statistically significant increases in the mean number of days in the last week spent cycling for at least 30 min, and in the mean number of days cycled to work in the last 7 days were observed. After the training, participants cycled for longer on days on which they rode a bike than beforehand and there was a significant increase in overall physical activity levels amongst participants post-intervention. In conclusion, cycle training can be seen to be a useful strategy in encouraging people to cycle more often, and for longer, however more work is necessary to establish the longevity of this and the effect of other factors.

This study begins with the supposition that, in the Venezuelan Governor's offices, health policies and administration that favor the market economy model, with technocratic traits and based on the proposals of New Public Management (NPM) have predominated. The purpose of this research is to explain public policy and management for the 1990-2003 period in Venezuelan Governors' offices. Three cases were studied: Zulia, Lara and Aragua. The research was supported by official documents from the selected governors' offices and secondary sources. Conclusions are that the capitalist State, whose apparatus formed part of the governors' offices, organized in terms of its economic role to take care of market economy requirements and the accumulation of capital. The following practices are recognized: 1) the privatization of services and b) charging for the services rendered, continuing the process of accumulating capital in the logical sense, due to which there is no room for public policy and management in favor of the majority, for social inclusion nor for the democratization of power and social well-being.","[Fuenmayor, Jennifer] Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; [Fuenmayor, Jennifer] Univ Zulia, Inst Invest, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; [Ochoa Henriquez, Haydee] Univ Zulia, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; [Ochoa Henriquez, Haydee] UBV, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Ochoa Henriquez, Haydee] UBV, Sede Zulia, Vicosa, MG, Brazil",,"Fuenmayor, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",jjfuenmayor@yahoo.com; haydeeochoaubv@gmail.com,"Fuenmayor, Jennifer/G-8168-2018","Fuenmayor, Jennifer/0000-0003-0320-0449",,,,,49,1,1,0,2,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Taking this one-stop shopping behavior into account, we show that slotting fees may emerge as a result of a rent-shifting mechanism in a three-party negotiation framework, where a monopolistic retailer negotiates sequentially with two suppliers about two-part tariff contracts. If the goods are initially independent or sufficiently differentiated, the wholesale price negotiated with the first supplier is upward distorted. This allows the retailer and the first supplier to extract rent from the second supplier. To compensate the retailer for the higher wholesale price, the first supplier pays a slotting fee as long as its bargaining power vis-a-vis the retailer is not too large.","[Caprice, Stephane] INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, F-31931 Toulouse, France; [von Schlippenbach, Vanessa] DIW Berlin, DICE, Berlin, Germany; [von Schlippenbach, Vanessa] Humboldt Univ, Frankfurt, Germany",INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Caprice, S (通讯作者)，INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, F-31931 Toulouse, France.",caprice@toulouse.inra.fr; vschlippenbach@diw.de,,,,,,,35,9,11,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Application to directional forecasting of the daily close price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average over a 20-year out-of-sample period yields performance superior to random walk and logistic regression models, and on a par with that of multilayer perceptrons. A feature of the classifier is that it is parameter free, parameters entering the model only via the measure used to determine pairwise similarity between data points. This allows intuitions about the nature of time series to be elegantly integrated into the model. The recursive nature of eigenvector centrality makes it better able to deal with sparsely populated input spaces than conventional approaches based on density estimation.

However, when estimating VSL based on the respondents' use of bicycle helmets we find a significantly higher VSL; the VSL from bicycle-helmet usage is 7 times higher than the estimate based on seatbelt usage. Moreover, we do not find any strong relationship between risk perception and usage, or individual stated WTP and usage. Hence, the main conclusion, based on our analysis, is that stated and observed WTP are not consistent. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Their effectiveness is affected by the price sensitivity of vehicle fuel consumption and travel, measured as elasticities (percentage change in consumption caused by a percentage change in price). Lower elasticities imply that price reforms are relatively ineffective in achieving objectives, high prices significantly harm consumers, and rebound effects are small so strategies that increase vehicle fuel efficiency are relatively effective at conserving fuel. Higher elasticities imply that price reforms are, relatively effective in achieving objectives, consumers can easily reduce fuel consumption and vehicle travel, and rebound effects are relatively large. Some studies found that US price elasticities declined during the last quarter of the Twentieth Century but recent evidence suggests that vehicle travel has since become more price sensitive. This article examines evidence of changing vehicle fuel and travel elasticities, and discusses policy implications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective function uses frequency domain concepts, but is formulated in the time domain, and allows the estimation of all linear processes (e.g., ARIMA and component ARIMA). By using an asymptotic form of the forecast mean squared error, we obtain a well-defined nonlinear function of the parameters that is proven to be minimized at the true parameter vector when the model is correctly specified. We derive the statistical properties of the parameter estimates, and study the asymptotic impact of model misspecification on multi-step-ahead forecasting.

The law and economics analysis of these duties, especially the duty of directors to maximize shareholder wealth, shows that these duties fill contractual gaps, saving on transaction costs. Although duties to shareholders are well settled, duties to other participants such as creditors or employees are heavily debated. In this paper, we use an agency theory framework to address the relative efficiency of a duty to creditors, a duty to refrain from wrongful trading, or contractual devices. Such an analysis makes clear what effect these rules have upon the behavior of shareholders and boards and whether these rules can efficiently address agency problems. The upshot of the analysis is that both types of rules protect creditors, but the same can be said of specific contractual solutions. It is therefore unclear if the rules mitigate costs above and beyond what could be achieved by contract. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the type of bankruptcy system matters as well. Creditor protection is best delivered via a board friendly bankruptcy system instead of with a creditor friendly system that includes a wrongful trading rule. The conclusion is that creditor duties, or wrongful trading rules, are superfluous, while private solutions are still inadequate to solve all the agency problems in a way that the proponents of both types of creditor protections aim for.

The multi-sided business of seeking and providing attention is fluid with rivalries crossing boundaries defined by the features of the products and services. It is also dynamic. Rivals introduce new products and services, some involving drastic and frequent innovation. Online attention rivals impose competitive constraints on one another. Product differentiation tempers the significance of these constraints in particular situations. But the relevant differentiation mainly involves aspects of the attention that is procured and sold rather than, necessarily, particular features of the products and services used for acquiring and delivering that attention. Antitrust analysis should consider these competitive constraints in evaluating market definition, market power, and the potential for anticompetitive effects. The existence of competition among attention rivals does not imply that antitrust should reduce the vigor with which it examines mergers and exclusionary practices among these platforms.

The resulting equilibria strongly resemble the empirical phenomena collectively known as panel effects-and in particular the observed regularity with which ideological diversity on a panel predicts greater moderation in voting behavior (even after controlling for the median voter's preferences). In our model, nonpivotal panel members with ideologies far from the median have the greatest incentive to acquire additional policy-relevant information where no one on a homogeneous panel would be willing to do so. The resulting information structure pushes deliberation and observed voting patterns toward apparent moderation. We illustrate the plausibility of our model by calibrating it to empirical data and explore various normative implications of our theory.","[Talley, Eric] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Spitzer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, Austin, TX 78705 USA.",mspitzer@law.utexas.edu; etalley@law.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,72,21,24,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The current study examines the relationship between the legalization of medical marijuana and traffic fatalities, the leading cause of death among Americans ages 5-34. The first full year after coming into effect, legalization is associated with an 8-11 percent decrease in traffic fatalities. The impact of legalization on traffic fatalities involving alcohol is larger and estimated with more precision than its impact on traffic fatalities that do not involve alcohol. Legalization is also associated with sharp decreases in the price of marijuana and alcohol consumption, which suggests that marijuana and alcohol are substitutes. Because alternative mechanisms cannot be ruled out, the negative relationship between legalization and alcohol-related traffic fatalities does not necessarily imply that driving under the influence of marijuana is safer than driving under the influence of alcohol.","[Anderson, D.

The rationale for the study is the fact that national and regional traffic growth-rate forecasts are the basis for policy formation, and inaccurate forecasts may lead to inappropriate policies. The data correspond to the period of 1996-2008 whereas the forecasting models were revised in 2001. The results reveal the following: (1) traffic growth-rate forecasts were more inaccurate in the period before the revision as compared to the period after the revision and underestimation is most common; (2) the naive growth-rate forecasts perform better than the official forecasts, but GDP growth-rate forecasts perform worse than the official forecasts; (3) the growth-rate forecasts are unbiased and efficient at the national level, but there are variations among regions and time periods. Overall, the Norwegian growth-rate forecast appears to perform fairly well in the short run, but the small inaccuracies that were observed may cause a problem in the long run, particularly in relation to the evaluation of the long-term effects of investments. We therefore advice that models need to be continually revised to accommodate more recent data such as international traffic and immigration which seem to greatly impact on the accuracy of models.

I also propose some heuristics implied by Luhmann's economic ontology, which are potentially interesting for methodological and theoretical strategies of modern economics.","Natl Res Univ, Dept Econ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Boldyrev, IA (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Dept Econ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",iboldyrev@hse.ru,"Boldyrev, Ivan/I-9071-2016",,,,,,55,8,9,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Five issues in extracting factors from a large panel of macro variables are addressed; namely, selection of a subset of the available information, incorporation of the forecast objective in constructing factors, specification of a multivariate forecast objective, data grouping before constructing factors, and selection of the number of factors in a data-driven way. Our empirical results show that each of these features helps to improve forecast accuracy, especially for the shortest and longest maturities. Factor-augmented methods perform well in relatively volatile periods, including the crisis period in 20089, when simpler models do not suffice. The macroeconomic information is exploited best by partial least squares methods, with principal component methods ranking second best. Reductions of mean squared prediction errors of 2030% are attained, compared to the NelsonSiegel model without macro factors.

The objective is to show that legal norms in the publicity sphere use inexact terms that, on occasion, do not adapt to reality. The methodology used was exploratory analysis reviewing literature relative to publicity as seen from communications and law and identifying standards in the European and national environment related to publicity. Conclusions are that a legalism exists leading to the fact that the law utilizes indistinctly terms such as publicity, information, propaganda and sales force that generate legal confusion in publicity matters. A possible solution would be that the administrative authorities along with the industry work together to clarify the terms of this discipline and generate legal security in this area, as is being done for digital publicity.","Univ Rey Juan Carlos Madrid, Fac Ciencias Comunicac, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Pastor, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos Madrid, Fac Ciencias Comunicac, Madrid, Spain.",esther.martinez.pastor@urjc.es,"Martinez-Pastor, Esther/AAX-4742-2021","Martinez-Pastor, Esther/0000-0002-2861-750X",,,,,35,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

One common approach uses the Mohring model of 1972 and its successors to optimise one or more aspects of the supply of transit services given various level of demand. This paper simulates the operation of a simple circular bus route using the equations of a basic Mohring type model and a Decision Support System (DSS) to endogenise demand under the assumption that there is a fixed demand for travel but commuters can choose between the bus and private vehicle. The selected approach recognises that demand for a particular mode of travel is predicated on the speed of the vehicle in service which is itself determined by the demand for that vehicle (in this model or boarding and alighting time) rather than being determined exogenously. This creates an iterative feedback mechanism whereby changes to the attributes of the bus and car alter mode choice and the speed in service of the bus which, in turn, alters mode choice. The simulation is used to predict changes to patronage and VRC under scenarios regarding changes to the transport network (in terms of fares and running costs, frequency and spacing of bus stops) using parameters from both a Multinomial Logit (MNL) and a Mixed Multinomial Logit (MMNL). The results demonstrate that there are large differences in the size and, in some cases, direction of predicted changes to patronage, VRC and revenue, depending on whether the parameters of the MNL or MMNL model are used.

The heart of the paper is a survey of European and Australian regional airlines, which we mirror with revealed experiences of bus operators. We aim to identify a number of elements in the contracting regimes that have exposed ambiguity and significant gaps in what the principal (e.g., transport department) expected, and what the agent (airline or bus operator) believed they were obliged to deliver. Ultimately airline and bus services are similar in that public authorities procure transport services that are desirable for the society but would be unprofitable without government involvement. In both sectors (theoretically fairly similar) public transport contracts are used, and those usually include obligations and performance measurements. In terms of similarities, one of the surveyed contract details that had a perceived high clarity in both industries was payment procedures and amongst those with rather poor clarity was also in both industries incentives to improve performance and grow patronage. We also show differences between regional air services and bus operations with regard to performance measurement and pre-specified obligations. Because of the strong safety culture around air services we find that regulation and trusting partnerships are even more important to aviation than to the bus sector. Because of the high level of trust but also because of simpler and more complete contracts in aviation, there is much less (re-)negotiation going on compared to the bus operations.

J,"Preston, J; Robins, D",,,,"Preston, John; Robins, Dawn",,,Evaluating the long term impacts of transport policy: The case of passenger rail privatisation,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Passenger rail; Privatisation; Welfare analysis,BRITISH RAIL; PRIVATIZATION,"Britain's national rail system was 'privatised' as a result of the 1993 Railways Act, with most of the organisational and ownership changes implemented by 1997. This paper examines the long term impacts of these changes. A key issue when examining long term changes is that of the counterfactual what would have happened if the changes had not occurred? A simple econometric model of the demand for passenger rail services was developed and used in conjunction with extrapolative methods for key variables such as fares and train km to determine demand-side counterfactuals. Extrapolative methods were also used to determine counterfactual infrastructure and train operation costs. Although our results are sensitive to the assumptions we have made concerning the counterfactual they suggest a number of impacts. Since privatisation, rail demand has grown strongly but our analysis indicates that transitional disruptions suppressed demand by around 9% over a prolonged period (1992/3 to 2005/6), whilst the Hatfield accident reduced demand by about 5%, albeit over a shorter period (2000/1 to 2006/7). A welfare analysis suggests that although consumers seem to have gained as a result of privatisation, for most years this has been offset by increases in costs. An exception is provided by the two years immediately before the Hatfield accident. Overall the loss in welfare since the reforms were introduced far exceeds the net receipts from the sale of rail businesses. Thus although the reforms have had advantages in terms of lower fares and better service levels than otherwise would have been the case, this appears to have been offset by increased infrastructure and train operations costs. The source of these high costs remains an area of speculation but appear to be related to aspects of both market and regulatory failure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that both transport capital and other public capital have positive direct effects, and it seems that the returns to public investment are largely diminishing with development, but other public capital in West China has greater economic returns than transport network capital. Also, significant negative spillovers of transport network capital can be found, due to the migration of production factors. However, positive spillovers of other public capital can be captured for West China.

Unlike the individual quota system advocated by many economists, the policy encouraged coordinated fishing and did not require a detailed assignment of rights. We model the decision to join and behavior under cooperative and independent fishing. The data confirm our key predictions: the co-op attracted the least skilled fishermen, consolidated and coordinated effort among its most efficient members, and provided shared infrastructure. We estimate that resulting gains in rent were at least 33 percent. Some independents were disadvantaged by the co-op's formation, however, which prompted them to oppose it in court. We analyze the source of their disadvantage and provide guidance for designing fishery reform that leads to Pareto improvements, enabling reform without losers.","[Deacon, Robert T.; Costello, Christopher] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Parker, Dominic P.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Deacon, RT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,,47,30,33,0,30,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

After analysing local housing markets as well as socio-demographic development of the selected case studies from an interregional perspective, sociospatial processes are highlighted from an intra-urban perspective. The paper goes on to explore different types of residential satisfaction and potential residential mobility. A main emphasis is put on the interpretation of these types against the backdrop of different housing conditions.

Based on an environmental coalignment perspective, we argue that boundary-spanning search is a key activity for new ventures so that they can deal with different market forces to enhance their breakthrough innovations. Most of the hypotheses proposed are supported by the results of a survey of 227 ventures in the high-technology zone of Shenzhen. We found that boundary-spanning search is not only associated positively with breakthrough innovations of new ventures but also plays a significant role in influencing the effect of market forces on both types of innovations. This paper offers insight into the way in which new ventures can achieve both market innovations and technological innovations through different types of boundary-spanning search. Furthermore, this study argues that boundary-spanning search is an important tool that enables new ventures to create more innovative performance under competitive environments.","[Lin, Chen-Ju] Tzu Chi Coll Technol, Dept Accounting Informat, Hualien 970, Taiwan; [Li, Ci-Rong] Fujian Normal Univ, Fac Management, Fuqing Branch, Fuqing City 350300, Fujian, Peoples R China",Tzu Chi University of Science & Technology; Fujian Normal University,"Lin, CJ (通讯作者)，Tzu Chi Coll Technol, Dept Accounting Informat, 880,Sec 2,Chien Kuo Rd, Hualien 970, Taiwan.",jzlin0208@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,18,20,11,157,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The correlation between the measures is much higher for larger airports than for smaller ones.

In a financial liberalized housing market, the housing mortgage loan implies insurance function to homeowners through the default option. Larger expected volatilities in the population imply a higher value of the default option. When analyzing the impact of the long-term population development on housing prices, the traditional deterministic population forecasting employed by previous research provides limited credibility. By means of the newly developed stochastic population forecasting methodology and counterfactual numerical simulations, we found a huge volatility associated with long-term population forecasting.

In case of high parent control, marketing managers' involvement with strategic marketing activities, such as brand strategy, positioning and new brand development, tended to be limited. On the other hand reporting to the headquarters was quite often mentioned as one of the most frequent activities of the marketing department. Opposite pattern was typical for marketing managers working in subsidiaries with low parent control. At the same time both group of marketers differed also in ambitions they had, as well as in knowledge and skills gaps of their junior colleagues they perceived. The findings are of high importance especially for HR managers of multinational corporations and for business faculties. Working in subsidiaries with high parent control will be more suitable for employees who prefer standardized tasks and who do not mind following strict regulations. On the other hand, working in subsidiaries with low parent control should be more suitable for employees who appreciate less structured tasks, who enjoy complexity of marketing and who are strong in strategic and creative thinking. However the findings of the study can be useful also for top management of multinationals who compare pros and cons of strategies of standardization and localization.","[Karlicek, Miroslav; Chytkova, Zuzana] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Mkt, Prague, Czech Republic; [Horejs, Nikola] Millward Brown, New York, NY USA; [Mohelska, Hana] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Fischer, Jakub] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; University of Hradec Kralove; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Karlícek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Mkt, Prague, Czech Republic.",miroslav.karlicek@vse.cz; zuzana.chytkova@vse.cz; nikola.horejs@cz.millwardbrown.com; hana.mohelska@uhk.cz; fischerj@vse.cz,"Fischer, Jakub/J-7874-2012; Karlicek, Miroslav/AAK-2659-2020; Chytkova, Zuzana/JWP-6522-2024; Mohelska, Hana/F-9896-2019","Mohelska, Hana/0000-0003-0441-0712; Fischer, Jakub/0000-0003-4658-1974",,,,,10,5,5,4,39,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In 2006 these industries (including production of beverages) employed on average more than 17 thousand people, which is around 13% of employment in Estonian manufacturing industries. Meat, dairy and bakery industries can be characterised as having few dominant players along with a high number of small companies. The aim of this paper is to outline the major development challenges of the Estonian food manufacturing industries in the light of innovative processes in large and small companies. Estonian food manufacturing industries have successfully invested into major process and product innovations. These changes have enabled to offer modern packages of high quality and a wide variety of products in terms of package size, taste, and readiness for usage. The innovations have also improved food safety and structure, nutritional value, and offered more efficient ways to provide consumers with differentiated products.","Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Roolaht, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Narva Rd 4-A116, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia.",tonu.roolaht@ut.ee,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,19,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Dual discounting involves discounting carbon and monetary values differently; stand level modeling efforts show that it improves the profitability of afforestation projects. However, these stand level results may not hold across other age classes and stocking levels. Using a partial, spatial equilibrium model of the Norwegian forest sector, we analyze the impacts of a dual discounting scheme on climate change mitigation efforts.

However, Polish farms had higher intensity of crop production and profitability of land (over 50%) and productive assets (by 84.3 percentage points). Proprietary structure of Polish and Lithuanian farms were not favourable, but in Poland the share of low mobility of fixed assets was greater, resulting in a much lower efficiency of capital (more than 2-fold).

Data used in this study are taken from European Judicial System report published by The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice. In this study two stage DEA is used. In the first stage, the efficiency of justice service is measured by data envelopment analysis. In the second stage, the results obtained from DEA are regressed with variables affecting the courts by Tobit regression model. In the DEA analysis while number of judges and office staff are used as inputs, resolved cases are used as outputs. In the Tobit regression model while the results obtained from DEA are used as dependent variable, judge salaries, judges' basic education and number of courts are used as explanatory variables. According to Tobit regression model, it's found that there is a positive and significant relation between efficiency of justice service and salaries of judges in European countries. The increase in judge salaries is significant for the efficiency of courts, but it certainly is not only solution for the efficiency of justice services.","Pamukkale Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Denizli, Turkey",Pamukkale University,"Deyneli, F (通讯作者)，Pamukkale Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Denizli, Turkey.",fdeyneli@pau.edu.tr,"Deyneli, Fatih/A-2366-2016; Deyneli, Fatih/AAD-3180-2019","Deyneli, Fatih/0000-0003-1867-1075;",,,,,35,42,44,0,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In a second step it examines some broader theoretical implications of popular contestation, government responses and processes of regime transformation in both countries. Events over the past 15 months further question dominant approaches to the study of collective action in authoritarian contexts; however, contrary to recent claims, they fail to invalidate in part even confirm structural non-culturalist explanations for the longevity of authoritarian regimes in Arab countries. Above all, the contribution argues that some critical differences between the anciens regimes in Egypt and Tunisia account for the partly divergent dynamics and outcomes of change so far. At the same time, rather similar long-term processes of state formation have shaped the politics of both countries in ways that differ substantially from most other Arab countries.","IEP Grenoble, CNRS PACTE, F-38040 Grenoble, France",,"Kienle, E (通讯作者)，IEP Grenoble, CNRS PACTE, BP 48, F-38040 Grenoble, France.",Eberhard.Kienle@iep-grenoble.fr,,,,,,,77,13,17,0,81,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

A defendant, who is uninformed about the level of harm that he has caused, makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to an informed plaintiff. If the parties cannot agree on a settlement and the case goes to trial, the judge decides how much effort to exert in discovering the actual damages. We show that, under very general assumptions, this model exhibits multiple equilibria. In some equilibria, the judge exerts less effort and more cases settle out of court, whereas in others the opposite occurs. We also show that the judge prefers the low effort equilibria with high settlement rate and argue that a managerial judge could easily steer the parties towards low effort equilibria.

I find persistent evidence for the first two implications in how the sex composition of national legislatures differs across electoral mechanisms (winner-take-all chambers employ a greater proportion of males) and in how reelection prospects for U.S. representatives differ by sex (females enjoy longer expected service in a winner-take-all chamber).

The case of cost overruns in Dutch transport infrastructure projects,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cost overruns; Infrastructure; Ex-post studies; The Netherlands,LIE,"This paper examines three independent explanatory variables and their relation with cost overrun in order to decide whether this is different for Dutch infrastructure projects compared to worldwide findings. The three independent variables are project type (road, rail, and fixed link projects), project size (measured in terms of estimated costs) and the length of the project implementation phase. For Dutch projects, average cost overrun is 10.6% for rail, 18.6% for roads and 21.7% for fixed links. For project size, small Dutch projects have the largest average percentage cost overruns but in terms of total overrun, large projects have a larger share. The length of the implementation phase and especially the length of the pre-construction phase are important determinants of cost overruns in the Netherlands. With each additional year of pre-construction, percentage cost overrun increases by five percentage points. In contrast, the length of the construction phase has hardly any influence on cost overruns. This is an important contribution to current knowledge about cost overruns, because the period in which projects are most prone to cost overruns is narrowed down considerably, at least in the Netherlands. This means that to determine the causes and cures of overruns one should focus on the period. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Cantarelli, C. C.; van Wee, B.; Molin, E. J.

Conclusions are that in the area of international commerce, it is probable that family businesses in Zulia encounter greater difficulties in promoting their expansion, above all due to the influence exercised by some psychological and cultural characteristics of the family businessman that lead him or her to conduct the exporting process in a slower, more conservative way.","[Romero B, Jenny; Bracho, Neida] Univ Zulia, Inst Invest, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; [Hernandez, Lissette] CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia",Universidad de la Costa,"Romero, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Inst Invest, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",jennyfrb@yahoo.com; lissettehf@yahoo.es; neidabracho@hotmail.com,,"Hernandez Fernandez, Lissette/0000-0003-0839-6057",,,,,20,0,0,0,8,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

On average, firms lose 2.3 percent of their market values when an antitrust investigation is uncovered. This corresponds to a total value loss of Euro4.3 billion. Overall, the fines imposed by the legal system contribute to only 12 percent of this total value loss. Another 55 percent of the total value loss is explained by the lost conspiracy-generated profits. We find that the residual 33 percent of the total value loss is explained by reputation loss.

This article examines how labour market repositioning policies contributed to this recovery. Following Karl Polanyi's conceptualization of the economy as an 'instituted process', I explore how these policies function as state-driven redistributive strategies aimed at triggering reciprocal responses from employers and workers within the putatively self-regulatory local labour market. The Singapore case foregrounds the causal roles of place- and time-specific state-firm-labour interactions in precluding what Polanyi calls society's 'double movement' against market-driven regulation. This successful preclusion exemplifies how the conditions and relations of economic production are not reproduced solely through market exchange; to sustain the capital accumulation dynamic, complementary acts of reciprocity and redistribution from different socio-economic stakeholders could be equally, if not more, important.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Lim, KF (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 W Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",keanfan@interchange.ubc.ca,,"Lim, Kean Fan/0000-0002-7979-2068",,,,,63,5,6,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Thus, the existence of a more competitive environment significantly decreases procurement costs in Turkey. Second, when auctions are open to foreign participation, the auction price tends to be lower.

(3) Advertising is significantly associated with lower idiosyncratic risk for firms with higher idiosyncratic risk. (4) R&D is significantly associated with higher idiosyncratic risk for firms with median and higher idiosyncratic risk. In summary, our evidence shows that both advertising and R&D have a stronger effect on firms with higher beta- and idiosyncratic risk than on those with lower beta- and idiosyncratic risk, respectively. Our findings are useful to help both management executives and investors. Firm managers can allocate limited resources more efficiently to reduce their firm risk; investors could exert their influence on firm's senior executives to make decisions that are beneficial to stock returns.","[Peng, Chi-Lu] Chung Hua Univ, Dept Finance, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; [Chen, Miao-Ling; Wei, An-Pin] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan",Chung Hua University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Peng, CL (通讯作者)，Chung Hua Univ, Dept Finance, 707,Sec 2,Wu Fu Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",miaoling@mail.nsysu.edu.tw; chilupeng@gmail.com; anpinwei@gmail.com,"Peng, Chi-Lu/J-3259-2019; Peng, Chi-Lu/AAO-7788-2020; Li, jiaqi/JOZ-6395-2023","Peng, Chi-Lu/0000-0003-1487-4625",,,,,68,8,8,1,29,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The lease financing industry dropped dramatically during the years immediately following the outbreak of the crisis, threatening in this way the business furtherance of many NFI. The literature is rather scarce in the approach to the management of finance lease exposure risks. This study carries on the cycle of extensive authors' research in the field of credit risk associated to lease financing exposures. The calibration of quantitative factors used in internal credit scoring models for NFI funding is essential for this type of factors in order to be effective in the ex-ante identification of default or insolvency cases. It is in this context, we have also tested the efficiency increase of quantitative factors by incorporating the Z-score function in the internal rating system used for financing decisions.","[Chiriac, Petronel; Dardac, Nicolae] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,petronelchiriac@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",,,978-606-19-0103-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,116,120,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEN33,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317436900024,0

The analysis disentangles good macroeconomics news from bad news and, simultaneously, considers time intervals with and without confounding announcements from other sources. Releases from both institutes lead to an immediate response of returns occurring 15 seconds after the announcements, i.e. within the first possible time interval. Announcements of both institutes are also clearly and immediately reflected in the volatility, which remains at a significantly higher level for approximately 2 minutes.

This bias arises from the fact that accounts are terminated when the existing system, but not the proposed new system, detects a fraudulent transaction. This therefore flatters the estimated detection rate of the existing system. We develop more formal estimators that can be used to compare the existing and proposed new systems without risking this effect. We also assess the magnitude of the bias.

Furthermore, it is assumed that 90% of our decisions are taken at the subconscious level, thus even the most sincere answers might be pointing in the wrong direction. The subconscious mechanisms underlying the decision making process have long been inaccesible to marketers but things are going to change with the emergence of neuromarketing.

The analysis uses quarterly data for South Africa. The paper reveals that government authorities in South Africa are more likely to react more quickly when the budget is in deficit than when in surplus, and that the stabilisation measures used by government are fairly neutral at low deficit levels; that is, at deficit levels of 4 per cent of GDP and below. We conclude that the assumption that adjustment towards equilibrium is always present and of the same strength under all circumstances, is not valid in the case of fiscal data on South Africa; and that that fiscal sustainability in South Africa has been attained at the expense of a reduction in the ratio of expenditure to GDP on education, and a relatively constant ratio of expenditure to GDP on health. The paper noted that a priori one would expect that such a decline in the allocations to sectors which could stimulate growth and which in turn could generate future revenue, may pose a threat to the accumulated fiscal space. In South Africa the main fiscal challenge, therefore, is to find ways through which the recent gains in fiscal solvency can be consolidated.","[Jibao, Samuel S.; Schoeman, Niek J.; Naraidoo, Ruthira] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Jibao, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Naraidoo, Ruthira/AAO-6265-2021","Naraidoo, Ruthira/0000-0001-8915-269X",,,,,41,6,7,1,10,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Hence, greater role is played by Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), on the one hand gearing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth through banks' sector and on the other hand making economy more vulnerable to global financial fluctuations, causing asymmetric shocks, resulting in current account deficit.

Research indicates, however, that many mergers have not resulted in the expected benefits, in part because organizations have neglected the human resource aspects of the change. Although M&A-transactions are characterized as highly emotional events, research on the emotional dimension of these events is still rare. This is especially the case as far as cross-border activities are concerned. This paper describes the typical effects of the merger process on the people involved and, identifies the necessity of considering the human resource factor within the mergers and acquisitions transactions. Recent M&A studies on human issues frequently call upon the 'merger syndrome' as a typical post-merger phenomenon and a concept used to describe the - usually negative - effects on the attitudes and behavior of employees in the affected organizations. In order to identify the potential causes of 'merger syndrome', I have looked at existing research literature which analyze the soft or human side of M&A as often one of the most problematic issues. Drawing on elements provided by the literature on the 'merger syndrome', this paper also introduces an analytical framework for investigating the role of emotions in international mergers and acquisitions transactions. The paper ends up with an overview of existing empirical studies to 'merger syndrome'.","[Sacek, Alen] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Doctoral Program Global Management & Leadership, D-70771 Leinfelden Echterdingen, Germany",,,alen.sacek@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,19,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,566,575,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100051,0

This paper proposes to analyze the effect of the quality of interaction and shared values on the graduate's identification as well as the effects this has on his/her commitment and loyalty toward the institution. Empirical testing of the proposed causal model was made using Structural Equation Modeling. Results confirm the importance of relationship management and the relevance of constructs derived from this approach as key variables that influence university performance. Specifically, the quality of student-professor interaction and shared values have a positive influence on the graduate-university identification (G-U), which in turn affects graduate commitment and loyalty to the educational institution.","[Schlesinger, Ma Walesska; Cervera, Taulet Amparo] Univ Valencia, Dept Comercializac & Invest Mercados, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Iniesta Bonillo, Ma Angeles] Univ Almeria, Almeria, Spain",University of Valencia; Universidad de Almeria,"Schlesinger, MW (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Comercializac & Invest Mercados, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",walesskas@gmail.com; amparo.cervera@uv.es; mi-niesta@ual.es,"Iniesta-Bonillo, M.

Political leadership, institutions and design are important conditions that must be considered in the context of one another, but they are also conditions that will change and be influenced by the planning process. Drawing on case studies of janmarg BRT in Ahmedabad, and the Delhi BRT in India's capital, we demonstrate the role of the planning process in influencing BRT project outcomes. The planning process is too often viewed as a sequence of steps in which design, institutions and leadership provide an unchanging framework in which planning proceeds. This 'one-dimensional' view needs be re-framed in 'three-dimensions.' It must explicitly also consider approach (i.e. strategy and tactics) and timing (i.e. both moment of action and duration). These in turn reshape design, institutions and leadership. Findings suggest that such a 'three-dimensional' planning process, when well timed, incremental and pragmatic may help to overcome institutional and design weaknesses, and to solidify political support. This improves viability and long-term system sustainability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using an integrated transport and land-use model calibrated for the Stockholm region, we explore whether this has any significant impact on the CBA outcome, and in particular on the relative ranking of rail and road investments. Our results indicate that induced demand has a larger impact on the benefit of rail investments than on the benefit of road investments. The effect on the relative ranking is still limited for two reasons. First, the number of houses that are built over 20 30 years is limited in comparison to the size of the existing housing stock. Second, the location of most of the new houses is not affected by any single infrastructure investment, since the latter has a marginal effect on total accessibility in a city with a mature transport system. A second aim of this paper is to investigate the robustness of the relative CBA ranking of rail and road investments, with respect to the planning policy in the region 25 years ahead. While the results suggest that this ranking is surprisingly robust, there is a tendency that the net benefit of rail investments is more sensitive to the future planning policy than road investments. Our results also underscore that the future land-use planning in the region in general has a considerably stronger impact on accessibility and car use than individual road or rail investments have.

The new HSR alternative (which started to operate in February 2008) competes directly with one of the densest airline domestic markets in the world, and its introduction produced substantial improvements in level of service, achieving reductions in travel time of more than 50% over the conventional train. A specifically designed revealed preference (RP) survey coupled with highly precise measurements of the level-of-service variables for all alternatives allowed us to estimate progressively more flexible models, the specification of which also considered different interactions of socioeconomic variables (and other important factors affecting mode choice) with the typical level-of-service attributes. We also examined income effect through the introduction of the expenditure rate multiplying all time components. This specification allowed us to analyse the income elasticity of the willingness to pay (WTP) in order to provide useful information to quantify users' benefits during the lifespan of a given project. We found, as expected, that HSR and air transport users exhibit substantially higher values for saving travel time than bus travellers. Also as expected, savings of waiting time are more valued than savings of access time, and the latter more valued than savings of in-vehicle travel time. We were also able to demonstrate the relevance of considering a differentiated analysis for travellers that did not pay for their travel expenses, providing a theoretically sound explanation for the large differences encountered in WTP with respect to other travellers. Finally, the obtaining of the elasticity values for the choice probabilities provided us valuable information to understand competition in this market. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Semi-structured interviews with 50 Danish adolescents were analyzed by means of deductive-inductive thematic narrative analysis based on the sodo-ecological approach. The results show three groups in line with the market-diffusion model: intended early car users, intended early license holders and later car users, and intended late license holders and car users. The first group are car enthusiasts who associate cars with high instrumental, affective, symbolic, and relational values, have car-oriented social networks, and imagine a car-oriented lifestyle. The second group are car pragmatists, who associate cars with high instrumental and relational values, perceive car expenses as a barrier, and imagine a car-oriented lifestyle only in the long-term. The third group are car skeptics, who have low interest in cars and imagine a cycling-oriented future. Policy implications concern (i) promoting shared-responsibility among individuals, public bodies, communities and policy makers towards a sustainable future, (ii) applying a policy-package comprising complementary policy measures to target the three identified groups, (iii) relying on social networks for knowledge propagation and success of policy measures and educational campaigns, and (iv) promoting a tangible future vision based on sustainable modes.

As a result, regional planners have started to integrate the governance of airport regions into their core work. The spatial developments around Schiphol Airport have been governed by a joint initiative of local actors for several decades. In this in-depth case study, we use the multi-level perspective from transition studies to draw lessons on the governance of airport regions. Our findings uncovered the rise (1980s-1990s) and the fall (2000s-2010s) of a strong governance structure: the Governance Forum Schiphol (Bestuursforum Schiphol). At its height it was able to navigate through a complex playing field of overlapping and competing governance structures. Its initial strength, the establishment of a real estate development company which enabled the implementation of its regional planning vision, also turned out to be its weakness. In the first decades of its existence, this connection with real estate development made it a central arena to which other emerging governance arrangements, addressing other issues, could connect. In the long run, it prevented the Governance Forum to adjust to changes at the landscape level and other governance arrangements emerged addressing similar issues. Currently, the platform is to be disassembled. The paper draws lessons for and raises questions on the future development of government structures for airport regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The eurozone crisis has been widely interpreted as the result of a mismatch between international monetary integration and a concomitant lack of fiscal integration, or more broadly as the result of a European Union which is economically integrated, yet politically fragmented. The prospect of a 1930s-style descent into division and nationalism has formed the backdrop against which moves towards extensive integration at the supranational level have been made. Polanyi diagnosed the political effects of monetary integration through his analysis of the gold standard system in The great transformation, making it important that we unpack his analysis and consider carefully how a Polanyian perspective might apply to the eurozone today. I argue that Polanyi encourages us to look beyond 'monetary vs. fiscal' and 'economic vs. political' characterizations of European integration, and instead to examine how such oppositions are formed in the first place and how they constrain political debate, particularly in terms of how 'sound money' is established as the highest policy concern. Through a re-reading of Polanyi's distinction between 'all-purpose' and 'special-purpose' money, I highlight how, despite the huge efforts undertaken to preserve the identity of the euro as an all-purpose currency, the eurozone crisis has rendered visible a series of latent conflicts between the different functions of money. This analysis moves us away from the 'monetary vs. fiscal' integration view of the eurozone crisis and towards a more open study of how the various possible purposes of money are being articulated and challenged, offering some limited hope for alternatives to the current eurozone policy agenda.","Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Holmes, C (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",c.holmes@warwick.ac.uk,,"Holmes, Christopher/0000-0002-1248-0983",,,,,55,15,15,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

For family migrants, the decision to return is highly influenced by changes in their marital status. Using administrative panel data on the entire population of recent family immigrants to the Netherlands, we estimate the effect of a divorce and remarriage on the hazard of leaving the Netherlands using a 'timing of events' model. The model allows for correlated unobserved heterogeneity across the migration, the divorce and remarriage processes. The family migrants are divided into five groups based on the Human Development Index (HDI) of their country of birth. We find that both divorce and remarriage increase return of family migrants from less-developed countries. Remarriage of family migrants from developed countries makes them more prone to stay. Young migrants are influenced most by a divorce.

Attention centres on issue-salience and policy framing in party manifestos in state-wide and regional elections. The findings reveal a significant rise in issue-salience in parties' Westminster election programmes; with right- and left-of-centre parties increasingly advocating mixed economy approaches to rail transport as part of the wider rise of 'valence politics'. The analysis also reveals how devolution may lead to the territorialisation of rail transport policy. In contrast to parties' Westminster programmes, regional manifesto discourse evidences a general rejection of neo-liberalism and stronger support for state control and/or not-for-profit rail operators. Overall, the findings underline the formative nexus between political representation and public policy - and show how, in the wake of state decentralisation, policy framing is contingent on 'regional' socio-economic factors and party politics, including state-building by civic nationalist parties.

Given the wide range of design options for fuel surcharge schemes, the reduced price transparency and the question of fair cost recovery, fuel surcharges have become a consumer protection issue. The paper reviews the regulatory approach to fuel surcharges in Brazil, the European Union, Japan and the United States. Further, it addresses the complexity of attempts to construct fuel surcharge schemes that rely on estimates of per-passenger fuel costs. The paper concludes that regulatory activities should aim to include fuel surcharges in all initial fare quotes and advertising.

In this paper, I review the interlocking world city network model (IWCNM) and three additional bipartite projection-based measures of the world city network, considering which theoretical conception of the world city network' construct each can validly measure. I introduce a new Stata command, onemode, to compute these four measures, and use them to produce world city networks from three publicly available datasets on advanced producer services, international organisations, and engineering and architecture firms. The results suggest that each projection-based measure is potentially valid, but only for a corresponding understanding of the world city network. Researchers are encouraged to clearly define what they mean when invoking the phrase the world city network,' and only then selecting a measurement that is valid.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Neal, Z (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, 316 Phys Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",zpneal@msu.edu,"Neal, Zachary P/C-3165-2009",,,,,,40,30,30,7,50,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In a spatial context, firms can price discriminate using location-contingent pricing. Nonlocalized competition implies that neighboring effects are not relevant to firms. This paper analyzes spatial price discrimination and location choices in the spokes model. Highly asymmetric location patterns are one outcome if the number of firms is sufficiently high: in that case, one firm supplies a generally appealing product whereas others focus on a specific niche. Moreover, multiple equilibria arise for intermediate values of the number of firms. In this case, the location patterns do not always globally minimize the sum of transport costs: asymmetric configurations distribute more efficiently the cost between firms.","Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Reggiani, C (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",carlo.reggiani@manchester.ac.uk,,"Reggiani, Carlo/0000-0002-5069-3592",,,,,27,10,10,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

In this research, two studies examine the influence of the numerical format (either percentages or absolute numbers) presented on FOP-reduced nutrient content claims and the moderating influence of consumers' numeracy levels (i.e., consumers' ability to interpret numbers). Low numerate consumers are more strongly influenced by the label's numerical format, but results differ across nutrition attributes linked to cardiovascular disease risk. For saturated fat, low numerate consumers had more favorable evaluations of the product that had a label presented in a percent format compared to an absolute unit format. In contrast, the moderating effect of numeracy had little effect on the format of reduced sodium claims.

The paper also attributes the influence to Bork's emphasis on neutral principles for judicial decision making, to Bork's service as solicitor general, to the delayed publication of his book until after that service, and to the appointment of John Paul Stevens to the Court.

It aims to address the problem that differences between the national contract laws of the Member States may constitute an obstacle for the European Internal Market. This paper develops a model of the institutional competition in European contract law and uses it to addresses the question as to whether an optional European contract code and the CESL are economically desirable for European contract law. To do so I examine the transaction costs involved in the process of choosing an applicable law that European businesses face when they conduct cross-border transactions in the European Internal Market. I then describe how these transaction costs shape the competitive environment, i.e. what I refer to as the European market for contract laws in which the contracting parties choose a law to govern their cross-border contracts. Having identified this environment and the competitive forces operating within it, I propose a model, the Cycle of European Contract Law. I use this model to analyze the competitive processes that take place in the European market for contract laws. Based on my results I make recommendations for the optimal implementation of an optional European contract code and the CESL in European contract law.","[Wulf, Alexander J.] Bucerius Law Sch, Hamburg, Germany; [Wulf, Alexander J.] SRH Hsch, Berlin, Germany",,"Wulf, AJ (通讯作者)，Bucerius Law Sch, Hamburg, Germany.",alexander.wulf@law-school.de,,"Wulf, Alexander J./0000-0001-6477-2761",,,,,62,6,7,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The important explanatory factors relate to PRI&U researcher's additional support after the technology transfer, the potential absorptive capacity of the company, and the company's previous R&D partnership experience with the same PRI&U.

The multi-layered framework discerns three levels: metrics', interpretations', and practices'. We argue that many comparative studies mainly focus on metrics, while researching interpretations and practices instead - and how these three levels influence each other through processes of actualisation and counteractualisation - would enhance our knowledge on gentrification.

Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with foreign crew from a range of South Korean fishing vessels as well as other industry individuals.

Boosting is one possible method of using high-dimensional data for this purpose. It is a stage-wise additive modelling procedure, which, in a linear specification, becomes a variable selection device that iteratively adds the predictors with the largest contribution to the fit. Using data for the United States, the euro area and Germany, we assess the performance of boosting when forecasting a wide range of macroeconomic variables. Moreover, we analyse to what extent its forecasting accuracy depends on the method used for determining its key regularization parameter: the number of iterations. We find that boosting mostly outperforms the autoregressive benchmark, and that K-fold cross-validation works much better as stopping criterion than the commonly used information criteria.

We used SFpark, a federally funded experiment in market-priced parking in San Francisco, to study how changes in meter prices influenced on-street parking availability. We supervised observations of more than 13,400 vehicles parked on a subset of dynamically priced and control blocks at three points in time during 2011 and 2012. Repeated-observation, change-on-change regressions show that when prices rose, the block-level occupancy of parking fell, suggesting that SFpark worked as intended. But blocks where prices rose showed no discernible improvement in parking availability the share of time at least one space on a block face was vacant. Price increases also had no association with other factors we would expect to be influenced by price, including parking duration, vehicle turnover, and carpooling. These relationships were robust to controlling for the parking zone, the previous price level, nearby employment, and the weather. A price system designed to improve average occupancy may not improve parking availability, and thus may not reduce cruising. Cities trying to reduce cruising may need to adjust prices based on minimum vacancy, and price changes may need to be larger in many cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, from the perspective of the time series regression, the Value-at-Risk factor can also demonstrate the variation of the stock market, especially for the larger companies in the Taiwan stock market.","[Chen, Dar-Hsin] Natl Taipei Univ, Coll Business, Dept Business Adm, Taipei 237, Taiwan; [Chen, Chun-Da] Tennessee State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Wu, Su-Chen] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Grad Inst Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Taipei University; Tennessee State University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Chen, CD (通讯作者)，Tennessee State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, AWC Campus,330 10th Ave North, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",dhchen@mail.ntpu.edu.tw; cchen2@tnstate.edu,"Chen, Chun-Da D/O-1454-2017; Chen, Chun-Da Derek/HZK-9205-2023","Chen, Chun-Da D/0000-0001-8527-8375; Chen, Chun-Da Derek/0000-0001-8527-8375",,,,,42,11,11,1,25,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The regression results obtained using data on agricultural R&D projects in Korea suggest a need for varying R&D management strategies according to the performance objective (the outcome index) of each R&D project. The quality of R&D personnel appears to be the most common and effective source of agricultural competitiveness.

This observation suggests that while demands for new drugs against NTDs continue to grow, there is still a low profit margin for any innovation produced. As a result, there are few incentives for private industrial investments in drugs R&D for neglected diseases, and thus, urgent need for a new set of mechanisms to drive research towards these often forgotten issues. One possible solution comes in the form of a collaborative partnership where drugs for neglected disease are seen by public, private and philanthropic organs as global public goods. In this scenario, multilateral collective action creates an artificial market where there are fewer risks for innovators and more results for benefactors. Coupled with policy-based push-pull mechanisms, these collaborations, like the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), mitigate the challenges of a failed market and represents a paradigm for other potential sustainable development collaborations, post-2015.","Sci Po, Paris Sch Int Affairs, Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Le, J (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris Sch Int Affairs, Paris, France.",jimmy.le@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,20,2,3,0,29,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Empirical evidence, however, is limited. Using establishment-level data on decision rights over information technology investments, I find that a high net value of adaptation is strongly associated with delegation, as are local information advantages and firm-wide diversification; in contrast, a high net value of within-firm coordination is correlated with centralization. Variation across establishments within firms is widespread: most firms are neither fully centralized nor fully decentralized. Delegation patterns are largely consistent with standard team-theory predictions; however, certain findings, such as a negative correlation between delegation and firm size, call for a consideration of agency costs as well.","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"McElheran, K (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",kmcelheran@hbs.edu,"McElheran, Kristina/I-5257-2016",,,,,,67,37,43,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We show that his diversion ratio between two products (A and B) can be, and has been, interpreted in two distinct ways: first, as the fraction of customers leaving Product A that switch to Product B, and second, as the increased sales of B as a fraction of the lost sales of A. To establish a proper relationship between lost and captured profits, which is the main purpose of the diversion ratio, the first interpretation does not work. This ambiguity surrounding the concept of the diversion ratio has given rise to confusion (although algebraic elaborations in the literature are usually more precise than the language used). Practitioners relying on customer surveys to estimate diversion ratios need to be aware of the potential pitfalls when tailoring the survey questions to the incorrect definition of the ratio.","[Niels, Gunnar] Oxera, Oxford, England",,,adtenkate@hotmail.com; gunnar.niels@oxera.com,,,,,,,4,2,3,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

A buyer group allows retailers to commit credibly to increased input prices, which serve to reduce combined final output to the monopoly level; increased input costs are then refunded from suppliers to retailers through slotting allowances or rebates. The stability of such an 'implied cartel' depends on the retailers' incentives to source their inputs secretly from a supplier outside of the buyer group arrangement at lower input prices.

During the same years many poor countries, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, experienced a sharp increase in homicides. Using panel data for a sample of 38 developed and developing countries, I find a statistically significantly positive relationship between an increase in the number of criminal deportees received by a country and a corresponding increase in that country's homicide rate, and I establish causality through instrumental variables. My analysis suggests that about 23 percent of the increase in the homicide rate in developing countries between 1985 and 1996 can be attributed to the increase in the inflow of criminal deportees from the United States.

Drawing from the health halo and information disclosure literatures, the potential positive consumer outcomes associated with the disclosure of calorie (only) and additional nutrient information are examined. Results across four studies show that while most consumers underestimate calorie levels of restaurant menu items, the degree of underestimation is substantially greater for sodium. The provision of sodium content levels for menu items, in addition to calorie information, influences purchase intentions and choices of consumers with high health risk levels, but has little effect on other consumers. Reducing Americans' average daily intake of sodium (currently 3,400 mg) to the recommended level of 2,300 mg could eliminate 11 million cases of high blood pressure and prevent 92,000 annual deaths (Palar and Sturm 2009).

We use structural VAR approach with identification scheme based on a priori restrictions that are derived from theoretical framework of Post-Keynesian macroeconomic model. Our main hypothesis, which is confirmed in the empirical analysis, is that the accumulation of capital in Croatia was primarily determined by income from labor; i.e. that Croatia had wage-led accumulation. We also found that labor market dynamics was dominantly influenced by demand side shocks and that positive effects of the rise in exports, resulting from the gain in competitiveness (after reducing wage share in income) outweigh negative effects of weaker demand on the capacity utilization. So in our opinion export share increase should become policy prioriry, as domestic demand is currently constrained by high private and public debt levels. To the extent that increase in exports might require decline in the relative share of labor, negative impact on the investments in non-tradable sector would need to be offset with higher investments in tradable sector of Croatian economy.","[Vujcic, Boris; Zrnc, Jurica] Croatian Natl Bank, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Vujcic, Boris] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Deskar-Skrbic, Milan] Erste & Steiermark Bank Dd, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Ratkovski, Zvonimir] Deloitte Croatia, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited,"Vujcic, B (通讯作者)，Croatian Natl Bank, Trg Hrvatskih Velikana 3, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",boris.vujcic@hnb.hr; mdskrbic@erstebank.com; zvonimir.ratkovski@gmail.com; jurica.zrnc@hnb.hr,"Vujcic, Boris/Q-4902-2019",,,,,,17,6,6,0,7,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

However, evaluating the effect of such private security measures remains understudied in the economics of crime literature. Unlike most previous studies, the present analysis considers four separate measures of private security: security guards, detectives and investigators, security system installers, and locksmiths. The effects of laws allowing the concealed carrying of weapons are also evaluated. As private security efforts are potentially endogenous to crime rates, dynamic GMM panel data models are estimated in addition to structural (non-instrumented) regressions. The empirical results suggest that the impact of private security efforts generally varies across crime types, though there appears to be a robust negative relationship between the employment of security system installers and the rate of property offenses.

The market growth, saturation and competition model is developed for the markets of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for the time period 2000-2012. Commonly used insurance metrics like density and penetration transformed into market based factors describing the strength of market growth and premium-to-salary market saturation. Additional market growth and saturation factors and state of competition added to the model. Methods used in the empirical part are econometric analysis, including analysis of regression, as well as economic analysis, including main trend analysis, development indicators, relative and absolute indicators and other methods. The research outcome is a cross-country comparison of market growth, saturation and competition to support strategic decisions by financial companies operating in the private pension saving market.

Without the assessment of the sport event contribution the reasoning of the event's budget becomes complicated, unless not economical, but political criteria of the event organization are followed exclusivelly. An economic contribution of the sport event interests not only practicians, i.e., organizers of sports events, but also the scientists of economics. The aim of the article is to assess the economic contribution of the sport event. In the assessment of economic contribution it is important to evaluate the legacy of sport event. Namely because of this aspect the problem of assessment of the economic contribution of sport event appears, since the expenses when the event is organized are felt before it and during the event, and economic contribution and legacy of the sport event may occur after it is over. In the article also direct and indirect impact of Eurobasket 2011 on the economy was assessed, however it is necessary to consider also the legacy of sport event, i.e., the use of sports arenas in the future. Refering to the experience of the Eurobasket 2011 organizers the possibilities of basketball championship improvement are identified in the article. The first possibility is the increase of investments made by the sport event organizers into the communication regarding the higher attraction of foreign fans. One more possibility would be the governmental legislative-taxing concessions for the promotion of international events. And also an international organization of the sport event by collecting a higher event tax would transfer more marketing rights for a local organizer.","[Balciunas, Mindaugas] Lithuanian Sport Univ, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Jasinskas, Edmundas] Lithuanian Sport Univ, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Koisova, Eva] Univ Alexander Dubcek Trencin, Dept Econ & Econ, Trencin 91150, Slovakia",Lithuanian Sports University; Lithuanian Sports University; Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Balciunas, M (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sport Univ, Sporto Str 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania.",mindaugas.balciunas@lsu.lt; edmundas.jasinskas@gmail.com; eva@koisova.tnuni.sk,"Koišová, Eva/AIB-8438-2022; Jasinskas, Edmundas/JYO-6178-2024","Koišová, Eva/0000-0003-1701-4217; Jasinskas, Edmundas/0000-0003-3158-2974",,,,,31,7,7,3,50,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The facts that time-varying parameter models are parameter rich and the time span of our data is relatively short motivate a desire for shrinkage. In constant coefficient regression models, the Bayesian Lasso is gaining increasing popularity as an effective tool for achieving such shrinkage. In this paper, we develop econometric methods for using the Bayesian Lasso with time-varying parameter models. Our approach allows for the coefficient on each predictor to be: (i) time varying; (ii) constant over time; or (iii) shrunk to zero. The econometric methodology decides automatically to which category each coefficient belongs. Our empirical results indicate the benefits of such an approach.

We use panel data of Spanish manufacturing firms for 1990-2006, as well as external information on European Patent Office and US Patent Office patent counts. We construct a new synthetic measure of competition and estimate the impact of patents on this measure at the industry level. Then, the effect of industry-wide competition and patenting on firms' innovation is estimated at the firm level. Our results suggest that patents reduce the level of competition in the industry, whereas the effect of competition on innovation varies with the type of innovation indicator. Thus, by lowering competition, patents in an industry exert an indirect effect on innovation besides their direct effect. In addition, interaction effects between patents and competition indicate that patents soften the impact of competition changes on firms' innovation.","[Beneito, Pilar; Sanchis, Amparo] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Anal Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Beneito, Pilar; Engracia Rochina-Barrachina, Maria; Sanchis, Amparo] ERICES, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Engracia Rochina-Barrachina, Maria] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Estruct Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Beneito, P (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Anal Econ, Ave Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",pilar.beneito@uv.es,"Llopis, Amparo Sanchis/ABE-8264-2021; Beneito, Pilar/AAD-9619-2022; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/K-8929-2014","Llopis, Amparo Sanchis/0000-0002-0872-7859; Beneito, Pilar/0000-0001-5767-7010; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/0000-0002-9263-1023",,,,,36,12,15,15,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Due to the lack of importance of agriculture in global economy, accounting of this sector received little attention from researchers and regulators of accounting standards until the adoption of IAS 41. An index of the mandatory disclosure of biological assets is constructed and calculated based on the notes of financial statements included in 2011 annual report of this sample of firms. This study tests several hypotheses relating the index and the following variables - biological assets intensity, ownership concentration, size, auditor type and international stakeholders. The mandatory disclosure of biological assets is found to be influenced by biological assets intensity, ownership concentration and size. Being recognized as an interesting guide, IAS 41 is far from being consensual and continues on daily debate.

To empirically investigate the relationship between property tax burden and forest land sale activity, property tax data and over 5300 Minnesota forest land sale records from 2000 to 2008 were assembled. Analyses were carried out to identify statistically significant relationships between several measures of private forest land sale activity and forest land property tax burden. The analyses failed to find a statistically positive relationship between the two. Statistically significant negative associations were found between some measures of forest property tax burden and forest land sale frequency, indicating forest land sales activity actually decreased with increasing property tax burden. While high property taxes, no doubt, influence forest land sale decisions, the findings from this study suggest its influence may not be as pervasive as once thought.

That is why if the manager needs the employee to perform, better than the enforcement works to initiate the inner conviction they want to perform.

This paper also argues that such investments are often embedded in social and intra-ethnic ties which connect them with Vietnam's ethnic Chinese businessmen. To this end, there is a tendency for these firms to rely on informal ties and non-market institutions in the form of the ethnic Chinese business networks.

One feature of these data is that the second generation can be identified, allowing direct analysis of this group and allowing their exclusion from calculations of comparison rates for the native population. Although adult new arrivals were less likely than natives to be incarcerated, this likelihood was increasing with their years in the USA. The foreign born who arrived as children and second-generation immigrants had slightly higher rates of incarceration than natives of native parentage, but these differences disappear after controlling for nativity differences in urbanicity and occupational status. Finally, while the incarceration rates of new arrivals differ significantly by source country, patterns of assimilation are very similar.","[Moehling, Carolyn M.; Piehl, Anne Morrison] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Moehling, Carolyn M.; Piehl, Anne Morrison] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Piehl, Anne Morrison] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Piehl, AM (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",apiehl@economics.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,33,6,9,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The primary objective to use day surgery was to separate the patients with lighter chirurgical procedure, to less traumatize the patients with hospitalization, to protect the patient from nosocomial infections and to make recovery easier in greater comfort of the own home. The primary impulse for dealing with the effectiveness of health care systems, with an emphasis on day surgery, were conflicting responses regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of deployment and use of day surgery performance. On the one hand, we find the direct and indirect evidence of functional application of day surgery performance in health facilities in Slovakia and its potential benefits in achieving the aims of health policy of the SR. On the other hand there are critical responses on lack of the effects of the day surgery use, which are associated with low valuation of stated procedures which are inadequate to the real costs. It hinders its development in comparison with the development abroad. The main aim of this article is to compare the functionality of day surgery care in comparison with the system orientated on traditional hospitalization, using the opinion of the experts who represent the system of health care in Slovakia. For orientation in criteria characterizing the functionality of health care systems in Slovakia, we started from the premise that the functionality of health care system is a basis of its effectiveness. Given the considerable heterogeneity of compared criteria of health care systems we have chosen the method of Analytical Hierarchy Process as the optimal method, supported by the expert group method.","[Soltes, Vincent; Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Soltés, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia.",vincent.soltes@tuke.sk; beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Šoltés, Vincent/AAA-2329-2020; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Soltes, Vincent/0000-0002-2656-5582",,,,,39,52,52,0,24,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Surprisingly, attention devoted to the spatial implications of media information is far from sufficient. Existing researches bring ample evidence that TV coverage embodies media agenda in a satisfactory manner as it has rather profound impact on the public on the one hand and is representative enough on the other. Our paper deals with TV news reporting related to NUTS III regions in the Czech Republic. The main perspective adopted in this article is a qualitative one, which facilitates the evaluation of TV news contents. We are deliberately focusing on national TV broadcasting, which is the most influential one. Individual contributions we evaluate appeared in the framework of news reporting in public Czech TV and private Nova and Prima. In spite of severe limitations in media data, our paper covers the period between the years 2004 and 2011, which helps to underpin our conclusions in a sufficient way. Contributions, which are related to individual NUTS III regions and resonate at the national level, constitute the focal point of our research. TV reflection of material reality is of intangible character; nonetheless similarly to material categories, one can identify spatial as well as thematic differentiation and even patterns also in the sphere of TV news reporting. There are only little doubts that media landscape and closely associated mental maps have been largely underestimated so far. Thus, these topics represent one of pivotal theoretical and practical challenges in the field of spatial sciences, which holds true for post-transition country even more.","[Suchacek, Jan] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Sed'a, Petr; Friedrich, Vaclav] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Koutsky, Jaroslav] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Reg & Local Dev, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Suchácek, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",jan.suchacek@vsb.cz; vaclav.friedrich@vsb.cz; petr.seda@vsb.cz; jaroslav.koutsky@ujep.cz,"Koutsky, Jaroslav/S-8495-2017; Friedrich, Václav/J-9265-2012; Suchacek, Jan/ABH-4495-2020; Seďa, Petr/X-1866-2018","Friedrich, Václav/0000-0003-0076-5233; Suchacek, Jan/0000-0001-9508-6959; Seďa, Petr/0000-0002-2205-6377",,,,,20,27,27,0,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The modern approach to Innovation Economics understands that technology standards, the competitive conduct of firms, and the economic performance of innovative industries are endogenous and jointly determined. Market competition and standards organizations endogenously determine technology standards, which are consistent with innovative efficiency. This contrasts with traditional Innovation Economics, which can be summarized as a Standards-Conduct-Performance paradigm. The traditional view, which is reminiscent of the traditional Industrial Organization Structure-Conduct-Performance paradigm, incorrectly assumes that technology standards are exogenous and cause imperfectly competitive conduct and inefficient economic performance. Instead, studies of innovation should apply game-theoretic models that account for strategic interaction and empirical tools that control for the interplay among technology standards, competitive conduct, and economic performance.","[Spulber, Daniel F.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Spulber, Daniel F.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Spulber, DF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",jems@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Spulber, Daniel F/A-8722-2009","Spulber, Daniel F/0000-0003-2697-6522",,,,,199,29,31,1,74,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Through an examination of private umbilical cord blood banking in south India, this paper investigates the interplay of accumulation and its interruption in Indians' uptake of this practice. Although Chennai-based bankers, doctors and parents explain the recent surge in popularity for cord blood banking in the city in terms of interlinked financial and familial accumulation, investment and security, Indians' cultural and religious conceptions of the latent power of the placenta and cord often work against cord blood banking marketers' neat account of twinned economic and familial accumulation.

One is that the threat of debt intolerance is general: the reasoning is that the sharp rise in government debt levels caused by post-crisis fiscal expansion will force investors to abandon government bonds in favour of some other asset class. The other proposition is that there is a one-size debt threshold: the reasoning is that no government, those of the G7 countries included, can escape the serious consequences of debt intolerance and the threat of exit should its debt to GDP ratio reach 90 per cent. This paper argues that neither of these propositions can have credibility at a time of continuing global economic slowdown and consequent contraction in the global supplies of investable assets. At such a time investors cannot possibly hold up the threat of intolerance to core economy governments because they have no choice but to store substantial portions of their wealth in the latter's bonds, a fact which in turn means that the debt thresholds for core economy governments cannot possibly be the same as the average for other governments.","London Metropolitan Univ, London Metropolitan Business Sch, London N7 8HN, England",London Metropolitan University,"Lysandrou, P (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Univ, London Metropolitan Business Sch, 277-81 Holloway Rd, London N7 8HN, England.",p.lysandrou@londonmet.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,19,19,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We applied the Process Analysis Method of sustainability assessment to generate an indicator set in a systematic and transparent way, that is consistent with a declared definition of a sustainable transport system. Our method identifies stakeholder groups, the full range of impacts across the environmental, economic and human/social domains of sustainability, and those who generate and receive those impacts. Car users are shown by the analysis to have dual roles, both as individual makers of decisions and as beneficiaries/sufferers of the impacts resulting from communal choice. Thus car users, through their experience of service quality, are a potential force for system change. Our method addresses many of the well-known flaws in measuring transport sustainability.

I first develop the relevance of three conceptseconomic rents, self-exploitation, and social embeddednessto CSA and then introduce a framework that relates CSA farmers' earnings to the average rate of profit, economic rents, and self-exploitation. I then examine qualitative and quantitative data from a study of 54 CSAs in California's Central Valley and surrounding foothills to explain the wide range of farmers' earnings in relation to the characteristics of production of CSAs, the social embeddedness of CSAs, and the farmers' motivations and rationalities. Qualitative data from interviews are used to interpret the results of an ordinary least squares regression analysis showing that (1) farmers' age, number of employees, and type of CSA strongly shape farmers' earnings; (2) the moral economy of CSA cuts both ways economically, allowing for the capture of economic rents but more often resulting in self-exploitation because of farmers' strong sense of obligation to their members; and (3) farmers' motivations are diverse, but tend toward low and moderate instrumentalism, meaning that earning an income is often not a high priority relative to other values. The conclusion recommends the need to recognize alternative rationalities but also to discuss and confront strong self-exploitation in alternative food networks because of the broader political economic context in which they exist.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Galt, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, 1309 Hart Hall,1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",regalt@ucdavis.edu,,"Galt, Ryan/0000-0002-0243-5636",,,,,77,154,181,5,124,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

It presents a model in which imperfect institutions create rents for some parties within the economy and are a source of comparative advantage in trade. Institutional quality is determined as an equilibrium of a political economy game. When countries share the same technology, there is a race to the top in institutional quality: both trade partners are forced to improve institutions after opening. On the other hand, domestic institutions will not improve in either country when one of the countries has a strong enough technological comparative advantage in the institutionally intensive good. While time series results are not statistically significant, a related cross-sectional prediction of the model is consistent with the data. Countries whose exogenous geographical characteristics predispose them to exporting in institutionally intensive sectors exhibit significantly higher institutional quality.","[Levchenko, Andrei A.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Levchenko, Andrei A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Levchenko, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",alev@umich.edu,,"Levchenko, Andrei A/0000-0001-9087-7911",,,,,47,51,62,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Motivated by the paucity of empirical analyses of merger-specific efficiencies, we examine a merger's market share effects. Standard merger theory predicts that if merger-specific efficiencies are present, the merged firm should regain market share in the long run. We estimate short- and long-run merger effects on market shares from the divestiture of Texaco's Canadian assets. Using a difference-in-difference specification we compare changes for the merging firm against changes for other vertically integrated firms in the same market. A general equilibrium type effect renders our estimates biased but the sign of each effect is consistently estimated. Our approach is a useful complement to across-market comparisons, which are often hindered by the difficulty of finding control markets that experience the same supply and demand shocks as the treatment markets.

Our findings indicate that younger firms tend to outperform incumbents for sales growth and that larger firms tend to grow more than smaller companies. However, the effects of firm size and age vary substantially according to the firm's specific pattern of innovation. In particular, highly innovative firms tend to outperform competitors regardless of their age or size, while for conservative KIBS, size is a prerequisite for growth.

The ICC's jurisdiction later included regulation of trucking and bus transportation. An unintended consequence of ICC regulation was the development of labor markets in these sectors that helped promote labor organization and labor rent sharing. Indeed, some of the most influential unions in American labor history represented workers in ICC-regulated industries.

A new measure of entrepreneurship derived from matching files from the Current Population Survey (CPS) is used to provide the first test of the hypothesis that business creation rates were high in Silicon Valley during the Roaring 90s. Unlike previous measures of firm births based on large, nationally representative datasets, the new measure captures business creation at the individual-owner level, includes both employer and nonemployer business starts, and focuses on only hi-tech industries. Estimates indicate that hi-tech entrepreneurship rates were lower in Silicon Valley than the rest of the United States during the period from January 1996 to February 2000. Examining the post-boom period, we find that entrepreneurship rates in Silicon Valley increased from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. Although Silicon Valley may be an entrepreneurial location overall, we provide the first evidence that the extremely tight labor market of the late 1990s, especially in hi-tech industries, may have suppressed business creation during this period.","[Fairlie, Robert W.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Chatterji, Aaron K.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Duke University,"Fairlie, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Engn 2 Bldg, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",rfairlie@ucsc.edu; ronnie@duke.edu,,,,,,,46,29,34,1,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

A classification is proposed based on different scales of analysis (e.g. long-distance vs. short-distance freight transport), and on modeling approaches (e.g. aggregate vs. disaggregate). The first part of the paper focuses on the long-distance scale (i.e. national and international). In this context aggregate modeling efforts, using time series data, have either concentrated on the growth pattern for specific commodities or on the traditional four-step model, typically applied to passenger demand. These models address large-scale problems, but are unable to deal explicitly with the micro-mechanisms underlying demand, where a more disaggregate approach is needed. The second part of the paper deals with short-distance models and with the distribution of final products from wholesalers and restocking centers to retailers and end consumers. These models can be cast into two classes: those simulating level and spatial distribution of commodities traded within the study area (Origin-Destination matrices) and those simulating the delivery process with the ultimate goal of estimating commercial vehicle flows on the road network. In particular, the aggregate class of models can be further split based on reference unit (i.e. vehicle, quantity and delivery). Finally, the paper discusses the pros and cons of both types of models (i.e. long and short distance), and describes the research challenges in this area for the near future.","[Nuzzolo, Agostino; Coppola, Pierluigi; Comi, Antonio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Enterprise Engn, I-00133 Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Coppola, P (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Enterprise Engn, Via Politecn 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",coppola@ing.uniroma2.it,"Coppola, Pierluigi/G-8981-2012; Comi, Antonio/C-5083-2008","Coppola, Pierluigi/0000-0003-0729-282X; Comi, Antonio/0000-0001-6784-1638; Nuzzolo, Agostino/0000-0002-9685-4849",,,,,93,38,43,0,77,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The analysis of a host country's optimal pricing behavior therefore incorporates a specific student migration model. Students usually are aware of the fact that they might return to their home countries after being educated abroad, even if they initially intended to stay on in the host country. With rational expectations, a change in students' perceptions of the return probability after graduation can affect their first-round decisions whether to study abroad. The optimal adjustment of non-resident tuition fees in the host country has to take this behavioral response into account. Under certain conditions, the behavioral effect is dominant, and a decline in stay rates of students actually requires tuition fee cuts.","Univ Konstanz, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Lange, T (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Box D133, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",thomas.lange@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,35,14,16,0,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The need for complementary measures in the road transport system is also discussed. Likewise, the paper also mentions the impact of increased rail infrastructure charges on certain significant industrial sectors. An increase in rail charges may reduce social welfare even though the reduction in rail transport mileage is small. This is mainly due to large non-internalised absolute externalities for road freight. For commuter trains, the infrastructure charges' share of the costs of rail transport is expected to rise to 13 percent, which in an international perspective still will be small.

As a result, the estimated unilateral effects price increase is much higher than the actual unilateral effects price increase. Even when recapture rates are introduced, problems arise with nested demand structures and inaccurate market definition.

Top bidder and target law firms are both associated with significantly higher takeover premia. These associations are significant even after controlling for selection bias and major offer, bidder, and investment bank adviser characteristics. Our interpretation is that top bidder law firms have stronger incentives and abilities to facilitate deal completions, while top target law firms have stronger incentives and abilities to help realize higher takeover premia, consistent with their clients' objectives.

This paper describes a meta-analysis used to determine the key factors associated with WTP price premium estimates by examining data from 19 different studies conducted around the world. Results of Bayesian hierarchical models show that frequently purchased wood products and wood products with lower base prices tend to capture higher percentage premiums. Survey administration method was also a statistically significant factor influencing variations in WTP estimates. Results show that conjoint analysis elicited inflated WTP estimates toward certified wood products compared with contingent valuation methods. Reported WTP estimates have increased in recent years. Recommendations to reduce the error of WTP estimates toward certified wood products and improve the validity of experimental studies are provided.

This paper provides insights into this question by exploring the impacts of (1) a combination of a carbon tax and a fuelwood policy, and (2) a combination of a carbon tax and a sequestration policy on (i) the economy of the forest sector, and (ii) the dynamics of the forest resource. To do this, we used a modified version of the French Forest Sector Model (FFSM) and carried out simulations on a 2020 time horizon. Basing our analysis on the fuelwood sector, we showed that wood producers always benefit from the combination of a carbon tax with either a fuelwood policy or a sequestration policy at the national level. Conversely, and although it favors wood products instead of non-wood substitutes, a carbon tax always decreases consumer surpluses by increasing wood product prices. As a consequence, the combination of a carbon tax with sectoral policies is likely to raise questions about the political economy of the mitigation program. This is particularly true in the case of a combination of a carbon tax with a sequestration policy, which already decreases consumer surpluses. We eventually showed that by increasing transport costs between domestic regions, the carbon tax reallocates production patterns over French territory which could lead to the necessity of a regional breakdown of policy-mixes in the forest sector.

It is explained why the boom of research papers on this issue came in the seventies of the last century. It is described, how the contacts of Czechoslovak and Swedish researchers, at the same time, motivated the first ones to use the Erlander principle, i.e. starting with a set of candidate routes and afterwards choosing some of them by variables which are equal to the number of assigned buses. Afterwards it is shown that the original Erlander approach used the total passenger time losses as objective function. It led to a non-linear model since the unknown variable expressing the number of vehicles enters into the denominator of the objective function. Another complication of the model was in the necessity to avoid zeroes in the denominators. Czechoslovak researchers did not possess any computer enabling to solve non-linear optimization problems of the dimensions met in practice, Therefore, they decided to replace the indicator of total passenger time losses by another one which would not contain the decision variable in the denominator, but in the numerator They took the numerical ratio of number of places in vehicles to the number of passengers. Further, the paper embodies the results achieved in the Czech and Slovak Republic into the context of world literature. The optimization methodology PRIVOL is then described in details, together with a brief outline of its application. Finally, the further development of research is predicted. E.g. the incorporation of demand elasticity with respect to the transport supply into the constraints in the model.","[Cerny, Jan; Cerna, Anna] Univ Econ, Fac Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cerny, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",cerny@fm.vse.cz; cerna@fm.vse.cz,,,,,,,29,7,7,0,9,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Data was obtained from a survey of attitudes and opinions about immigration in Spain administered by ASEP. Results show that, with the passage of time, an increase in anti-immigrant feeling is produced that functions independently from the macro and micro economic indicators of Spanish society. The main variables explaining the increase of this anti-immigrant feeling are, on the one hand, the threat defined by the number of perceived immigrants and the loss of national identity, and, on the other hand, competition for economic and social resources and state investment in immigration matters.","[Checa Olmos, Juan Carlos] Univ Almeria, Dept Geog Hist & Humanidades, Almeria, Spain; [Arjona Garrido, Angeles] Univ Almeria, Ctr Estudios Migrac & Relac Interetn Cemyri, Almeria, Spain; [Arjona Garrido, Angeles] Univ Almeria, Area Antropol, Almeria, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria,"Olmos, JCC (通讯作者)，Univ Almeria, Dept Geog Hist & Humanidades, Almeria, Spain.",jcheca@ual.es; arjona@ual.es,"Checa, Juan Carlos/N-8584-2015; ARJONA, ÁNGELES/I-3915-2017","ARJONA, ÁNGELES/0000-0003-3493-6133",,,,,26,1,1,0,6,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

We propose a copula GARCH approach, where the return series are modeled as univariate GARCH processes and the dependence structure between the return series is defined by a copula function. Four different copulas are fitted - a constant and conditional normal and symmetric Joe-Clayton (SJC) copulas - and estimated by a semi-parametric method. We found that the time-varying normal copula yields the best fit for CROBEX-CAC40, CROBEX-DAX, and CROBEX-FTSE-MIB stock indices pairs, while the time-varying SJC copula is the best fit for CROBEX-ATX and CROBEX-FTSE100. Further, we found that the probability of simultaneous extreme positive and negative returns in Croatian and other European stock markets can increase to 0.77 during turbulent times. The lower and upper tail dependence dynamics between Croatian and other European stock markets is similar in pattern, differing only in scale. The basic conclusion of the research is that the dependence between the stock markets of Croatia and five major European stock markets is dynamic and can be properly captured by either a dynamic normal or symmetrized Joe-Clayton copula GARCH models.","Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,47,5,5,0,10,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

At the second stage, we study the relationship between corrected efficiency scores and possible explanatory variables. On one hand, our result shows statistically significant differences in efficiency levels across countries and sectors. Likewise, significant levels of inefficiency are identified especially in service sectors (Hotels and Restaurants, Retail and Wholesale and Transport). On the others hand, the results of the analysis in second stage confirmed the existence of a significant relationship between the country that firms operate (country-effect) and firm's age (learning by doing). The latter relationship between age and efficiency has different behaviors according to the sector concerned, in the form of U shape in the Hotels and Restaurants, inverted U shape in Metal and Machinery and Wood and Furniture and linear in the Retail and Wholesale sector. Contrary perhaps to expectations, the results also allow us to conclude that there is no important statistically significant relationship between the efficiency and variables related to the strategies implemented by firms and the control of the property.","[de Jorge Moreno, Justo] Univ Alcala, Business Sci Dept, Madrid 28802, Spain; [Laborda Castillo, Leopoldo] Univ Alcala, Inst Latin Amer Studies IELAT, Madrid 28801, Spain",Universidad de Alcala; Universidad de Alcala,"Moreno, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala, Business Sci Dept, Plaza Victoria S-N, Madrid 28802, Spain.",justo.dejorge@uah.es; llabordacastillo@gmail.com,"De Jorge-Moreno, Justo/O-9546-2018","De Jorge-Moreno, Justo/0000-0002-8326-3046",,,,,21,0,0,0,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

However, research of partnership quality on the outsourcing of human resources (HR) is very limited. Therefore, this research aims at examining the relationship between partnership quality variables (business understanding, trust, commitment, communication and top management) and the success of HR outsourcing. The sample is obtained from a cross sectional survey and the sample studied are 96 manufacturing organizations in Penang, Malaysia. Results indicate that most of the organizations that outsourced HR functions were from electronic and electrical industry. The analyses also show that partnership quality variables such as trust, business understanding and communication have significant positive impact on HR outsourcing success. The study concluded that HR outsourcing as a competitive strategy in Malaysia is still relatively new and probably many of its potential benefits are not fully understood. Therefore, by understanding the relationship with the service providers, the organizations are able to achieve outsourcing success by identifying areas of expected benefits and improvements.","[Ee, Elaine; Halim, Hasliza Abdul; Ramayah, Thurasamy] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Halim, HA (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia.",leehtjohn@yahoo.co.uk; haslizahalim@usm.my; ramayah@usm.my,"T., Ramayah/E-4629-2010; Halim, Hasliza Abdul/E-3592-2012","T., Ramayah/0000-0002-7580-7058; Abdul-Halim, Hasliza/0000-0003-3708-7114",,,,,35,16,21,3,33,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In contrast to previous studies on the participation degree, the paper highlights the importance of the previous decision to invest abroad. To do so, an econometric model with a limited dependent variable helps to show that to ignore the previous decision modifies the conclusions of the empirical analyses that raise an empirical model over a sample of firms with foreign affiliates. Additionally, the paper analyses in detail the importance of the cultural and political-legal differences between home and host countries that justify a different type of participation in equity of foreign affiliates. A clear implication for future research in this field is the need to reconsider the econometric approach to include the investment decision.

A critical view into the diachronism of conflict management theories reveals that on this plan the perspective has also changed; from the traditional conflict essentially negative, destructive to the positive, beneficial model. For these reasons, the purpose of this research is to identify and analyse conflict situations in the pre-university education in Romania (particularly in Dambovita County) and also to highlight the main motivators, respectively de-motivators regarding teachers' work in pre-university education. The collection of information was done by means of direct observation methods and documents study, the findings of this research indicating that currently, Romanian pre-university education undergoes a tense period. As a result, the teaching profession is characterized by many conflicts and low levels of motivation. In conclusion, it is extremely important for us to realize the depth and nature of conflicts that education is facing. And in the process of trying to diminish or to solve the problems and challenges we face, we should ensure that we do not destroy teachers' motivation because this will have a negative impact on all stakeholders in the education field.","[Popescu, Constanta; Tudorache (Stancescu), Ana-Maria; Vasilescu, Liviu] Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Dambovita, Romania",Valahia University of Targoviste,"Popescu, C (通讯作者)，Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Dambovita, Romania.",tantapop@yahoo.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,476,483,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100044,0

As most real-world firms produce multiple products, the transition from the prevailing situation to hypothetical monopoly implies both a hypothetical merger of all firms that produce inside products and a hypothetical spin-off of all outside products produced by those firms. Such a spin-off has a number of effects, which we discuss in detail for both substitute and complementary outside companions. We argue that these effects do not bring market definition any closer to its ultimate goalthat is, the assessment of market power. In our view, it is preferable to consider the hypothetical monopolist as an inclusive monopolist, resulting from the merger of all firms producing inside products but without any spin-off of companions. Such a monopolist captures the idea of the hypothetical cartel referred to in the 2010 version of the Guidelines, but is better suited to describe the issues at stake.","[Niels, Gunnar] Oxera, Oxford, England",,,adtenkate@hotmail.com; gunnar.niels@oxera.com,,,,,,,9,1,1,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Various aspects of this oil civilisation are examined, including the development of centres of high carbon living such as Dubai. This paper explores the probable peaking of oil and its problematic consequences. It is shown how this has already had major economic and social consequences. New forms of indebtedness were directed to new kinds of property purchaser and the parcelling up of these debts into new financial packages. From the 1980s onwards many new American suburbs were built distant from city centres but rising oil prices led to the collapse of the mortgages of those living in oil-dependent suburbs and finance during 2007-8 onwards.

Whereas U.S. jurisprudence has traditionally considered loyalty rebates to be a procompetitive business practice, the Court of Justice of the European Union has repeatedly held that loyalty rebates are an illegal means of distorting competition. This article challenges the Community Courts conviction that loyalty rebates do not constitute competition on the merits and claims the opposite. The adoption of loyalty rebates is a direct consequence and a vital expression of the competitive process. The need for different forms of loyalty rebates naturally emerges from the diverse market conditions that prevail in different industries, which explains the widespread use of diverse loyalty rebates in business practice. It is the heterogeneity of commercial pressures that dominant firms are facing that determines the competitive structure and size of their rebates. By suppressing competition in rebates, orthodox legal doctrine in Europe has distorted the competitive process in a variety of global markets, and thereby caused significant harm to competition and consumers. Since loyalty rebates are an efficient and healthy form of competition, plaintiffs and competition authorities that allege anticompetitive foreclosure as a result of loyalty rebates should generally carry the burden of proving the existence of a restriction of competition. The Courts prevailing interpretation of Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), by contrast, is bound to punish successful innovators and to protect less effective rivals from the inconveniences of the competitive process.","Charles River Associates Inc, Brussels, Belgium",Charles River Associates,"Zenger, H (通讯作者)，Charles River Associates Inc, Brussels, Belgium.",hzenger@crai.com,,,,,,,92,12,13,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The deregulation of airports over the past decades has resulted in local councils owning most of the rural and regional airports across Australia. The paper provides an overview of the international literature on regional airports and research directed at defining the issues faced by regional and rural airports in Australia. A survey of airport managers, regulators and local councils was undertaken across Australia to outline the challenges and stresses that regional airports are facing. Core findings indicate that the operation of rural and regional airports is under stress due to the interrelating factors of infrastructure costs, high cost of maintenance, and security infrastructure upgrades. Small airports often compete with one another to attract airlines and maintain their infrastructure advantage. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

They raised questions regarding the exceptionalism of Arabs and Muslims, whom many observers and commentators considered to be tied to sentiments and solidarities of patrimonialism, tribe and religion. Yet, the forces that seemed to benefit from the transformations in Egypt and elsewhere were not those that made the revolution but precisely religious and patriarchal parties which benefited from popular constituencies in elections. A consideration of the political history of the main countries concerned can throw some light on these transformations. The nationalist, often military, regimes which emerged from the independence struggles of mid-twentieth century headed ideological, populist, nationalist and socialist movements and parties and authoritarian regimes which eliminated oppositional politics and social autonomies in favour of a corporatist welfare state. These regimes, facing economic and geo-political contingencies of the later decades were transformed into dynastic oligarchies and crony capitalism which broke the compact of welfare and subsidies leading to intensified impoverishment and repression of their populations. Popular strata were driven ever more into reliance on survival units of kin and community, reinforcing communal and religious attachments at the expense of civic and associational life. These ties and sentiments come to the fore when the ruling dynasties are displaced, as in Iraq after the 2003 invasion or Egypt after the removal of Mubarak. The ideological and universalist politics of the revolutionaries appear to be swamped by those conservative affiliations.","Univ London, London Middle E Inst, SOAS, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Zubaida, S (通讯作者)，Univ London, London Middle E Inst, SOAS, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",S.Zubaida@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,20,9,11,0,101,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The main argument of the article is that despite these unfavorable conditions, election forecasting in Lithuania has potential. Since the sample of national parliamentary elections is too limited for statistical modeling, the possibility of forecasting at the level of municipalities in the municipal council elections is discussed. Four factors (local unemployment change, party's belonging to the national government, population size and lagged vote share) are integrated into a model that strives to predict the vote share of the party that holds the mayor's post (the dominant political power in the municipal council). The model presented explains more than 70% of the variance in the dependent variable. The case diagnostics reveal that the model predicts municipal election outcomes very accurately.

The standard way to measure the human capital endowment is to consider the educational attainments of the resident population, usually the share of people with a university degree. Florida (2002) suggested a different measure of human capitalthe creative classbased on the actual occupations of individuals in specific jobs like science, engineering, the arts, culture, and entertainment. However, the empirical analyses conducted so far have overlooked a serious measurement problem concerning the clear definition of the education and creativity components of human capital. This article aims to disentangle this issue by proposing a disaggregation of human capital into three nonoverlapping categories: creative graduates, bohemians, and noncreative graduates. Using a spatial error model to account for spatial dependence, we assess the concurrent effect of the human capital indicators on total factor productivity for 257 regions of EU27. Our results indicate that highly educated people working in creative occupations are the most relevant component in explaining production efficiency, noncreative graduates exhibit a lower impact, and bohemians do not show a significant effect on regional performance. Moreover, a significant influence is exerted by technological capital, cultural diversity, and industrial and geographic characteristics, thus providing robust evidence that a highly educated, innovative, open, and culturally diverse environment is becoming more central for productivity enhancements.","[Marrocu, Emanuela; Paci, Raffaele] Univ Cagliari, CRENoS, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Marrocu, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, CRENoS, Viale S Ignazio 78, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",emarrocu@unica.it; paci@unica.it,"Marrocu, Emanuela/E-2903-2017","Marrocu, Emanuela/0000-0002-7436-0055; PACI, RAFFAELE/0000-0003-0301-438X",,,,,45,89,96,0,97,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

It seems therefore unavoidable that in difficult criminal cases, miscarriages of justice occur, but this is hard to study in the field. In a laboratory experiment, we examine the relationship between evidence of which the diagnostic value is known, subjective probability of guilt and errors in verdicts for abstract criminal cases. We look at two situations: (1) all evidence is given and (2) evidence can be acquired. In both situations, verdicts are inaccurate. For given evidence, errors are biased toward the most serious type, unfounded conviction. In the situation where evidence can be acquired, participants do not acquire enough which results in many mistakes, evenly divided over unfounded convictions and unfounded acquittals. We suggest ways to reduce error (JEL C91, K14, K40).","[Sonnemans, Joep] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Ctr Res Expt Econ & Polit Decis Making, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sonnemans, Joep] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Dijk, Frans] Council Judiciary, The Hague, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Sonnemans, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Ctr Res Expt Econ & Polit Decis Making, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.h.sonnemans@uva.nl; f.van.dijk@rechtspraak.nl,"Sonnemans, Joep/ITT-9754-2023","Sonnemans, Joep/0000-0001-7545-7409",,,,,40,18,18,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Overall results suggest that average costs decrease until passenger traffic reaches 5 million, remain constant over the range between 5 million and 14 million passengers, and afterwards start to increase. Moreover, we find evidence consistent with the existence of overcapitalisation for the largest regulated airports. Finally, private airports seem to be characterised by lower costs, although cost differentials associated with ownership status shrank over time. The main results are robust to unobserved heterogeneity and to endogeneity biases.","[Bottasso, Anna; Conti, Maurizio] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, I-16126 Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa,"Conti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, Via Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.",mconti@economia.unige.it,"Conti, Maurizio/AAC-9592-2021; BOTTASSO, Anna/AAD-6205-2021","Conti, Maurizio/0000-0001-8215-4836; BOTTASSO, Anna/0000-0002-9575-2840",,,,,32,25,26,0,13,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

SYNERGY,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,K21; K29; L21; L23; L24; L44; O31,LICENSE; LINUX,"The creation of free and open source software (FOSS) through social networks has been celebrated as one of the most interesting and inspiring developments of the information age. The main legal platform selected for facilitating this collaborative creation is the GNU General Public License (GPL). Software released under the GPL enables anyone to use, modify, and distribute the code. Yet, these rights are contingent upon virality: every copy or work based on the original code must also be subject to such terms and conditions. This article analyzes the interesting and intricate effects of virality on welfare and innovation. Virality increases motivations for parallel innovation, both in open source and in commercial code, inter alia by facilitating competition among networks and by preventing commercial firms from appropriating FOSS. At the same time, by almost closing the door on synergies between FOSS and commercial technologies, it limits cumulative innovation based on synergy and interoperability. As shown, FOSS creates an even stronger anti-commons tragedy than the patent regime. Viralitys (non)regulation will thus determine the balance, as well as the connecting bridges, adopted by society between the two modes of production as well as between competition and synergy. While this issue arises in other contexts, the unique features of the software industry and of FOSS raise complex challenges. This article then analyzes market and legal responses to the GPLs virality. Such analysis is timely given that the viral GPL has become standard in many socially produced FOSS projects.","[Gal, Michal S.] Univ Haifa, Fac Law, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Gal, MS (通讯作者)，NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA.",mgalresearch@gmail.com,,,,,,,68,8,8,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

These magnitudes are a function of a dozen parameters, such as the purchase cost, the battery cost, the electric efficiency, the price of electricity, the CO2 content of electricity (for the electric car), the purchase cost, the fuel efficiency, fuel prices, local pollution costs, CO2 emission (for the fuel car), as well as car life and mileage driven. With the likely present values of these parameters, excess costs are much above 10,000 euros per car, for very small CO2 gains. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to test the impacts of possible changes in parameter values. In nearly all cases, they are not sufficient to eliminate excess costs or to significantly increase CO2 gains. The electric car appears to be a huge gamble with taxpayers money.

J,"Leeson, PT",,,,"Leeson, Peter T.",,,Ordeals,JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SUPERSTITION; SOCIETY,"I argue that medieval judicial ordeals accurately assigned accused criminals' guilt and innocence. They did this by leveraging a medieval superstition called iudicium Dei (judgments of God). According to that superstition, God condemned the guilty and exonerated the innocent through clergy-conducted physical tests. Medieval citizens' belief in iudicium Dei created a separating equilibrium in which only innocent defendants were willing to undergo ordeals. Conditional on observing a defendant's willingness to do so, the administering priest knew he or she was innocent and manipulated the ordeal to find this. My theory explains the peculiar puzzle of ordeals: trials of fire and water that should have condemned most persons who underwent them did the reverse. They exonerated these persons instead. Boiling water rarely boiled persons who plunged their arms in it. Burning iron rarely burned persons who carried it. Ordeal outcomes were miraculous, but they were miracles of mechanism design.","George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Leeson, PT (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,,,,,,,44,56,60,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

Its subsidiary Container Corporation (CONCOR) was the sole operator of container trains. Entry of other entities in 2007 has been driven by larger public policy concerns. In the process, issues such as incumbent resistance, entry barriers, and lack of level playing field had an impact. These issues were enhanced by the use of a closely held organisation as a consultant, and conflicting roles of IR as licensor, regulator, service provider, and operator. This paper attempts to review the process starting from the policy announcement (February 2005) to evolution of a Model Concession Agreement (January 2007). It shows how policies were influenced by the incumbent to restrict competition by creating barriers on the one hand and how an alternate view provided by external entities, like the Planning Commission and other non-IR stakeholders significantly altered the course of action leading to entry of a large number of competing players.

Our proposal is to capture this regime-switching behaviour with an approach relying on Markov-switching autoregressive (MSAR) models. An appropriate parameterization of the model coefficients is introduced, along with an adaptive estimation method allowing accommodation of long-term variations in the process characteristics. The objective criterion to be recursively optimized is based on penalized maximum likelihood, with exponential forgetting of past observations. MSAR models are then employed for one-step-ahead point forecasting of 10?min resolution time series of wind power at two large offshore wind farms. They are favourably compared against persistence and autoregressive models. It is finally shown that the main interest of MSAR models lies in their ability to generate interval/density forecasts of significantly higher skill.

We present a case study of the hiring process of recent university graduates to test these hypotheses. The methodology used follows a two-stage approach. Principal component analysis allows us to identify first key categories of skills and attributes that influence the selection process. Then, using econometric analysis, a matrix classifies them according to employer size and type, degree, position and industry. The results show that soft skills (personality and other qualities) are the most required attributes in the selection process.

The objective of this study was to describe technological training policies in the Venezuelan municipal environment during the 2000-2008 period. This documentary-type research included a review of web sites belonging to ministries linked to technologies and to 26 mayor's offices. Results reflected the existence of diverse legal and managerial documents that permit developing human talent with the necessary technological competences required for modernizing public management; diverse organisms of a public and private character act as facilitators in training the public officials. The project Digital Mayor's Office has been the most transcendental policy for the technological training of officials; of the 26 web sites reviewed corresponding to the mayor's offices, policies of this type could be identified in only 4 of them. Conclusions are that the policies studied materialize through the creation of infrastructures composed of institutions, instructors, plans, programs and projects. In the municipal environment, they are the responsibility of the mayor's offices, found in an express, complementary or tacit form, and their contents deal with instrumental and cognitive aspects, without giving relevance to values and attitudes related to the technologies.","[Belloso de Nunez, Nora; Primera, Nelly] Univ Zulia, Ctr Estudios Empresa, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"de Núñez, NB (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Ctr Estudios Empresa, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",nbellosor@yahoo.es; nprimera58@hotmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,12,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Another key element raised by residents was knowing and recognising people in the area and being able to place them in appropriate contexts. Low shrubs and lighting improved the view. Visibility had a close connection to viewing other people and distinguishing between desirable and undesirable people, a classification aided by knowledge about residents in the area. The three elements lighting, cut shrubs and knowledge about neighbours are all contextualised and given meaning here in a broader understanding of how safety is experienced.","[Lindgren, Therese] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Landscape Dev, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Nilsen, Maria R.] Lund Univ, Dept Sociol, Lund, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Lund University,"Lindgren, T (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Landscape Dev, POB 66, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",lenathereselindgren@gmail.com; maria.nilsen@soc.lu.se,,,,,,,32,30,31,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

At first sight this can appear strange as one often mentioned advantage of the corporate form is that it provides for high transferability of shares whereby a large amount of equity easily can be accumulated. But looking around in the real world, most family firms are not listed and have an interest in the control of changes in ownership structure through clauses that restrict transferability of shares. In this paper this interest of control of ownership is taken for granted. The focus is instead on providing a contractual analysis of the pros and cons of different clauses that restrict transferability. What do the spectra of restricting clauses look like? In what transferability situation can it be more efficient to use a certain clause? Does it matter if a person controlling the use of the firm's assets has a majority ownership and/or is the manager of the firm? We further focus on the impact on management of post-sale purchase clauses, which are common only in the Nordic countries and thereby provide an indigenous perspective. How do succession matters enter into the picture? These are the type of questions that this paper aims to provide answers to. In the description of clauses the Swedish situation is the base case with a short discussion on how Sweden differs in this respect or is similar to the rest of the world.","[Sund, Lars-Goran] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Commercial Law, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Bjuggren, Per-Olof] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Econ, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University; Jonkoping University,"Sund, LG (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Commercial Law, POB 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",lars-goran.sund@jibs.hj.se; per-olof.bjuggren@jibs.hj.se,,,,,,,18,4,4,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

On the one hand, when offsets are purchased in an industry unrelated to the consumption activity, offsets are complements to consumption and the introduction of an offset market causes consumption to rise. On the other hand, when offsets are purchased in a related industry, consumption and offsets are substitutes and consumption falls. In general, however, net emissions decline. We find two exceptions to this rule. First, when offsets are purchased in an unrelated market, if there is no latent demand for offsets in their absence, the introduction of offsets can potentially cause a rise in net emissions when producers of dirty consumption goods have market power. Second, when offsets are purchased to fund green energy, emissions can rise if dirty producers can engage in pre-emptive strategic commitments and the price of offsets is chosen endogenously.","[Gans, Joshua S.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Groves, Vivienne] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Toronto; Stanford University,"Gans, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, 119 George St, Toronto, ON, Canada.",J.Gans@unimelb.edu.au; vivienne.groves@gmail.com,,"Gans, Joshua/0000-0001-6567-5859",,,,,20,5,6,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Uniformity of regulation can enhance the productivity of monitoring. We illustrate the general mechanism by showing that in the presence of members of the public that are willing and able to report violations to the regulator at a cost to themselves, uniform rules allow substituting third-party participation for costly own monitoring. However, socially desirable acts may have to be punished to generate deterrence for undesirable acts.

There nonetheless remains a methodological aspect that has never (to our knowledge) been analyzed in relation to the judges-and-efficiency thesis. We thus show that both promoters and critics of the judges-and-efficiency thesis similarly use a definition of optimization in which history, constraints and path-dependency are viewed as obstacles that must be removed to reach the most efficient outcome. This is misleading. Efficiency cannot be defined in absolute terms, as a global ideal that would mean being free from any constraint, including historically deposited ones. That judges are obliged to refer to the past does not mean that they are unable to make the most efficient decision because constraints are part of the optimization process: or optimization is necessarily path-dependent. Thus, the output of legal systems cannot be efficient or inefficient per se. This is what we argue in this paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We use a combination of administrative data and information gathered from a unique questionnaire that was issued to all jobseekers making a social welfare claim between September and December 2006 who were then tracked for eighteen months. We find that factors such as a recent history of long-term unemployment, advanced age, number of children, relatively low levels of education, literacy/numeracy problems, location in urban areas, lack of personal transport, low rates of recent labour market engagement, spousal earnings and geographic location all significantly affect the likelihood of remaining unemployed for twelve months or more. While the predicted probability distribution for males was found to be relatively normal, the female distribution was bimodal, indicating that larger proportions of females were at risk of falling into long-term unemployment. We find evidence that community based employment schemes for combating long-term unemployment have little effect as participants re-entering the register typically experience extended durations. Finally, we argue that the adoption of an unemployment profiling system will result in both equity and efficiency gains to Public Employment Services.","[O'Connell, Philip J.; McGuinness, Seamus; Kelly, Elish] Dublin Trinity Coll Dublin, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland; [McGuinness, Seamus] Flinders Univ S Australia, Natl Inst Labour Studies, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; Flinders University South Australia,"O'Connell, PJ (通讯作者)，Dublin Trinity Coll Dublin, Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland.",philip.oconnell@esri.ie,"O'Connell, Philip John/AFK-9353-2022","O'Connell, Philip John/0000-0002-2036-283X; Kelly, Elish/0000-0001-7035-2392; mcguinness, seamus/0000-0003-1729-3017",,,,,22,14,14,0,20,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We analyze the implications of this reform and its arising uncertainty on the agreements firms implement, especially on innovative agreements like vertical R&D agreements.

The primary aim is to study the dynamics in travel satisfaction ratings obtained before and after the intervention. Two behavioral mechanisms driving the change in satisfaction ratings are analyzed. The first one is that satisfaction ratings are influenced by reference points. The second mechanism is that satisfaction ratings are affected by cognitive awareness, whereby the disruption of routine travel conditions makes people think more fully about their travel happiness with different modes of transportation. It is found that the measure of satisfaction with the commute by car obtained right after the temporary intervention is significantly different from the measure obtained before the intervention, and both behavioral hypotheses are supported by the pattern of change in satisfaction ratings. The policy and modeling relevance of different well-being measures obtained at different points in time is discussed. As to mode switching, none of the 30 participants switched completely to public transportation after the intervention but a number of them continued to commute occasionally by public transportation. The relationship between mode switching and satisfaction and the implications of this intervention for public transportation agencies and other organizations interested in behavioral modification are discussed.

To this end, gravity model with bilateral and time effects is estimated by Hausman-Taylor AR(1) instrumental variable estimator, using panel data on bilateral trade between Serbia and its main trade partners during the period 2001-2010. The results indicate that overall level of development and difference in factor endowments stimulate Serbia's exports, which is in accordance with theoretical foundation that inter-industry trade is predominant in exports of less developed countries. Moreover, competing trade regimes appear as important determinant of Serbia's trade relations, whereas additional liberalization of trade regime with the USA as untraditional trade partner, even asymmetrical to Serbia's favour, cannot divert trade flows from traditional partners in the long-run. This could mean that distance plays more prominent role in bilateral trade than the degree of liberalization of trade regimes in case of Serbia. The result could be due to the contemporaneous effects of trade preferences granted to Serbia by the EU and other CEFTA 2006 signatories, main trading partners of Serbia.","[Bjelic, Predrag; Mitrovic, Radmila Dragutinovic] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Beograd 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Bjelic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Kamenicka 6, Beograd 11000, Serbia.",bjelic@ekof.bg.ac.rs; radmilam@ekof.bg.ac.rs,"Mitrovic, Radmila Dragutinovic/AAZ-5903-2020; Bjelic, Predrag/H-9959-2016","Mitrovic, Radmila Dragutinovic/0000-0003-2566-4666; Bjelic, Predrag/0000-0002-9777-8403",,,,,37,5,5,0,13,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Although a significant amount of discussion is occurring around how to segment portfolios or predict key variables in order to better fit the existing formulas, we believe that a re-examination of existing capital formulas with respect to credit risk is required. In this paper we develop a formula which is specifically tuned to the dynamics of retail loan portfolios and which could be employed for either regulatory capital or economic capital. The key advantages of this approach are that it is based upon a much more accurate model of retail loan defaults, does not require any new data feeds, is based upon readily available modeling frameworks, and can adapt to portfolio changes such as those observed in the US mortgage crisis.

A survey design was used and samples (N = 381) were drawn from unemployed people in the North West Province. The Experiences of Unemployment Questionnaire was administered. Regarding affective experiences, being unemployed was described as very unpleasant and it was associated with boredom, loneliness, uncertainty about the future, concerns about financial matters, emptiness and conflict. When it came to the participants' attitudes to work, the results showed that almost 96 per cent of them regarded work as important, particularly because it provides meaning. Regarding job application behaviour, the results showed that most of the participants would like to find a job within the month, and they expected to do so. Almost 78 per cent of the participants were asking people for a job at least once a week or more often. Most of them asked friends and acquaintances for employment information, but unemployed people also reported that they looked out for advertisements. People with poor education had the most negative experiences of unemployment and saw work as more important than did those with better education.","[de Witte, Hans] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Louvain, Belgium; [Rothmann, Sebastiaan] North West Univ, Optentia Res Programme, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa; [Jackson, Leone T.

In the calculations we apply the indicators in term of added value and formulate relations of these indicators. It is the system of financial and non-financial indicators. Nowadays these systems are based on the integration of financial analysis and the analysis of strategical factors of enterprise fruitfulness. An example of this system is Balanced Scorecard which represents an interconnection of enterprise financial efficiency's goals with its strategical goals. The instrument of efficiency's measurement are metrics i.e. strict financial or non-financial indicators or evaluative criteria which use efficiency's levels in specific area of enterprise. Metrics are created normally in term of added value and of parametrization. We deal more closely with indicators in term of added value. The important thing is also clear formulation of indicator's relations which has the same influence on quantitative evaluation of economic reality as the clear definition of indicators (metrics), system elements. We deal with the mathematical formulation of relations. The mathematical formulation of relations is represented by the matrix system which is created by vertical and horizontal combination of indicators. Indicators co-ordinating vertically represents matrix rows and indicators co-ordinating horizontally represents matrix columns. Its combination generates matrix elements which can represent various types of ratio indicators. We analyse specific computing procedures in matrix model. Enterprise matrix model formally decribes correlation between economic variables of the model. The starting point for the formulation of matrix model are absolute indicators organized in the table. In the table are differentiated by four essential matrix: imput efficiency matrix, output intensity matrix, imput structure matrix and output structure matrix. There are possible e.g., applications based on calculations using the pseudoinverse matrix, single-equation econometric model, multi-equation econometric model, modified matrix, etc. The presented matrix model belongs to operation research's nonstandard problems, which need cross-disciplinary approach of experts from various professions.","[Grell, Michal] Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Hospodarskej Informat, Katedra Aplikovanej Informat, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Hyranek, Eduard] Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Podnikoveho Manazmentu, Katedra Podnikovych Financii, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Economics Bratislava,"Grell, M (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Hospodarskej Informat, Katedra Aplikovanej Informat, Bratislava, Slovakia.",grell@euba.sk; hyranek@euba.sk,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,11,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It introduces the concepts of network capital and network space to complement existing notions of social capital and geographic space as explanatory factors underpinning the impact of networks. Empirically, the paper analyses the inter-organizational networks of firms across three different regional settings. As well as finding significant differences across regions, the analysis also finds cross-regional commonalities in terms of the association between the innovation prowess of firms and the nature of their networks. In particular, it is found that the innovation performance of firms is significantly related to network capital investment in dynamically configured inter-organizational knowledge alliances. It is concluded that such findings may provide clues in terms of policy making in areas such as cluster and innovation system development, especially in supporting and orchestrating networks which have a clear strategic and calculative rationale.","[Huggins, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Sch City & Reg Planning, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales; [Huggins, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Ctr Adv Studies, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales; [Johnston, Andrew] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sheffield Business Sch, Ctr Individual & Org Dev, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England; [Thompson, Piers] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England",Cardiff University; Cardiff University; Sheffield Hallam University; Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham,"Huggins, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch City & Reg Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",HugginsR@cardiff.ac.uk,"Johnston, Andrew/AFM-9399-2022; Thompson, Piers/R-5828-2019","Johnston, Andrew/0000-0001-5352-9563; Thompson, Piers/0000-0003-1961-7441",,,,,142,125,146,2,158,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

They do so either directly or, as a surprise continuation, after a hypothetical analogue. Both methods deliver a similar (and substantial) level of hypothetical bias - it is slightly higher, but not significantly so, in the between-subject comparison. This suggests that hypothetical bias in this context is not primarily driven by such factors as consistency seeking or impression management.

The present article presents an estimate of the health impacts due to a shift from car to bicycling or walking, by evaluating four effects: the change in exposure to ambient air pollution for the individuals who change their transportation mode, their health benefit, the health benefit for the general population due to reduced pollution and the risk of accidents. We consider only mortality in detail, but at the end of the paper we also cite costs for other impacts, especially noise and congestion. For the dispersion of air pollution from cars we use results of the Transport phase of the ExternE project series and derive general results that can be applied in different regions. We calculate the health benefits of bicycling and walking based on the most recent review by the World Health Organization. For a driver who switches to bicycling for a commute of 5 km (one way) 5 days/week 46 weeks/yr the health benefit from the physical activity is worth about 1300 (sic)/yr, and in a large city (> 500,000) the value of the associated reduction of air pollution is on the order of 30 (sic)/yr. For the individual who makes the switch, the change in air pollution exposure and dose implies a loss of about 20 (sic)/yr under our standard scenario but that is highly variable with details of the trajectories and could even have the opposite sign. The results for walking are similar. The increased accident risk for bicyclists is extremely dependent on the local context: data for Paris and Amsterdam imply that the loss due to fatal accidents is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the health benefit of the physical activity. An analysis of the uncertainties shows that the general conclusion about the order of magnitude of these effects is robust. The results can be used for cost-benefit analysis of programs or projects to increase active transport, provided one can estimate the number of individuals who make a mode shift.

In order to quantify the influence of using public funds for helping the financial sector, we have analysed the evolution of some key indicators regarding the measures used and their impact on the situation of public finances.

Theoretical method is used in order to achieve this objective. The theory building leads to the construction of conceptual model of strategy and business model, and provides its underlying logic. The main finding is that strategy is a pattern within which a business model changes. Only one strategy may exist for a firm in a concrete time frame, while there may be countless business models in the same period. Therefore, strategy represents the sum of all business models and their changes within a specified period. Each business model matches the set of functional strategies and their interdependencies, making strategic content in some particular moment, i.e. each business model is actually a bisection of the business strategy or a bisection of a set of functional strategies in one concrete moment. This specific contribution can be understood only if one takes an appropriate viewpoint of the process of strategy formation, namely the reactive perspective.","[Stefanovic, Ivan] NIS Ad Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Milosevic, Dragan] Coll Business Econ & Entrepreneurship, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Stefanovic, I (通讯作者)，NIS Ad Novi Sad, Narodnog Fronta 12, Novi Sad, Serbia.",ivan.stefanovic@nis.rs; dmilosevic@ikomline.net,,,,,,,55,6,10,1,40,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Faculty of Management and Economics, solves research focused on comparing the professional ambitions of students at secondary schools with the current structure of the labor market, and educational aspirations of students in secondary schools compared to the actual educational attainment of their parents. This study examines a representative sample of 854 respondents from all types of secondary schools from 75 cities of the Czech Republic. The results show that the average educational aspirations of respondents are bachelor's degree. The average variance in educational aspirations of selected occupations equaled the value of 1.2646, which may be indicative of fairly significant ambivalence in terms of educational aspirations. There were only 42 students with zero variance, and only 82 student with relatively little variance (less than 0.4). Also vocational focus of students is small on average, students chose 4.7 professions (definitely yes), 15 professions (rather yes and definitely yes) When designing the online questionnaire and doing the analysis of the data the classification of occupations from A. Roe was used. While Roe argues that most people choose a profession from one of eight groups of occupation, respondents chose on average from 5.3 work groups (rather yes and efinitely yes). With regard to educational mobility, it can be stated that the results showed the increase in intergenerational educational aspirations, and from this perspective, the educational structure appears not to be conserved.

To promote active transport in this neglected age group, knowledge of factors influencing all transport modes is needed. Focus groups were used to explore factors influencing transport choice of studying and working young adults, for short distance travel to various destinations. Nineteen students (mean age of 21 +/- 1.1 years) and 17 working young adults (mean age of 23 +/- 1.5 years) were recruited. Three focus groups were conducted with students and three with working young adults. Content analysis was performed using NVivo 9 software (QSR International). Grounded theory was used to derive categories and subcategories. Young adults talked about several factors that influence transport choice, which could be categorized in three themes: Personal factors, social factors and physical environmental factors. Some factors were reported as very important for choosing between transport modes, such as autonomy, travel time, financial cost and vehicle ownership; some as less important, such as the built environment and perceived safety and some as not important at all, such as ecology and health. Most factors were discussed by both students and working young adults, but some differences were found between the two groups, mainly based on income and living situation. When promoting active transport in young adults, health benefits or ecological benefits should not be emphasized.

His best-known writing on money uses is deeply original and presents strong insights that dissociate money from the concept of the market. Polanyi also developed an interesting non-dichotomous understanding of money in his The great transformation. However, taken together, these two contributions lead to some unresolved questions: his critique of the orthodox approach to money is ambivalent; his argument to separate payment from account is weak; and, most important, he ultimately makes an incomplete break with the classical real/monetary dichotomy. This paper proposes a distinction between money as a set of instruments and practices and money as a concept, through the integration of John Commons's concept of debt into Polanyi's framework. This reformulation allows us to resolve Polanyi's unresolved questions while preserving his major contributions, and leads to a more complex understanding of money.","CNRS IIAC LAIOS, F-75013 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Saiag, H (通讯作者)，CNRS IIAC LAIOS, 190 Ave France, F-75013 Paris, France.",hadrien.saiag@ehess.fr,,,,,,,59,13,13,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Using both de jure and de facto exchange rate regimes, we find that, conditional on several other factors affecting supervisory power allocation, policymakers are more willing to delegate this task to central banks when the latter are pegging their currency to some kind of parity. This evidence is confirmed when instrumental variables are added, in order to account for possible endogeneity.

This study compares the sample characteristics of 505 license agreements between inventors and developers of biomedical inventions with theoretical prescriptions about contractual terms when the parties' tacit knowledge is required to commercialize the inventions. The analysis reveals that (a) three-and four-part payments are common in licenses of biomedical inventions; (b) the importance of inventors' tacit knowledge in development activities is directly related to the magnitude of royalty rates in the licenses; and (c) the importance of developers' tacit knowledge in development is associated with minimum annual payments when the license includes measurable benchmarks to address the shelving of inventions, and to upfront payments in the absence of such benchmarks. Firms use a complex mix of upfront and state-contingent payments, broadly consistent with theoretical prescriptions, to cope with the incentive issues inherent in the exchange of tacit knowledge.","NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Hegde, D (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",dhegde@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,39,25,28,0,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We conclude that the relevant market in which Google competes with respect to Internet search is at least as broad as a two-sided search-advertising market. We also ask whether Google has a duty to provide organic search results that are neutral with respect to whether the displayed listing is for a Google rather than a non-Google business.

Results indicate that health consciousness is positively related to attitudes toward dietary supplements, which is positively related to perceived supplement benefits, but negatively associated with perceived supplement risks. Mediating effects of attitudes toward dietary supplements are also found. Moreover, familiarity with direct to consumer advertising (DTCA) moderates the relationship between health consciousness and attitude toward dietary supplements.

I compare these two methods of testing for discrimination using detailed data from Oakland, California. The hit rate test concludes that officer race does not matter on average or within neighborhoods. In contrast, the stop rate test concludes that officer race does matter within neighborhoods, and further suggests that the same officers discriminate in favor of their own race in some neighborhoods, yet against their own race in other neighborhoods. The contradictory nature of this discrimination suggests that it is more likely driven by information than animus.","Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Sanga, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",sarath.sanga@yale.edu,,"Sanga, Sarath/0000-0001-5504-3882",,,,,17,11,12,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

We present a framework for the characterisation and evaluation of the fairness of the language regime of the European Patent Office (EPO), which is currently based on three official languages: English, French and German. We estimate that the costs of access to patenting procedures borne by English-, French- or German-speaking applicants are at least 30 % lower than those borne by European applicants whose first language is not one of the current official languages of the EPO. In order to correct language-related cost asymmetries, we explore two possible alternative language regimes. In both cases, we introduce a centralised system of financial compensation that covers translation costs borne by European applicants whose first language is not one of the official languages of the EPO. In the first alternative, financial compensation is covered by savings on current translation costs at the granting stage. In the second alternative, the number of official languages is increased to five and financial compensation is funded by an increase in filing fee and by partial savings on translation costs at the granting stage. We show that both alternatives could substantially reduce language-related costs asymmetries among European applicants. In addition, we show that the five-language alternative would reduce the global costs of access to patenting procedures borne by all European applicants. Thus, more multilingualism can be cheaper than less multilingualism, provided that implicit costs are taken into account. We conclude discussing under which conditions the alternative language regimes proposed could have a positive impact on the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of the EPO language regime.","[Gazzola, Michele] Humboldt Univ, Inst Finanzwissensch, Wirtschaftswissensch Fak, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Volpe, Alessia] IRIS, F-75005 Paris, France",Humboldt University of Berlin; Servier; Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier,"Gazzola, M (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Finanzwissensch, Wirtschaftswissensch Fak, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",gazzola@hu-berlin.de; alessia.volpe@iris-sup.org,,"Gazzola, Michele/0000-0002-8856-6011",,,,,29,3,5,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

(1978, Organizational Strategy, Structure and Process, Academy of Management Review, 3, 546-562) and supported by the perception-evaluation personality model of Jung (1923, Psychological Types, London, Routledge & Kegan). Leadership model having five underlying constructs-group cohesion, intellectual flexibility, leader cognitive styles, leadership styles and leadership roles-is identified and studied. At first, respondent firms from various sectors are classified as innovators and defenders. Second, the constructs are empirically tested on them. Important findings suggest that innovators have intuitive-feeling leaders and defenders have sensing-thinking leaders, two of the four personality types proposed by Jung (1923). It has also been found that innovators are higher in the degree of intellectual adjustment; in the idea generation and nurturant phase leaders exhibit intuitive-feeling personality style; concept creators also exhibit the same. These findings may be used in organizations for leadership building, finding out best candidate job-fit and organization-fit during recruitment, and also for training and development of the leaders.","Int Management Inst Kolkata, Kolkata, India",International Management Institute (IMI) Kolkata,"Chatterjee, D (通讯作者)，Int Management Inst Kolkata, Kolkata, India.",d.chatterjee@imi-k.edu.in,"Chatterjee, Devjani/AAH-5404-2020; Chatterjee, Devjani/ACH-2116-2022","Chatterjee, Devjani/0000-0002-8408-4365",,,,,52,8,9,2,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

These concerns have come about as a consequence of the unique stylized attributes of electricity spot prices, such as the clustering of extremes, heavy tails and common spikes. We propose self-exciting marked point process models, which can be defined in terms of either durations or intensities, and which can capture these stylized facts. This approach consists of modeling the times between extreme events and the sizes of exceedances which surpass a high threshold. Empirical results for four major electricity spot markets in Australia show evidence of dependence between the occurrence times of extreme returns. This finding is directly related to the future behavior of the stochastic intensity process for price spikes. In addition, the proposed approach also provides more accurate one-day-ahead value at risk (VaR) forecasting in electricity markets than standard stochastic volatility models.

In one case, non-redeployable investments decrease investor's ex-post bargaining power. In the other they increase it. When the entry deterrence effect is acknowledged, the threat of hold-up against investor is largely weakened. Contrary to previous literature, in this respect, asset specificity may even constitute an endogenous enforcement device for incomplete contracts. We conclude that the impact of asset specificity on investor's post-contractual power, far from being general, depends on the nature of interactions between contractual arrangements and market structure.","[Nicita, Antonio] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Vatiero, Massimiliano] Univ Svizzera italiana, IDUSI, Lugano, Switzerland; [Vatiero, Massimiliano] Univ Svizzera italiana, IdEP, Lugano, Switzerland",University of Siena; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Nicita, A (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",nicita@unisi.it; vatierom@usi.ch,"Vatiero, Massimiliano/ABF-6606-2020; Vatiero, Massimiliano/C-3820-2013","Vatiero, Massimiliano/0000-0002-2886-9870;",,,,,38,3,3,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

J,"Qian, Y",,,,"Qian, Yi",,,Brand Management and Strategies Against Counterfeits,JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PRICE; ENTRY; COMPETITION; QUALITY,"In this paper, I provide a theory for brand-protection strategies to reduce counterfeiting under weak intellectual property rights. My theoretical framework has general implications for endogenous sunk cost investments as a means of deterring counterfeiters. My model incorporates two layers of asymmetric information that counterfeits can incur: counterfeiters fooling consumers and buyers of counterfeits fooling other consumers. Brands have a number of tools at their disposal to maintain a separating equilibrium in the face of counterfeits. One of the theoretical predictions of this study is that counterfeit entry induces incumbent brands to introduce new products. This helps to explain the innovation strategies that authentic firms employ in response to entry by counterfeiters in practice. Authentic prices rise if and only if the counterfeit quality is lower than a threshold level. In addition, the model demonstrates how authentic producers could invest in self-enforcement to increase counterfeiters' incentives to separate themselves from brands. Better channel management through company stores and other costly devices are forms of nonprice signals and complement a company's own enforcements against counterfeits. These predictions are validated using unique panel data collected from Chinese shoe companies covering the years 1993-2004. Data further reveal that companies with worse relationships with the government invest more in various self-enforcement strategies, which are effective in reducing counterfeit sales, and that the set of strategies are complements rather than substitutes for each other.","[Qian, Yi] Northwestern Univ, JL Kellogg Grad Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Qian, Yi] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Qian, Y (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, JL Kellogg Grad Sch Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",yiqian@nber.org,,,,,,,38,45,53,7,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Of the 38% of respondents who indicated a willingness to pay a premium for a fair trade product, the median premium they were willing to pay was around 20%. We find that those who are politically liberal, female, younger, and have attained higher levels of education are willing to pay higher premiums for fair trade, other factors held constant. Respondents who are unwilling to pay a fair trade premium are divided between not doing so because of a belief that all voluntary trade is already fair and a fear of potential unintended negative consequences on workers.","[Taylor, Jason E.; Boasson, Vigdis] Cent Michigan Univ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",Central Michigan University,"Taylor, JE (通讯作者)，Cent Michigan Univ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",taylo2je@cmich.edu; boass1v@cmich.edu,"Boasson, Vigdis/JGM-7234-2023","Boasson, Vigdis/0000-0002-8621-6026",,,,,22,23,24,3,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Locations are chosen before prices; we show that the opposite order, like a simultaneous game, does not have a Nash equilibrium. We also discuss Stackelberg games and second-best regulation. Our results show how departure times can be strategic instruments. Services are scheduled closer together than optimal.

Nevertheless, in the context of small to medium enterprises (SMEs), scant attention has been given to the empirical investigation into the influence of the quality of work life on employee tenure intention in Southern Africa. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap by examining the influence of SME employees' perceptions of the quality of work life on their tenure intention and the mediating role of job satisfaction and job commitment in this relationship as far as Zimbabwe is concerned. Five hypotheses were posited and sample data of 282 were collected from Harare, Zimbabwe's biggest city, to empirically test these hypotheses. The results of this study showed that, in the SME context, quality of work life positively and significantly influences employee job satisfaction, job commitment and consequently tenure intention.

As part of a broader understanding of social and institutional agency, the approach specifically redresses the apparent neglect of the multiple roles of the state and public policy interventions in research on path creation. The framework is used to interpret more than 30 years of path-creation activities that have placed the peripheral region of North East England at the forefront of the United Kingdom's burgeoning offshore wind sector. The empirical findings reveal how a variety of path-creation mechanisms have served to shape, and be shaped by, successive causal episodes of complex and geographically situated social agency. Emerging from an episode of entrepreneurial activity, the path's creation was subsequently catalyzed by a decade of strategic and contextual regional policy intervention before a radical restructuring of economic development governance in the United Kingdom created a policy vacuum for the path's development. The analysis of the policy-on, policy-off episodes illustrates the potential agency of evolutionary inspired policy interventions in supporting mechanisms of path creation and reveals a varied set of implications for the cohesion and embeddedness of the path's development.","Newcastle Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Dev Studies CURDS, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Dawley, S (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Dev Studies CURDS, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",stuart.dawley@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,187,201,12,113,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Quality of life on the other hand can be perceived as an expression of well-being and its importance is demonstrated by a number of publications that have been developed and rank quality of life across cities and states based on their observable characteristics. Amenities' assessments are employed in order to produce an index to rate quality of life. It is increasingly accepted that wellbeing cannot be entirely based on measures of income, wealth and consumption. Other indicators more qualitative (i.e. environment) should be considered. In the broader context, quality of life measures traditional economic goods such as food and accomodation but also more qualitative factors such as environmental and social (i.e. fresh air, low criminality). Environmental factors located in a given place can be considered as part of the wealth of the region in which they are located. A classification of the effects of environmental quality on consumers' utility and producers' costs that is based on housing prices and income differentials is useful because it provides information about the relative attractiveness to them of the total bundle of environmental and other attributes indigenous to each region. A theory is presented for this kind of analysis and classifications producing a qualitative evaluation of cities. The methodology used a number of Canadidan cities as a case study. An amenity-productivity classification was produced and cities were eventually classified as Low/High Amenity and Low/High Productivity providing useful information as to their relative attractiveness to firms and households.","[Giannias, Dimitrios; Sfakianaki, Eleni] Hellen Open Univ, Sch Social Sci, Patras, Greece",Hellenic Open University,"Giannias, D (通讯作者)，Hellen Open Univ, Sch Social Sci, Patras, Greece.",dgiannias@gmail.com; esfakianaki@eap.gr,"SFAKIANAKI, ELENI/S-7786-2016",,,,,,33,3,3,0,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

During the last 20 years the gross domestic product (GDP) was increased only by 67.9% in the Czech Republic, while in the Slovak Republic for the same period by 128%, i.e. more than twice compared with the CR. Much faster economic growth of Slovakia can be only partly explained by the lower initial level of economic development. The rapid economic development in Slovakia was mainly based on different concepts and enforcement of fiscal policy, on lower overall tax burden and therefore on a lower level of redistribution (lower share of public expenditure in GDP) and more favourable conditions for business. The differences between the Czech and Slovak economies growth rates are the expression of various concepts, objectives and government economic policy efficiency. Slovak economic policy for the whole period 1993-2012 in terms of GDP per capita and in terms of convergence to the European Union (EU) seems to be more pragmatic and successful.","[Hajek, Ladislav; Rezny, Lukas] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informatiky & Managementu, Katedra Ekon, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Hájek, L (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informatiky & Managementu, Katedra Ekon, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",ladislav.hajek@uhk.cz; lukas.rezny@uhk.cz,,,,,,,31,7,7,0,14,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Current theory falls short in its ability to explain how the management of project-based companies evolves because of their need to be agile and adaptable in a changing environment. The purpose of this paper is therefore to present a descriptive model that elucidates the maturation processes in a project-based organisation as well as to provide an enhanced understanding of multi-project management in practice. The maturation model illustrates the way the management of project-based organisations evolves between structuring administration and managing uncertainties, and emphasises the importance of active individual actions and situated management actions that have to be undertaken in order to coordinate, synchronise and communicate the required knowledge and skills. The outcomes primarily reveal that, although standardised project models are used and considerable resources are spent on effective project portfolio management, the way information and communication are dealt with is vitally important in the management of project-based organisations. This is particularly true of informal and non-codified communication.","KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Ind Engn & Management, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Jerbrant, A (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Ind Engn & Management, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,,63,6,13,4,78,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Such changes have led to organizational restructurings and implied rethinking of leadership functions and practices. Changing organizational structures, from traditional hierarchical towards lower and more flexible ones, have made leaders organize work in new ways. Teams account for one new way of organizing work and reaching organizational goals. Likewise, globalized markets have made leaders search for new solutions to meet the needs of customers. In consequence, organizations strive for competitive advantages through downsizing, subcontracting, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and other collaborative and network-based alternatives which are typically facilitated by virtual teams. Virtual teams are geographically and organizationally dispersed teams that function over time zones. Due to such dispersion, physical contact in virtual teams is reduced or lacking altogether which means that collaboration is enabled by IT-solutions such as computer-based communication. This kind of electronically facilitated team work is known to imply opportunities as well as challenges for today's global e-leaders. Research on virtual teams suggests that organizational success greatly depends on leadership. However, it remains unclear what kind of leaders, and more specifically, which leadership skills, behaviors or practices contribute to effective virtual teams. To add knowledge on the field and fill such research gap, this article aims at exploring e-leadership and answering these questions. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Phenomenography was used in the analysis and a collective description was conducted. A sample of students taking management degrees at five universities was adopted. Following data analysis, a model explaining our definition of students is presented. This definition was compared with the existing literature. Our findings do not indicate a single, predominant concept but reflect a diverse set of existing concepts. We conclude that students do present difficulties when it comes to explaining their theoretical definition in real situations applied to organizations. The results contribute towards a better understanding of the universities surveyed, but cannot be generalized. Thus, we recommend future studies replicate this research project at other Higher Education Institutions and confirm the factors making up the construction of the definition of strategy from the perspective of future managers. Given that topics relating to strategy and strategic management are highly relevant to organizations today, it is of similar great importance to identifying just what future managers perceive about these issues. Our model explains the definition of strategy in the vision of young managers about to enter the market. A balance between the current schools of thought on strategy and an approach to the reality of enterprises are presented as challenges for both teachers and researchers in this field.","[Mainardes, Emerson Wagner] FUCAPE Business Sch, Dept Management, Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Mainardes, Emerson Wagner; Ferreira, Joao J.; Raposo, Mario L.] NECE Res Ctr Business Sci, Covilha, Portugal; [Ferreira, Joao J.; Raposo, Mario L.] Univ Beira Interior, Management & Econ Dept, Covilha, Portugal",FUCAPE Business School; Universidade da Beira Interior,"Mainardes, EW (通讯作者)，FUCAPE Business Sch, Dept Management, Vitoria, ES, Brazil.",emerks@ubi.pt; jjmf@ubi.pt; mraposo@ubi.pt,"Mainardes, Emerson/AAI-2102-2019; Ferreira, João J.M./K-7669-2012; Raposo, Mário Lino Barata/C-8186-2012; Ferreira, Joao/HNP-5121-2023; ferreira, joao/JJE-8433-2023","Mainardes, Emerson/0000-0003-2525-275X; Ferreira, João J.M./0000-0002-5928-2474; Raposo, Mário Lino Barata/0000-0001-6213-5355;",,,,,88,17,36,4,58,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It plays a key role in determination of destination's competitive advantage; subsequently it influences the economic effects resulting from goods and services consumption in its territory. In scientific literature a significant attention has been paid to this concept for several decades. The aim of this paper was to examine destination attractiveness of Slovakia in terms of the most important tourism source markets demand - Visegrad countries' inhabitants, representing 80% share of the overall visitation of Slovakia. The attractiveness analysis results in terms of satisfied demand suggest that Slovakia is attractive to 4% of the V4 countries' population who visit it on average once a year, that is, to 14% of the V4 countries' population, who undertake one over-night stay per year on average. Slovakia is extremely attractive to the Czechs thanks to its proximity, common political history and non-existing language barrier; however, it remains unattractive to other V4 countries inhabitants. In terms of potential demand, Slovakia meets the ideal destination expectations of 70-71% of V4 countries population, which means it is strongly attractive to them. The Poles find it the most attractive while Hungarian and Czech residents find it less attractive. Slovakia's own inhabitants appreciate this tourism destination the least. They particularly criticize lack of quality services, negative attitude toward customers and high prices which do not correspond with the quality of services. Slovak respondents find the natural beauties of their own country most attractive. Such an evaluation is common for the Czech and Hungarian respondents too. According to the Polish respondents, the most attractive in Slovakia is the positive attitude of local population. They evaluate sports and recreational facilities and activities extremely positively. The inhabitants of Slovakia, Hungary and Poland find Slovakia much more attractive from the point of view of perceived destination attractiveness than in terms of satisfied demand attractiveness. Thus, there is a large gap for visitation increase, but also for perception improvement of Slovakia as a tourism destination. In the case of the Czech market, the attractiveness of Slovakia in terms of satisfied demand is very strong, and it is necessary to maintain this positive fact. In this connection the innovations and their promotion on relevant markets may be decisive. And thus the position of tourism as a tool for economic, social and cultural development of the country can be enhanced.","[Pompurova, Kristina; Simockova, Ivana] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Tourism & Hospitality, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Pompurová, K (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Tourism & Hospitality, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",kristina.pompurova@umb.sk; ivana.simockova@umb.sk,"Pompurová, Kristína/AAI-2074-2020; Šimočková, Ivana/AAO-7767-2021","Pompurová, Kristína/0000-0003-4721-9379; Šimočková, Ivana/0000-0003-2769-3022",,,,,14,8,8,1,25,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Taking into account long finance literature, firm characteristics such as market capitalization, book-to-market ration, the short-term history of past returns, or market turnover are important determinants of stock returns. This study seeks to identify factors important for forecasting changes in stock prices in Poland. The paper examines the relationships between common stock returns and four well-recognized factors: size, value, momentum and liquidity. First, we review existing literature in the field. Second, we investigate the relationship between fundamental factors and stock returns in the Polish market. We study also interactions between separate factors. We perform a long/ short portfolio analysis based on all stocks listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2000 and 2012. We find that historically in Poland it was possible to build factor-based portfolios which outperformed the broad market. However, the Polish market seems too young to derive some significant statistical interference. (c) 2014 The Authors.

We use a database with information on Spanish municipalities with more than 20,000 inhabitants for the period 2001-2008. Our data show that incumbents increase police spending 1 year before the elections, thus we confirm an electoral budget cycle on police expenditure in Spain. We also find that conservative parties are associated with increased spending on public safety. Population has a positive and significant impact on police expenditures per capita, which indicates diseconomies of scale. The theory on sub-national government spending shows that intergovernmental transfers per capita and taxes per capita are believed to impact local expenditures. Our model fits this assumption, showing a significant and positive influence of both variables on police expenditures. Finally, our model reports a positive impact of both immigration and economic level on police spending.","[Dolores Guillamon, Ma.; Bastida, Francisco; Benito, Bernardino] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Benito, B (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",mdguillamon@um.es; alba@um.es; benitobl@um.es,"Benito, Bernardino/K-9416-2014; Bastida, Francisco/K-9670-2014; Guillamon, Maria-Dolores/K-9689-2014","Benito, Bernardino/0000-0003-2165-994X; Bastida, Francisco/0000-0001-9875-3817; Guillamon, Maria-Dolores/0000-0001-7331-5167",,,,,65,31,42,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The different generations running the family firm (OFF) are likely to be constrained, not only by the demands of the business itself, but also by activism from non-management family shareholders. In this paper, we perform an analysis of a sample of Spanish family firms, both domestic and multinational, for the period 2000-2009. The results of this analysis show evidence of a positive relationship between the scope of internationalization and two other variables: family activism (FAT) and life cycle duration of the family firm (DLFF). When it comes to seeking alternative ways to create economic value and obtain debt finance, each generation is less risk averse than the preceding one. However, increasing family conflict over successive generations instigates economic value-destroying behavior. Overall, our findings suggest that economic value creation, leverage and international diversification in FFs will be conditioned not only by the ownership structure and size of the company, but also by the firm's current point in the business life cycle, the generation that is in charge, and activism from other family members, all of which play a decisive role in the FF internationalization and economic value creation process.","[Bobillo, Alfredo M.; Rodriguez-Sanz, Juan A.; Tejerina-Gaite, Fernando] Univ Valladolid, Dept Econ & Business, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Bobillo, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Dept Econ & Business, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.",amartbob@eade.uva.es; jantonio@eco.uva.es; tejerina@sid.eup.uav.es,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019; Rodriguez-Sanz, Juan Antonio/AAR-1953-2020; Tejerina Gaite, Fernando/U-5743-2017","Rodriguez-Sanz, Juan Antonio/0000-0001-7228-4020; Tejerina Gaite, Fernando/0000-0001-6301-0757",,,,,54,13,13,4,75,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The case study examines two elementary schools in Moscow, Idaho that annually participate in two designated days for walking and bicycling, International Walk to School Day in the fall and Fill the Racks! in the spring. Students walking or bicycling to school were counted before and after the events. For comparison, counts were also observed at a nearby school not involved with the Safe Routes to School program. Count data was collected for 8 days. Furthermore, 45 students and 17 parents were surveyed; and five parents and four community leaders were interviewed. The count data showed a significant increase in students using active modes of travel on the day of the event and a few weeks later. The interviews and surveys showed, among other things, there is strong support for the special events and most parents felt the designated days increased their child's motivation to walk to school. Many parents said the spring event prompted their child to return to walking to school after the cold winter months. Policy implications and other lessons learned are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

While reduced parking demand is frequently cited as a reason to promote carsharing, virtually no quantitative analysis has been done on the impact of carsharing on parking demand. Instead, prior studies focus on vehicle ownership, which has an implied connection to parking demand. This paper analyzes the impact of carsharing on parking demand in a university setting (with just over 1000 carsharing users) using a member survey and parking permit sales data. Changes in parking demand are broken down by geographic area and parking type. Members report the vast majority (over 76%) of forgone vehicles would be parked in the same area as the member's household on most weekdays, nights, and weekends. Roughly 30% would be parked on the street at most times, with the percentage parked in personal driveways and garages peaking at roughly 40% on nights and weekends and dropping to 26% on weekdays. Members reported an increase in shopping trips made by car or truck (statistically significant at 1% level), leading to a small increase in parking demand at stores, but this increase was much smaller than the reductions seen elsewhere. The paper also assesses other impacts which have so far been nearly exclusively measured in relatively large cities. For example, the survey revealed a reduction of 15.3 personal vehicles for every carsharing vehicle, roughly equivalent to findings from major cities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Third, it considers the material basis of the appeal of BRIC discourses, especially the credibility acquired through BRIC stimulus packages in the global financial crisis.

An analysis of traffic data from the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, Utah, USA",TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Air quality alerts; Traffic; Soft policy; Persuasion-based policy,,"Air quality alert programs are a form of soft or persuasion-based policy that is common in metropolitan areas that do not meet federal air quality standards in the United States. These programs disseminate daily air quality conditions, with ordinal ratings describing the health implications and suggesting reductions in automobile use and other actions that contribute to the poor air quality. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of air quality alert programs on driving is less encouraging than other soft policies to discourage driving, with many studies reporting small or no reductions in traffic. This study examines evidence for the effectiveness of air quality alert systems in reducing traffic over a 10-year period in Salt Lake and Davis counties, Utah, USA, a metropolitan area that often does not meet US federal air quality standards for both ground-level ozone in the summer and PM 2.5 pollution in the winter. We find that while air quality alerts have some effectiveness for reducing traffic in the center city, these small reductions are exceeded by larger increases in traffic near the edge of the metropolitan area. These effects are stronger during the PM 2.5 alert season than during the ozone alert season. These increases can be explained as discretionary trips by individuals escaping poor air quality by driving to the mountains. A policy implication is that soft policies alone may not be effective at reducing driving behavior when the public health implication of the message conflicts with its public responsibility implication.

Access to quality public transportation is critical for mobility to many of these populations. Determining how transit service is distributed among vulnerable groups has the potential to significantly enhance policy analysis. While many measures of accessibility exist, due to the complexity of transit networks and the scale of the urban areas, limited research has been conducted on developing a tool to measure how equitable the distribution of transit access is in a region. This paper develops a comprehensive method to quantify the quality of service and accessibility at each transit node in a network, combined with an index to measure the inequity (concentration of quality service) at the micro scale. These measures are applied to the distribution of all residential housing units, a random sampling of units and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development subsidized units in Baltimore, Maryland; to determine if the subsidized housing programs are achieving major policy objectives of providing equitable transit access to vulnerable groups. The results show that transit connectivity and accessibility is distributed among some types of subsidized housing units more equitably than can be achieved by random sampling in the general population, but for other types, the distribution is less equitable; indicating some policies to enhance transit access among these units have not been effective. Evidence from this study suggests that developers of affordable housing and transportation planners should work together to find development locations that place more emphasis on transit locations with high connectivity rather than simply reducing distance to any transit.

A greedy market participant that seeks to gain at the expense of others can usually find some way to do so. This might be done within the legal framework, or it might involve a violation of the law that is difficult to enforce. Since the legal system does not generally guarantee that markets can function efficiently, there is a role for other institutions to foster a more enlightened self-interest as a social norm and thus improve efficiency.","St Edwards Univ, Austin, TX 78704 USA",,"Clements, MT (通讯作者)，St Edwards Univ, Austin, TX 78704 USA.",mattcl@stedwards.edu,,,,,,,40,2,4,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In this paper we contribute to the takeover forecasting literature by suggesting the combination of probability forecasts as an alternative method of improving the forecast accuracy in takeover prediction and realizing improved economic returns from portfolios made up of predicted targets. Forecasts from several non-linear forecasting models, such as logistic and neural network models and a combination of them, are used to determine the methodology that best reduces the out-of-sample misclassification error. We draw two general conclusions from our results. First, the forecast combination method outperforms the single models, and should therefore be used to improve the accuracy of takeover target predictions. Second, we demonstrate that an investment in a portfolio of the combined predicted targets results in significant abnormal returns being made by an investor, in the order of up to double the market benchmark return when using a portfolio of manageable size.

A Dynamic Coefficient Random Effects Panel model is employed which captures both the country specific variance and temporal features. This model provides deeper insight into the relationship than has hitherto been possible. We show for Austria, Spain and possibly Belgium that the three predictive factors dominate while for other countries in the EU-15 country specific factors are more important. In relation to temporal effects we show both GDP and the recognition rate at the overall EU-15 level remain significant over time but refugee stock does not. We also show a downward level shift occurred in the elasticity of recognition rate in 2002 resulting in fewer refugees being recognised (i.e., granted refugee status) and, therefore, providing evidence that asylum policies have become more restrictive.","Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Keogh, G (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",gmkeogh@justice.ie,,,,,,,36,23,23,1,29,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We use the recently proposed Realized GARCH model combined with the skewed Student's t distribution for the innovations process and a Monte Carlo simulation approach in order to produce the multi-period VaR estimates. Our empirical findings, based on the S&P 500 stock index, indicate that almost all realized and implied volatility measures can produce statistically and regulatory precise VaR forecasts across forecasting horizons, with the implied volatility being especially accurate in monthly VaR forecasts. The daily range produces inferior forecasting results in terms of regulatory accuracy and Basel II compliance. However, robust realized volatility measures, which are immune against microstructure noise bias or price jumps, generate superior VaR estimates in terms of capital efficiency, as they minimize the opportunity cost of capital and the Basel II regulatory capital.

The gravity-based model was used to perform a disaggregated analysis to estimate the demand levels that will occur on the routes which are planned to be improved in specific regions of Turkey from now until 2020. During the scenario development phase for these gravity-based models, the growth rate of Turkeys GDP, as estimated by the World Bank from now until 2017, was used as the baseline scenario. Besides, it is assumed that the gross value added (GVA) of the origin and destination regions of the selected routes will show a pattern similar to GDP growth rates. Based on the estimated GDP values, and the projected GVA growth rates, the demand for each selected route was projected and found that the demand level for some of these road projects is expected to be very low, and hence additional measures would be needed to make these investments worthwhile.

Transport corridors have also been common practice in European transport policy since the creation of a borderless Europe in the 1990s. What is largely lacking in present-day research on European transport corridors is a consideration of a sector-transcendent and comprehensive spatial approach. We argue that adopting such an approach is beneficial to a valued analysis of European transport corridors, especially in the light of EU cohesion policy, agglomeration effects and place-based development. Also, negative external effects of persisting bottlenecks on welfare and quality of life in transport corridors should be better assessed and contextualised. This paper therefore suggests that policy can and should capitalise more on spatiality in corridors.","[Witte, Patrick; Van Oort, Frank; Spit, Tejo] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Wiegmans, Bart] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Technol & Geosci, Dept Transport & Planning, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Delft University of Technology,"Witte, P (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Heidelberglaan 2,POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",p.a.witte@uu.nl; f.g.vanoort@uu.nl; b.wiegmans@tudelft.nl; t.j.m.spit@uu.nl,"Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020","Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X",,,,,22,8,10,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Some of the political backlash of RLC is the perception that they are installed primarily to fulfill revenue guarantees and sustain the RLC program. Some municipalities have been charged with changing the signal phasing to trap more red-light runners and increase the revenue from RLC programs. This paper focuses on a number of engineering strategies, mainly related to signal timing that may be used by municipalities to achieve their financial goals. The negative impacts of implementing these measures on the safety and efficiency of intersection operations and public support on RLC programs are also discussed. These strategies are also revealed to increase transparency of the divergent motivations of RLC vendors, municipalities, policy makers and safety advocates.

One consumer-oriented policy response to this crisis is mortgage default counseling for borrowers. This study examines the rate at which minority borrowers seek default counseling and the resulting correlation between counseling and the probability that a borrower obtains a modification of his/her original mortgage contract terms. The results suggest that African Americans are more likely to be counseled, relative to Whites. However, Latinos or other non-White groups are no more or less likely to be counseled. The probability of loan modifications among counseled African Americans is also higher than other counseled borrowers. These results suggest that counseling policies and the public subsidy of default counseling may be one approach for promoting consumer financial well-being of these households, but also suggest counseling efforts might be better designed for other minority groups.

This article assesses this debate with reference to the role of Japanese electronics multinational corporations (MNCs) in the development of clusters in Malaysia. Conceptually, we present a typology of DFI-generated industrial clusters that represent increasing degrees of commitment to local value creation and upgrading. Empirically, we conducted a survey of 10 Japanese firms in Malaysia that examined whether or not their factories increased technological upgrading, increasingly embedded their operations through using local skilled labor and supply firms, and responded positively to national policies and cluster-governance measures supporting the electronics industry. We found that Japanese firms had clearly moved beyond simple assembly-based to embedded clustering but had not progressed further to technology-intensive behavior because of the poor technological environment in Malaysia, as well as Japanese MNCs' strategies that depend on technology from headquarters.

Employing cross-national panel data (covering 1994-2005) on European merger control, we find that changes in the EC's proclivity to remedy mergers are reflected in Member States in subsequent years.

We explore the formation of special districts as a particular form of the universal entrepreneurial search for gain or profit from exchange. Political entrepreneurship, like market entrepreneurship, operates inside some framework of rules, and the formation of special districts reflects the search for political gain within that framework of rules.

We develop a model in which Courts grant injunctions only when they have sufficient evidence that the prospective licensee is unwilling, in line with the way we understand Courts operate in Europe. In such a framework the prospective licensee has a powerful strategic tool: the offers that he makes to the patent holder will affect the royalty rate that the Court may adopt as well as the probability of being subject to injunctions (and the liability for litigation costs). We find that despite the availability of injunctions, the holder of a sufficiently weak patent will end up accepting below FRAND rates, in particular when litigation costs are high. We also find that the prospective licensee will sometimes prefer to litigate and the holder of a sufficiently strong patent will always end up in litigation by rejecting offers below FRAND. In particular, this arises when the prospective licensee has little to fear from being found unwilling, namely when the trial takes time (so that the threat of injunctions is less powerful), and when litigation costs are low. Importantly, we thus find that hold up (royalties above the fair rate) as well as reverse hold up (royalties below the fair rate) may arise in equilibrium.","[Lipatov, Vilen] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Neven, Damien] Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland",Goethe University Frankfurt,,glangus@crai.com; lipatov@em.uni-frankfurt.de; damien.neven@graduateinstitute.ch,,,,,,,9,15,15,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The third player is a freight forwarder with its own ship. For the purposes of analysis, the paper applied a two-stage game. The results revealed that the best form of cooperation is the one in which the large truck-operating company would establish a coalition with the ship-operating company; that is, vertical cooperation. This cooperation would generate better payoffs in the form of profit, not only to the members of this coalition, but also to the player that has not joined the coalition. However, user surplus is negative in all coalitions, which shows that the establishment of these kinds of cooperation is not beneficial (in terms of prices) for the users of these service providers.

The study applies historical micro data to re construct the travel pattern with no bridge in place and compare this to the current situation. To complete the socio-economic assessment, the consumer benefits including all freight and passenger modes, are compared with the cost profile of the bridge. The monetary contributions are extrapolated to a complete 50 year period. It is revealed that the bridge from 2000-2010 generated a consumer surplus of (sic)2 billion in 2000 prices discounted at 3.5% p.a., which should be compared with a total construction cost of approximately (sic)4 billion. Seen over the 50 year period and by assuming a medium growth scenario the bridge is expected to generate an internal rate of return in the magnitude of 9% corresponding to a benefit-cost rate of 2.2. A main advantage of analysing infrastructure ex post is the ability to learn and understand behavioural and methodological elements not foreseen at the ex ante stages. Following this we offer an extended discussion including two parts. Firstly we compare the ex ante predictions for the bridge to the current transport flows. The importance of having the right assumptions and the ability to model the phasing-in process are underlined. Secondly, we offer a wider discussion on why some projects are more beneficial than others. This is done by comparing the Oresund Bridge, the Channel Tunnel, and the Great Belt Link.

We adopt a network governance perspective and study connected clusters as goal-directed, multilevel whole networks that we denote as cluster networks. Based on an analysis of four empirical cases varying in regional scope, age and industry context, we identify two governance forms: internally governed cluster networks are formed to establish ties among cluster representative organizations to share knowledge and pool resources on selected activities; externally governed cluster networks are formed to systematically develop cross-cluster ties and competences on and across levels and are brokered by a central intercluster administrative organization as well as several decentralized lead organizations. Our findings show that cluster connectivity can go beyond organization-based pipelines and personal relationships to include clusters as governed entities, albeit with different intensities regarding the brokerage of ties on lower levels.","[Schuessler, Elke] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Decker, Carolin] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany; [Lerch, Frank] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Hamburg, Germany",Free University of Berlin; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; Helmut Schmidt University,"Decker, C (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany.",Carolin.Decker@whu.edu,"Decker-Lange, Carolin/HSF-7244-2023; Decker-Lange, Carolin/AAC-6203-2020","Decker-Lange, Carolin/0000-0002-6669-9673; Decker-Lange, Carolin/0000-0002-6669-9673; Schuessler, Elke/0000-0002-7505-4148",,,,,58,13,15,1,84,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,,,IND INNOV,Ind.

J,"Figueroa, O",,,,"Figueroa, Oscar",,,"Four decades of changing transport policy in Santiago, Chile",RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Santiago; Chile; Urban transport; Transport policy; Deregulation; Urban transport planning; Transantiago; Bus operation,,"During the last forty years, Santiago has experienced a series of drastic changes in public transport policies. These changes have ranged widely, from total deregulation to processes that concentrated the management of public transport within the hands of the public sector. From traditional forms of regulations and policies within a framework that is common throughout Latin America, the system then migrated to complete deregulation. Later, it made a return to more traditional regulations, although tendering for concessions was introduced as an innovation. Finally, after a new intervention in 2007, a highly planned system was introduced with a strongly centralized organization of authority. These four major changes, over four decades, leads to the conclusion that Santiago has become a true laboratory for public transport policies and management. However, and regardless of these changes, certain elements have remained unaltered, such as the almost complete dominance of private ownership in the operation of the system (except for the minor public company, which ended during the 1970's), the absence of subsidies for operations (except in the last period) and with authority lying with the national government as opposed to local government. This article reviews the practices of these forty years, analyzing the components of their policies, results and evaluations, as well as the foundations on which these changes are built.

While non-motorized and public transport modes have the largest shares in passenger transport, there is a strong increase in ownership and use of cars and motorcycles. In Latin America in 2010 there were 2.5 new motor vehicle registrations for every new child being born. Motorization results in congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, motorization increases the use of fossil fuels and results in reduction of physical activity, which in turn increases obesity and related illnesses. Costs of negative externalities are estimated to be around 18% of the average income of 15 selected cities in the region. There is a direct relation between fatalities and air pollution with automobile use, so curbing motorization might prove beneficial for the society at large. There is considerable evidence from Latin America that it is possible to modify motorization trends. This can be done through reallocation of resources already dedicated to transportation to emphasize the provision of access for people and goods rather than maximizing transport activity. Mainstreaming sustainable transport will benefit from cooperation among countries - as it was agreed in the Bogota Declaration (Foro de Transporte Sostenible de America Latina, 2011). It will also require improved information and institutions, and support from the international community, through focused financial instruments, development assistance and technical cooperation.

The planning, financing, procurement, implementation and operation of these systems, and the institutional context for them, are examined. All of the systems that have used private sector finance for the development of the initial systems have faced financial problems. Optimism bias in demand forecasts and unrealistic expectations for cost recovery of capital intensive systems have been contributing factors. Lessons to be learned include the importance of clear government leadership and sound institutional arrangements, and the need for improved understanding of the best manner in which the private sector can be used to achieve efficient and effective rail projects.

This method ignores market fundamentals by assuming that all the relevant information is included in the spot price. Our article analyses the bias resulting from such an approach when the market is imperfectly competitive. We propose a stylised two-period model of the natural gas market with no uncertainty, focusing on strategic interactions between two types of oligopolistic players-pure traders and suppliers with downstream customers-who have access to storage. We show that the true value of storage capacity is not the same for traders and for suppliers.

On average, acquirer advisers exhibit positive valuation errors that are significantly greater than those of target advisers. Top-tier advisers produce more accurate valuations than lower tier advisers, but we find no relation between valuation accuracy and the contingency structure of advisory fees. The stock price reactions to merger announcements and to the public disclosure of target-sought fairness opinions are positively related to the difference between target firm valuations contained in the fairness opinion and the merger offer price.

It argues that recycling is a reflexive intervention in economic activity which extends the boundaries of markets, by internalizing objects formerly externalized as wastes and by attending to the temporal properties of materials. It differentiates between activities based on manufacturing recycled products and the activities of materials recovery linked to commodity markets in secondary materials. By taking the in vivo economic experiment resulting from the UK's Ship Recycling Strategy as its empirical focus, the paper demonstrates how recycling connects to wider debates about experimentation and the constitution of markets, and shows the importance of assaying and assay devices as market devices to the economization of recycling. It further shows that, in materials recovery, measurement is estimation and things are hard to pacify. This makes recycling difficult to stabilize as an economic activity. The consequences are considerable: notably, the possibility of economic failure can threaten to contaminate stabilized (or cold') forms of politics. The importance of contracts as a means to securing politicized markets in secondary materials recovery is indicated.","[Gregson, Nicky] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England; [Gregson, Nicky] Univ Durham, Durham, England; [Watkins, Helen] Glasgow Museums, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Calestani, Melania] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",Durham University; Durham University; University of Southampton,"Gregson, N (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England.",nicky.gregson@durham.ac.uk; M.Calestani@soton.ac.uk,"Gregson, Nicky/E-2167-2014","Gregson, Nicky/0000-0002-2796-389X",,,,,62,32,35,0,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Both home-to-HEI (higher education institution) as well as HEI-to-work mobility results in net flows towards the central economic region of the Netherlands. However, many graduates move within the larger central and peripheral regions and these flows are focused on cities. There is a strong regional component to graduate mobility as origins and destinations tend to be relatively close to the chosen HEI. Flows seem to be influenced by regional familiarity, with relatively many graduates moving back to familiar home regions. Often, a city's young graduate labour force and graduate residents have studied at a local HEI.

The general objective of this article is to examine the mechanisms through which the negative social identity of migrant farm workers from Veracruz, San Luis Potosi and Chiapas arriving in the citrus-growing region of Tamaulipas, is built. Qualitative methodology was used that included in-depth interviews with 60 migrant farm workers, presidents of 3 municipalities in the area and some employers. Conclusions were that the migrant workers' negative social identity is built on two mechanisms: first, the veracity of the stereotype of the migrants' poor hygiene, which underlies the rest of the negative stereotypes, and the second, ignoring non-stereotypical behaviors. If migrants are provided with healthy accommodations, the stereotype of dirtiness will crumble and the rest of the negative stereotypes will lose their foundation.","Univ Autonoma Tamaulipas, Unidad Acad Trabajo Social & Ciencias Desarrollo, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Tamaulipas,"Rubio, KLA (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Tamaulipas, Unidad Acad Trabajo Social & Ciencias Desarrollo, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",kandrade@uat.edu.mx,"RUBIO, KARLA L ANDRADE/U-1329-2018","RUBIO, KARLA L ANDRADE/0000-0002-2140-8457",,,,,21,0,0,1,14,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

By comparing two areas that differ with regard to their agricultural structures and key aspects of production as well as by combining different concepts for identifying clusters, new insights into cluster structures in rural areas could be derived. It is shown that in both areas agriculture and food production are of above-average importance. Whereas some authors argue that rural regions per se represent clusters of agriculture and food production, we propose a more differentiated perspective based on in-depth analyses of cluster structures in rural areas. In order to prove the existence of cluster structures in both research areas, two different approaches were used: a top-down approach measuring regional concentration of industries and a survey-based bottom-up methodology focusing on network relationships and information exchange between network actors. It is shown that both areas do not have all characteristics typical for clusters. Nonetheless, both approaches show that the region of Weser-Ems, characterized by intensive livestock production, complies better with cluster criteria than northeast Lower Saxony which is dominated by arable farming. We conclude that more clear-cut criteria for identifying cluster structures in rural areas would be helpful, not at least for political decision-making processes addressing structural policy for rural areas in which agriculture and its supply chain partners play an important economic role for the local economy due to a lack of economic alternatives.","[Battermann, Henning Wilhelm; Deimel, Mark; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Battermann, HW (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",hbatter@uni-goettingen.de; mdeimel@uni-goettingen.de; theuvsen@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,87,3,3,3,30,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Study results show that passenger travel experience encompasses all moments of contact with the transportation service, as well as aspects that are not in direct control of the transportation provider. The results also reveal that the travel experience involves a holistic set of customer responses that go beyond cognitive assessments, also comprising sensorial and emotional components. The comparison of the two transportation settings shows that both experience-centric and utilitarian trip passengers have a holistic view of the travel experience, although focusing on different experience drivers and customer responses.

We discuss background to the CAPM and derive the equations of the capital market line and security market line. To become more dynamic in the model we suggest apply the equations (12) and (13) expressing the time varying measure of the systematic risk of equity fundamental beta. To demonstrate the applicability of the general model we apply financial econometrics involving three key steps model selection, estimation and testing. We suggest a variety of factors (quite 24 variables) that potentially influence equity risk of Dell. In an efficient financial market we expect only stock market reaction to the unanticipated component of the fundamental variables. Thus we focus on the unanticipated or unexpected components, which we find as the residuals from ARIMA models fitted to the fundamental data. These ARIMA models were identified from the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of the data. The outcome of our modelling shows that only the multiplying the residuals from ARIMA model fitted to 6-month treasury bills yield data by the excess return on the market portfolio data and the excess return on the market portfolio data are linked to variations in Dell's equity risk. The results of estimating the most comprehensive specification of the economic variable market model of equation (17) are reported in Tab. 1. Tests are indicating an absence of autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in the model. The applied model can be used to determination of equity costs within a discounted cash flow approach to assess of the business value of equity or intrinsic value of stock.","Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva & Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Glova, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva & Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia.",jozef.glova@tuke.sk,"Glova, Jozef/Z-2482-2019","Glova, Jozef/0000-0001-5972-7771",,,,,19,9,9,0,17,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Some have raised concerns that the FPs compromise the cohesion policies of the European Commission aimed at reducing income disparities between European regions. We investigate whether existing scientific collaborations between European Union (EU) subnational regions-as captured by co-authored publications-are conducive for acquiring FP funding, and whether FP funding, in turn, stimulates subsequent co-publication activity between pairs of EU regions. Our results indicate that previous co-publication activity only has a minor effect on being funded. We also find that the effect of funding on co-publication activity is especially significant for regional pairs that did not intensively co-publish before participation. The results suggest that the returns to FP funding are highest when involving scientifically lagging regions. In this respect, the current FP policy is in line with cohesion policy.","[Hoekman, Jarno] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Scherngell, Thomas] AIT, Vienna, Austria; [Frenken, Koen] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Innovat Sci, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Tijssen, Robert] Leiden Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol Studies CWTS, Leiden, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); Eindhoven University of Technology; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Hoekman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Groningen, Netherlands.",j.hoekman@umcg.nl,"Hoekman, Jarno/C-3287-2017; Tijssen, Robert JW/B-2397-2009; Scherngell, Thomas TS/C-6803-2009; Frenken, Koen/C-4486-2017","Hoekman, Jarno/0000-0002-2817-1229; Scherngell, Thomas/0000-0003-4592-4103; Tijssen, Robert/0000-0001-5237-9583; Frenken, Koen/0000-0003-4731-0201",,,,,40,64,68,0,98,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Microferanchising should be more effective and impactful on lives of individuals than traditional and official development aid of international and governmental institutions which is often critised for its low efficiency over the last fifty years of their existence. The paper focuses on micro franchising definition, missions, features and geographical presence of existing micro franchising concepts. It reflects current status and compiles available information sources and literature dedicated to micro franchising. The available literature and its authors offer the model of micro franchising as one of the supportive solutions based on self-reliance and entrepreneurship. The article provides a summary of findings from author's research conducted among seventy sample cases of existing micro franchising concepts in the developing world. There are several objectives that this paper shall fulfill. The first objective is to create and publish the very first original Czech written source of information introducing the concept of micro franchising. There has been nothing written and published before and therefore mainly nearly not even known about micro franchising in the Czech Republic. Therefore, and this is the second objective, it should create an informative summary of micro franchising as a new development tool, introduce its definition, features, missions and geographical presence to prove evidence of its existence in the developing world. The third objective is to prove the presumption of the author that the awareness of the topic of micro franchising in the Czech society would be very low. The awareness of micro franchising was studied in an empirical research, which was a survey conducted by the author in autumn 2012 on a sample of 356 Czech respondents. This survey proved extremely low awareness, so the assumption of correlation between lack of information available and knowledge in the society about this topic was confirmed. Therefore this paper, being a first Czech original source should be of a relevant value.","Tech Univ Liberci, Ekon Fak, Katedra Podnikove Ekon, Liberci, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Machácková, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Ekon Fak, Katedra Podnikove Ekon, Liberci, Czech Republic.",vendula.machackova@tul.cz,"Machackova, Vendula/ITV-9344-2023",,,,,,23,1,1,0,20,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Additional challenges to the sustainability of fiscal balances are posed by ageing population and trends in social spending. Given the scale of the problem, the analysis of fiscal consolidation needs to take into account projected trends in social spending. This paper sheds light on the scale of fiscal consolidation that will be needed to ensure long-term sustainability and on the potential benefits of institutional reforms in mitigating budget pressures of social spending. Based on alternative scenarios, results suggest that in several OECD countries, the fiscal challenges are exacerbated in the long-term by spending pressures related to health and pensions. Therefore, reforms to entitlement programmes need to be an important part of any longer-term sustainability strategy. In particular, reforms of pension and health systems can mitigate budget pressures resulting from ageing populations and hence contribute to fiscal consolidation. Institutional reforms may hence support long-term fiscal sustainability and, at the same time, reduce adverse short-term effects of fiscal consolidation on growth.","[Merola, Rossana] ESRI, Whitaker Sq Sir John Rogersons Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Merola, Rossana] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Sutherland, Douglas] OECD, Dept Econ, Paris, France",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Merola, R (通讯作者)，ESRI, Whitaker Sq Sir John Rogersons Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland.",rossana.merola@esri.ie; douglas.sutherland@oecd.org,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,6,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-214-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,13,+,,,,,,4,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA4JV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335871100002,0

In the course of the 1990s, however, the port product increasingly came to be seen as a set of interlinking functions, with the port as such serving as one of the links in the overall logistic chain. The most recent literature has revisited the concept of port competition to take due account of the complex and heterogeneous nature of ports today. Moreover, the focus is no longer exclusively on competition between ports, but increasingly also on internal competition, between individual production companies and service providers operating within or making use of the same port setting. Starting from the above framework, this paper focuses on the exogenous and endogenous variables that can affect port competition, which ultimately provides insight into potential strategies for improving the competitiveness of Italy's seaports.

This paper presents comparative case studies on current artists-accompanied urban regeneration initiated by housing corporations in Utrecht and Rotterdam. On the basis of discourse analysis on the voices of decisive actors, it explores the rationale behind artists-accompanied urban regeneration and the sociospatial implications thereof. It empirically indicates that housing corporations are more inclined to deploy artists in urban regeneration when there are sufficient vacant buildings. It also illustrates that more decentralised housing corporations have a stronger and more long-term commitment to urban regeneration. The latter includes a greater commitment to interventions by artists within urban public space.","[Zebracki, Martin] Wageningen Univ, Cultural Geog Grp, Dept Environm Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Smulders, Levi] Treaty Utrecht, Labyrinth Res & Advice & Dept Neighbourhood Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Zebracki, M (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Cultural Geog Grp, Dept Environm Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands.",martin.zebracki@wur.nl; elmaria@cultural-evolution.com,,"Zebracki, Martin/0000-0003-0053-2093",,,,,36,4,4,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

A vast amount of literature is devoted to analyzing the effects of these deregulation and restructuring measures on efficiency and productivity and the results are not totally unambiguous. However, while most of the papers show that the introduction of competition within the sector (in both passenger and freight markets) has had a positive impact in terms of efficiency and productivity, the impact of vertical separation has produced different results in the literature. The contribution of this paper to the existing literature is twofold. Firstly we estimate efficiency levels (using a sample with information of 23 European national rail systems from 2001 to 2008) using alternative approaches. Then we compare the results of both techniques in order to analyze the potential differences between these approaches. Secondly we estimate the effects of the reforms on inefficiency levels and we find that the rankings obtained are similar, and that the best way to foster an increase in efficiency is always by combining vertical and horizontal reforms in the rail industry.

Consequently, harmful environmental impacts of transport are likely to increase unless specific policies aimed at mitigating these impacts can be successfully implemented. Based on EU-level requirements for carbon dioxide emission reductions, a car tax reform was enacted in Finland in 2008. By using the environmental protection process (EPP) framework as a conceptual tool, we perform a quantitative content analysis of media discussion of the car tax reform. The EPP framework is an integrative tool, aimed at an overall view of the characteristics of environmental problems and mitigation measures. The results show that societal factors, emissions, measures and the potential side-effects of the reform dominated the media discussion. Short-term impacts were emphasised over longer-term perspectives in the discussion's future-orientation. Overall, it seems that in spite of a relatively wide-ranging discussion, the media debate contributed only marginally to public understanding of the prerequisites for environmentally sustainable transport.

The established objective was to characterize the actions that male and female Venezuelan citizens use in the daily community organization routine in El Callao, Sector 4, San Francisco Municipality, State of Zulia, Venezuela. The research had a qualitative focus and employed the hermeneutic method. Techniques were the semi-structured interview and participative observation, using transcription and categorization. The main informants were ten spokespersons from the communal council in El Callao, Sector 4. Conclusions are that the daily routine in this organization is dynamized by: 1) the popular episteme, manifested unconsciously in the interweaving of personal relationships established among the members of the team and leading to the creation of a minimal communication bridge to incentivize people's participation through personal contact family to family, neighbor to neighbor, friend to friend; through friendship, affectivity and companionship. 2) Religion, which acts as a spiritual resource to help in deploying their activities. Their working strategies are influenced by the affective component.

Yet despite this growing emphasis on the importance of psychological well-being, there is little attention devoted to how the transport system can influence life satisfaction. This paper explores the role that well-being currently plays in transport policy and scopes out its potential to inform transport policy in future. Based on a review of the psychological literature, a model is proposed that hypothesises that transport influences life satisfaction indirectly through facilitating access to important life domains and directly through physical mobility and externalities. Preliminary studies in transport provide support for this model. Policy implications are discussed and areas of future research using this framework are suggested. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Termination rights are, however, widely criticized, mainly for fear that the buyer may use nonconformity as a pretext for getting rid of a contract he no longer wants. We show that this possibility of opportunistic termination might actually have positive effects. Under some circumstances, it will lead to redistribution in favor of the buyer without any loss of efficiency.

It finds overall convergence but growing within country disparities, especially due to the behaviour of newcomer regions. It also finds strong (but falling) spatial correlation of per-capita income. Starting from this evidence, the paper considers the role of socio-economic features, specialisation patterns and geographical factors in explaining within countries disparities. Overall we find that partly specialisation but more evidently socio-economic clusters have a good explanatory power while simple geographical factors do not explain within countries divergence. This does not mean that spatial factors are not important: rather it means that agglomeration alone cannot explain a complex and variegated pattern of growth where structural and socio-economic factors appear to be playing an important and increasing role.","[Chapman, Sheila A.] Univ LUMSA Rome, I-00136 Rome, Italy",Universita LUMSA,"Meliciani, V (通讯作者)，Univ Teramo, Viale Crucioli 122, I-64100 Teramo, Italy.",chapman@lumsa.it; vmeliciani@unite.it,,,,,,,40,17,17,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

I argue that a generalization of Roemer's (1998) proposal is the most satisfactory approach.

In this paper, we take advantage of a quasi experiment afforded by the fact that revolving-door laws were introduced in different states at different times to investigate their effects on electricity prices. Our findings suggest that while revolving-door laws temporarily dampen industrial electricity prices, they have no effect on commercial or residential prices. There is also some evidence that these regulations affect the characteristics of state public utility commissioners; commissioners from states with revolving-door regulations serve shorter terms and are less likely to be subsequently employed in the private sector, compared with their counterparts from states without revolving-door laws.","[Law, Marc T.] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Long, Cheryl X.] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",University of Vermont; Xiamen University,"Law, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",,,,,,,,16,10,13,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The effect of demographic change on travel demand arises through changes in land use, which in turn are affected by planning policy. In particular, how the additional population will be housed, whether on greenfield or brownfield sites, will be important for decisions on investment in the transport system. Increased population density within existing urban areas facilitates access and is best served by public transport. The declining share of car-based journeys in London illustrates the scope for containing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To accomplish this, descriptive methodology was used; structured and semi-structured interviews were applied to spokespersons from these councils as well as selected neighbors and community leaders. Results showed: a) The consultative mode has a greater presence in community council management, preserving the scenario of representation, now, in the power of the representatives that comprise them; very few cases involve neighbors in their activities. b) These community organizations have the capacity to develop and implement projects, despite limited technical support from public or private institutions and reliance on state funding.

As a result, financial markets can force these countries' sovereigns into default. In this sense member countries of a monetary union are downgraded to the status of emerging economies. This makes the monetary union fragile and vulnerable to changing market sentiments. It also makes it possible that self-fulfilling multiple equilibria arise. I analyse the implications of this fragility for the governance of the Eurozone. I conclude that the new governance structure (ESM) does not sufficiently recognise this fragility. Some of the features of the new financial assistance are likely to increase this fragility. In addition, it is also likely to rip member-countries of their ability to use the automatic stabilisers during a recession. This is surely a step backward in the long history of social progress in Europe. I suggest a different approach to deal with these problems.","Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"De Grauwe, P (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium.",paul.degrauwe@econ.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,24,8,9,0,19,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Mediating interests in the EU Member States, as demonstrated in the case of the Czech Republic, are discussed. Czech agriculture bears the heritage of an extensively collectivised sector. The case study demonstrates the efforts of a new Member State to modernise in the area of professionally mediated interests while at the same time the controversial role of agricultural organisations in the competitive fight for agricultural subsidies. The strong position of the lobby, and agricultural lobbies, is primarily based on the unity and the unilateral nature of their interests, the excellent organisation when promoting these interests, the ability to gain the sympathy of politicians, consumers and tax payers, the existence of relatively small and homogenous groups and, last but not least, their abilities at pointing out the fact that agriculture has an irreplaceable role in society and the national and international economy. The liberalisation of agriculture depends on a successful fall in the importance and voter strength of the agricultural sector and its sympathisers and a balancing of its natural political advantages. Strong elements supporting the liberalisation of agriculture are also sustainable development and modernisation of the agricultural sector and the sustainable economic development, distancing itself from agricultural roots.

Contrary to this view, this paper presents a descriptive and documentary analysis that aims to provide an alternative model for motivation. The basic idea of this model is that human motivation is a complex phenomenon, directed toward covering several different goals: the needs and wants of the individual. These goals are organized in a hierarchical structure that presents specific characteristics associated with growth principles for needs, satiation and non-independence. The ultimate objective is to satisfy those goals, presupposing the construction of some adaptive aspiration levels. Both the construction of these levels and identification of the needs and wants structure are cognitive processes; in a context subject to uncertainty and among individuals with limited cognitive and rational capacities, these processes are conditioned by the socio-institutional environment. This concept of motivation is more realistic than the vision from the conventional economy and is consistent with the findings of other sciences, such as psychology, sociology and neuroscience. However, this model is not a closed theoretical body, but is open to the possibility of incorporating improvements.","Univ Leon, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ & Estadist, E-24071 Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Fernández-Huerga, E (通讯作者)，Univ Leon, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ & Estadist, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",eduardo.fernandez@unileon.es,"Fernández-Huerga, Eduardo/AAC-5767-2019","Fernández-Huerga, Eduardo/0000-0001-8974-0440",,,,,66,2,3,0,17,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Drawing on the case of Sitakunda-Bhatiary, Bangladesh, it shows that symbiosis is intricately bound up in the global circulation of wastes and their recovery through secondary processing. It draws attention to the importance of key places as conduits in the transformation of materials and secondary processing; emphasizes their importance as sites of symbiotic activity; and shows how such places exemplify economies of recycling, reuse, and remanufacturing, but in conditions of minimal environmental regulation. It therefore shows that contemporary symbiosis is not necessarily clean and green and may be very messy; that it can be generative of agglomerations, not just dependent upon prior agglomerations; that such agglomerations may be cross sectoral, not just interplant; and that symbiosis needs to be thought of not just through geographic proximity, but through the spatialities of globalization.","[Gregson, Nicky] Univ Durham, Sci Labs, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Akter, Nasreen; Foisal, Sadat] Univ Chittagong, Dept Anthropol, Chittagong, Bangladesh",Durham University; University of Chittagong,"Gregson, N (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sci Labs, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",nicky.gregson@durham.ac.uk; m.a.crang@durham.ac.uk; fuahamed@sosca.u.acin; nasreen_shilpi@yahoo.co.uk; Raihana.ferdous@durham.ac.uk; Sadatahmedfoisal@gmail.com; ray.hudson@durham.ac.uk,"Crang, Mike/C-8178-2011; Gregson, Nicky/E-2167-2014","Crang, Mike/0000-0001-7678-8496; Gregson, Nicky/0000-0002-2796-389X; Ferdous, Raihana/0000-0001-5319-9007",EPSRC [EP/H045155/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/E002196/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E002196/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/H045155/1] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,72,55,59,1,55,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

For firms with low absorptive capability, the choices are reversed, that is to use LowInn and HighOut strategies when competitive intensity is low, and LowOut and HighInn R&D strategies when competitive intensity is high.

According to Reasoned Action Theory, consumer attitude determines the consumer purchase intention of a new product; however, the literature does not contain a well-established scale to measure consumer attitude towards product innovation, especially at the product category level. This study develops a category-specific measure of consumer attitude towards product innovation and investigates the relationship between consumer attitude and its antecedent factors. The procedure proposed by Churchill () is used to create and refine a multi-item measurement scale. Study results reveal that consumer attitude towards product innovation contains three components of quality, value, and attractiveness. The value and attractiveness of product innovation seem more important than quality to influence consumer purchase intention; in addition, consumer change seeking has a positive effect on consumer attitude towards product innovation. Consumer product knowledge has a positive influence on value and attractiveness components; however, the influence of consumer product knowledge on the quality component is insignificant. The results provide a theoretical insight into product innovation and management implications for new product providers.","[Lee, Bruce C.

While the first problem concerns the issue of the possible emergence of regional disparities, the second one solves the contrary, the possibility of reducing the existing regional disparities. Regional disparities are understood quite narrowly in this paper, covering just the area of the difference between the economic productivity of the regions. It is known that the objective of regional policy is the regional development aimed at increasing the cohesion of regions and their competitiveness. As will be shown in the first model it is more efficient to allocate investment and concentrate economic activity in those regions that have higher productivity. In this way, regions with lower productivity may get behind those regions that have higher productivity. These regions will then become less competitive and in order to maintain cohesion of regions it would be useful to make some redistribution of income between more productive and less productive regions. To the possible differences in productivity between regions the government directs investment in infrastructure to less developed regions. The aim of such efforts is to improve the equipment of the population of the given region, to improve the technological level of the region and to strengthen the competitiveness of that region. This is the reason why the second mathematical model, described in this paper, deals with income redistribution and regional investments in their infrastructure. Both models are formulated as optimal control problems in continuous time and Pontryagin maximum principle is used to locate optimal solutions finally.","Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informatiky & Managementu, Katedra Informatiky & Kvantitativnich Metod, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Prazák, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informatiky & Managementu, Katedra Informatiky & Kvantitativnich Metod, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",pavel.prazak@uhk.cz,"Prazak, Pavel/F-8299-2013","Prazak, Pavel/0000-0001-9160-5758",,,,,17,6,6,0,12,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It does so through questioning how the UK government contended that the number of civilian deaths stemming from the 2003 Iraq invasion could not 'reliably' be known. The twists and turns of official public statements are interpreted against the back region government and civil service deliberations obtained under the British Freedom of Information Act. Far from settling what took place, however, this material compounded the challenge of trying to characterize different strategies for manufacturing ignorance. From an examination of the choices, contingencies and challenges in the way actors and social scientists depict ignorance, this paper then considers future possibilities for inquiry whereby social analysts can question their role in producing ignorance while questioning claims of ignorance.","Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 2DZ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Rappert, B (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 2DZ, Devon, England.",B.Rappert@ex.ac.uk,,,,,,,59,50,54,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Similar results are obtained at single equation level when a vector moving average framework is considered. In addition, the out-of-sample forecasting properties of aggregate and disaggregate procedures to forecast the aggregate variable are provided. Moreover, it is shown that the condition of equality of aggregate and disaggregate predictors is not necessary for the equality of their mean squared errors.

Desertec as a scenario towards a restructuration of energy supply within the EUMENA-region. In 2009 the Desertec Industrial Initiative (DII) was founded by several, predominant German enterprises including the NGO Desertec Foundation. The objective of DII is to organize the conditions for the realisation of the Desertec idea, which aims to supply, in a large scale manner, Europe with electricity produced in solar power plants in North Africa and the Arabic peninsula. The Desertec concept is playing with and combining different myths as the desert, the large-scale, megatechnic vision and the reconciliation of the North and the South. Critics of Desertec argue that the project has the intention to impede an energy transition towards decentralized energy structures in Europe and that Desertec has a neo-colonial attitude. Both the Arab spring and the disaster of Fukushima have changed the discoursive landscape and the institutional conditions around the realisation of Desertec. The paper raises and responds to the question, whether Desertec can be seen as a Fordist or a Postfordist project according to the categories of the French regulation school. Additionally, the Desertec concept is reflected from a cultural geography's point of view.","Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Geog, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Schmitt, T (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Geog, Kochstr 4-4, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",Tho-mas.Schmitt@geographie.uni-erlangen.de,,,,,,,60,3,3,1,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Using data from annual reports, this article tests the validity of this claim. We find that while pharmaceutical firms do invest in R&D, they also enjoy strong rents; between 1988 and 2009, pharmaceuticals enjoyed profits of 3 to 37 times the all-industry average, depending on the years, while investing proportionately less in R&D than other high-R&D firms. Costs of pharmaceutical drugs have successfully flown below the radar in much of the current health care debate, with producers managing to obstruct alternative sourcing as well as payment cuts. While health care is examined for savings in other areas, sustained high pharmaceutical profits suggest that as a new health care policy develops in the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry should not be excluded from examination for significant savings in health care costs.","[Spitz, Janet] Coll St Rose, Sch Business, Albany, NY 12203 USA",,"Spitz, J (通讯作者)，Coll St Rose, Sch Business, 432 Western Ave, Albany, NY 12203 USA.",spitzj@strose.edu,,,,,,,82,11,19,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Indicators of discrimination against women, including employment ratios and differences in income, show that there have been considerable gains in the recent past. These measures are, however, often biased. In this study a different, specific and concrete method of describing and detecting discrimination is presented, namely the difference in the number of ablution facilities provided for each gender group in public spaces. Ablution facilities at airports, train stations and shopping centres in four major South African cities (N=128) were inspected. Medium to large differences in the respective number of facilities were found (eta(2) .05 to .13), with women receiving fewer service facilities than men. These results suggest that, despite progressive legislation and vigorous affirmative action in South Africa, local women are still being discriminated against on a very concrete, visible level. The effectiveness of the measurement tool is also discussed.","Univ S Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Steyn, R (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Steyn, Renier/M-4675-2017; Steyn, Renier/ABA-2208-2020","Steyn, Renier/0000-0002-2446-3662; Steyn, Renier/0000-0002-2446-3662",,,,,48,4,4,1,11,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The victory of the managerial experts made assets legible and therefore 'value-able'. (2) the paper demonstrates that the promotion of managerial experts at the expense of technical experts was a deeply political transformation, as it involved the replacement of a well-established, well-connected group of incumbent political actors. More specifically, I show how the promotion of managerial experts at the expense of technical experts helped the federal government of President Putin eliminate one of the main challengers to its ability to regulate economic activity from the centre - regional governors.","[Wengle, Susanne A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wengle, Susanne A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Chicago; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Wengle, SA (通讯作者)，401 Pick Hall,5828 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",wengle@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,79,10,12,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This paper investigates the sustainability credentials of DRT services using evidence from UK-based research. More specifically, six potential DRT market niches were identified, including those which offer potential commercial opportunities (e.g. airport surface access) and those that meet social needs (e.g. non-emergency hospital trips). Mode share of these DRT services, against car or bus travel, was simulated from mixed logit models within a panel data modelling framework estimated from survey data. The survey was conducted of over 400 respondents in urban (Rochdale, Manchester) and rural (Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire) areas. Experience shows that it is particularly difficult to make DRT services financially viable. Of the DRT services investigated, those targeting airline or train passengers offer potential. However, they are in direct competition with the car, and so their success depends on the cost and availability of parking spaces. Some of the DRT schemes explored meet social needs, such as to access shopping facilities or hospitals, but they face cost challenges. In addition, institutional barriers for new DRT schemes need to be overcome in order to develop a sustainable local public transport system. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The model considers: a) that a person sometimes travels with friends and family, and therefore shares the travel expenses and/or satisfies several travel needs, and b) that uses in given time period more than one mode of transport. The parameters of the model are derived by detailed, face-to-face, computer-assisted interviews. A limited number of interviews have been so far completed. However, they hint to some very interesting empirical evidence. It is found that car ownership is currently very high in the Italian families and that the car is used extensively both for work \ study and, especially, for other-than-work \ study trip purposes. Offering a carsharing service (CS) would enhance the mode choice and could, in some cases, lower the total mobility costs. The respondents assign quite a large value to the pleasure of owning a car, much more so than the pleasure of being carsharing users, both for workers and for students. Consequently, the respondents would dislike not owing a private car, while having the choice between the private and the carsharing car is preferred especially by the students. The mobility cost indicators reflect, but not perfectly, the preference-based choices of the sample. Three individual case studies are further analyzed. They have been defined as: a low, a medium and a high mobility case study. The low mobility case study shows that these persons would largely benefit from the existence of a CS service, they would use it occasionally and they would probably be willing to forgo the private car. The medium mobility case study shows that the variables parking time, access time and CS fare can easily switch the balance between convenience and inconvenience of using CS. The higher mobility case study in a small town setting demonstrates that in such circumstances the prospects for a viable CS service are rather bleak.","[Danielis, Romeo; Rotaris, Lucia; Rusich, Andrea; Valeri, Eva] Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Matemat & Stat, I-34127 Trieste, Italy",University of Trieste,"Danielis, R (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Matemat & Stat, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",danielis@units.it,,"Valeri, Eva/0000-0003-3000-0397",,,,,40,3,3,0,22,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

One consequence of this is that forecasts are updated frequently. How should individuals or institutions react to updates, given that these are likewise expected to be uncertain? We discuss this problem in the context of a life cycle saving and labor supply problem, in which a cohort of workers decides how much to work and how much to save for mutual pensions. Mortality is stochastic and point forecasts are updated regularly. A Markovian approximation for the predictive distribution of mortality is derived. This renders the model computationally tractable, and allows us to compare a theoretically optimal rational expectations solution to a strategy in which the cohort merely updates the life cycle plan to match each updated mortality forecast. The implications of the analyses for overlapping generations modeling of pension systems are pointed out. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

All previous results found that potential entry would lead to lower prices and greater competition. Examining markets where entry occurs by the acquisition of access rights from an existing incumbent, we demonstrate that, where competitive choices are strategic complements, a more efficient entrant may be unable to acquire those rights from a less efficient incumbent due to the unilateral accommodating behavior of the efficient incumbent. Similarly, such accommodating behavior may deter efficient investment by an incumbent. These results have implications as to how economists view potential entry and its benefits.","[Byford, Martin C.] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Gans, Joshua S.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Toronto,"Byford, MC (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Bldg 80 Level 11,445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",martin.byford@rmit.edu.au; Joshua.Gans@rotman.utoronto.ca,,"Byford, Martin/0000-0003-0483-155X",,,,,16,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

J,"Macmillen, J; Stead, D",,,,"Macmillen, James; Stead, Dominic",,,Learning heuristic or political rhetoric? Sustainable mobility and the functions of 'best practice',TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sustainable transport policy; Best practice; Policy actors; UK; Walking; Cycling,POLICY TRANSFER; TRANSPORT POLICY; CONVERGENCE; SUCCESS; BRITISH,"In recent years, the notion of 'best practice' has become accepted into the standard lexicon of transport policy. Best (or 'good') practice approaches to the development, implementation, and evaluation of transport interventions regularly appear at all scales of policy-making, and seem to enjoy explicit and implicit support from a diverse array of political actors. Critical reflection on this trend has chiefly focussed on the spatial limits to policy transfer, highlighting the salience of institutional heterogeneity as a limitation to policy convergence. Drawing on a series of in-depth interviews with actors involved in UK walking and cycling policy, this paper explores two fundamental questions relating to best practices as they are directly 'produced' and 'consumed': firstly, how the notion of best practice is encountered and understood by policy actors and, secondly, why policy actors employ the notion in the course of their professional work. Despite its intuitive appeal, we argue that the notion of best practice in this context is characterised by substantial conceptual ambiguity and diverse functionality. Five distinct reasons why policy actors employ the term best practice emerge from the analysis. These we term heuristic learning, discourse manipulation, self-promotion, affiliative justification and strategic articulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The system combines quantitative and qualitative analysis methods to develop an estimated fiscal cost, in addition to estimates of GHG emissions, transportation time and cost savings, and a prioritization metric focusing on social impact of road construction. The IPSS system has been applied in several case studies, including South Africa, Mozambique, Vietnam, a pan-African analysis, and several Asian countries including China, South Korea, Mongolia, and Japan. This paper serves as the first comprehensive explanation of the IPSS system, including the literature review, background, and methodology. The results section focuses on the costs of climate change in an illustrative case study of the State of Colorado in the United States, due to specific data and outputs required for the other analysis components. This paper focuses on the need for a holistic systems approach, its relevance to transportation planning and investment, and one example of how climate change considerations can be quantified and applied at the policy level.

Early work, built firmly upon a qualitative approach to the collection and analyses of new intercity datasets, considered cities as being constituted by their relations with other cities. Subsequent research, however, would take a strong quantitative turn, best demonstrated through the articulation of the inter-locking world city network (ILWCN) model' for measuring relations between cities. In this paper, we develop a critique of research based around the ILWCN model, arguing that this top down' quantitative approach has now reached a theoretical impasse. To address this impasse, we argue for a move away from structural approaches in which the firm is the main unit of analysis, towards qualitative approaches in which individual agency and practice are afforded greater importance.","[Watson, Allan] Staffordshire Univ, Dept Geog, Ctr Sci, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DF, Staffs, England; [Beaverstock, Jonathan V.] Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England",Staffordshire University; University of Bristol,"Watson, A (通讯作者)，Staffordshire Univ, Dept Geog, Ctr Sci, Leek Rd, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DF, Staffs, England.",a.watson@staffs.ac.uk; jonathan.beaverstock@bristol.ac.uk,"Watson, Allan/A-2098-2009","Watson, Allan/0000-0001-7120-7664; Beaverstock, Jonathan/0000-0003-1228-9465",,,,,111,42,48,0,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

However, the long lifetimes both of individual aircraft and of aircraft models in production mean that, in reality, any technology-based methods of emissions reduction will take a significant time to percolate into the fleet. The timescale over which new technology enters the fleet depends on a number of factors, most notably the demand for new aircraft, and is a potential barrier for technology-based (as opposed to economic or operational) policy measures. In this paper we evaluate aviation CO2 emissions for the US, Europe and the world, discuss the theoretical reductions possible by substituting newer technology, assess the timescales on which these emission reductions are achievable, and discuss other timescales which may affect policy outcomes.

Motivated by empirical features, (a) we specify a time-varying probability of shifts as a function of large negative lagged returns; and (b) we incorporate a mean reverting mechanism so that the sign and magnitude of the jump component change according to the deviations of past jumps from their long run mean. This allows the possibility of forecasting the sign and magnitude of the jumps. We estimate the model using twelve different series, and compare its forecasting performance with those of a variety of competing models at various horizons. A striking feature is that the modified RLS model has the smallest mean square forecast errors in 64 of the 72 cases, while it is a close second for the other 8 cases. The improvement in forecast accuracy is often substantial, especially for medium- to long-horizon forecasts. This is strong evidence that our modified RLS model offers important gains in forecasting performance. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Since 1982, the state-owned company that operates the port's only terminal has attempted to reduce dredging costs by enlarging a mole built perpendicular to the coast. Unfortunately, this solution has altered the coast's dynamic equilibrium and produced the virtual destruction of Trujillo's beaches. Cost estimates of a permanent solution are higher than the benefits the population perceives. This paper aims to determine, from the economic point of view, whether it is worth maintaining the port open and, if so, how to pay for the cost of repairing the externality it causes to Trujillo's inhabitants. Results provide evidence that even ports with limited demand have the potential to produce important savings when alternative ports are located relatively far. Quantitative results also show that: (i) operating Salaverry's single terminal will not generate enough resources to pay for repairing Trujillo's beaches; (ii) if the government wants to concession the terminal to a private company, an additional subsidy will have to be granted; and (iii) whereas the total cost of maintaining the port open is dear, CBA analysis shows that dosing it down would cost society even more.","Univ Pacifico, Lima 11, Peru",Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Defilippi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Av Salaverry 2020, Lima 11, Peru.",defilippi_ef@up.edu.pe,"Defilippi, Enzo/AGR-6849-2022; Defilippi, Enzo/AAG-2469-2019","Defilippi, Enzo/0000-0002-5826-096X; Defilippi, Enzo/0000-0002-5826-096X",,,,,25,0,0,0,12,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Using a DVD package created for this study, this experiment tested the impact of DVD brand name, educational claim specificity, and a personality dimension (i.e., regulatory focus orientation) on parents' perceptions of educational value and purchase intentions. Parents reacted similarly to specific and ambiguous educational statements, but gave higher educational value estimations when the brand name had an educational cue. An interaction suggested that the effect of the claim outcome specificity depended on the claim verb specificity. Parents with a strong focus on pursuing possible rewards (promotion focus) had higher perceptions of educational value and stronger desires to purchase the DVD.

Many have theorized that this required breach of confidentiality may have adverse effects on effective psychological treatment-but the issue remains unaddressed empirically. Because of the presence of duty-to-warn laws, patients might forgo mental health treatment that would prevent violence. Using a fixed-effects model and exploiting the variation in the timing and style of duty-to-warn laws across states, I find that mandatory duty-to-warn laws cause an increase in the homicide rate of .4, or 5 percent.

The suitable quantiles of the distribution of these forecast errors are then used along with the point forecast made by the selected model to construct an empirical prediction interval.

Consistent with the economic model of crime this effect is stronger for crimes motivated by financial gain, such as motor vehicle theft and robbery. Moreover, the effect is only present for those immigrants most likely to have poor labor market outcomes.

A voluntary instrument, private standards are so widespread to have become de facto mandatory for suppliers who wish to access the most profitable markets. Developed by retailers and business coalitions and enforced through third-party certification, private food safety standards constitute one of the principal food safety governance instruments of agribusiness value chains. Albeit private and voluntary, such standards have profound public implications because they contribute to food safety and protect consumers' health. This article uses law and economics theory to identify their strengths and vulnerabilities and understand the relationship between public and private regulation. Specifically, it examines whether private standards can fulfill the public interest objective of protecting consumers' health and whether they compete with or rather complement public regulation. The article argues that private standards have emerged in response to food scares to coordinate complex food value chains and have become ever more relevant in the context of intense market globalization, an area in which public regulation often failed. Among the advantages of private standards, are their flexibility and ability to rapidly respond to new risks. Through their focus on management-based regulation and strong market incentives for producers, private standards promote compliance better than traditional inspection methods. Private standards also present several gray areas including increased risk of capture due to their limited transparency and gaps in enforcement by third-party certifiers. The article suggests areas that deserve additional scrutiny, especially the opacity of standards vis-A -vis consumers and the public sector and the quality and reliability of third party certification.","[Fagotto, Elena] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Ash Ctr Democrat Governance & Innovat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fagotto, Elena] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Inst Law & Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Harvard University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Fagotto, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Ash Ctr Democrat Governance & Innovat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",elena_fagotto@hks.harvard.edu,,,,,,,53,26,29,1,77,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The broadcasters influence the probability of getting viewer attention through the amount that they spend on programming, so that their advertising capacity depends on their own program outlays as well as on those of their competitors. A larger number of broadcasters will reduce overall capacity even when total program outlays are kept fixed, because the attention of viewers is split among a larger number of channels. The authors derive properties of equilibrium in an oligopolistic market with private broadcasters and show that the number of firms has a negative effect on overall advertising and viewer satisfaction. If there is a public channel that also sells advertisements but does not maximize profits, this will have a positive effect on advertiser and viewer satisfaction.","[Hansen, Bodil O.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Keiding, Hans] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School; University of Copenhagen,"Keiding, H (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",hans.keiding@econ.ku.dk,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

The work of university teachers is very demanding - their effects on students, laic and professional public, employers, incubators of innovation etc. is a reflection of their knowledge, skills, experience, and above of all: their motivation. In addition, teachers are confronted with ideas, knowledge, and motivation of students on the each lecture or seminar. Therefore, it is necessary to influence desirably the motivation of university teachers, act upon it systematically, ethically and constructively. Literature and practice consistently present that motivation is linked to remuneration. Therefore, the content of paper consists in a definition of motivation, motivating and remuneration, and mutual relations between the motivating and the remuneration. We can understand remuneration as a separate function of human resource management, while its outputs and effects only indirectly affect the work motivation and satisfaction, or remuneration can be seen as a motivating tool, as a complex system elements that affect together the motivation of university teachers in terms of remuneration for performed (past) work, and at the same time, in terms of perspective (forward) commitment for expected work. In the methodological part of paper, considered theoretical views are supported by results of own questionnaire survey conducted at the University of Zilina (Slovak Republic) in 2013 which aimed to reveal a deeper understanding of the university teachers' motivation. 86 university teachers and managers participated in the survey what represents 13.13% of all teachers. The results show that motivation is shaped by numerous organizational motivators. Generalizing ascertained data, the remuneration, understood complexly as a system of efficient motivators, takes an important position in the motivating university teachers and managers.

The Global Top MBA Rankings 2013 of Financial Times, London, ranks Indian School of Business 34th and IIM Ahmadabad 26th. Yet, there is a huge demand-supply gap. So those having the means, irrespective of their capability, migrate abroad for management education. This does not benefit the Indian economy. Absence of competition for domestic players discourages innovation and quality service. Based on her macro level overview and study of live cases of FDI in management education in India through either direct setting up of campuses or, through collaborations with established management institutes, the author contends that FDI in management education will make foreign education affordable, improve the services of Indian B-Schools, and prevent drain of foreign exchange.

There are significant impacts of paper industry on the environment and economy during its traditional production process. Instead of using virgin raw materials, in many countries wastepaper are collected and reused by recycling which saves resources like energy, time, and raw material. In this study the traditional paper production (system 1) which uses a virgin raw material is economically compared with recycling option (system 2). The two systems are compared based on their investment, material, maintenance and operating costs considering the time value of money. Annual worth (AW) method is used for economic comparison. AW values of all estimated disbursements during the life cycle of the systems are presented.

This article, drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's conception of social capital, in contrast to the widely accepted notion of it, critically examines the link between social capital and group-based micro finance.

Business ethics is about identifying and implementing values, rules and standards of conduct for guiding morally right behaviour in an organisation's interaction with its stakeholders. Against this background a quantitative analysis of the ethical practices of 46 companies operating in the Eastern Cape automotive industry was conducted to determine the extent to which ethics-related interventions contributed to establishing and maintaining an ethical organisational environment. A structured online questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data collected was subjected to extensive statistical analyses, including Cronbach Alpha coefficients and item total correlations, and various descriptive statistics were included as a quantitative summary of the data. A constant reference value for the study was also calculated to allow inferences regarding the significance of the tested variables to the study. The results revealed that the organisations in the sample are highly ethical due to the presence of ethics-related interventions, including a code of ethics, committed leadership, adherence to internal and external governance requirements, compliance with legislation and encouragement and disclosure of unethical behaviour. In light of the high number of ethical scandals internationally, this study will add to the empirical body of business ethics research, as it provides organisations with a framework to establish and maintain an ethical business environment.","[Lloyd, Hendrik R.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Sch Econ Dev Studies & Tourism, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Mey, Michelle R.; Ramalingum, Koman] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Sch Ind Psychol & Human Resource Management, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University; Nelson Mandela University,"Lloyd, HR (通讯作者)，Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Sch Econ Dev Studies & Tourism, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",,"Lloyd, Hendrik/R-9834-2019",,,,,,40,4,7,0,16,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

A construction contract agreement which regulates the relationships between the client and the contractor is also viewed as a product of communication. The authors hypothesize that the main cause of conflicts in the construction industry is unsuccessful communication between the client and the contractor.

The fundamental purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the transition from socialism to capitalism in these countries has strongly changed the structure of transactions made through black market. Until 1989, the main role of the black market was to provide basic goods, because of the failure of planners to allocate scarce resources. The analysis of statistical data shows that the transformations of these economic systems have generated new causes of the black market: excessive taxation, low confidence in the new institutions, corruption and low tax morale. Our analysis shows that in the last decade, as the population confidence in political institutions has began to grow, the share of informal activities in GDP has began to decline.","[Mursa, Gabriel Claudiu; Isan, Vasile; Ifrim, Mihaela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Mursa, GC (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Bvd Carol I 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",mursa@uaic.ro; visan@uaic.ro; mihaela.ifrim@uaic.ro,"Ifrim, Mihaela/AAI-3121-2021",,,,,,30,2,2,0,36,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Mirroring effects relate to adaptation, innovative governance forms of which in our sample are strongly affected by such features as size failing to fit the potential or actual dimension of the market (size factor). Acquainted markets have the effect of decreasing difficulties in accessing countries' institutional externalities and gaining marketing competitive advantages. Our results show that MMNEs tend to replicate their existing business models when they enter ` informed' and 'experienced' markets.

The Czech Republic is one of the leading recipients of the FDI in the CEE. The impact of the FDI is visible not only on national level but also on the regional level. Despite the fact that the Czech Republic belongs to the middle-size EU Member States, the regional development after 1989 differs distinctly. The article focuses on results of the questionnaire survey of the foreign-owned companies in Liberec region. The results are compared with the average values of the indicators for Liberec region. The aim of the article is to determine the motives of the investment, the structure of exported production, workforce development and employment of foreign workers in the companies that came to the Liberec Region as the FDI. We have also verified the hypothesis that the main reasons of the FDI entry were the low production costs and the investment incentives. According to the results of the questionnaire survey we can confirm only the first part of the hypothesis. The importance of the low production costs which were the most significant for almost 60% of the companies. Another essential factor for 50% companies was the qualified labor force. However, this does not corresponds with the education structure of the FDI workers, 62% of them achieved only basic education or secondary education without leaving examination. Anyway, the investment incentives were significant reason only for one company. According to our survey the FDI helped the region to reallocate the workforce form the previously dominating textile industry to nowadays dominating automotive sector. The other positive effect of the FDI is the employment of the lower qualified work force which has a worse position on the labor market than the highly qualified. Nevertheless it neither is important to emphasize that the positive effect of the FDI is nor based on the long-term factors.","[Potuzakova, Zuzana; Demel, Jaroslav] Tech Univ Liberci, Ekon Fak, Katedra Mkt & Obchodu, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Potuzáková, Z (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Ekon Fak, Katedra Mkt & Obchodu, Liberec, Czech Republic.",zuzana.potuzakova@tul.cz; jaroslav.demel@tul.cz,"Demel, Jaroslav/HLP-4946-2023","Demel, Jaroslav/0000-0001-6634-2263",,,,,41,1,1,0,10,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Biological gender is seen as one of the critical factors impacting entrepreneurship behavior. A need for inclusive development has been extensively focused on in order to promote entrepreneurship in women. However, rather than biological gender, it is the 'gender role behavior' which is more relevant for finally expressed behavior. Androgyny is a balanced psychological identity that combines the social behaviors of both genders. Androgynous behavior increases the flexibility and adaptability of individuals as they have access to both behavior patterns based on situational necessity rather than being confined to socially dictated gender stereotypical behavior. This flexibility is imperative for entrepreneurs who have to constantly keep adjusting to environmental challenges. This study attempts to understand the 'gender - role orientation' of N=51 Indian women entrepreneurs who have fulfilled stringent performance criteria to qualify for participation in an entrepreneurial development program. Bem's sex role inventory (BSRI) was used for measuring the gender role orientation of these participants. 45% (n=23) of the participants had an androgynous gender- role orientation in this study. The number of years of entrepreneurial experience, type of business, external cultural influences and the stage of entrepreneurial venture, all had a role in the evolution of androgyny. The implications of these findings on entrepreneurship behavior are discussed from an Indian context. (c) 2014 The Authors.

However, due to their small size, the growth of MSMEs is vulnerable. Generally, MSMEs lack the capability to innovate on their own, and most MSMEs cannot grow into large and competitive firms. In this paper, we argue that intermediary organizations can integrate innovation resources for MSMEs and enhance the innovation capabilities of MSMEs. Through a case study of an intermediary organization in China, this paper confirms that intermediary organizations can expand the innovation resources available for MSMEs, help MSMEs scan and identify useful innovation resources, and provide expertise to MSMEs in utilizing innovation resources. While traditional resource-based theories maintain that a firm's internal heterogeneous resources can generate competitive advantages, this paper proposes that specialized intermediary organizations can also play the role of resource integrators for small firms and help small firms acquire and utilize external strategic resources. This research also provides insights to the literature about the growth of local firms in emerging economies. Although technological innovation projects require significant R&D investments and are difficult for local MSMEs to handle, this paper suggests that intermediary organizations can help MSMEs initiate innovation projects by expanding the resources available to MSMEs and by assisting them in maximizing the use of the resources at a reasonable cost. Finally, this paper provides some policy implications for firms and policy-makers in emerging economies.","[Liu, Xuefeng] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Shou, Yongyi] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xie, Yuying] Shepherd Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Shepherdstown, WV USA",Xiamen University; Zhejiang University,"Shou, YY (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yshou@zju.edu.cn,"Liu, xuefeng/IUP-1483-2023","Shou, Yongyi/0000-0002-8152-8936; Xie, Yuying/0000-0002-7710-3425",,,,,47,6,6,1,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The quality of health care is linked to a series of variables that could be controlled by management. Nevertheless, the users' perception of the service offers fundamental keys about the quality of the attention offered by hospitals, considering their expectations. Research was carried out at the consultation service for internal medicine in a hospital in the city of Maracaibo, selected randomly from the city's hospital network. A questionnaire was applied to a sample of the total population treated at the internal medicine service in the selected hospital. For the systemization of data, SPSS V.15 software was used. As a result, it was found that it is necessary to monitor the rendering of health services through quality management indicators. Conclusions are that it is important to establish a system that guarantees quality in rendering health services, which includes, fundamentally, their planning, control, assurance and assessment within a duly planned management program, in order to satisfy the service users.","[Vargas Gonzalez, Vilma] Univ Zulia, Ctr Estudios Empresa, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; [Valecillos, Jose; Hernandez, Carmen] Univ Zulia, Ctr Estudios Empresa, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,,vilmavargashernandez@yahoo.es; valecillosjose16@yahoo.com.ve; cchiquinquira_1990@hotmail.com,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

This paper proposes a novel, adaptive and efficient method to forecast both volatility and VaR. Extending existing exponential smoothing as well as GARCH formulations, the method is motivated from an asymmetric Laplace distribution, where skewness and heavy tails in return distributions, and their potentially time-varying nature, are taken into account. The proposed volatility equation also involves novel time-varying dynamics. Back-testing results illustrate that the proposed method offers a viable, and more accurate, though conservative, improvement in forecasting VaR compared to a range of popular alternatives.

The paper adds to the findings of previous studies, by considering recent developments in the related practice and the literature. It is shown that, for within-sample fitting, the realized measure is more informative than the implied volatility. In contrast, the implied volatility is more informative than the realized measure for out-of-sample forecasting, in particular for multi-step-ahead forecasting. Moreover, we show that it is helpful to use all the information provided by the realized measure and the implied volatility for the within-sample fitting.

Whilst there are a small number of studies which have estimated option and non-use values, they rest largely on contingent valuation methods which are subject to dangers of bias, and concentrate on commuter services into cities rather than truly rural services. This paper seeks to overcome these problems by conducting a Stated Preference (SP) experiment in rural communities, which values the provision of rail services and compares this against Post Office provision. We believe that using this approach, and allowing respondents to compare willingness to pay for rail services with that for another important rural service subject to threatened cuts, should produce more reliable results; moreover we achieve this using self completion questionnaires rather than much more expensive interviews. Our results show much lower values for rail than previous studies, though this is to be expected in truly rural areas where the likelihood of commuting by rail is much lower. Other non-use values are greater than option values in this context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

There have been suggestions that the conventional central place model can no longer adequately describe and explain the patterns in contemporary polycentric urban areas and regions, and that it should be replaced by a new 'network' model. Though the network model is still in need of elaboration, several of its key notions are recognisable in this case study on cinema-going in the city-region of Rotterdam. However, this study also makes clear that the current 'prototype' of the network model needs to be enhanced by attention to the broad issue why people choose to visit certain service venues, including considerations regarding spatial factors but non-spatial factors like qualities of service venues, before it can serve as a valid model for future study.","[Romein, Arie; Maat, Kees] Delft Univ Technol, OTB Res Inst Built Environm, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Romein, A (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, OTB Res Inst Built Environm, POB 5030, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",A.Romein@tudelft.nl; C.Maat@tudelft.nl,"Maat, Kees/AAB-7865-2019","Maat, Kees/0000-0002-7832-7017",,,,,44,1,1,1,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In particular, we evaluate the impact on refraining from bus usage and consequently on mode choice, and the extent of passengers' fear and risk perception of a terrorist attack. The paper is based on a survey carried out in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, and in Haifa, the third largest metropolitan area in Israel. Both cities, especially Jerusalem, experienced severe terror attacks in the post -9/11 era. The results indicate that the factors investigated, especially fear and risk perception, are central in understanding travel behavior in regard to public transportation in Israel. Women are more afraid of being involved in such a tragedy, perceive its risk to be higher than do men, and therefore the impact on women's travel behavior is more intensive; the level of fear of a terror attack in both cities is similar. The results also show that people are aware that the risk of road crashes is higher than the risk of terror attacks. Although this is in line with the reality, people's behavior may be strongly affected by the threat of terror attacks despite its low probability of occurrence. Consequently, an undesired shift from public transportation to private passenger car may occur. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Evans, AW",,,,"Evans, Andrew W.",,,The economics of railway safety,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Railways; Safety; Accidents; Cost benefit analysis; Train protection; Level crossings; Privatisation; Deregulation,,"This paper reviews the statistics and economics of railway safety in Great Britain, the European Union and the United States, together with some results for Finland and Japan. In these countries railway safety has improved over recent decades. That finding applies both to train accidents and to personal accidents such as persons struck by trains. Fatal train collisions and derailments command most attention even though they are infrequent and account for only a small minority of railway fatalities. Great Britain, the EU and the USA formally espouse conventional cost benefit analysis for the appraisal of railway safety measures, using the same valuations for the prevention of casualties as are used in road safety appraisal. However there are often strong institutional, legal and political pressures towards adopting railway safety measures with safety benefit: cost ratios well below 1. The best-documented examples of this are automatic train protection systems, which are discussed in the paper. Apart from trespassers, the largest group of railway fatalities occur at level crossings, which the paper also discusses. Level crossing safety measures would seem to be an appropriate subject for cost benefit analysis, but there are few case-studies in the literature. Over the last few decades, the railways in many countries have been privatised or deregulated with the aim of improving their economic performance. Such changes have the potential to affect safety. The paper reviews evidence of the effects on safety of railway restructuring in Great Britain, Japan and the United State, and finds no evidence that safety deteriorated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We present both descriptive statistics from an opting-out website and econometric evidence exploiting the panel structure of a large individual-level data set. Our descriptive analysis shows that opting out is concentrated towards the last days of the year, i.e., the last chance to avoid paying church tax for the entire coming year. Our econometric evidence suggests that the average effect of tax incentives for the whole population is both statistically and economically significant. A 1 standard deviation increase in church tax leads to between 0.5 and 1 percentage point decline in the likelihood of church membership. In addition, we find that church membership dropped substantially when a law change made opting out significantly easier.

While a handful of questions have become the standard measures of financial literacy in previous research, little work has been done examining whether responses to these questions accurately capture underlying financial capability, or whether they causally relate to subsequent financial well-being. Taking advantage of longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study we examine whether some of the questions previously used as measures of financial literacy are consistent measures of financial knowledge and effective predictors of future changes in wealth. We find that respondents frequently do not consistently answer questions across survey waves and that the context in which a question is asked affects the likelihood of correctly responding. Moreover, our regression analyses suggest that correctly answering these questions, consistently or not, has little significant relationship to changes in wealth over time, and is often related to a decrease in future wealth.

Mass production of biofuels will not be a practical solution because it requires strong competition for land that is used for growing food. Therefore, it will be necessary to revise the frame of transportation energy sources. The number of pure light- and heavy-duty electric vehicles could increase in urban areas. Instead, it will be hard to find a viable alternative to the internal combustion engine for extra-urban transport vehicles, therefore alternative synthetic fuels could be used to compensate for fossil fuel depletion. Aside from a small share obtainable from biomass, most synthetic fuels are expected to be obtained from coal. Among these, synthetic natural gas represents a very good solution. In fact, synthetic natural gas will be advantageous with respect to hydrogen, whose on-board storage will be an unsolved problem in the medium term, and with respect to synthetic liquid fuels, which require more energy in the production phase. Moreover, the carbon content of liquid fuels, which is higher than that of gaseous fuels, will be responsible for higher CO2 emissions from vehicles. Currently, natural gas has poor diffusion in the transport sector, and this paper highlights the motivations for favouring a policy aimed at increasing the share of gaseous fuel-powered vehicles. In addition to the low environmental impact, synthetic natural gas also offers the possibility of optimising the utilisation of future resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, 33 states have passed cell phone laws targeting only young and novice drivers, while 10 states have similar laws for all drivers regardless of age. This paper examines the efficacy of state cell phone laws in reducing non-alcohol related fatal crashes involving drivers under the age of 21. We found that handheld cell phone bans targeting all drivers reduced fatal crashes involving young drivers, but there was insufficient evidence that complete cell phone bans targeting only young drivers reduced fatal crashes. In addition, the effect of graduated licensing programs was insignificant for the period 2000-2010. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead, I contend that unfree labour needs to be understood in relational' terms as a particular form of adverse incorporation' in the global economy. This form of adverse incorporation is constituted through the circular interaction between, on the one hand, the functioning of the global productive economy and associated labour markets, and, on the other, the social relations of poverty which give rise to vulnerability and to unfree labour.

We employ a fixed effects regression model on company level data, covering the period from 2001 to 2008. Our results demonstrate that the impact of leverage on labour productivity is non-linear and it differs dramatically between local and multinational companies. In the case of local companies, at low levels of leverage, an increase in external financing tends to bring along an improvement in labour productivity, while at higher levels of leverage an increase in debt financing appears to result in a loss of labour productivity. For multinational companies, the impact of leverage on labour productivity tends to be more linear and leverage appears to have a negative impact on labour productivity. Although debt overhang is believed to be an issue in the Baltic countries in general, local companies with low leverage might be able to increase labour productivity by additional borrowing.","[Avarmaa, Mari; Hazak, Aaro; Maennasoo, Kadri] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn Sch Econ & Business Adm, Akad Tee 3, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Avarmaa, M (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn Sch Econ & Business Adm, Akad Tee 3, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",mari.avarmaa@nordea.com; aaro.hazak@tseba.ttu.ee; kadri.mannasoo@tseba.ttu.ee,"Hazak, Aaro/AAA-9502-2020; Avarmaa, Mari/J-1128-2018","Hazak, Aaro/0000-0003-2897-0554; Avarmaa, Mari/0000-0002-1846-1185; Mannasoo, Kadri/0000-0002-3011-168X",,,,,52,12,12,0,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Despite the growing interest in these networks, relatively little emphasis has been placed on two broad areas of investigation: on the one hand, the interplay of the growth mechanisms underpinning the evolution of collaborative arrangements; on the other, the implications that the structure and multiplexity of these arrangements have on knowledge creation and diffusion. The articles in this Special Issue aim to bridge these gaps in the literature and, by embracing a variety of perspectives, contribute towards a better understanding of how collaboration networks originate, function, and evolve. This Introduction offers a theoretical and methodological framework for the articles here included. It begins by discussing problems of measurement of scientific collaboration, and goes on to examine the role that growth mechanisms, structural variety and multiplexity play in shaping the genesis and functioning of collaboration networks. In reviewing current and emerging research themes, the discussion will also identify promising research directions that will stimulate future work on collaboration networks in science and technology.","[Maggioni, Mario A.] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, DISEIS, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Maggioni, Mario A.] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, CSCC, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Breschi, Stefano] Univ L Bocconi, Dept Management & Technol, Milan, Italy; [Breschi, Stefano] Univ L Bocconi, CRIOS, Milan, Italy; [Panzarasa, Pietro] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London, England",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Bocconi University; Bocconi University; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Maggioni, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, DISEIS, Lgo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",mario.maggioni@unicatt.it,"Maggioni, Mario A./AGL-3270-2022","MAGGIONI, Mario A./0000-0002-2449-8275",,,,,56,18,19,3,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

However, the 2007 credit crunch exposed the severe limitations of this approach. This article presents a methodological analysis of the New Neoclassical Synthesis and how the paradigmatic heuristic of the representative agent, namely, market clearing subject to sticky prices, excluded the Keynesian notion of involuntary unemployment arising from lack of effective demand. It shows these models may be modified to produce Keynesian results, but are ruled out of consideration by proponents of the New Neoclassical approach by weak incommensurability. It concludes that because of this the New Neoclassical Synthesis, in spite of its failure to explain the sub-prime crisis, is likely to resist successfully the resurgence in Keynesian economics.","[McCombie, John] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [McCombie, John] Univ Cambridge Downing Coll, Cambridge CB2 1DQ, England; [Pike, Maureen] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Oxford Brookes University,"McCombie, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",jslm2@cam.ac.uk; mpike@brookes.ac.uk,,,,,,,88,3,4,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The performance on ascending trends was found to be superior to that on descending trends, and the performance on intermediate trends was found to be superior to that on strong trends. Furthermore, the group whose attention was drawn to the direction and strength of each trend via the additional questions performed better on some aspects of the task than did their no-additional questions counterparts.

We analyze how the merger would have led to adverse unilateral, coordinated, and exclusionary effects. AT&T and T-Mobile contended that their proposed merger would not adversely affect competition in wireless services because T-Mobile USA was not an effective rival, because other wireless providers could easily replace any competition that was lost as a result of the merger, and because the efficiencies from the merger would be so substantial that they would outweigh any perceived anticompetitive effects.

The standard approach is the simultaneous ascending auction, in which many related lots are auctioned simultaneously in a sequence of rounds. I analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the approach with examples from US spectrum auctions. I then present a variation-the combinatorial clock auction-which has been adopted by the UK and many other countries, which addresses many of the problems of the simultaneous ascending auction while building on its strengths. The combinatorial clock auction is a simple dynamic auction in which bidders bid on packages of lots. Most importantly, the auction allows alternative technologies that require the spectrum to be organized in different ways to compete in a technology-neutral auction. In addition, the pricing rule and information policy are carefully tailored to mitigate gaming behavior. An activity rule based on revealed preference promotes price and assignment discovery throughout the clock stage of the auction. Truthful bidding is encouraged, which simplifies bidding and improves efficiency. Experimental tests and early auctions confirm the advantages of the approach.","Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Cramton, P (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",pcramton@gmail.com,"Cramton, Peter/ABG-7651-2021","Cramton, Peter/0000-0001-8621-1092",,,,,37,88,99,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Biased Trial Courts, Litigious Losers, or Low Trial Win Rates?",AMERICAN LAW AND ECONOMICS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PARTY CAPABILITY THEORY; MEDICAL MALPRACTICE; LITIGATION; PLAINTIPHOBIA; RESOLUTION; SELECTION,"Multiple studies find that plaintiffs who lose at trial and subsequently appeal are less successful on appeal than are losing defendants who appeal. The studies attribute this to a perception by appellate judges that trial courts are biased in favor of plaintiffs. However, at least two alternative explanations exist. First, losing plaintiffs may appeal at higher rates independent of the potential merits. Second, if plaintiffs tend to pursue to trial lawsuits where they should win on the merits less than half the time, then potentially reversible outcomes at trial will be more likely to be adverse to defendants. This study revisits the analysis of the appellate process with a statistical model that ties together win rates at trial, appeals rates, and success rates on appeal. The model can distinguish the competing explanations for differential appellate success rates, and we estimate this model using matched data on Federal District Court trials and appeals to the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal. We find consistent evidence that the lower plaintiff success rate on appeal is due to plaintiffs' pursuing lawsuits where they should win on the merits (which we define to be an outcome that would not be reversed or remanded on appeal) less than half the time. We find no evidence that asymmetric success on appeal is attributable either to trial courts favoring plaintiffs or to higher rates of appeal by losing plaintiffs.

Using data from a new Irish cohort study, I document the relationship between birth weight and socio-economic status. The association of maternal education with birth weight does not appear to be due to the timing of birth or complications during pregnancy, even controlling for a wide range of background characteristics. However, results do suggest intergenerational persistence in the transmission of poor early life conditions. Birth weight predicts a number of outcomes at age 9, including test scores, hospital stays and health. An advantage of the data is that I am able to control for a number of typically unmeasured variables. I determine whether parental investments (as measured by the quality of interaction with the child, parenting style, or school quality) mediate the association between birth weight and later indicators. For test scores, there is evidence of non-linearity, and boys are more adversely affected than girls. I also consider whether there are heterogeneous effects by ability using quantile regression. These results are consistent with a literature which finds that there is a causal relationship between early life conditions and later outcomes.","[McGovern, Mark E.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Harvard Ctr Populat & Dev Studies, Dublin, Ireland; [McGovern, Mark E.] Univ Coll Dublin, Geary Inst, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"McGovern, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Harvard Ctr Populat & Dev Studies, Dublin, Ireland.",mcgovern@hsph.harvard.edu,"McGovern, Mark/Q-4051-2018","McGovern, Mark/0000-0003-0131-3466",,,,,32,10,11,0,12,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

J,"Olsaretti, S",,,,"Olsaretti, Serena",,,RESCUING JUSTICE AND EQUALITY FROM LIBERTARIANISM,ECONOMICS AND PHILOSOPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"One of the central motifs of G. A. Cohen's work was his opposition to capitalism in the name of justice. This motif was fully in view in Cohen's work on Robert Nozick's libertarianism: Cohen carefully reconstructed and relentlessly criticized Nozick's apologetics of the free market, which, he thought, was internally coherent but unconvincing. This article suggests that Cohen's opposition to libertarianism did not, however, go far enough, and identifies two respects in which Cohen's position could and should have been more critical of that philosophy. The first concerns Cohen's negative agenda, that is, his critique of Nozick's libertarianism, the second Cohen's more positive agenda, the formulation of his egalitarian view. With regard to the first, this article argues that Cohen did not subject to full critical pressure the idea of self-ownership libertarians endorse, and consequently accorded it greater inequality-engendering power than libertarians may claim for it. With regard to the second point, this article suggests that Cohen implicitly assumed a market-friendly answer to the question of what consequences people who make choices should be held responsible for, which he could and should have questioned.","ICREA Univ Pompeu Fabra, *, *, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA,"Olsaretti, S (通讯作者)，ICREA Univ Pompeu Fabra, *, *, Spain.",serena.olsaretti@upf.edu,"Olsaretti, Serena/F-8638-2016","Olsaretti, Serena/0000-0001-6775-8551",ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,25,6,7,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

It started by defining high level outcome goals, as measures of ultimate public transport success, and then identified the major societal issues that public transport systems can help to resolve. These issues were separately defined for Southern African and western settings. The importance of taking an integrated approach to transport, particularly land use/transport integration, was seen as fundamental to goal achievement. Workshop papers provided many and varied examples of this importance, ranging from PPPs for major public transport projects to system design issues and contracting out of services. The Workshop included detailed discussion on paratransit development in Southern Africa, where relationship management is proving to be critical, in-line with much previous Thredbo discussion about the important role of trusting partnerships. Parallels and contrasts were drawn with paratransit in western settings. Competition in passenger rail was also a focus, with some questioning of the benefits of franchising. Discussion concluded by proposing recommendations for policy and research and suggesting agenda items for future Thredbo Conferences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The pattern of energy consumption and their causes for change are benchmarked against select countries. A mathematical model that decomposes changes in energy consumption to various factors has been used. The changes in the energy consumption are attributed to growth in transport volume, structural change or modal shift, and energy intensity. The analysis is conducted for passenger and freight transport separately. Results indicate that the growth in transport volume has been the main cause for increase in energy consumption for both passenger and freight transport in India despite the decline in energy intensity of various transport modes. Though not surprising for a growing economy like India, this poses a challenge for the future. Currently, India is a low carbon economy. However, the choices that the economy is making, as it is growing, are towards energy intensive options particularly in transportation and building sectors. There is a need for policy framework to steer the economy towards making appropriate choices that are environmentally sustainable and also do not jeopardize economic growth aspirations. In case of passenger transport, the trend is comparable with other countries studied in this paper (US, Canada, China, Japan, UK) except France. For freight transport, the contribution of the increase in transport volume to changes in energy consumption is far higher in India than that amongst the countries compared, though all countries except Japan have shown a positive contribution of increase in volume to the changes in energy consumption. The large contribution of the transport volume to the changes in passenger transport energy consumption is due to increasing shift towards personalized modes of transport (such as cars, two wheelers) in India and decrease in passenger occupancy per vehicle. The growth in freight transport energy consumption is a reflection of the high growth of the economy. The problem, however, is that a large part of freight is transported using road unlike that in some other benchmarked countries. Future policies aimed at containing energy consumption in the transport sector would need to focus on the modal structure which would require more use of rail for transportation of freight and public transportation systems for passenger transport. This would, however, require huge inefficiencies to be overcome before consumer choice shifts towards rail or public transportation system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Inspired by recent studies, we argue that regions diversify into industries that make use of capabilities in which regions are specialized. Since the spread of capabilities occurs through mechanisms that have a strong regional bias, we expect that capabilities that are available at the regional level play a larger role than do capabilities that are available at the country level for the development of new industries. To test this hypothesis, we analyze the emergence of new industries in 50 Spanish regions at the NUTS 3 level in the period 19882008. We calculate the capability-distance between new export products and existing export products in Spanish regions and provide econometric evidence that regions tend to diversify into new industries that use similar capabilities as existing industries in these regions. We show that proximity to the regional industrial structure plays a much larger role in the emergence of new industries in regions than does proximity to the national industrial structure. This finding suggests that capabilities at the regional level enable the development of new industries.","[Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Sect Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Minondo, Asier; Navarro, Mikel] Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, San Sebastian 20012, Spain; [Navarro, Mikel] Univ Deusto, Orkestra Basque Inst Competitiveness, San Sebastian 2012, Spain",Utrecht University; University of Deusto; University of Deusto,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Sect Econ Geog, POB 80 115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.boschma@geo.uu.nl; aminondo@deusto.es; mikel.navarro@deusto.es,"Minondo, Asier/G-1769-2015; Navarro, Mikel/P-2544-2014","Minondo, Asier/0000-0001-8566-1278; Navarro, Mikel/0000-0002-5984-2881",,,,,48,253,301,12,225,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Opponents claim that abolishing planting rights will have several negative effects, such as an increase in production and a decrease in the prices. On the other side the reform supporters, argue that it will benefit the sector and enhance its competitiveness. In times where the Common Agricultural Policy is being discussed, the liberalization of planting rights seems to be justifying more a political objective rather than a market objective. This paper simulates the effects of liberalization on wine prices, production and land values in the Chianti Classico wine denomination using the Nerlove's approach (1956-1958). The work also investigates the IGT quota production within the area that could become Chianti Classico wine after the liberalization. In conclusion, the magnitude of these effects is likely to differ strongly if the EU decides to leave the control to MS, Interbranch Organisation and Consortium board or not. In particular, the effects will depend on (1) how restrictive policy measure to control the production shall be taken by the Consortium; (2) how easy it will expand IGT vineyards in Chianti Classico with the protectionism policies; (3) how the wine producers could be control the bulk wine prices.","[Gaeta, Davide; Corsinovi, Paola] Univ Verona, Dipartimento DEA, I-37100 Verona, Italy",University of Verona,,davide.gaeta@univr.it,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,2,MEDIMOND S R L,40128 BOLOGNA,"VIA MASERATI 5, 40128 BOLOGNA, 00000, ITALY",,,978-88-7587-690-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,93,101,,,,,,9,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BA8IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338155900009,0

We use data from the French Organizational Changes and Computerization survey from 2006. We test a probit model to demonstrate the organizational structure and organizational changes underlying the firm's ETS adoption choice. Results show that ETS adoption is strongly favored by organizations with heavy hierarchical structures, standardized managerial practices and contractual mechanisms with external partners. This adoption process seems to coevolve with the organization: firms that implemented an ETS during the observed period (20032006) have experienced the most important organizational changes in terms of managerial practices, information systems and contractual relations, as well as the strengthening of the intermediate levels in the hierarchy.","[Galliano, Danielle] INRA, UMR AGIR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Orozco, Luis] Univ Toulouse, LEREPS, F-31042 Toulouse, France",INRAE; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Toulouse (SciencePo Toulouse); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Galliano, D (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, LEREPS, UT1,21 Allee Brienne, F-31042 Toulouse, France.",luis.orozco-noguera@ut-capitole.fr,"Orozco, Luis/JEZ-2676-2023","Orozco, Luis/0000-0002-0739-4511",,,,,59,3,3,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Inventions generated in the ICT sector are used in other economic sectors, as well as in the areas of social life. The phenomenon significantly hampers a thorough analysis of the importance of ICT sector in a multi-dimensional development of information society (IS). Therefore, capturing the category of information society is still a challenge to scientific cognizance. One of the characteristics of modern society is the ability to use the computer network systems, in particular the Internet, for the rapid exchange of information, or making purchases. Today is characterized by preparation, competence and ability to use information systems to purchase transmission services and remote processing of information. These new categories, forms and phenomena also allude to scientific cognizance. The answer to this is a constant search for ways to capture the categories of information society (IS). There is a consensus in the search of rational and yet in-depth analysis of the IS development process, in which the leading role in the IS development is granted to ICT industry. Thus, it is very often the basis for the analysis of the potential and the level of information society development. In studies concerning the ICT sector, not only the data on production are used, but also other characteristics describing the sector, including patent activity which indicates the direction of technological development today and in the future. This article raises the hypothesis that the convergence of the identified IPC classes, most strongly exploited by both, the European Union countries and one of the leading global companies of the ICT sector, suggests that the development of information society is not only highly correlated with the ICT sector, but also significantly depends on an identifiable, relatively small number of technological areas. As a result of the adopted research procedure, it was found that the leading technologies, which constitute the material basis of the IS development are digital computing, data processing equipment, arrangements for program control, processes or apparatus specially adapted for the manufacture or treatment of semiconductor.","[Okon-Horodynska, Ewa] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Econ & Management, PL-30374 Krakow, Poland; [Wisla, Rafal] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Econ & Management, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland; [Sierotowicz, Tomasz] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Management & Social Commun, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University; Jagiellonian University; Jagiellonian University,"Okon-Horodynska, E (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Ul Prof Stanislawa Lojasiewicza 4, PL-30374 Krakow, Poland.",ewa.okon-horodynska@uj.edu.pl; rafal.wisla@uj.edu.pl; tomasz.sierotowicz@uj.edu.pl,"Sierotowicz, Tomasz/Q-8272-2019","Sierotowicz, Tomasz/0000-0002-1462-8267",,,,,10,2,2,0,27,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Due to commercialization, privatization and liberalization, the traditional role of German airport organizations as merely providers of infrastructure gives way to a more market-oriented understanding. Airport service quality and the ability to constantly innovate are important variables that contribute to overall airport attractiveness. Despite that airports are becoming increasingly aware of the need for customer-orientation, the majority of airports still suffer from a lack of genuine customer (passenger) insights. This due to the fact that airlines and tour operators own the passenger relationship and data. The emergence of public social software platforms (SSP), such as the online social network Facebook, is now enabling airport organizations to enter into a dialogue with the passenger and gain a deeper understanding of passenger needs while leveraging social capital. The research paper examines, if airports are able to increase their operational efficiency when entering into a collaborative communication with their customers on SSP. Design/methodology/approach. Based on a social capital / network approach to organizational work, the paper discusses the convergence of social and technological networks and the underlying motives of customers and organizations for joining social software platforms. Findings. The paper proposes a theoretical model to describe how a mutually beneficial relationship between organizations and customers on Facebook can help airports to reach economic goals. As a next step, the theoretical model will be operationalized and empirically tested in 2012 using qualitative and quantitative research. Originality/value. Social capital research as well as the adoption of SSP by organizations is still mainly scoped within organizational boundaries. The paper broadens the research focus to the focal actors organization and customer. From a practitioners' point of view, airport managers might find it useful to learn what organizational challenges arise when engaging with customers on social software platforms.","[Tenge, Marion] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,marion.tenge@gmx.net,,,,,,,34,0,0,1,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,614,622,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100058,0

This article proposes an approach whereby financial and non-financial performance measures are combined to measure the contribution of marketing to sales. Secondary data from two retail brands within the same industry were analysed whereby actual accounting data were adjusted to examine the link between marketing expenditures, specifically with regard to the 4Ps (typical non-financial measures), and sales. The results of the time series regression showed that the nature of the relationship between marketing expenditures and sales is dependent largely on the product characteristics.

This belief stems from a long standing mathematical error in the original calculation of the expected value of the game. This article argues that, in addition to the mathematical error, there are also methodological considerations which gave rise to the paradox. This article explains these considerations and why because of the modern computer, the same considerations, when correctly applied, also demonstrate that no paradox exists. Because of the longstanding belief that a paradox exists it is unlikely the mere mathematical correction will end the myth.

Based on extensive research, this paper demonstrates that 1973 cannot be perceived as the unequivocal inception date of rational options trading, however. Furthermore, there is a good case to be made against indiscriminate use of equilibrium-based models. Arguably, various benchmarking and hedging approaches, used by numerous pre-Black-Scholes practitioners, may have had perfectly sound merit, while the formula's great popularity as a heuristic for rapidly expanding markets in the late 20th Century has turned it into a curse, altering traders' and investors' behaviour, as well as the nature of financial crises. Detailed coverage of the development of corresponding economic thought and research starts in Europe due to its leading and innovative role before World War II, and then passes on to the United States, in line with the redeployment of global economic power. Tight collaboration and swift transmission of ideas between various pre-war markets, as well as academia is shown to be in stark contrast with the subsequent economic and financial breakdown, corresponding to a breach in the continuity of finance research. Complementing the global view, similar points are being made using historical Czech resources. These show that Czechoslovakia used to be an integral part of the global financial environment before becoming part of the Soviet bloc. Two notable personalities of outstanding stature are also introduced, Gustav Flusser (1885-1940) and Oldrich Vasicek (*1942), whose biographies illustrate the development of financial economics, as well as corollaries of political and social forces.",,,,jan@vlachy.cz,,"Vlachy, Jan/0000-0002-2270-3247",,,,,104,3,3,0,15,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The CPPCC is the main form and the primary channel of Chinese consultative democracy. To recognize and grasp the relationship between consultative democracy and the CPPCC has important meanings for Chinese democratic construction. In February 2006, the Central Committee of the CPC promulgated the suggestions of the CPC Central Committee on strengthening the work of the CPPCC (hereinafter referred to as the suggestions), in which the main theses of two democratic forms was put forward. One is people exercise their rights through elections and votes, namely the electoral democracy, which reflects the people's congress system. The other is people fully consult before major decisions are made, namely the consultative democracy, which embodies the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC. This basic political system and the people's congress system supplement and complement each other. It makes all democratic parties and personages without party affiliation widely participate in the administration of state and social affairs, and the political demands of different classes and different social groups incorporated into the political system to be fully expressed, so as to maximize protection of the realization of the people's democracy. It was the first time that the CPC Central Committee had presented that there were two forms of democracy in the document. It shows that consultative democracy is an important part of the Chinese democracies. The CPPCC is a great creation because the CPC combined the united front theory of Marxism-Leninism, theories of political parties and democratic political theory with the concrete practice of the Chinese. As an organization with the most extensive patriotic united front as well as the mechanism of multi-party cooperation and political consultation, the CPPCC is an important part of the socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics. The 17th CPC National Congress explicitly proposed further development and improvement of the CPPCC system is an important aspect of the development of socialist democratic politics. The CPPCC proceeds in coordination with the consultative democracy. And it is an important form of consultative democracy. Therefore, it has an important significance for the democracy-building of China to correctly understand and grasp the relationship between the consultative democracy and the CPPCC.","[Wang, Changming] Shenyang Univ, Xinmin Normal Coll, Xinmin 110300, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Shenyang University,,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-07-5036-7,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2013,17.0,,,,,,239,245,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA4DW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335444300045,0

The first of these, the universal adoption of collective action clauses, was embraced by the market after some hesitation. Another proposal-the more widespread appointment of trustees to represent bondholders in times of crisis, to centralise enforcement action against the debtor and thus to facilitate debt relief-has so far failed to have the desired impact. Amongst other potential reasons for this failure, the argument has been made that to vest enforcement rights in the trustee, as opposed to individual bondholder rights, would be to reduce the deterrence against opportunistic defaults and thus to exacerbate moral hazard. Using a sample of secondary market bond spreads and information on default status, this paper assesses empirically whether sovereign bonds issued under a trust structure indeed carry a higher default risk. It finds no systematic evidence of either a spread premium or higher actual default rates for bonds with collective enforcement rights.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Häseler, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Rothenbaumchaussee 36, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",Soenke.Haeseler@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,8,8,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The ACCC encouraged ARTC and its users (principally coal producers) to discuss and negotiate the detail of the undertaking. At the final stage the parties were able to resolve their differences and put an agreed undertaking to the ACCC.

The developing world in particular has seen a veritable explosion of such arrangements. There can be, however, a significant difference between developing countries that are 'low-income' versus those that are middle-income. In some ways low-income countries can benefit more from the access to new capital and technical expertise that a PPP can bring. On the other hand there can be significant barriers to implementation of PPP's in low-income nations and equity issues can loom especially large there. This paper examines these differences by way of a case study of the country of Bangladesh.

In contrast, such a positive effect on the self-employment rate is observed only for prefectures with very high or very low density.

Despite this, contemporary narratives have principally focused on the global geography of the credit crunch, leading to a dearth of studies on other geographical scales, particularly regional spaces. This article seeks to address this gap by examining how regional spaces and financial institutions were reconfigured through the politics of financialization throughout the 1990s, which stimulated the adoption of inherently spatial strategies, connecting them to global markets, to increase shareholder value. It is argued in this article that these politics and strategies contributed to the vulnerability of these 'traditional' regional banks during the British financial crisis. Furthermore, it provides an insight into how financial elites generated trans-local networks that facilitated the financialization of regional housing markets in the UK.","Kingston Univ, Kingston Upon Thames KT2 7LB, Surrey, England",Kingston University,"Wainwright, T (通讯作者)，Kingston Univ, Kingston Hill, Kingston Upon Thames KT2 7LB, Surrey, England.",t.wainwright@kingston.ac.uk,,"Wainwright, Thomas/0009-0003-5415-4558",,,,,78,25,25,1,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The methodology applied is documentary analysis using official documents, statistics and research papers. Conclusions are that the social inclusion policy studied during that period, although partly motivated by political and electoral goals, remains disconnected. It has been more coherent with the normative precepts than with the social policy for the sub-period 1999-2002. Behavior of the social indicators would express certain global achievements in the management of inclusion. However, inclusion has not been accompanied by a protagonist popular empowerment; it is still too protected by the central government, necessitating a horizontal relationship between state institutions and communities, a process that requires qualitative cultural changes in the long term that can comply with constitutional precepts about participation and inclusion.","Univ Zulia, Inst Invest Econ & Sociales, Escuela Sociol, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Chacín, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Inst Invest Econ & Sociales, Escuela Sociol, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",neritzaalvarado@yahoo.es,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

The period including the recent credit crisis offers a unique laboratory for the analysis of the relative successes of different VaR methods when used in both emerging and developed markets. The proposed ranking model aims to form a unified framework which penalizes not only the magnitudes of errors between realized and predicted losses, but also the autocorrelation between the errors. The model also penalizes excessive capital allocations. In this respect, the ranking model seeks for VaR methods which can capture the delicate balance between the minimum governmental regulations for financial sustainability, and cost-efficient risk management for economic vitality. As a complimentary statistical tool for the ranking model, we introduce a predictive ability test which does not require the selection of a benchmark method. This statistic, which compares all methods simultaneously, is an alternative to existing predictive ability tests, which compare forecasting methods two at a time. We test and rank twelve different popular VaR methods on the equity indices of eleven emerging and seven developed markets. According to the ranking model and the predictive ability test, our empirical findings suggest that asymmetric methods, such as CAViaR Asymmetric and EGARCH, generate the best performing VaR forecasts. This indicates that the performance of VaR methods does not depend entirely on whether they are parametric, non-parametric, semi-parametric or hybrid; but rather on whether they can model the asymmetry of the underlying data effectively or not.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse congestion in the logistics channels for container imports into the United States. A spatial stochastic optimisation model was specified which optimises ocean shipping and inland transportation networks, and accounts for congestion and risk. The model allows for risks associated with container demands, ocean shipping costs, and some of the logistical constraints. The results quantify the probability distributions of container flows under conditions of congestion and stochastic variables. The results are used to analyse inter-route and inter-port competition.","[Wilson, William W.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Fan, Lei] N Dakota State Univ, Gavilon LLC, Transportat & Logist Program, Omaha, NE 68102 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; North Dakota State University Fargo,"Wilson, WW (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",fanlei_fl@hotmail.com; william.wilson@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,52,6,7,0,20,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

This increased attention has been due to the continuous insanitary and health threatening conditions, in spite of governments' huge budgetary interventions. Meanwhile, for most urban poor, waste collection and recycling is a common means for eking out a living, yet this potential for improving solid waste management appears untapped by the authorities. Using mainly qualitative research techniques, this study examines the role of the informal sector and promotes dialogue on the potential of this sector in solid waste management. The findings show that the practice has become a survival strategy for thousands among the urban poor and that, the proper integration of the sector into the existing solid waste management policies can lead to sustainable management practices and possibly help alleviate poverty.","Univ Ghana, Accra 00233, Greater Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Oteng-Ababio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, POB LG59, Accra 00233, Greater Accra, Ghana.",moababio@ug.edu.gh,,,,,,,52,25,29,2,51,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

J,"Aksoy, HC; Schäfer, HB",,,,"Aksoy, Huseyin Can; Schafer, Hans-Bernd",,,Economic impossibility in Turkish contract law from the perspective of law and economics,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Contract law; Impossibility; Excessive performance difficulty; Impracticability,BREACH; DOCTRINE,"We argue that the proposed introduction of the doctrine of economic impossibility in Article 137 of the reform draft of the Turkish Code of Obligations is in line with economic considerations and facilitates business transactions. This new rule gives courts the explicit power to terminate a contract and relieve the party, which owes specific performance of its obligation, without imposing any duty to pay expectation damages to the other party. We argue that a court's decision to terminate a contract under economic impossibility should be based on three tests. First, a low-probability-event occurs between contract formation and performance. Second, this event causes an excessive increase in the costs of specific performance. Third, the concept of an excessive increase should take into due consideration the other party's interest in specific performance. The reform draft includes explicitly the first two tests, but not the third test. We also show under which conditions an excessive performance difficulty should not lead to termination of the contract but rather to an adjustment of the agreed price. We argue that the rule of economic impossibility, if diligently adjudicated, saves the parties transactions costs in comparison to a rule under which the law insists on specific performance or damage payments. We also argue that a specific rule of economic impossibility leads to better and more business-oriented solutions to the underlying problems than the alternative, which is to solve such problems under the broad and unspecific cover of the good faith or the Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus doctrine.","[Schafer, Hans-Bernd] Bucerius Law Sch, Hamburg, Germany; [Aksoy, Huseyin Can] Cakmak Law Off, Ankara, Turkey; [Aksoy, Huseyin Can] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Germany; [Schafer, Hans-Bernd] Bilkent Univ, Fac Law, Ankara, Turkey",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Schäfer, HB (通讯作者)，Bucerius Law Sch, Hamburg, Germany.",hcanaksoy@gmail.com; hans-bernd.schaefer@law-school.de,"Aksoy, Hüseyin Can/V-7785-2019","Aksoy, Hüseyin Can/0000-0002-9243-189X",,,,,32,1,1,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Niklas Luhmann's theoretical and methodological proposal for modern social systems is used; the analysis is illustrated with Latin America examples. The conclusions remit us to the limitations with which democracy is confronted and its requirements of quality in Latin America, whose deficits can be explained by a social operation that tends toward high degrees of informality, exclusion, stabilization of client networks, corruption; all attributes with which normative orientation of a modern social order must confront and the actions belonging to a part of the world that tends toward stratified and hierarchical dynamics.","[Vallejos-Romero, Arturo] Univ Los Lagos, Ctr Estudios Desarrollo Local & Reg CEDER, Santiago, Chile; [Torres Nafarrate, Javier] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Torres Nafarrate, Javier] Univ Iberoamer, Dept Ciencias Sociales & Polit, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad de Los Lagos; Goethe University Frankfurt; Universidad Iberoamericana Ciudad de Mexico,"Vallejos-Romero, A (通讯作者)，Univ Los Lagos, Ctr Estudios Desarrollo Local & Reg CEDER, Santiago, Chile.",avallejos@ulagos.cl; javier.torres@uia.mx,,"Vallejos-Romero, Arturo/0000-0002-0393-7275",,,,,26,0,3,0,10,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

This is perhaps because apologies are regarded as 'cheap talk' and are deemed to be non-informative of an individual's conscious state. In this paper, I develop a formal framework in which one can analyze remorse and apologies. I argue that legal procedures can be designed to price apologies, such that only truly remorseful individuals apologize. Hence, apologies would not be mere 'cheap talk' and could send correct signals regarding an offender's true conscious state, making them credible. This will lead victims, upon receiving apologies, to forgive offenders more frequently. Moreover, pricing apologies does not negatively impact the possibility of achieving optimal deterrence. An (arguably negative) effect of pricing apologies is its elimination of insincere apologies. If it is assumed that apologies, even if insincere, carry rehabilitative and/or palliative benefits, then the optimality of pricing apologies depends on a trade-off between achieving credibility and increasing such rehabilitative and palliative benefits.

The research presented here systematically examines neighborhoods in the three New York City boroughs for which residential, off-street parking is possible but potentially scarce. The research is conducted in two stages. Stage one is based on a Google Earth(C)survey of over 2000 properties paired with the City's tax lot database. The survey and tax lot information serve as the basis to estimate on-site parking for New York City neighborhoods. With parking availability estimated, a generalized linear model using census tracts as the unit of analysis, is used to estimate the maximum likelihood parameters that predict the proportion of residents who drive to work in the Manhattan Core. The research shows a clear relationship between guaranteed parking at home and a greater propensity to use the automobile for journey to work trips even between origin and destinations pairs that are reasonably well and very well served by transit. Because journey to work trips to the downtown are typically well served by transit, we infer from this finding that non-journey to work trips are also made disproportionately by car from these areas of high on-site parking.

Using a two-period mean-variance setting, the harvesting decisions of NIPF owners are examined with the aim of measuring their willingness to take risks. Since willingness to pay for reduction of risk is empirically unobservable, I rely on an index of NIPF owners' attitudes to risk from a hypothetical survey question involving financial risk. According to the index, respondents (owners) are categorized as risk-averse, risk-neutral or risk-seeking. I apply a probit analysis to test how owner and property characteristics influence the NIPF owners' attitudes to risk. The results show that characteristics influence the formation of risk attitudes. More explicitly, a longer period of ownership increases the probability that the owner is risk-averse, while increased time in the forest conducting silvicultural work increases the likelihood that an owner is risk-seeking. The results also show that female NIPF owners are more risk-seeking than male owners. The study fills a knowledge gap in the literature, relating owner and property characteristics to management decisions. Inclusion of risk attitudes and the judgement of risks into studies of NIPF owners' management can help to understand why NIPF owners' harvesting may deviate from net present value maximisation.

As a result, this research provides three competitiveness indices and discusses on how the competitiveness of three Lithuanian sectors is or is not affected by a purposive EU funding for each sector. The empirical research is constructed in two steps: (i) creating a composite index of each of three economic sectors and (ii) testing the causality between EU funding and sector's competitiveness index. Findings of empirical research support the EU funding policy objective oriented towards raising competitiveness. The change in EU funding vas found to have statistically significant explanatory power over change of competitiveness level of tourism and agriculture, forestry & fisheries sectors. The article contributes to the research field by providing competitiveness index structure for agriculture, forestry & fisheries sector which might suggest ideas or contribute as a starting point for further professional empirical studies. It also contributes to the field by applying methodology of building competitiveness index for primary, tertiary and quaternary sectors of economy. General methodological approach used in this article could be also applied in other studies that evaluate an impact of one or few economic variables (or policy measures) on the competitiveness of economic sector.","[Balzaraviciene, Sigita] UAB Ernst & Young Baltic, LT-01302 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Pilinkiene, Vaida] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Balzaraviciene, S (通讯作者)，UAB Ernst & Young Baltic, Subaciaus St 7, LT-01302 Vilnius, Lithuania.",sigita.balzaraviciene@lt.ey.com; vaida.pilinkiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,21,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

However genealogic bases of the modern concept of local self-government which has been valid in Europe and Poland can be found under the banners of the French Revolution. Making an analysis of the use of resources of natural environment it should be noted that the volume of waste and pollutions resulting from human's activities is so large that the environment is often not capable of their absorption. In the case, where the long term goal of environmental policy is evolution of inter-regional development of diversification, the diversification of pollution of the environment and its natural assimilation capacity is the basis conclusion on the necessity of regional (communal) diversification of protective policy instruments (Fiedor, 1992, p.29).","Poznan Univ Econ, Fac Management, Dept Org & Management Theory, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Bartkowiak, P (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Fac Management, Dept Org & Management Theory, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",p.bartkowiak@ue.poznan.pl,"Bartkowiak, Piotr/AAE-6046-2020","Bartkowiak, Piotr/0000-0001-9678-3465",,,,,22,0,0,0,11,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The dynamic models of capital structure have been utilised to document several findings of empirical significance. First, transaction costs reduce dramatically in the post liberalisation regime, and the associated speed of adjustment is more pronounced, and statistically significant for the post liberalisation epoch. Second, financial liberalisation has a significant impact on the capital structure speed of adjustment. Third, the results confirm most of the theoretical predictions of capital structure theories; however, the relationship is more significant in the post liberalised regime. Finally, new evidence has been revealed on what determines the debt maturity structure of firms in a transitional economy.","[Chipeta, Chimwemwe] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Wolmarans, Hendrik P.; Vermaak, Frans N.

In the wake of the crisis, there have been demands that rational economic knowledge be extended further and more vigorously, to prevent such ignorance being possible in future. At the same time, there have been demands for a new, softer rationalism, which factors in the possibility of errors and systemic complexities. What neither approach recognizes is that ignorance is not simply the absence of rational economic knowledge, but is a productive force in itself, something that is actively nurtured and exploited, both by neo-liberal theorists such as Hayek and by expert actors who have been implicated in the financial crisis. We explore how ignorance has been alternately an albatross, a commodity and an institutional alibi to financial actors and the scholars who study them.","[Davies, William] Univ Oxford, Kellogg Coll, Ctr Mutual & Employee Owned Business, Oxford OX2 6PN, England; [McGoey, Linsey] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Oxford; University of Essex,"Davies, W (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Kellogg Coll, Ctr Mutual & Employee Owned Business, Oxford OX2 6PN, England.",williamdavies10@gmail.com,,"McGoey, Linsey/0000-0002-4404-2574",,,,,57,102,114,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Few papers have considered the relationship between innovation and the wider spatial structure within which firms operate. This article has three objectives. First, we investigate whether innovation varies in a continuous manner across space. Second, we explore whether these spatial variations can be explained by variations in information gathering and collaborative behavior. Finally, we seek to verify whether these conclusions are robust to the inclusion of local fixed effects. We find that innovation varies both across continuous space and across discrete territories. However, this geography is not affected by firms' information gathering and collaborative behaviors. Since these factors, usually considered as explanations of geographic variation in firm level innovation, have no effect, this reveals limits to our understanding of the geography of innovation which call for further exploration.","[Doloreux, David] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Shearmur, Richard] Univ Quebec, INRS Urbanizat Culture Soc, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Doloreux, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",doloreux@telfer.uottawa.ca; richard.shearmur@ucs.inrs.ca,"Doloreux, David/Y-7368-2019","Doloreux, David/0000-0001-7101-2170",,,,,60,100,107,2,115,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The intensity of the absorption of the entrepreneurial support is analysed according to the criteria set by the government and according to the troubled areas given by the individual regions of the Czech Republic. Whereas the regions supported by the government are given centrally within the Strategy of the regional development of the Czech Republic. The regional level of the troubled areas is set ad hoc. Thus one of the crucial issues of this paper is to find potential preferences of the local authorities when deciding about the applications for the entrepreneur subsidies, loans and guaranties. The detailed analysis focuses on subsidies as the only non-profit form of the support. Further question is whether the regions with the intense government support get enough subsidies from entrepreneurial bodies in comparison with other (non-troubled) areas in the Czech Republic. The key documents for the research were the lists of recipients of subsidies in the first half of programme term 2007-2013 published by the CzechInvest agency. In total there are more than three thousand approved projects. The analysis covered only those businesses which received the subsidies. This research sample comprised of almost fifteen hundred subjects. Given the fact that the Czech Ministry of Trade and Industry publishes the location exclusively on the regional level it was necessary to add the information about the municipality or the place of the business which received the subsidy, to the list of recipients of the subsidies. It was necessary to define the concerned areas on the district level or territorial areas of municipalities with extended competencies or territorial units of municipalities chartered by town halls. The data about municipalities was found in the trade register for each subsidised project separately The relevant data concerning the research were found in the researcher's database.","Univ Jana Evangelisty Purkyne, Fak Socialne Ekon, Katedra Financi & Ucetnictvi, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Felixová, K (通讯作者)，Univ Jana Evangelisty Purkyne, Fak Socialne Ekon, Katedra Financi & Ucetnictvi, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",katerina.felixova@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,12,12,0,19,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Empirical evidence is presented from recent fieldwork with rice and fish wholesalers that suggests that informality, in the form of trustworthy relations and social capital, has the potential to foster the traders' adaptive capacities and thus not only their individual business performance, but also the overall robustness of the urban food system.","[Keck, Markus; Bohle, Hans-Georg] Univ Bonn, Inst Geog, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Zingel, Wolfgang-Peter] Heidelberg Univ, Sudasien Inst, Abt Int Wirtschaft, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",University of Bonn; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Keck, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Geog, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",markus.keck@geographie.uni-bonn.de; bohle@geographie.uni-bonn.de; h93@ix.urz.uni-heidelberg.de,,"Keck, Markus/0000-0002-6152-097X",,,,,48,11,11,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

In developed countries creativity and knowledge have become one of the main prerequisites for economic growth and maintaining of competitiveness. This paper responds to these changes and together with use of New creative index analyses creative potential in selected countries of the European Union (Germany, Spain, the Netherland, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Luxembourg) and their regional locations (89 cities). As a result the basic premise is confirmed, the creative ratio responds to economical performance of the region. In the paper the structure of New creative index is shown (32 indicators), the results of the index are illustrated by transparent graphical demonstrations. The construction of New Creative Index itself looks to be based on Florida 3T model for the first sight, but the content of 3T is composed from different indexes. The use of new indexes in wider representation eliminates some shortcomings which unable to apply the Florida creative index to countries in EU or the smaller territorial units. The regions with high creative potential are found in Germany and big cities of Sweden and Finland. On the other hand the regions with low creative potential are found predominantly in Spain, which is followed by the Netherland. Closer view on Spanish regions verified that touristic location is not sufficient for formation of creative centers.","[Kloudova, Jitka; Chwaszcz, Ondrej] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Dept Econ, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Kloudová, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Dept Econ, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic.",kloudova@farne.utb.cz; chwaszcz@seznam.cz,"Kloudova, Jitka/C-7634-2009",,,,,,33,3,3,0,23,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This paper contends that firms competing in markets subject to high rates of technological change and market uncertainty must incorporate external resources into their business models in order to enact dynamic capabilities. An empirical study focusing in the mobile industry confirms that external developers are paramount to absorb external knowledge and transform it into knowledge of explicit nature and, therefore, of high value for other participants in the network. In this sense this paper finds evidence on the influence that external developers, conceptualized as Lead Users (VonHippel 1986), exert on firms' ability to compete in two-sided markets exhibiting strong network effects. This paper finds that there exist a strong relationship between the ability of the sponsoring firms to extract profits and the level of participation of external developers into their networks.","[Lopez Berzosa, David; Miguel Davila, Jose-Angel] Univ Leon, Fac CC EE & Empresariales, E-24071 Leon, Spain; [de Pablos Heredero, Carmen] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Fac CC JJ & Sociales, Madrid 28032, Spain",Universidad de Leon; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Berzosa, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Leon, Fac CC EE & Empresariales, Campus Vegazana S-N, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",david.lopez@unileon.es; jam.davila@unileon.es; carmen.depablos@urjc.es,"De-Pablos-Heredero, Carmen/A-3519-2014; Miguel-Davila, Jose Angel/G-9738-2015","De-Pablos-Heredero, Carmen/0000-0003-0457-3730; Miguel-Davila, Jose Angel/0000-0002-5191-0528",,,,,39,8,9,1,53,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

We identify three key, cross-unit bank processes: governance (bank headquarters), sales (branch processes) and operations (ICT and facilities to support local (branch) and inter-unit (headquarters-to-branch) tasks). We suggest a framework that incorporates three main reference models, from an organizational design perspective. Model 1 (exploitative model) applies when the bank's headquarters work to formalize branch sales processes supported by operations processes. Model 2 (exploratory model) applies when the bank's headquarters allows flexibility in branch sales processes and uses operations processes to decentralize tasks. Model 3 (ambidextrous model) applies when a branch incorporates the characteristics of Models 1 and 2 simultaneously. We ground our claims using fieldwork conducted in 2004-2005 that involved a number of major Italian banks. We show that while large organizations, such as banks, base their ambidextrous innovation on organizational design, contextual elements such as trust and commitment, and management styles and leadership play a role in dealing with efficiency-oriented vs. flexibility-oriented tasks within the same bank branch.","[Marabelli, Marco] Bentley Univ, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Frigerio, Chiara; Rajola, Federico] Cattolica Univ, Milan, Italy",Bentley University,"Marabelli, M (通讯作者)，Bentley Univ, 175 Forest St, Waltham, MA 02452 USA.",mmarabelli@bentley.edu,,,,,,,76,7,8,2,83,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The generation replacement of practitioners should be resolve with sales of established medical practice to young attested physician. However, it is questionable, whether the valuation methods traditionally used for market profitable entities can be applied to value of the specific economic subjects, such as medical practice. Nowadays, a number of valuation methods is elaborated theoretically and used in practice. According to the fundamentals of valuation, four basic approaches are distinguished: property, yield, market (comparative) and combined. Verifying applicability of these methods on the valuation of private medical practice for children and adolescents, 6 basic techniques with some modifications were selected. Moreover, to apply the valuation methods in the Czech Republic, it is necessary to consider the possible constraints arising from the Czech legislation. Besides defining the purpose of the valuation, which determines the choice of valuation methods mainly, it was necessary for their adequate application: to describe the relevant features of the valued private medical practice; to analyze the environment, in which the medical practice operates; to carry out the financial analysis of valued entity. Three scenarios were elaborated: pessimistic, neutral (expected), and optimistic. It turned out that the most appropriate method for the valuation of the private medical practice is biphasic method of predicted discounted net income. In connection with evaluation of the ??result, the attention was paid to the sensitivity values to change of the discount rate, and to the cash flow discounting method. The result of valuation confirmed the hypothesis: respecting identified specificities and constraints, private medical practice can be valued with known valuation methods.","[Minarik, Jakub; Kraftova, Ivana] Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Ekonomiky & Managementu, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Minarík, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Ekonomiky & Managementu, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",Jakub.Minarik@centrum.cz; Ivana.Kraftova@upce.cz,"Kraftova, Ivana/G-8935-2017","Kraftova, Ivana/0000-0003-0740-2670",,,,,22,3,3,0,6,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Current research highlights the need for better data collection and analysis of these impacts. Using unique primary data, this paper quantifies the economic cost of health effects from the largest wildfire in Los Angeles County's modern history. A cost of illness estimate is $9.50 per exposed person per day. However, theory and empirical research consistently find that this measure largely underestimates the true economic cost of health effects from exposure to a pollutant in that it ignores the cost of defensive actions taken as well as disutility. For the first time, the defensive behavior method is applied to calculate the willingness to pay for a reduction in one wildfire smoke induced symptom day. which is estimated to be $84.42 per exposed person per day.

There is a revaluation of the present principles of business based on achieving profit. Corporate social responsibility is a long-term sustainable solution in the form of engagement of the business sector in solving the problems of society. Responsible businesses make an economic profit and social benefit by their commitment to ethical conduct and social responsibility, whereas irresponsible businesses steal the resources of the state and society. This means that tax evasion can also be considered a manifestation of unethical conduct. In the long term income tax is a significant source of finance for public budgets of the Slovak Republic used for financing the needs of the state and society. This paper presents the results of primary research focused on analysis of tax evasion on income tax in the context of corporate social responsibility in the Slovak Republic. The realistically calculated (i.e. detected) consequences of socially irresponsible behaviour of businesses are analyzed on the basis of data obtained from secondary research in the area of criminal liability for evasion, incorrectly calculated or concealed tax obligations of businesses.

The paper fills the gap in literature as the most recent period and the countries covered by the present paper have not been studied yet. The entire period of estimation is divided to six sub-periods capturing individual phases of the financial and economic crisis. We separately estimate a modified GARCH-M (1,1) model for each country and each sub-period using daily returns of the major national stock market indices. Although the markets share the main development trends the reactions of markets to domestic and international shocks differ remarkably. The day of the week effect is measured for both daily returns and conditional variance (volatility) of the returns. The results clearly indicate that there is a little evidence of day of the week effect. Daily calendar anomalies are rather sporadic, isolated, unstable over time and often opposite to theoretical assumptions. While some occurrences of the day of the week effect were revealed in the Czech Republic and Poland, Hungary is almost completely free of anomalies. There is no phase of financial crisis characteristic of significantly increased incidence of day of the week effects. However, only stage with no day effect in returns was the pre-crisis period. We conclude that the day of the week effect is not typical for the Central European stock markets and the recent financial crisis seems to have no impact on existence of this phenomenon in the markets.","[Stavarek, Daniel; Heryan, Tomas] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Stavárek, D (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance, Opava, Czech Republic.",stavarek@opf.slu.cz; heryan@opf.slu.cz,"Heryan, Tomas/J-6424-2015; Stavárek, Daniel/A-7134-2010","Heryan, Tomas/0000-0003-2027-7149; Stavárek, Daniel/0000-0001-5061-1721",,,,,21,16,16,1,20,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We investigate, therefore, to what extent firms are using particular knowledge sources from regional, national or international spatial levels, and to what extent their innovativeness can be explained by the knowledge sourcing pattern and their location. The paper draws on data from 110 ICT companies in three Austrian regions and uses both descriptive tools and multivariate models. The variety of knowledge sources used on regional as well as international levels and the engagement in R&D cooperations are identified as key factors for innovation in the ICT-sector, whereas company location had less direct effect.","[Toedtling, Franz; Grillitsch, Markus; Hoeglinger, Christoph] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Reg Dev & Environm, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Tödtling, F (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Reg Dev & Environm, Nordbergstr 15, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",Franz.Toedtling@wu.ac.at,"Grillitsch, Markus/AAS-9067-2021; Tödtling, Franz/X-3776-2019","Grillitsch, Markus/0000-0002-8406-4727; Todtling, Franz/0000-0003-1105-5149",,,,,53,38,40,5,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Or does Hollywood supply the films that world audiences demand and, because of the logistics of distribution, screen these films first in the domestic market prior to exhibition in foreign markets? In this article, the authors empirically analyzed the global market for motion pictures to provide statistical evidence that can speak to these questions. They examined data on nearly 2,000 films exhibited from 19972007, inclusive, in the United States and Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdommarkets that today collectively account for over 75% of worldwide cinema box-office revenue. The empirical evidence provides support for the hypothesis that the supply of Hollywood films has accommodated global demand as the relative size of the U.S. domestic market has decreased. There is no evidence that box-office success in the United States creates a contagion that spreads to other film exhibition markets; however, box-office success in international markets appears to be less uncertain for films that have been successful in their U.S. releases.","[Walls, W.

In the second stage, we used a semi-parametric technique (Simar and Wilson in J Econom 136(1): 31-64, 2007) that produces a robust inference for an unknown serial correlation between efficiency scores.

At the heart of this proposition is the idea of consumer sovereignty, where producers that best meet the material wants of consumers will be the most successful. With some notable exceptions however, few transport markets work along free market principles, and hence by implication with little consumer sovereignty. Deregulated bus markets however, 'should' show evidence of the theorem. This paper therefore examines the English deregulated market to examine if this is indeed the case. An overall assessment of performance in terms of fare levels, technical efficiencies, profitability and user satisfaction is undertaken, and a correlation matrix estimated from which some overall patterns become clear. This is further developed through a more formal cluster analysis, out of which emerges a clear five cluster model. Clusters identify operators as classic oligopolists, efficient profiteers, mature market operators, the consumers' choice and the low fare operator. The overriding conclusion is that whilst there is some evidence of consumer sovereignty, the vast majority of local English bus markets contain producer centric operators that remain protected by significant barriers to entry. As a consequence, the market cannot regulate its own behaviour to produce economically efficient bus services. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper addresses three research questions: Can the factors found in stochastic mortality-forecasting models be associated with real-world trends in health-related variables? Does inclusion of health-related factors in models improve forecasts? Do resulting models give better forecasts than existing stochastic mortality models? We consider whether the space spanned by the latent factor structure in mortality data can be adequately described by developments in gross domestic product, health expenditure and lifestyle-related risk factors using statistical techniques developed in macroeconomics and finance.

This study used both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the impact on costs of vertical separation. We find the impact to vary with circumstances, but for more densely used railways and those with a higher proportion of freight traffic, vertical separation raises costs. It appears that the main reason for this is the misalignment of incentives, leading each player to seek to optimise their own costs rather than those of the system as a whole. Various approaches are used to try to overcome this misalignment, through track access charges, performance regimes and various forms of partnership, but none is fully successful. We also find no evidence that complete vertical separation leads to more competition, or indeed that such an increase in competition reduces costs, though we consider that further work is needed to better measure the extent of competition in different markets. From a policy perspective our findings suggest that alternative railway structures will suit different railways with different patterns of usage and therefore a policy that seeks to impose complete vertical separation on all EU members would increase costs.

Yet the central policy used to regulate immigration-detention and deportation-has received little empirical evaluation. This article studies a recent policy innovation called Secure Communities. This program permits the federal government to check the immigration status of every person arrested by local police and to take the arrestee into federal custody promptly for deportation proceedings. Since its launch, the program has led to a quarter of a million detentions. We utilize the staggered rollout of the program across the country to obtain differences-in-differences estimates of its impact on crime rates. We also use unique counts of the detainees from each county and month to estimate the elasticity of crime with respect to confined immigrants.

The model assesses an attraction-accessibility measure derived from a gravity framework. The measure is estimated on a regional basis and can be interpreted as the market potential of a region. We introduce three versions of the model: the first measures the potential restricted to the domestic market, the second considers the external sector, and the third is essentially a regional accessibility index, which captures the domestic market potential at regional level.

It is argued that commodity traders provide an empirical site for uncovering the missing links between research on world cities on the one hand, and global commodity chains on the other. Commodity trading is compelling as it is linked both with the financial sector (financing and paper trade) and with the production and distribution of commodities (storage and transportation). However, these two activities do not necessarily need to be in geographical proximity. Rotterdam and Amsterdam handle large volumes of commodities flowing through their ports, but the trading desks of the large commodity houses handle the trade transactions. There is a strong presence of the world's largest commodity traders in the Netherlands, which include not only the port-based physical-operational functions but also the trading desks, treasuries and holding companies. The paper concludes with an overview of avenues for further research.","[Jacobs, Wouter] Univ Antwerp, ITMMA, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Jacobs, Wouter] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",University of Antwerp; Ghent University,"Jacobs, W (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, ITMMA, Kipdorp 59, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",wouter.jacobs@uantwerpen.be,,,,,,,25,13,13,2,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Needs and priorities concern both the data to be collected or made available and the tools to be developed or made available to support science-based policy-making. An on-line survey was addressed to more than 3000 stakeholders, mostly from European countries, in which participants were asked to assess the importance (high, medium or low priority) of more than 50 items reflecting data and resources for all stages of road safety policy making from fact-finding and diagnosis, to programme development, to implementation and monitoring/evaluation. A principal component analysis technique was applied, and 6 components of data and tools were identified, concerning implementation of measures, statistical models, costs and safety impacts of measures, road infrastructure and accident analysis, common definitions and under-reporting, and crash causation. Then, cluster analysis was carried out for profiling the stakeholders, revealing 4 groups of stakeholders with similar needs and priorities in road safety data and tools: a low priorities group, a need data and models group, a group mainly interested on implementation and an in-depth analysis group. Further analysis of the cluster characteristics suggested that the 4 clusters are adequately - and often similarly - represented in all groups of countries, and in all types of organization (e.g. national administrations, universities, interest groups, road safety organizations etc.). It is also found that national/regional administrations and research institutes/universities reported practically the same needs in data and tools, not confirming the common belief that these two types of stakeholders have different needs. Finally, the policy-makers group within the stakeholders was found to put particular emphasis on implementation issues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Intra-day power prices have a fine structure and are driven by an interaction of fundamental, behavioural and stochastic factors. Furthermore, there are reasons to expect the functional forms of price formation to be nonlinear in these factors and therefore specifying forecasting models that perform well out-of-sample is methodologically challenging. Markov regime switching has been widely advocated to capture some aspects of the nonlinearity, but it may suffer from overfitting and unobservability in the underlying states. In this paper we compare several extensions and alternative regime-switching formulations, including logistic specifications of the underlying states, logistic smooth transition and finite mixture regression. The finite mixture approach to regime switching performs well in an extensive, out-of-sample forecasting comparison.

The contention is that while much has been written about economic integration, institutions and security communities in regionalism, a discussion of the significance of other regional projects has lagged behind. Social policy, particularly in the Americas, has been neglected as a policy domain in the account of regionalism. Changes in the political economy of Latin America in the last decade suggest that we need to engage afresh with regional governance and social policy formation in the Americas. By looking at the institutions, resources and policy action in the area of health within the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) this paper reconnects regionalism and social policy and explores two interrelated, yet largely unexplored, issues: the linkages between regional integration and social development beyond the historical hub of trade and finance; and the capacity of UNASUR to enable new policies for collective action in support of social development goals in the region, and to act as a broker of rights-based demands in global health governance. In so doing, the paper contributes towards a more nuanced understanding of regionalism and regionalization as alternative forms of regional governance.","Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Riggirozzi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",P.Riggirozzi@Soton.ac.uk,,"Riggirozzi, Pia/0000-0001-5809-890X",,,,,57,37,42,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

However, this approach requires detailed knowledge of local housing markets, which is not readily available at a fine resolution for most airport regions around the world. This paper proposes a new noise monetization method based on city-level personal income, which is often more widely available. Underlying the approach is a meta-analysis of 63 hedonic pricing studies from eight countries, conducted between 1970 and 2010, which is used to derive a general relationship between average city-level personal income and the Willingness to Pay for noise abatement. Applying the new model to income, noise, and population data for 181 airports worldwide, the global capitalized monetary impacts of commercial aviation noise in 2005 are estimated to be $23.8 billion, with a Net Present Value of $36.5 billion between 2005 and 2035 when a 3.5% discount rate is applied. Comparison with previous results based on real estate data yields a difference of -34.2% worldwide and -9.8% for the 95 US airports in the analysis. The main advantages of the income-based model are fewer data limitations and the relative ease of implementation compared to the hedonic pricing methods, making it suitable for assessing the monetary impacts of aviation noise reduction policies on a global scale.

This is done by building explanatory models using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In effect, the model tries to forecast the Baltic Exchange Dry Index (BDI) using real data for a twenty-year period for a wide range of macroeconomic factors (nineteen) and maritime indexes (four), for which data are available on a daily, weekly, monthly or 3-monthly basis. This depends mainly on the agency or bureau that is responsible for the compilation of every distinct macroeconomic figure. However, in case the figure under examination is tradable in a specific market, the data resolution may also depend on the characteristics of this market. The effectiveness of the model depends also very much on whether or not neural networks are able to predict accurately the evolution of BDI. For this reason, a period around and after the financial crisis of 2008 was selected. However, the data series spans 20 years from 1991 to 2011 and in this way captures market movements in the more extreme up and downturns. During this period the BDI presented a steep decline of more than 90% and dropped from the level of 9,912 units (May 2008) to 558 units (Dec 2008). Therefore, this paper investigates whether it was possible to predict in June 2008, what would have happened 2,4,6, 8 and 10 months forward. The results reached, after the implementation of the specific methodology described in this paper are satisfactory: models built using ANNs and taking into account macroeconomic factors in addition to other parameters (shipping and microeconomic) are able to predict the evolution of the Baltic Dry Index much more accurately than existing methods. The performance of the model is very satisfactory for the prediction period, although there are really no robust models for accurate predictions for longer periods.","[Lyridis, Dimitrios V.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, GR-15773 Athens, Greece; [Lyridis, Dimitrios V.] Lab Maritime Transport, GR-15773 Athens, Greece; [Manos, Nikolaos D.; Zacharioudakis, Panayotis G.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Maritime Transport, GR-15773 Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; National Technical University of Athens,"Lyridis, DV (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, 9 Heroon Polytechniou St, GR-15773 Athens, Greece.",dsvlr@mail.ntua.gr; nmanos@mail.ntua.gr; panzac@mail.ntua.gr,"Lyridis, Dimitrios/AAA-5769-2021","Lyridis, Dimitrios V./0000-0003-0812-0560",,,,,14,7,7,1,19,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Against James Scott's concept of legibility', my research shows that the Romanian Party officials were fully aware of the limitations imposed by standardized knowledge and statistics in their planning activity and tried to counteract these limitations by producing in-depth ethnographic knowledge about economic units, production and people. Narrative and interpretative accounts of factory life proved to be the most efficient tools for a state which managed not only populations and resources, but also social production processes. Investigating the fundamental ways in which knowing was inextricably tied to planning as a condition of possibility for the exercise of state power reveals how the project of transforming economy and society into a totalizing historical configuration depended upon essentially anti-totalizing forms of knowledge.","Cent European Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Anthropol, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Cucu, AS (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Anthropol, Zrinyi Utca 14, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",cucu_alina-sandra@ceu-budapest.edu,,,,,,,41,7,7,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Drawing on longitudinal register data, this study reports findings from the highly-regulated housing context of Amsterdam. Through regression modelling and GIS analyses, we demonstrate that tenure conversions from rent to owner-occupancy are not just bringing about changes in social-class composition, but also affect the ethnic and demographic compositions. Moreover, conversions from rent to ownership have highly spatially-specific effects. Our evidence suggests that tenure conversions may contribute to gentrification in the inner-city of Amsterdam, while conversions in post-war neighbourhoods do not lead to a social upgrading and may even facilitate downgrading. Furthermore, trends in the converted section of the housing market are not just mirroring income developments but also seem to reflect trends in ethnic segregation and demographic trends such as a renewed interest among families to live in the inner-city.","[Boterman, Willem R.; van Gent, Wouter P.

We distinguish between ad hoc and systematic reactions and discuss their effectiveness for dealing with two basic challenges: (1) identifying and solving the problems that caused the failure; and (2) changing the organization accordingly. We apply this conceptual perspective to illustrate the dynamics of learning from the drastic failure that occurred during the development of the Airbus A380 superjumbo. Our findings echo extant observations that efforts to redesign organizational behavior in an ad hoc manner are often insufficient. Instead, the organizational system must provide scaffolding that allows experiencing a critical event in a rich and systematic manner. When seen from a dynamic perspective, however, we find that even imperfect ad hoc efforts may play a vital role. By enforcing changes, providing stability, and raising awareness, they can act as a helpful prelude to more systematic problem solving and change.","[Doerfler, Isabel] Univ Munich, Ctr Digital Technol & Management, D-80290 Munich, Germany; [Baumann, Oliver] Univ Southern Denmark, Strateg Org Design Unit, Dept Mkt & Management, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Munich; University of Southern Denmark,"Baumann, O (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Strateg Org Design Unit, Dept Mkt & Management, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",oliv@sod.dias.sdu.dk,,"Baumann, Oliver/0000-0002-0797-9464",,,,,53,15,17,0,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

We highlight the impact, in terms of model specification, of the choice of the particular high-frequency explanatory variable to be included in the cointegrating relationship, which we call a dynamic mixed-frequency cointegrating relationship. The forecasting performance of aggregated models and several mixed-frequency regressions are compared in a set of Monte Carlo experiments. In particular, we look at both the unrestricted mixed-frequency model and at a more parsimonious MIDAS regression. Whereas the existing literature has only investigated the potential improvements of the MIDAS framework for stationary time series, our study emphasizes the need to include the relevant cointegrating vectors in the non-stationary case. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the choice of dynamic mixed-frequency cointegrating relationship does not matter as long as the short-run dynamics are adapted accordingly. Finally, the unrestricted model is shown to suffer from parameter proliferation for samples of relatively small size, whereas MIDAS forecasts are robust to over-parameterization. We illustrate our results for the US inflation rate.

We argue that firms producing products for which rapid technological change is characteristic will benefit from outsourcing to avoid the risk of not recouping their sunk cost investments when new production technologies appear. This risk is exacerbated when firms produce for low volume internal use, and is mitigated for those firms that sell to larger markets. Hence, products characterized by higher rates of technological change will be more likely to be produced by mass specialized firms to which other firms outsource production. Using a 1990-2002 panel data set on Spanish firms and an exogenous proxy for technological change, we provide causal evidence that technological change increases the likelihood of outsourcing.

The proposed hybrid model combines the capability of wavelets and neural networks to capture non-stationary nonlinear attributes embedded in financial time series. A comparison study was performed on the predictive power of two econometric models and four recurrent neural network topologies. Several statistical measures were applied to the predictions and standard errors to evaluate the performance of all models. A Jordan net that used as input the coefficients resulting from a non-decimated wavelet-based multi-resolution decomposition of an exogenous signal showed a consistent superior forecasting performance. Reasonable forecasting accuracy for the one-, three- and five step-ahead horizons was achieved by the proposed model. The procedure used to build the neuro-wavelet model is reusable and can be applied to any high-frequency financial series to specify the model characteristics associated with that particular series.

Its absence from the forest landscape is, therefore, of concern, such that one official Swedish environmental objective is to increase the volume of deadwood. However, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, another environmental goal, is likely to work against this biodiversity objective. In this study we utilize a regional economic forest sector model, focusing on northern Sweden, in order to estimate the effect of a large scale introduction of stump harvest on the future use of forest fuel. In addition, an ecological model, describing the relationship between the availability of stumps and the abundance of saproxylic beetles, is linked to the economic model. The parameters used in the economic model are derived from a data set spanning 28 years while the ecological model is derived from a survey of ten clear cuts, undertaken seven years after the clear cutting, in order to investigate the abundance of saproxylic beetles in stumps. We simulate the effects of an increased demand for wood fuels in northern Sweden, with or without stump harvest. The two scenarios have different effects on all major round wood markets in the region, as well as on the abundance of saproxylic beetles. More specifically, the harvest of stumps is associated with a 5% reduction in the mean abundance of saproxylic beetles living in deadwood on future clear cuts and a 3% increase in the use of renewable energy recourses in heating plants.

The theoretical framework takes account of the dynamics and interactions of forests' multiple carbon pools and assumes an infinite time horizon. Our paper provides a theoretical foundation for numerical model studies that have found that a social cost of carbon implies longer optimal rotation periods and that if the social cost of carbon exceeds a certain threshold value the forest should not be harvested. At the same time we show that it could be a net social benefit from harvesting even if the commercial profit from harvest is negative. If that is the case, the optimal harvest age is decreasing in the social cost of carbon. (C) 2014 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

The research methods used in this paper are panel data analysis and cluster analysis. The results point out that the level of shadow economy is lower in countries with higher government effectiveness, regulatory quality, business freedom, fiscal freedom and labour freedom. Regulatory quality, government effectiveness and shadow economy were the most important variables in dividing EU countries into three main clusters The main conclusion is that in order to diminish the level of shadow economy we have to increase institutional efficiency.","[Iacobuta, Andreea-Oana; Socoliuc, Oana Ramona; Clipa, Raluca Irina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm Bvd, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Iacobuta, AO (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm Bvd, Carol I 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",andreea.iacobuta@uaic.ro; oanasocoliuc@gmail.com; riclipa@gmail.com,"Socoliuc (Guriță), Oana-Ramona/GOJ-7802-2022; Clipa, Raluca/N-1996-2016; Iacobuta-Mihaita, Andreea-Oana/GJB-6392-2022","Socoliuc (Guriță), Oana-Ramona/0000-0001-5538-6789; Clipa, Raluca Irina/0000-0002-0214-9568",,,,,36,3,3,1,38,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Furthermore, the conjugate prior is modeled as hierarchical in order to exploit the information across regimes. This framework allows breaks in the variance, the regression coefficients, or both. The regime duration can be modelled as a Poisson distribution. A new, efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler draws the parameters from the posterior distribution as one block.

The Government of India has opened up many sectors and areas to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in a gradual manner. However, agriculture sector has been exposed to Multi-national Companies (MNCs) in a restricted manner considering the threat of land grabbing as well as other technical, social and economic issues. In this paper an attempt has been made to evaluate the performance of agriculture in the pre and post globalisation period as well the impact of restrictive FDI policies on the overall growth of the agriculture sector. An in-depth analysis has been done of the expected threats, weaknesses as well as the opportunities which can be nourished in the era of globalisation. A comparative analysis has been done of FDI policies and its impact on agriculture in other countries viz. USA, China and African countries. For empirical analysis, comparative ratio analysis and granger causality test between GDP, GCFR and FDI has been done during the period 1990-2010. The paper concludes with discussion on various aspects and possible outcome of the impact of FDI and the countervailing policy of Government of India with respect to agriculture sector.

It also tries to measure the success of the coalition loyalty programmes which satisfy the variety seeking behaviour. Design/Methodology/Approach: A structured questionnaire was developed and various aspects of the loyalty programme were studied. The data analysis consisted of exploratory factor analysis, chi-square analysis and Fisher's exact analysis test. Findings: The study reveals the importance of acceptance of variety seeking behaviour as a value which the customer derives by joining the coalition based loyalty programmes. It also reveals how the ease and simplicity of joining the coalition programme has an impact on the loyalty levels. Practical implications: We believe that this research will benefit the managers in strategizing for particular segments of their loyalty programme members. It will enable their understanding of the fact the greater customer co-creation, higher are the loyalty levels. Originality/Value: There has been little research on the variety seeking behaviour and its impact on the loyalty levels of the customer. This research paper tries to fill in this gap. It also tries to link Co-creation of the consumption experience and its impact on the loyalty levels. Limitations/Future research: This research was done in India and therefore a wider geographic and demographic reach and study across comparative coalition loyalty programmes will help to establish the model proposed.

No comprehensive assessment of costs related to the treatment of lung cancers at all stages has been published in the Czech Republic to-date. The results in this study are calculated based on diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms, i.e. process maps. These, in turn, are derived from the recommended therapeutic procedures issued by the Masaryk Institute of Oncology, the University Hospital in Hradec Kralove and the University Hospital in Plzen. In total, the costs and reimbursements were calculated for 32 utilized algorithms, i.e. process maps. The costs for therapeutic processes account for 22 results, while 10 results correspond to diagnostic processes. Both direct and indirect costs were included in individual calculations. The calculations imply that treatment costs significantly differ depending on the selected diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. It becomes apparent that the setting of the reimbursement system presently generates different stimuli for providers, who may reach both positive and negative balances. This fact, in turn, may have an effect on the economic result leading, in its consequence, to the preference of more suitable alternatives in terms of reimbursement regardless of the optimum procedures for the particular patient. This fact is, to a certain extent, reflected by the reimbursements calculated by means of the DRG system. The given algorithms may potentially be used by health care providers to reach working costs, which will allow accurate calculations for particular hospitals.","[Simrova, Jana; Rogalewicz, Vladimir] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, CzechHTA, Dept Biomed Technol, CR-16635 Prague, Czech Republic; [Simrova, Jana; Vojtisek, Radovan] Univ Hosp Plzen, Dept Radiotherapy & Oncol, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Bartak, Miroslav] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Social Work, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague; University Hospital Plzen; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Simrová, J (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, CzechHTA, Dept Biomed Technol, CR-16635 Prague, Czech Republic.",jana.simrova2107@gmail.com; miroslav.bartak@ujep.cz; vojtisekr@fnplzen.cz; rogalewicz@fbmi.cvut.cz,"Barták, Miroslav/N-9249-2017; Rogalewicz, Vladimír/H-6246-2011","Rogalewicz, Vladimír/0000-0001-5432-4148; Vojtisek, Radovan/0000-0001-7318-7927",,,,,31,14,14,0,21,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The methodology used is structural equation modeling (Partial Least Squares technique). The sample consisted of 116 firms. Our findings show that: (1) the EFQM model is a reliable and valid framework to measure the results achieved by the firm; (2) The synergies between the critical factors make up a management system, especially, the importance of leadership, strategy and processes for the system's effectiveness and soundness; (3) The obtaining of a measure of the overall results.

The Internet has been particularly widely adopted by banks, which use it not only to communicate with customers but also due to its efficiency and ease and economy of use. Although electronic banking is developing broadly overall, we are interested in the development of cyclical bill payments via the Internet. The purpose of this paper is to test the usage frequency of online cyclical payment compared to other payment channels. We analyzed data gathered from a representative sample of 12,386 households in Poland and found that Polish households use the services of non-banking institutions most frequently when they make payments are connected to household maintenance. This inclination was particularly marked among residents of small towns, retirees and farmers. There is also evidence of a race in Poland to establish standards for mobile payments.","[Szopinski, Tomasz; Staniewski, Marein W.] Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Fac Management & Finance, PL-01030 Warsaw, Poland",,"Szopinski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Fac Management & Finance, 55 Pawia Str, PL-01030 Warsaw, Poland.",tszopinski@wp.pl; staniewski@vizja.pl,"Staniewski, Marcin Waldemar/AAE-1854-2021","Staniewski, Marcin Waldemar/0000-0003-1913-6007; Szopinski, Tomasz/0000-0002-9314-1886",,,,,36,2,2,0,10,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In this article, we examine the scale and nature of imbalance in the British economy. We first examine the stylized facts of spatial economic imbalance, especially in relation to the recurring debate over the existence and persistence of a 'North-South Divide' in the nation's economic landscape. We then review some theoretical accounts of unbalanced regional growth and the role they give to sectoral structure and competitiveness. Next, dynamic multi-factor partitioning methods are used to determine the relative contribution that sectoral composition has made to Britain's North-South growth gap. In the light of our findings, we argue that the Coalition Government's policies to redress that imbalance are unlikely to have any profound impact.","[Gardiner, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Econometr, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Gardiner, Ben; Martin, Ron] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Sunley, Peter] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Tyler, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Southampton; University of Cambridge,"Martin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",rlm1@cam.ac.uk,"Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023",,ESRC [ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,86,109,117,2,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The primary goal of this research is to aid public agencies with day-to-day road management within limited financial resources. In order to demonstrate the value of this approach, we present a case study using data collected for 18 regional offices of the South Korean Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs. Road agencies want to know whether they currently have sufficient equipment to handle work demands, but this is difficult to predict. Thus, a methodology was developed to employ historical data on road management equipment, and two evaluation indicators were identified. Using our method, equipment can be classified into four groups: (1) frequently used and important, (2) relatively less used and important, (3) barely used and low importance, and (4) frequently used and low importance. In our case study we show that these can be used by regional offices to determine either to lend or borrow among offices or to consider purchase for both long and short term use. While our study focuses on a specific case study, the overall methodology can easily be applied by similar decision makers in other countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that the approach is likely to outperform standard pre-election surveys, due to its better coverage and reduced measurement error, and the possibility of correcting for sample selection. We set out the practical details of the method and demonstrate its usefulness by employing a recent German mayoral election as an empirical case.

The objective of this research was to analyze the assessment of staff performance and motivation in Health Research Institutes. The study was descriptive, with a cross-sectional, non-experimental, field design. The population consisted of research institutes in the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Zulia. Units of observation were the staff assigned to these institutions. Data was collected using a survey-type questionnaire, validated by a panel of experts; later, a pilot test was applied, whose reliability level was 0.95. Results showed the absence of an assessment that measures worker performance, the absence of frequent recognitions for the staff, as well as the non-applicability of sanctions for violating a rule. Conclusions were that the absence of formal and informal assessments generated discomfort in the personnel in relation to the few rewards and the non-application of sanctions for uncompleted work.","[Urdaneta Quintero, Omar Ramon; Urdaneta Quintero, Milagros del Valle] Univ Zulia, Fac Odontol, Div Estudios Grad, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Quintero, ORU (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Fac Odontol, Div Estudios Grad, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",omar_urdaneta_q@yahoo.com; miliur69@hotmail.com,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,14,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

We assess the possibility that differences in fertility across groups remain even though their socio-economic characteristics are similar. More specifically, we consider that parents' fertility decisions are affected by the uncertainty concerning the future economic status of their offspring. We assume that this uncertainty varies across groups and is linked to the size of the group one belongs to.

Could results be more conclusive given existing data limitations and the current methodological state of the art? How far are we from obtaining such results? We conclude that there are far too many arguments with blurry lines predicting just about any result. Data are more likely to constitute the binding constraint rather than methodology issues, despite the fact that the estimation of causality between democracy and crime can still be improved.

Areas around Copenhagen, Denmark, have also experienced continuous urbanisation and a considerable in-migration, which has contributed to the development of a wider metropolitan region. Most recently, however, a shift of migration towards the urban centre has occurred. Was the emergence of the urban-rural region just an ephemeral phenomenon? Migration patterns are used to analyse urban-rural relationships. Generally, in-migration was concentrated in areas located at medium to long-distances from the city centre from 1996-2005, while in the years since 2006, this trend has been reversed. However, a differentiated view on migration shows a very diverse and non-linear development. We focus on three migration types, Ex-urbanisation, Displaced urbanisation and Anti-urbanisation and compare their development since 1986 in three time periods. Each type shows a different behaviour, partially unstable over time.","[Fertner, Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Fertner, C (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",chfe@life.ku.dk,"Fertner, Christian/B-8716-2012; Fertner, Christian/AAQ-1029-2020","Fertner, Christian/0000-0001-6112-3328; Fertner, Christian/0000-0001-6112-3328",,,,,52,13,16,3,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

One finding is that academic patents have a short-term disadvantage, which disappears in the long term. Our results also indicate that controlling for whether the patent belongs to a core or non-core technology relative to the firm's technological profile neutralizes the premium of non-academic patents. In other words, patents belonging to firms' core technologies have significantly higher value, regardless of whether they are academic or non-academic patents. The above results indicate that the technological profile of firms is an important characteristic to analyse, when examining the value of academic patents and the specific role that academics play in industrial invention.","[Ljungberg, Daniel; Bourelos, Evangelos; Mckelvey, Maureen] Univ Gothenburg, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Dept Econ & Soc, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Ljungberg, D (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Dept Econ & Soc, Box 625, Gothenburg, Sweden.",daniel.ljungberg@handels.gu.se,"胡, 巧爱/GXZ-8730-2022","Ljungberg, Daniel/0000-0002-3868-516X",,,,,37,11,13,1,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The aim of this paper is to investigate this issue and to test the predictions of different streams of the theoretical economic literature on organizational design. We use the estimates of survival data analysis models to examine the determinants of the addition of a middle-management level to the corporate hierarchy of a large sample of Italian high-tech entrepreneurial ventures. The econometric results lend support to the view proposed by the information processing stream that the information overload problems engendered by a highly competitive and unpredictable business environment are key drivers of the creation of a middle-management level. Moreover, in accordance with the knowledge hierarchy literature, the greater the human capital of firms' owner-managers, the more likely the appointment of a middle manager. Conversely, we fail to provide evidence consistent with theoretical predictions inspired by the decentralization of incentives stream. Lastly, transaction costs and adverse selection problems in the managerial labour market are found to have a large negative effect on the likelihood of the appointment of middle managers.","[Colombo, Massimo G.; Grilli, Luca] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Colombo, MG (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",massimo.colombo@polimi.it; luca.grilli@polimi.it,"; Grilli, Luca/K-6348-2017","Colombo, Massimo G./0000-0003-0373-1565; Grilli, Luca/0000-0003-4550-9276",,,,,103,25,29,1,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Assuming policy makers cannot directly allocate households across rural and urban regions, we find there are circumstances where a second-best efficient allocation of government services is independent of the relative weights the policy maker places on the welfare of rural and urban households. An 'efficient' urban bias ensures that wages are maximized for urban and rural households and that migration to the city is not excessive. Thus, inequities in the provision of government services are not necessarily a sign of political favoritism. In these circumstances, a second public policy instrument is needed to effect redistribution in favor of urban households. A 'redistributive' urban bias takes the form of restricting migration flows to the city and not in altering the allocation of government services.","[Mourmouras, Alexandros] Int Monetary Fund, IMF Inst, Europe & Middle East Div, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Rangazas, Peter] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",International Monetary Fund; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,"Rangazas, P (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, 425 Univ Blvd, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",prangaza@iupui.edu,,,,,,,13,12,12,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In countries where the threat of political extraction is higher, we hypothesize that firms hold a lower fraction of their assets in liquid form. Consistent with this conjecture, using data representing over 30,000 firms across 109 countries, we find that corporate holdings of liquid assets are negatively correlated with measures of political corruption. Further, annual investment in property, plant, equipment, and inventory plus dividends is positively correlated with measures of political corruption suggesting that owners channel their cash into harder to extract assets. To the extent that the threat of political extraction moves firms away from their otherwise optimal levels of liquid assets, our findings suggest that the threat of political extraction may reduce economic development not only through the direct costs of political payoffs but also because the potential for asset extraction moves firms away from their otherwise optimal asset holdings.","[Caprio, Lorenzo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Faccio, Mara; McConnell, John J.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Caprio, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",mcconnj@purdue.edu,,,,,,,40,106,119,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

This is in addition to investigating the impact of city growth on energy consumption and emissions from transport. It utilizes results of 1971, 1978, 1987, 1998 and 2001 travel demand surveys, undertaken during the corresponding GC transport studies; each was published a year or two later. No further transport studies have been carried out in GC over the past decade and in view of the current political situation, it is not envisaged that similar studies will be undertaken in the near future. The analysis includes the evolution of daily trips, trip purpose share, modal share and number of cars. More recent trends for 2006/2007 vehicle registration by type and size are given. The evolution of transport supply covers projects until early 2012. In parallel estimates of the evolution of energy consumption and cost, emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2) and pollutants (CO, HC and NOx) are given for 1971/2001. The adopted estimation methodology is summarized. Comparative analysis of relevant evolution indexes and trends of growth between 1971 and 2001, taking the former as base year, is given. Land use and transport policies and projects that in some cases helped, directly or indirectly, to reduce traffic congestion, or at least prevented an increase, are addressed, commenting on their outcomes. Thus, transferable experience are useful to sister cities benefiting from successes and avoiding drawbacks. The evolution of the impact of GC metro on energy consumption and cost, and GHG emissions is given for 1987/2001, assuming the scenario metro did not exist. More recent impact analysis is given for 2007/2008, as the data allowed estimating traffic volumes that would have been added to the congested metro corridors under the above scenario; and the related fuel consumption and cost and GHGs. The paper ends with conclusions on GC evolution, learned lessons and suggests repeating similar work in other mega cities of the developing countries. Further research is emphasized, e.g., modeling the relationship between land use, transport, energy and emissions; modeling emission factors by vehicle type; and studying fuel-subsidy-reduction scenarios and their socio-economic effects.

After an update on the current U.S. food policy environment, the article reviews the controversies surrounding locating big food retail in underserviced areas. It argues that the food access problem can only move forward if three areas are addressed. First, economic geographers must return to a serious engagement in crucial evidence-based 'before/after' retail interventions as Wrigley and his UK researchers did almost 15 years ago. Second, current research must not be done in isolation to the context of the rapidly changing global retail environment and the multiple ways people now access their food. Third, solutions must also address the broader issues of affordability and need and the particular U.S. style governance regime that limits what personal responsibility can do.","Queens Univ, Dept Geog, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Donald, B (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Geog, MacKintosh Corry Hall,D201, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",betsy.donald@queensu.ca,,,,,,,27,38,54,5,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Based on the case study of lunch box delivery system organized by the Mumbai dabbawalas, demonstrated that an informal sector was capable of developing an urban logistics system that was precise, reliable and affordable to the middle class society in Mumbai. These facts suggest an approach based on adapting logistics solutions harmoniously to the urban landscape, public policy, infrastructure and skill sets of the company's employees in order to be attractive to the end customer, offering a good match between supply and demand i.e., consumer and producer satisfaction. At the same time logistics solutions should evolve continuously in order to be attractive to the core customer base and should be customer driven.

Another problem group is related to communication and collaboration issues: insufficient collaboration between target groups in different levels, inadequate way of information. The current research is based on sociological research methods: interviews and questionnaires involving respondents from principal target groups: state institutions, water management enterprises, municipalities, experts and population. The contribution of integrated approach leads to the management model, which involves: drinking water protection, water safety, public health and local planning issues. Accordingly, the adaptive approach leads to operative and flexible decisions and solutions, more effective planning, efficient provision of water resource infrastructure, learning from shortcomings and indicating a need for overall environmental assessments and research, as well as, comprehensive environmental communication.

Offset payments for carbon sequestered in forest biomass of $15-$50/t CO(2)e applied in all countries increased CO2 sequestration in world forests by 5-14 billion tons from 2009 to 2030. Limiting implementation to developed countries exported environmental damage from North to South, as developing countries harvested more, decreasing their stored CO(2)e. Substantially more CO(2)e was sequestered by allocating a given budget to all countries rather than to developed countries only. As offset payments increased wood prices relatively more than they decreased production, timber revenues generally increased. In the few countries with timber revenues losses they were more than compensated by the offset payments. (C) 2013 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

Most literature however, tends to concentrate on breadth as opposed to depth of programme outreach. This paper is based on a primary household survey of 1,132 respondents in the Punjab Province of Pakistan to assess which category of the poor is being served by microfinance institutions: are they the very poor, middle poor or less poor ones? In order to make comparisons, borrower (treatment) and non-borrower (control) households are ranked by poverty scores generated by employing Principal Component Analysis. The study reveals that the depth of poverty outreach is significantly lower than what has been claimed by lenders.

This paper examines whether and to what degree access to flexible work schedules affects the departure times of commuters in the two largest and most congested areas of California: the Los Angeles and San Francisco regions. Trip data were obtained from the 2009 US National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The results of this study show that people who have access to flexitime preferred later departure times rather than earlier times. Workers with flexible schedules were 3.30% less likely to depart before peak hours, 4.11% less likely during peak hours, and 7.41% more likely afterwards. Based on these findings, government agencies and private firms in regions with severe traffic congestion problems may consider adopting alternative work schedules. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper aims to discuss the innovation performance of Baltic States and to examine the usability of the new approach of calculating Europe 2020 Innovation Indicator in case of Latvia. The theoretical and methodological evidence is based on the analysis of the economic literature, scientific works published by Latvian and foreign scientists; the legal documents of European Commission; the statistics database of the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia; Eurostat and other international statistical and methodological materials. Bibliography review, as well as methods of statistical analysis such as grouping, processing and comparative analysis has mainly been used in the paper.","[Jesilevska, Svetlana] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,svetlana.jesilevska@csb.gov.lv,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,327,338,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100031,0

We show that the Faustmann landowners receive information rents, on average 55% of the rental payments. For the Hartman landowners the high conservation costs of old stands result in low information rents; they are only 13% of the rental payments. This estimate omits amenity benefits the landowners derive from their forests; accounting for these benefits would increase information rents dramatically. Despite the high information rents, landowners' conservation motives decrease the rental payment required for participation in the conservation program. Hence, landowners' conservation motives give governments a great opportunity to allocate conservation contracts in a more cost effective way, thereby extracting larger benefits for scarce conservation funds.

The Johansen cointegration technique and VECM model were used to find the long-run and short-term dynamic relationships in money demand model. Empirical results provide the evidence that exchange rate and interest rate payable on denar time deposits up to one month explains the most variations of money demand in the long-run, while interest rate is significant only in short-run. Long-run money demand function is estimated to indicate slow speed of adjustment of removing the disequilibrium. Our finding shows that real money demand M1 in the Republic of Macedonia is stable in the analyzed period. The results obtained in this study suggest that the National Bank should carefully monitor the exchange rate and inflation as two most important indicators of monetary policy, because these two determinants are the main drivers of demand for money in the short and long term.","Stopanska Banka AD Skopje, Ohrid, Macedonia",,"Kjosevski, J (通讯作者)，Stopanska Banka AD Skopje, Pitu Guli 5, Ohrid, Macedonia.",jordan_kos@yahoo.com,"Kjosevski, Jordan/O-2871-2019",,,,,,44,2,3,0,5,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

To this end, autoregressive conditional density (ARCD) models are employed which allow for time variation in variance, skewness and kurtosis. The performance of ARCD models is evaluated against that of GARCH and of other conventional hedge ratio estimation methodologies based on exponentially weighted moving averages, ordinary least squares and error correction, respectively. An empirical application using spot and futures data on the DJI, FTSE and DAX equity indices compares the in-sample and out-of-sample hedging effectiveness of each approach in terms of risk minimization. The results show that the ARCD approach has the best performance, thus suggesting that forecasting higher moments is of practical importance for futures hedging.
