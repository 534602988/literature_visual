J,"Hammitt, JK",,,,"Hammitt, James K.",,,DISCOUNTING HEALTH AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS: A RESPONSE TO NORD,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,cost-effectiveness analysis; discount rate,DECISION,"Nord (2011) criticizes standard arguments which assert that consistency requires that future health benefits must be discounted at the same rate as future costs in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). He suggests these arguments are misguided because they require transitivity of preferences across decision contexts and that it can be appropriate to discount health at different rates depending on the programs to be compared. I claim that rejecting transitivity is unwarranted and would sharply diminish the utility of CEA. Factors that tempt Nord to reject consistency can be accommodated by recognizing that CEA does not perfectly mimic normative social preferences because it omits factors (like distribution of health in a population) that can be normatively significant. A better approach is to maintain consistency in application of CEA but authorize decision makers to depart from rankings implied by CEA when justified and to explain which specific factors justify the decision. Finally, the assertion that health must be discounted at the same rate as costs requires the additional assumption that the dollar value of health does not change over time, a point that is not always recognized in standard arguments.

We find that the total social value of bariatric surgery is large for treated patients, with incremental social cost-effectiveness ratios typically under $10,000 per life-year saved. On the other hand, pharmaceutical interventions against obesity yield much less social value with incremental social cost-effectiveness ratios around $50,000. Our approach accounts for: competing risks to life expectancy; health care costs; and a variety of non-medical economic consequences (pensions. disability insurance, taxes, and earnings), which account for 20% of the total social cost of these treatments. On balance, bariatric surgery generates substantial private value for those treated, in the form of health and other economic consequences. The net public fiscal effects are modest, primarily because the size of the population eligible for treatment is small. The net social effect is large once improvements in life expectancy are taken into account. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates whether the public value safety-related health care improvements more highly than the same improvements in contexts where the health care system is not responsible. Method: An online survey was conducted to elicit the relative importance placed on preventing harms caused by 1) health care (hospital-acquired infections, drug administration errors, injuries to health care staff), 2) individuals (personal lifestyle choices, sports-related injuries), and 3) nature (genetic disorders). Direct valuations were obtained from members of the public by using a person trade-off or matching method. Participants were asked to choose between two preventative interventions of equal cost and equal health benefit per person for the same number of people, but differing in causation. If participants indicated a preference, their strength of preference was measured by using person trade-off. Results: Responses were obtained from 1030 people, reflecting the sociodemographic mix of the UK population. Participants valued interventions preventing hospital-acquired infections (1.31) more highly than genetic disorders (1.0), although drug errors were valued similarly to genetic disorders (1.07), and interventions to prevent injury to health care staff were given less weight than genetic disorders (0.71). Less weight was also given to interventions related to lifestyle (0.65) and sports injuries (0.41). Conclusion: Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to safety-related interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.","[Singh, Jeshika; Lord, Joanne; Longworth, Louise; Buxton, Martin] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Singh, Jeshika; Buxton, Martin] Brunel Univ, Multidisciplinary Assessment Technol Ctr Healthca, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Orr, Shepley; McGarry, Teresa; Sheldon, Rob] Accent MR, Chiswick, England; [Orr, Shepley] UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, London, England",Brunel University; Brunel University; University of London; University College London,"Singh, J (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Gaskell Bldg, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",jeshika.singh@brunel.ac.uk,"; Lord, Joanne/H-1417-2011","Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Lord, Joanne/0000-0003-1086-1624",MATCH within Brunel University; HERG within Brunel University; EPSRC [EP/F063822/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/F063822/1] Funding Source: researchfish,MATCH within Brunel University; HERG within Brunel University; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This research was jointly funded by MATCH and HERG within Brunel University.,,38,6,6,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15,5.0,,,,,690,698,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.005,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867778.0,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100012,0

The main result is that a generalized version of differencing identifies local average responses (LARs) in nonseparable structures. In contrast to existing results, this does not require either substantial restrictions on functional form or independence between the persistent unobservables and the explanatory variables of interest, and it requires only two time periods. On the other hand, the results are confined to the subpopulation of stayers (Chamberlain, 1982), i.e., the population for which the explanatory variables do not change over time. We extend the basic framework to include time trends and dynamics in the explanatory variables, and we show how distributional effects as well as average partial effects are identified. Our approach also allows endogeneity in the transitory unobservables. Furthermore, we show that this new identification principle can be applied to well-known objects like the slope coefficient in the semiparametric panel data binary choice model with fixed effects. Finally, we suggest estimators for the local average response and average partial effect, and we analyze their large- and finite-sample behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This limitation can potentially be overcome when panel data are available. For such data, we develop a sequence of models that combine features of the static cross-sectional latent class (finite mixture) models with those of hidden Markov models. We model the probability of movement between categories in terms of a Markovian structure, which links the current state with a previous state, where state may refer to the category of an individual. This article presents a suite of mixture models of varying degree of complexity and flexibility for use in a panel count data setting, beginning with a baseline model which is a two-component mixture of Poisson distribution in which latent classes are fixed and permanent. Sequentially, we extend this framework (i) to allow the mixing proportions to be smoothly varying continuous functions of time-varying covariates, (ii) to add time dependence to the benchmark model by modeling the class-indicator variable as a first-order Markov chain and (iii) to extend item (i) by making it dynamic and introducing covariate dependence in the transition probabilities. We develop and implement estimation algorithms for these models and provide an empirical illustration using 19951999 panel data on the number of doctor visits derived from the German Socio-Economic Panel.

Given a vector 0 of parameters, the vector of states alpha = (alpha(1),..., alpha(n)) is Gaussian and the observed vector y = (y(1)(inverted perpendicular), ...., y(n)(inverted perpendicular))(inverted perpendicular) need not be. I describe a procedure to construct a close approximation q(alpha vertical bar theta, y) to the target density p(alpha vertical bar theta, y). It requires code to compute five derivatives of log p(y(t)vertical bar theta,alpha(t)) with respect to alpha(t), t = 1,..., n, and is not otherwise model specific. Since q(alpha vertical bar theta, y) is proper, fully normalised and simulable, it can be used as an importance density for importance sampling (IS) or as a proposal density for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). HESSIAN is an acronym but it also refers to the (sparse) Hessian matrix of log p(alpha vertical bar theta, y) with respect to alpha-the HESSIAN method is based on sparse matrix operations rather than the Kalman filter. I construct q(alpha vertical bar theta, y) and a related approximation q(theta, alpha vertical bar y) of p(theta, alpha vertical bar y) for two stochastic volatility models, two stochastic count models and a stochastic duration model. I illustrate their use for numerical approximation of likelihood function values and marginal likelihoods, using IS, and for posterior inference, using IS and MCMC. Compared with other simulation smoothing methods, the HESSIAN method is highly numerically efficient. In an IS application featuring a Student's t stochastic volatility model and n = 8851 daily log returns, the efficiency of IS for numerical approximation of the elements of the posterior mean E vertical bar theta vertical bar y vertical bar is between 80% and 100%.

Under our asymptotics, the PC estimator is inconsistent. We find explicit formulae for the amount of the inconsistency, and propose an estimator of the number of factors for which the PC estimator works reasonably well. For the special case when the idiosyncratic terms are cross-sectionally but not temporally correlated (or vice versa), we show that the coefficients in the OLS regressions of the PC estimates of factors (loadings) on the true factors (true loadings) are asymptotically normal, and find explicit formulae for the corresponding asymptotic covariance matrix. We explain how to estimate the parameters of the derived asymptotic distributions. Our Monte Carlo analysis suggests that our asymptotic formulae and estimators work well even for relatively small n and T. We apply our theoretical results to test a hypothesis about the factor content of the US stock return data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These features present challenges to the estimation of the effect of clinical and socioeconomic characteristics on health utilities. Our objective was to develop and demonstrate an appropriate method for dealing with these features. Methods: We developed a statistical model that incorporates an adjusted limited dependent variable approach to reflect the upper bound and the large gap in feasible EQ-5D questionnaire values. Further flexibility was then gained by adopting a mixture modeling framework to address the multimodality of the EQ-5D questionnaire distribution. We compared the performance of these approaches with that of those frequently adopted in the literature (linear and Tobit models) by using data from a clinical trial of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Results: We found that three latent classes are appropriate in estimating EQ-5D questionnaire values from function, pain, and sociodemographic factors. Superior performance of the adjusted limited dependent variable mixture model was achieved in terms of Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, root mean square error, and mean absolute error. Unlike other approaches, the adjusted limited dependent variable mixture model fits the data well at high EQ-5D questionnaire levels and cannot predict unfeasible EQ-5D questionnaire values. Conclusions: The distribution of the EQ-5D questionnaire is characterized by features that raise statistical challenges. It is well known that standard approaches do not perform well for this reason. This article developed an appropriate method to reflect these features by combining limited dependent variable and mixture modeling and demonstrated superior performance in a rheumatoid arthritis setting. Further refinement of the general framework and testing in other data sets are warranted. Analysis of utility data should apply methods that recognize the distributional features of the data.","[Alava, Monica Hernandez; Wailoo, Allan J.; Ara, Roberta] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Wailoo, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",a.j.wailoo@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Hernandez, Monica/0000-0003-4474-5883; Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617",,,,,39,113,118,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2012,15,3.0,,,,,550,561,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.12.014,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,941CN,22583466.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303940600019,0

There are very few recent studies of AD costs by all dimensions of disease severity. Our objective was to improve estimation of the relationship between AD severity and costs of AD care by using more comprehensive AD data severity and a large sample size. Methods: Participants were community-dwelling AD patients recruited between 2003 and 2005 and followed annually during a 2-year period in 50 French memory clinics. We used the Resource Use in Dementia questionnaire to estimate costs from a societal perspective. We explored the presence of potential endogeneity bias by using instrumental variable regressions. Results: Cognitive declines impacted informal costs more than medical and nonmedical costs, while functional declines impacted nonmedical costs more than medical and informal costs. Both cognitive and function declines increased the total costs of care. We found that the endogeneity of these variables led to a large underestimation of their impact of AD severity on costs. Conclusion: Potential endogeneity should be controlled for to prevent biased estimations of the impact of AD severity measures on costs.","[Rapp, Thomas] Univ Paris 05, LIRAES, F-75006 Paris, France; [Andrieu, Sandrine; Molinier, Laurent; Grand, Alain; Cantet, Christelle; Vellas, Bruno] Univ Hosp Toulouse, INSERM UMR1027, Toulouse, France; [Mullins, C.

Food insecurity could be related to lack of adequate nutrition experienced by poor children and may be pointed out as one of the possible explanations for this relationship. This paper investigates the association between food insecurity and children's health and nutrition and the role of the former in the child health income gradient. Using data from the 2006 Brazilian Demographic and Health Survey, the results show that children living in households with food insecurity have worse nutrition and health indicators. In addition, the relationship between household income and many children's health and nutrition measures weakens but remains significant when controlling for food insecurity.

A significant body of research has emerged suggesting that participation in SNAP increases the probability of being obese for adult women and has little effect on the probability for adult men. However, studies addressing the effects of participation on children have produced mixed results. This paper examines the effect of long-term SNAP participation on the Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile and probability of being overweight or obese for children ages 518 using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Children and Young Adults data set. An instrumental variables identification strategy that exploits exogenous variation in state-level program parameters, as well as state and federal expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), is used to address the endogeneity between SNAP participation and obesity. SNAP participation is found to significantly reduce BMI percentile and the probability of being overweight or obese for boys and girls ages 511 and boys ages 1218. For girls ages 1218, SNAP participation appears to have no significant effect on these outcomes.

While these methods achieve near asymptotic efficiency in both fixed trend break and no trend break environments, in finite samples pronounced valleys in the power functions of the tests (when mapped as functions of the break magnitude) are observed, with power initially high for very small breaks, then decreasing as the break magnitude increases, before increasing again. In response to this problem, we propose two practical solutions, based either on the use of a with-break unit root test but with adaptive critical values, or on a union of rejections principle taken across with-break and without-break unit root tests. These new procedures are shown to offer improved reliability in terms of finite sample power. We also develop local limiting distribution theory for both the extant and the newly proposed unit root statistics, treating the trend break magnitude as local-to-zero. We show that this framework allows the asymptotic analysis to closely approximate the finite sample power valley phenomenon, thereby providing useful analytical insights. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the literature of forecast combinations, there have been only a few studies exploring how to deal with outliers. In this work, we propose two robust combining methods based on the AFTER algorithm (Yang, 2004a). Our approach utilizes robust loss functions in order to reduce the influence of outliers. Oracle inequalities for certain versions of these methods are obtained, which show that the combined forecasts automatically perform as well as the best individual among the pool of original forecasts. Systematic simulations and data examples show that the robust methods outperform the AFTER algorithm when outliers are likely to occur and perform on par with AFTER when there are no outliers. Comparison of the robust AFTERs with some commonly used combining methods also shows their potential advantages. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A value set based on EHSs and valuation by the visual analogue scale (VAS) in the German general population was compared with a German and a UK value set, both based on GHSs and time-trade off valuation. Accuracy in the prediction of actual VAS ratings by patients was assessed using correlation and mean absolute error. Construct validity was tested by correlation with established disease activity indices and test-retest reliability by intraclass correlation between two measurements. Data originated from a survey of 270 patients with Crohn's disease and 232 patients with ulcerative colitis. Results: EHS-VAS correlates best with actual VAS ratings for all patients but not for all subgroups. EHS-VAS has the lowest mean absolute error for almost all analyzed groups ex-cept for measured differences between two time points. Regarding test-retest reliability in all patients, EHS-VAS correlations were closest to those of actual VAS ratings. Conclusion: EHS-VAS renders experience- based valuations but not decision utilities. GHS-based approaches cover severe health states more extensively, but study patients reported health states similar to those of a general population. Compared to GHS time-trade off value sets, the EHS-VAS value set predicted EQ-5D VAS valuations by patients with inflammatory bowel disease equally well and partly better. It performed partly better with respect to test-retest reliability and the same with respect to construct validity.","[Leidl, Reiner; Reitmeir, Peter; Stark, Renee] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85758 Neuherberg, Germany; [Leidl, Reiner] Univ Munich, Munich Sch Management, Munich, Germany; [Koenig, Hans-Helmut] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Med Sociol & Hlth Econ, Hamburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Munich; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf,"Leidl, R (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Postfach 1129, D-85758 Neuherberg, Germany.",Leidl@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Leidl, Reiner/GQY-7389-2022; König, Hans-Helmut/P-1211-2018; Leidl, Reiner M/B-7209-2009; Stark, Renée/B-6733-2013","Leidl, Reiner M/0000-0002-7115-7510; Stark, Renée/0000-0002-6612-292X",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research [01 GI 0487],German Federal Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Parts of this study were supported by a grant from the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research: Competence Networks in Health Research: Inflammatory Bowel Disease, grant number 01 GI 0487.",,19,16,17,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,,,,151,157,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.08.004,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GU,22264983.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299318500018,0

Methods: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using data from the UK fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and CPT11 (irinotecan) use and sequencing (FOCUS) trial. The analysis adopted the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Input parameters were derived using a system of risk equations (for probabilities), count data regression models (for resource use), and generalized linear models (for utilities). Parameter estimates were obtained using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, propagating the simulation values through the state-transition model to characterize appropriately the joint distributions of expected cost, survival and quality-adjusted life years for each treatment strategy. An acceptability frontier was used to represent the probability that the optimal option is cost-effective at different values of the costeffectiveness threshold. Results: The base-case analysis used drug unit costs provided by a typical English hospital. First-line doublet therapy combination therapy fluorouracil (5FU) plus irinotecan was the most cost-effective strategy at standard thresholds, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 14,877 pound (pound sterling) compared with first-line 5FU until treatment failure followed by single agent irinotecan. Other strategies were all subject to extended dominance. A sensitivity analysis using published drug (list) prices found the most cost-effective strategy would be first-line fluorouracil until failure followed by 5FU plus irinotecan (ICER: 19,753) pound. Conclusions: The combination of 5FU and irinotecan (whether used first or second line) appears to be more cost-effective than the single agent sequential therapies used in the FOCUS trial, or 5FU plus oxaliplatin.","[Manca, Andrea; Sculpher, Mark J.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Asseburg, Christian] Univ Eastern Finland, Fac Hlth Sci, Kuopio, Finland; [Seymour, Matt T.] Univ Leeds, Natl Canc Res Network Coordinating Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Meade, Angela; Stephens, Richard; Parmar, Mahesh] MRC, Clin Trials Unit, London, England",University of York - UK; University of Eastern Finland; University of Leeds; Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit,"Manca, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",am126@york.ac.uk,"Asseburg, Christian/AAK-2903-2020; Parmar, Mahesh KB/H-4557-2018","Asseburg, Christian/0000-0001-7196-3363; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913; Seymour, Matthew/0000-0002-2441-9629",UK Medical Research Council [E164/3]; Sanofi -Synthelabo; Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer; Wyeth-Lederle; Baxter; MRC [MC_U122861325] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_U122861325] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Sanofi -Synthelabo; Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer; Wyeth-Lederle(Wyeth); Baxter; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Principal trial funding was from the UK Medical Research Council (grant number E164/3).

Methods: By using government's perspective, budget impact was estimated within a 5-year period after the introduction of the policy. The number of patients who need treatment with each drug and the costs of treatments by both original and generic versions were obtained from Thai government agencies. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to determine the impact of uncertainty surrounding parameters such as the numbers of patients and the health-care costs. Results: The study indicated that the use of generic drugs under the policy could save the government budget approx-imately $370 million over 5 years. It was also found that each drug had a different effect on budget saving depending on the number of patients treated, the difference in drug costs between original and generic drugs, and the lag time from the introduction of the policy to the availability of the generic drugs on the market. Conclusion: The study showed that the introduction of the government use licenses policy in Thailand would provide significant benefits for the study timeframe; however, there are several issues that should be taken into account when the government use licenses policy is adopted.","[Mohara, Adun; Yamabhai, Inthira; Chaisiri, Kakanang; Tantivess, Sripen; Teerawattananon, Yot] Minist Publ Hlth, HITAP, Dept Hlth, Muang 11000, Nonthaburi, Thailand",Ministry of Public Health - Thailand,"Mohara, A (通讯作者)，Minist Publ Hlth, HITAP, Dept Hlth, 6th Floor,6th Bldg,Tiwanon Rd, Muang 11000, Nonthaburi, Thailand.",adun.m@hitap.net,,"Teerawattananon, Yot/0000-0003-2217-2930; Suya, Inthira/0000-0001-7054-2153","Health Insurance System Research Office; Bureau of Policy and Strategy, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand","Health Insurance System Research Office; Bureau of Policy and Strategy, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand","This study was funded by a grant from the Health Insurance System Research Office and the Bureau of Policy and Strategy, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand.

The explanatory factors are growth in the unit's cost efficiency, output growth, changes in input prices and technical progress. In order to implement the decomposition, an estimate of the industry's best practice cost function for the two periods under consideration is required. Profitability at a period of time is defined as the value of outputs produced by a production unit divided by the corresponding cost. Using the earlier work by Balk and O'Donnell, the paper provides a decomposition of profitability growth over two periods into various explanatory factors that are similar to the cost ratio decomposition except that change in outputs explanatory factor is replaced by two separate factors: an index of output price growth and a measure of returns to scale.

We use bagging as an alternative approach to Hall and Huang (2001). Asymptotic properties of our proposed estimators and forecasts are established. Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to show their finite sample performance. An application to predicting equity premium is taken for illustration. We introduce a new forecasting evaluation criterion based on the second order stochastic dominance in the size of forecast errors and compare models over different sizes of forecast errors. Imposing monotonicity constraint can mitigate the chance of making large size forecast errors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, Shimshack and Ward (2010) studied how U.S. households responded to FDA's 2001 mercury-in-fish advisory. They found that the average at-risk household reduced fish consumption by 21%, resulting in a 17%-reduction in mercury exposure at the cost of a 21%-reduction in cardioprotective omega-3 fatty acids. Based on a static assessment of the health costs and benefits Shimshack and Ward concluded that the advisory policy resulted in an overall consumer welfare loss. In this note, we propose a dynamic assessment that links the long-term cardiovascular health effects of the advisory to life-cycle consumption. We find that under reasonable assumptions the welfare loss might be much larger than suggested. Our analysis highlights the importance of accounting for dynamic effects when evaluating persistent changes in exposure to environmental health risks. (C) 2014 Elsevier BV.

The literature to date has mainly used the uneven rollout of NCMS across counties as a way of identifying its effects on access to care and financial protection. This study exploits the cross-county variation in NCMS generosity in 2006 and 2008 in the Ningxia and Shandong provinces to estimate the effect of coverage generosity on utilization and financial protection. Our results confirm earlier findings of NCMS being effective in increasing access to care but not in increasing financial protection. In addition, we find NCMS enrollees to be sensitive to the price incentives set in the NCMS design when choosing their provider and providers to respond by increasing prices and/or providing more expensive care.

To this end, we derive a mean variance preference generalised to ambiguity from the second-order Taylor Young expansion of the VEU certainty equivalent. We apply this Mean Variance Variability preference to the static two-assets portfolio problem and deduce asset allocation results which extend the mean variance analysis to ambiguity in the VEU framework. Our criterion has attractive features: it is axiomatically well-founded and analytically tractable, it is therefore well suited for applications to asset pricing as proved by a novel analysis of the home-bias puzzle with two ambiguous assets.

Methods: A dynamic stochastic model for the optimal timing of a treatment switch is developed and applied to a problem in medical decision taking, i.e. to patients with unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Results: the theoretical model suggests that cost uncertainty reduces expected net benefit. In addition, cost volatility discourages switching treatments. the stochastic model also illustrates that as technologies become less cost competitive, the cost uncertainty becomes more dominant. With limited substitutability, higher quality of technologies will increase the demand for those technologies disregarding the cost uncertainty. The results of the empirical application suggest that the first-line treatment may be the better choice when considering lifetime welfare. Conclusions: Under uncertainty and irreversibility, low-risk patients must begin the second-line treatment as soon as possible, which is precisely when the second-line treatment is least valuable. As the costs of reversing current treatment impacts fall, it becomes more feasible to provide the option-preserving treatment to these low-risk individuals later on.","[de Mello-Sampayo, Felipa] ISCTE IUL Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"de Mello-Sampayo, F (通讯作者)，ISCTE IUL, Av Forcas Armadas,Cac 187, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",fdmso@iscte.pt,"de Mello-sampayo, felipa/D-3661-2015","de Mello-sampayo, felipa/0000-0002-5219-7023",,,,,31,5,5,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2014,17,2.0,,,,,215,222,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.12.008,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AD6EB,24636379.0,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333346600008,0

Methods: We propose definitions of the different states of waiting, persistence, with sufficient supply to implement the prescribed dosing regimen, gaps, nonpersistence, and nonacceptance and an algorithm for transitions between states to describe long-term adherence to medication treatment The model and algorithm are operationalized for use in a case with a retrospective cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with access to records of prescribed drugs from a Danish diabetes research hospital and records of filled prescriptions at Danish pharmacies from the Danish Health and Medicines Authority. Results: Calculations of long-term adherence to medication are shown for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on metformin and/or simvastatin. The study shows how the prevalence of patients waiting to initiate treatment, patients with supply to implement the prescribed dosing regimen, patients not accepting treatment, and patients discontinuing treatment varies over time. Conclusions: The proposed multistate model and algorithm can easily be translated and used for the calculation of adherence to medication in any chronic disease. The model and algorithm take time into account, and thus, changes in incidence rates and prevalence of the different states over time can be estimated on several time scales (calendar time, age of the patient, and time since indication for medication).","[Jensen, Majken Linnemann; Jorgensen, Marit Eika; Carstensen, Bendix] Steno Diabet Ctr AS, DK-2820 Gentofte, Denmark; [Jensen, Majken Linnemann; Hansen, Ebba Holme] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Aagaard, Lise] Univ Southern Denmark, Fac Hlth, Odense, Denmark",Steno Diabetes Center; University of Copenhagen; University of Southern Denmark,"Jensen, ML (通讯作者)，Steno Diabet Ctr AS, Niels Steensens Vej 1,NLD2-06 MLiJ, DK-2820 Gentofte, Denmark.",MLiJ@steno.dk,"Aagaard, Lise/AAV-3273-2021","Hansen, Ebba Holme/0000-0001-7156-6552; Jorgensen, Marit Eika/0000-0001-8356-5565","Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation (at The Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education); danmark sygeforsikring (a mutual health insurance company)","Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation (at The Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education); danmark sygeforsikring (a mutual health insurance company)","This study has in part been funded by The Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation (at The Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education) and danmark sygeforsikring (a mutual health insurance company).

We call this requirement alpha proportional individual rationality. We identify a key threshold such that if alpha is less than this threshold, then efficiency obtains asymptotically. If alpha is greater than the threshold, then inefficiency obtains asymptotically. In addition, we obtain the convergence rate of the probability of provision to its efficient/inefficient level. Moreover, as a methodological contribution of this paper, we propose the standard deviation of an agent's interim expected provision as a measure of the agent's influence in a mechanism. We find that as the economy becomes large, an agent's influence in any sequence of anonymous mechanisms converges to zero, and thus any sequence of anonymous feasible mechanisms must converge to a constant mechanism. We obtain uniform bounds for those rates of convergence. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We explore this issue using general method of moments estimation and a panel of financial flows data spanning 119 countries and 16years. Our primary concern is how DAHG affects government health expenditure as source (GHES). We disaggregate the average effect of DAHG and separately identify the effects of increases versus decreases in DAHG. We find that a $1 year-over-year increase in DAHG leads to a $0.62 (90% confidence interval (CI): 0.15, 1.09) decrease in GHES, whereas a $1 year-over-year decrease in DAHG does not have an effect on GHES that is statistically different from zero (CI: -0.67, 1.17). Simulation shows that the displacement of GHES between 1995 and 2010 reduced total government health expenditure by $152.8 billion (CI: 46.9, 277.6). Moreover, the irregular disbursement of DAHG reduced total government expenditure by $96.9 billion (CI: 0.5, 212.4). Thus, this research shows that health aid is fungible and highlights the cost of displacement and erratic aid disbursement. (c) 2013 The Authors.

Sometimes, however, the target effectiveness estimates are not readily available. This may be because many alternative instruments measuring these outcomes are being used (and not all always reported) or an extended follow-up time of clinical trials is needed to evaluate long-term end points, leading to the limited data on the target clinical outcome. In the areas of highest priority in health care, decisions are required to be made on a short time scale. Therefore, alternative clinical outcomes, including surrogate end points, are increasingly being considered for use in evidence synthesis as part of economic evaluation. Objective: To illustrate the potential effect of reduced uncertainty around the clinical outcome on the utility when estimating it from a multivariate meta-analysis. Methods: Bayesian multivariate meta-analysis has been used to synthesize data on correlated outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis and to incorporate external data in the model in the form of informative prior distributions. Estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire were then mapped onto the health-related quality-of-life measure EuroQol five dimensional questionnaire, and the effect was compared with mapping the Health Assessment Questionnaire obtained from the univariate approach. Results: The use of multivariate meta-analysis can lead to reduced uncertainty around the effectiveness parameter and ultimately uncertainty around the utility. Conclusions: By allowing all the relevant data to be incorporated in estimating clinical effectiveness outcomes, multivariate meta-analysis can improve the estimation of health utilities estimated through mapping methods. While reduced uncertainty may have an effect on decisions based on economic evaluation of new health technologies, the use of short-term surrogate end points can allow for early decisions. More research is needed to determine the circumstances under which uncertainty is reduced.","[Bujkiewicz, Sylwia; Sutton, Alex J.; Cooper, Nicola J.; Abrams, Keith R.] Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Biostat Res Grp, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Thompson, John R.] Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Genet Epidemiol Grp, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Harrison, Mark J.] Univ Manchester, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Symmons, Deborah P.

He constructed an example of the transfer paradox based on three Leontief functions. The transfer paradox is that when there is a set of agents in the home country and that the home country is trading with other countries, then certain public lump-sum tax transfer plans could make all agents in the home country better off. Our contributions are as follows. First, we show that such an example can be constructed with three smooth CES utility functions. Second, we establish the three crucial conditions for the existence of the transfer paradox: (1) the donor (a taxpayer) has stronger preference for the foreign good than the recipient; (2) the donor is ex-ante wealthier than the recipient; (3) the elasticity of substitution of the foreign country's preference is strictly less than one.

Then, contestant 2 exerts an effort in the second period, and wins the contest if her output is larger than or equal to the observed noisy output of contestant 1; otherwise, contestant 1 wins. We study two variations of this model: one in which both contestants do not know the realization of the noise when they exert their effort (symmetric information), and another in which contestant 1 knows the realization of the noise when exerting her effort, while contestant 2 does not (asymmetric information). For both variations, we characterize the subgame perfect equilibrium and examine the effect of a random noise on the contestants' equilibrium outputs. In particular we show that contestants' equilibrium behavior in our model is robust to the existence of a small noise. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Cohorts were defined by the presence or absence of osteoporosis and CD (osteoporosis ONLY, CD ONLY, and CD plus osteoporosis) and, for osteoporosis cohorts, by incident (recent diagnosis) or prevalent osteoporosis (long-standing). Primary outcome was total health care costs during 1-year follow-up. Costs, adjusted for baseline characteristics, were analyzed with a generalized linear model with log link and gamma distribution. Results: Of the 494,160 patients, the majority had evidence of CD with or without osteoporosis: CVD (54%), two or more CDs (24%), DM (8%), depression (4%), COPD (1%); 9% had osteoporosis ONLY The range of actual mean costs was as follows: CD ONLY, $8,377 (CVD) to $12,801 (two or more CDs); CD plus incident osteoporosis, $15,696 (CVD) to $23,860 (two or more CDs); CD plus prevalent osteoporosis, $10,038 (CVD) to $17,997 (two or more CDs). Compared with CD ONLY, baseline-adjusted costs were 66% (two or more CDs) to 91% (DM) higher for CD plus incident osteoporosis and 13% (CVD) to 23% (depression) higher for CD plus prevalent osteoporosis (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The burden of osteoporosis in patients with CD is significant, particularly for patients with newly diagnosed osteoporosis.","[Thayer, Sarah W.; Rey, Gabriel Gomez; Seare, Jerald G.] OptumInsight, Eden Prairie, MN USA; [Stolshek, Bradley S.] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA",Optum; Amgen,"Thayer, SW (通讯作者)，OptumInsight, 425 Market St,Floor 15, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",sarah.thayer@optum.com,,,"Amgen, Inc.","Amgen, Inc.(Amgen)","Amgen, Inc.

Health Equity Funds (HEFs) aim to make exemptions effective by giving NGOs responsibility for assessing eligibility and compensating providers for lost revenue. We use the geographic spread of HEFs over time in Cambodia to identify their impact on out-of-pocket (OOP) payments. Among households with some OOP payment, HEFs reduce the amount paid by 35%, on average. The effect is larger for households that are poorer and mainly use public health care. Reimbursement of providers through a government operated scheme also reduces household OOP payments but the effect is not as well targeted on the poor. Both compensation models raise household non-medical consumption but have no impact on health-related debt. HEFs reduce the probability of primarily seeking care in the private sector.

Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2009) propose a pre-test-based approach which delivers near asymptotically efficient unit root inference both when breaks do not occur and where multiple breaks occur, provided the break magnitudes are fixed. Unfortunately, however, the fixed magnitude trend break asymptotic theory does not predict well the finite sample power functions of these tests, and power can be very low for the magnitudes of trend breaks typically observed in practice. In response to this problem we propose a unit root test that allows for multiple breaks in trend, obtained by taking the infimum of the sequence (across all candidate break points in a trimmed range) of local GLS detrended augmented Dickey-Fuller-type statistics. We show that this procedure has power that is robust to the magnitude of any trend breaks, thereby retaining good finite sample power in the presence of plausibly-sized breaks. We also demonstrate that, unlike the OLS detrended infimum tests of Zivot and Andrews (1992), these tests display no tendency to spuriously reject in the limit when fixed magnitude trend breaks occur under the unit root null.

However, the link between the physician response to performance incentives and the existing payment mechanisms is still not well understood. In this article, we study this link using the recent primary care physician payment reform in Ontario as a natural experiment and the Diabetes Management Incentive as a case study. Using a comprehensive administrative data strategy and a difference-in-differences matching strategy, we find that physicians in a blended capitation model are more responsive to the Diabetes Management Incentive than physicians in an enhanced fee-for-service model. We show that this result implies that the optimal size of P4P incentives vary negatively with the degree of supply-side cost-sharing. These results have important implications for the design of P4P programs and the cost of their implementation.

A discrete choice experiment was designed and administered to 198 young doctors. We analysed the data using several specifications of a random parameter model to account for various sources of preference heterogeneity. By modelling preference heterogeneity, we showed how sensitivity to different incentives varied in different sections of the population. In particular, doctors from rural backgrounds were more sensitive than others to a 45% salary increase and having a post near their home province, but they were less sensitive to a reduction in the number of on-call nights. On the basis of the model results, the effects of two types of interventions were simulated: introducing various incentives and modifying the population structure. The results of the simulations provide multiple elements for consideration for policy-makers interested in designing effective interventions. They also underline the interest of modelling preference heterogeneity carefully.

Research has suggested that it may be insensitive to the burdens associated with particular conditions. This study was designed to explore the feasibility of developing and valuing a disease-specific bolt-on version of the EQ-5D questionnaire for use in psoriasis. Methods: A series of steps were undertaken to develop, test, and evaluate dimensions for a psoriasis specific version of the EQ-5D questionnaire (hereafter referred to as the EQ-PSO questionnaire). Candidate dimensions were explored through a review of published literature, in-depth qualitative interviews with patients, and consultation with a clinical expert. A psychometric validation exercise was then undertaken to establish how well dimensions functioned. Two dimensions were selected for inclusion in a draft measure alongside the existing EQ-5D questionnaire dimensions: skin irritation and self-confidence. Last, a time trade-off valuation exercise was conducted with 300 members of the UK general public to derive utilities for health states described by the measure. Results: The psychometric analyses indicated that the two new candidate dimensions captured additional variance over and above the existing five dimensions. Data from the valuation exercise were analyzed by using different models. A collapsed random effects model was put forward as a parsimonious and accurate approach. Based on this model, estimated utilities ranged from 0.98 +/- 0.02 for state 1111111 to 0.03 +/- 0.29 for state 5575555. Conclusions: This study has developed the EQ-PSO questionnaire to support future psoriasis research and has informed the development of future bolt-on versions of the EQ-5D questionnaire.","[Swinburn, Paul; Lloyd, Andrew] Oxford Outcomes, Oxford, England; [Boye, K.

We compare the main probabilistic properties (strict stationarity, existence of moments, tails) of the EGARCH model, which are already known, with those of an asymmetric version of the log-GARCH. The quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of the log-GARCH parameters is shown to be strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. Similar estimation results are only available for the EGARCH (1,1) model, and under much stronger assumptions. The comparison is pursued via simulation experiments and estimation on real data.

It is not obvious how such payments affect health worker effort. On the one hand, one could argue that because informal payments resemble formal pay for performance schemes, they will incite higher effort in the health sector. On the other hand, health personnel may strategically adjust their base effort downwards to maximise patients' willingness to pay informally for extra services. To explore the relationship between informal payments and health worker effort, we use a unique data set from Tanzania with over 2000 observations on the performance of 156 health workers. Patient data on informal payments are used to assess the likelihood that a particular health worker accepts informal payment. We find that health workers who likely accept payments do not exert higher average effort. They do however have a higher variability in the effort they exert to different patients. These health workers are also less sensitive to the medical condition of the patient. A likely explanation for these findings is that health workers engage in rent seeking and lower baseline effort to induce patients to pay.

This paper examines the outcomes of 2635 workers across 24 worksites who were offered financial incentives for weight loss that took various forms, including fixed payments and forfeitable bonds. We document extremely high attrition and modest weight loss associated with the financial incentives in this program, which contrasts with the better outcomes associated with pilot programs. We conclude by offering suggestions, motivated by behavioral economics, for increasing the effectiveness of financial incentives for weight loss. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Three empirical patterns motivate this study: Leaving school in a bad economy has persistent and negative career effects, career and health outcomes are correlated, and fluctuations in contemporaneous economic conditions affect health in the short-run. I draw data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Age 40 Health Supplement. Members of my sample left school between 1976 and 1992. I find that men who left school when the school-leaving state unemployment rate was high have worse health at age 40 than otherwise similar men, while leaving school in a bad economy lowers depressive symptoms at age 40 among women. A 1 percentage point increase in the school-leaving state unemployment rate leads to a 0.5% to 18% reduction in the measured health outcomes among men and a 6% improvement in depressive symptoms among women.

J,"O'Donnell, JC",,,,"O'Donnell, John C.",,,"Personalized Medicine and the Role of Health Economics and Outcomes Research: Issues, Applications, Emerging Trends, and Future Research",VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,health economics and outcomes research; personalized medicine; stratified medicine,,"The decade since the completion of the sequencing of the human genome has witnessed significant advances in the incorporation of genomic information in diagnostic, treatment, and reimbursement practices. Indeed, as case in point, there are now several dozen commercially available genomic tests routinely applied across a wide range of disease states in predictive or prognostic applications. Moreover, many involved in the advancement of personalized medicine would view emerging approaches to stratify patients in meaningful ways beyond genomic information as a signal of the progress made. Yet despite these advances, there remains a general sense of dissatisfaction about the progress of personalized medicine in terms of its contribution to the drug development process, to the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery, and ultimately to the provision of the right treatment to the right patient at the right time Academicians, payers, and manufacturers alike are struggling not only with how to embed the new insights that personalized medicine promises but also with the fundamental issues of application in early drug development, implications for health technology assessment, new demands on traditional health economic and outcomes research methods, and implications for reimbursement and access. In fact, seemingly prosaic issues such as the definition and composition of the term personalized medicine are still unresolved. Regardless of these issues, practitioners are increasingly compelled to find practical solutions to the challenges and opportunities presented by the evolving face of personalized medicine today. Accordingly, the articles comprising this Special issue offer applied perspectives geared toward professionals and policymakers in the field grappling with developing, assessing, implementing, and reimbursing personalized medicine approaches. Starting with a framework with which to characterize personalized medicine, this Special Issue proceeds to illuminate issues related to the intersection of personalized medicine and comparative effectiveness; use of personalized medicine approaches in drug development; methodological challenges; and payer approaches to evaluation and reimbursement of pharmacodiagnostics in the United States and Europe. It concludes with a look ahead, underscoring current controversies yet to be resolved along with their implications for further research and policy. It is hoped that these articles will help inform the daily challenges faced by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) community as it collectively addresses what promises to be a new era in drug development and health care delivery.","Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Bristol-Myers Squibb,"O'Donnell, JC (通讯作者)，Bristol Myers Squibb Co, POB 4000,Rt 206 & Prov Line Rd,Mailstop J23-04, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",john.odonnell@bms.com,,,,,,,3,19,20,0,38,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,S,,,S1,S3,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.004,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CS,24034305.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325467800001,0

This concluding article uses the resulting insights to identify implications for the economic incentives for evidence generation. It argues that promoting an efficient path to personalized medicine is going to require appropriate incentives for evidence generation including: 1) a greater willingness on the part of payers to accept prices that reflect value; 2) consideration of some form of intellectual property protection (e.g., data exclusivity) for diagnostics to incentivize generation of evidence of clinical utility; 3) realistic expectations around the standards for evidence; and 4) public investment in evidence collection to complement the efforts of payers and manufacturers. It concludes that such incentives could build and maintain a balance among: 1) realistic thresholds for evidence and the need for payers to have confidence in the clinical utility of the drugs and tests they use; 2) payment for value, with prices that ensure cost-effectiveness for health systems; and 3) levels of intellectual property protection for evidence generation that provide a return for those financing research and development, while encouraging competition to produce both better and more efficient tests.","[Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Towse, A (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, 7th Floor,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England.",atowse@ohe.org,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014",,,,,,21,35,36,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,S,,,S39,S43,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.003,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CS,24034311.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325467800008,0

This study was conducted to develop a set of quality indicators (QIs) of a childhood cancer control and health care delivery system in Ontario, Canada. Methods: A systematic review and targeted gray literature search were conducted to identify potential childhood cancer QIs. A series of investigator focus group sessions followed to review all QIs identified in the literature, and to generate a provisional QI set for a childhood cancer system. QIs were evaluated by three content experts in a sequential selection process on the basis of a series of criteria to select a subset for presentation to stakeholders. Following an appraisal of the relevance of quality assessment frameworks, remaining QIs were mapped onto the Cancer System Quality Index framework. Results: The systematic review yielded few relevant childhood cancer system QIs. Overall, 120 provisional QIs were developed by the investigator group. Based on median QI rating scores, representation across the childhood cancer continuum, and feasibility of data collection, a subset of 33 QIs was selected for stakeholder consideration. Conclusions: The subset of 33 QIs developed on the basis of a systematic literature review and consensus provides the basis for the selection of a set of QIs for ongoing, standardized monitoring of various dimensions of quality in a childhood cancer system.","[Bradley, Nicole M.

We use the Shapley value to evaluate both the economic and the political power. We show that usual weighted majority voting cannot prevent political distortions from emerging in a huge mass of situations. Distortions are less severe if partners can leave the union at low cost. We propose an alternative voting method based on random assignments of voting rights. Agents are given chances to vote instead of weights. If chances are computed according to a specific formula, no political distortion occurs. As an application, we analyze the rotation voting system recently adopted by the European Central Bank. We find that this system yields an enormous amount of political distortion. Then we compute the voting chances that should be assigned to Eurozone countries in order to eliminate it.

This new treatment, however, is associated with a higher acquisition cost compared with alternatives. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of fidaxomicin or oral vancomycin for the treatment of CDIs. Methods: We performed a cost-utility analysis comparing fidaxomicin with oral vancomycin for the treatment of CDIs in the United States by creating a decision analytic model from the third-party payer perspective. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with fidaxomicin compared with oral vancomycin was $67,576/quality-adjusted life-year. A probabilistic Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis showed that fidaxomicin had an 80.2% chance of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year. Fidaxomicin remained cost-effective under all fluctuations of both fidaxomicin and oral vancomycin costs. The decision analytic model was sensitive to variations in clinical cure and recurrence rates. Secondary analyses revealed that fidaxomicin was cost-effective in patients receiving concominant antimicrobials, in patients with mild to moderate CDIs, and when compared with oral metronidazole in patients with mild to moderate disease. Fidaxomicin was dominated by oral vancomycin if CDI was caused by the NAP1/Bl/027 Clostridium difficile strain and was dominant in institutions that did not compound oral vancomycin. Conclusion: Results of our model showed that fidaxomicin may be a more cost-effective option for the treatment of CDIs when compared with oral vancomycin under most scenarios tested.","[Stranges, Paul M.] Univ Michigan, Coll Pharm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Stranges, Paul M.; Collins, Curtis D.] Univ Michigan Hlth Syst, Dept Pharm Serv, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hutton, David W.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Collins, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan Hlth Syst, Dept Pharm Serv, 1500 E Med Ctr Dr B2D321, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",cdcollin@med.umich.edu,"Stranges, Paul/ABL-3275-2022; Stranges, Paul/AAA-3164-2020","Stranges, Paul/0000-0003-3797-2762",,,,,55,62,68,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2013,16,2.0,,,,,297,304,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.11.004,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,144AC,23538181.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318910400009,0

Numerous researches showed that strenuous exercise may increase oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, exercise-induce oxidative stress had been associated with decreased physical performance, and increased muscular fatigue, tissue damage, inflammatory response. The aim of this study assessed the influence of 4-week Cordyceps militarys extract (CM) supplement intervention on oxidation stress and cytokine excretion in plasma after exhaustion exercise. And we also want to discuss the effect of exercise training and supplement on muscular antioxidant capacity. Plasma samples were taken before, immediately after exhaustion exercise, and 0.5 hour, 2 hour, and 24 hour after exercise testing. The results of MDA levels in control group and CM-5 group (5 mg/kg/day) were significantly higher after exhaustion exercise (P<0.05). However, MDA production after exhaustion exercise in high dose of Cordyceps militaris supplementation was not significantly increased. Erythrocytes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activation were seen no significant difference at any groups throughout our study.

Responsiveness (sensitivity to change) and known-group validity, however, still remained unknown. Thus, the goal of this study was to explore such psychometric properties for the SATMED-Q. Methods: We used data from a 6-month prospective study carried out in pain clinics, which included patients with chronic refractory pain of neuropathic origin who needed a change in their therapies. Sensitivity to change was assessed by comparing changes in the total and domain scores between baseline and end-of-trial visits according to patients' response criterion: pain reduction 50% or more (responder). Also, correlations between changes in pain intensity and satisfaction scores were computed. Known-groups validity was explored by comparing the degree of satisfaction between groups of different levels of pain. Results: The sample was formed with 728 subjects (57.8 years, 61.0% women). After changing their therapy, 47% of the patients were considered responders, and pain intensity was reduced by an average of 42.9% 32.4% (P < 0.001), which was significantly correlated (r = -0.524, P < 0.001) with total treatment satisfaction improvement. The total score in the SATMED-Q was significantly higher in responders than in nonresponders: 80.9 (79.6-82.3) versus 66.5 (65.0-98.0) (P < 0.001). Also, the instrument showed different scores of satisfaction according to different degrees of pain (mild, moderate, severe), F = 116.8 (P < 0.001) in the total composite score and domains. Conclusion: The SATMED-Q was sensitive to changes in patients' satisfaction with treatment. In addition, patients' different heath statuses are correlated with different levels of satisfaction with treatment.","[Rejas, Javier; Soto, Javier] Pfizer Slu, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Dept, Madrid 28108, Spain; [Ruiz, Miguel; Pardo, Antonio] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Methodol, Sch Psychol, Madrid, Spain",Pfizer; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Rejas, J (通讯作者)，Pfizer Slu, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Dept, Ave Europa,20-B,Parque Empresarial Moraleja, Madrid 28108, Spain.",javier.rejas@pfizer.com,"Ruiz, Miguel/B-9124-2011; Pardo, Antonio/C-1465-2011","Ruiz, Miguel/0000-0002-2734-2196; Pardo, Antonio/0000-0001-5421-8177","Pfizer, S.L.U","Pfizer, S.L.U(Pfizer)","The work included in this article did not receive any funding.

There are two types of players - patient and impatient - and a player's type is private information. An impatient type is incapable of cooperative play, while if both players are patient types - and this is common knowledge - then they can cooperate with a grim trigger strategy. We find that the longer that players have gone without cooperating, the lower is the probability that they will cooperate in the next period. While the probability of cooperation emerging is always positive, there is a positive probability that cooperation never occurs. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A Medicare shared savings program is established for accountable care organizations in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. However, savings created by providers cannot be distinguished from the normal (random) variation in medical claims costs, setting up a classic principalagent problem. To lessen the likelihood of paying undeserved bonuses, payers may pay bonuses only if observed savings exceed minimum levels. We study the trade-off between two types of errors in setting minimum savings requirements: paying bonuses when providers do not create savings and not paying bonuses when providers create savings.

A leading application is to exchange rate models. A key assumption of the asymptotic theory is that the discount factor approaches one as the sample size grows. The finite sample approximation implied by the asymptotic theory is quantitatively congruent with the modest departures from random walk behavior that are typically found and with imprecise estimation of a well-studied regression relating spot and forward exchange rates.

Existing models estimate morbidity, mortality, and cost solely from incidence. They do not estimate illness duration or use time as an independent cost predictor. Existing models may underestimate physician visits, hospitalizations, deaths, and associated costs. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo model to estimate illness duration, physician/emergency room visits, inpatient hospitalizations, mortality, and resultant costs for a given Salmonella incidence. Interested parties include society, third-party payers, health providers, federal, state and local governments, businesses, and individual patients and their families. The marginal approach estimates individual disease behavior for every patient, explicitly estimates disease duration and calculates separate time-dependent costs. The aggregate approach is a Markov equivalent of the existing models; it assumes average disease behavior and cost for a given morbidity/mortality. Transition probabilities were drawn from a meta-analysis of 53 Salmonella studies. Both approaches were tested using the 1993 Salmonella typhimurium outbreak in Gideon, Missouri. This protocol can be applied to estimate morbidity, mortality and cost of specific outbreaks, provide better national Salmonella burden estimates, and estimate the benefits of reducing Salmonella risk.

This paper is concerned with describing an optimal test of the Vuong (1989) and Rivers and Vuong (2002) type null hypothesis that the two models are equivalent under the given measure of fit (the ranking may vary for different measures). We adopt the generalized Neyman-Pearson optimality criterion, which focuses on the decay rates of the type I and II error probabilities under fixed non-local alternatives, and derive an optimal but practically infeasible test. Then, as an illustration, by considering the model comparison hypothesis defined by the weighted Euclidean norm of moment restrictions, we propose a feasible approximate test statistic to the optimal one and study its asymptotic properties. Local power properties, one-sided test, and comparison under the generalized empirical likelihood-based measure of fit are also investigated. A simulation study illustrates that our approximate test is more powerful than the Rivers-Vuong test. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Their article raises three fundamental (inter-related) issues for VOI methods: (1) how to make sense of the concept of uncertainty in a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) model, (2) the interpretation of heterogeneity in CEA, and (3) the relationship between data from a new study and the CEA model when there is heterogeneity. We discuss these three issues using an illustrative example meta-analysis of magnesium for myocardial infarction. Careful consideration of the relationship between existing (and future) evidence and the CEA model is required to provide practical VOI methods that can help research funders prioritise new research in the face of heterogeneity.

Periodic QOL assessments typically made on nonbleed days may not provide complete reflections of the burden on patients/families. Aim: To evaluate the impact of bleeding episodes on patients/caregivers/families and the association between monthly QOL scores and patients' average diary experiences. Methods: Frequently bleeding inhibitor patients (>= four bleeds in 3 months), or their caregivers, provided daily assessment of EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire and EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire visual analogue scale, pain (11-point Likert scale), and family anxiety/stress/activity change over 3 to 6 months. QOL scores were stratified by bleed/nonbleed days. Results: Patient QOL assessments were recorded by 37 of the 39 enrolled patients/caregivers (3771 of 3777 eligible dairy days, 472 bleed/3299 nonbleed days). Median (range) diary duration was 91 (66-180) days, with 8.2% (0%-72.2%) bleed days. Mean health scores were significantly worse on bleed days than on nonbleed days (P < 0.0001 for all): EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire index, 0.66 versus 0.82; visual analogue scale health, 69.7 versus 77.4; and pain score, 4.1 versus 1.8. Bleed days also had higher (P < 0.001) proportions of days with abnormalities in family anxiety/stress (42% vs. 30%) and family activity changes (34% vs. 21%). Conclusions: Assessing the impact of hemophilia with inhibitors on patient/family QOL typically includes periodic (likely nonbleed day) evaluations reflecting baseline abnormalities. Daily assessment, however, indicated that frequent acute bleeds impair QOL beyond patient's nonbleed day baseline. New approaches are required to assess the cumulative impact of frequent acute bleeds on patients and their families.","[Neufeld, Ellis J.; Saxena, Kapil] Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Neufeld, Ellis J.; Saxena, Kapil] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Recht, Michael] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Sabio, Hernan] Wake Forest Univ, Baptist Med Ctr, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Solem, Caitlyn T.] Pharmerit N Amer, Bethesda, MD USA; [Pickard, A.

In five of these countries, variations in cost are analysed using log-linear models. In the other five countries, negative binomial regression models are used to explore variations in LoS. We compare how well each country's diagnosis-related group (DRG) system and a set of patient-level characteristics explain these variations. The most important explanatory factors are the total number of diagnoses and procedures, although no clear effects are evident for our CABG-specific diagnostic and procedural variables. Wound infections significantly increase LoS and costs in most countries. There is no evidence that countries using larger numbers of DRGs to group CABG patients are better at explaining variations in cost or LoS. However, refinements to the construction of DRGs to group CABG patients might recognise first and subsequent CABGs or other specific surgical procedures, such as multiple valve repair.

The findings suggest that there is a large reduction in household resources associated with maternal illness, driven almost entirely by spending on health care. In spite of this loss of resources, we find that households are able to fully insure consumption against maternal ill health, although confidence intervals are unable to rule out a small effect. Households in our study area are shown to have good access to informal credit (whether it be from local money lenders or family relatives), and this appears critical in helping to smooth consumption in response to these health shocks, at least in the short term.

The model includes additive, unknown, individual-specific components and allows for spatial or other cross-sectional dependence and/or heteroscedasticity. A simple smoothed nonparametric trend estimate is shown to be dominated by an estimate which exploits availability of cross-sectional data. Asymptotically optimal bandwidth choices are justified for both estimates. Feasible optimal bandwidths, and feasible optimal trend estimates, are asymptotically justified, finite sample performance of the latter being examined in a Monte Carlo study.

Therefore, we propose a semiparametric general trimmed estimator (GTE) of truncated and censored regression, which is highly robust but relatively imprecise. To improve its performance, we also propose data-adaptive and one-step trimmed estimators. We derive the robust and asymptotic properties of all proposed estimators and show that the one-step estimators (e.g., one-step SCLS) are as robust as GTE and are asymptotically equivalent to the original estimator (e.g., SCLS). The finite-sample properties of existing and proposed estimators are studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

How to weigh future health effects has resulted in ongoing discussions. These discussions are imminently relevant for health care interventions with current costs but future benefits. Different approaches to discount health effects have been proposed. In this study, we estimated the impact of different approaches for discounting health benefits of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Methods: An HPV model was used to estimate the impact of different discounting approaches on the present value of health effects. For the constant discount approaches, we varied the discount rate for health effects ranging from 0% to 4%. Next, the impact of relevant alternative discounting approaches was estimated, including hyperbolic, proportional, stepwise, and time-shifted discounting. Results: The present value of health effects gained through HPV vaccination varied strongly when varying discount rates and approaches. The application of the current Dutch guidelines resulted in a present value of health effects that was eight or two times higher than that produced when using the proportional discounting approach or when using the internationally more common 4% discount rate for health effects, respectively. Obviously, such differences translate into large variations in corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Conclusion: The exact discount rate and approach chosen in an economic evaluation importantly impact the projected value of health benefits of HPV vaccination. Investigating alternative discounting approaches in health-economic analysis is important, especially for vaccination programs yielding health effects far into the future. Our study underlines the relevance of ongoing discussions on how and at what rates to discount.","[Westra, Tjalke A.; Daemen, Toos; Wilschut, Jan C.] Univ Groningen, Dept Med Microbiol, Mol Virol Sect, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [Brouwer, Werner B.] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Parouty, Mehraj; Rozenbaum, Mark H.; Boersma, Cornelis; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon PE2, Dept Pharm, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [Beutels, Philippe H.] Univ Antwerp, CHERMID, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Rogoza, Raina M.] Optum Insight, Market Access Reimbursement & Pricing, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Groningen; University of Antwerp; University of Groningen,"Westra, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Med Microbiol, Mol Virol Sect, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, HPC EB88,POB 30-001, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands.",t.a.westra@umcg.nl,"Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023; Beutels, Philippe/A-1919-2010","Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397; Rogoza, Raina/0000-0001-8243-0319; Beutels, Philippe/0000-0001-5034-3595; Daemen, Toos/0000-0003-0166-512X; Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; Boersma, Cornelis/0000-0002-1190-2638",Dutch ZonMw [152002008]; GlaxoSmtithKline,Dutch ZonMw; GlaxoSmtithKline,"This work benefited from the Dutch ZonMw grant 152002008.

Research design and methods: A randomized controlled trial of 387 patients with diabetes (96.5% Hispanic) with clinically significant depression followed over 18 months evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the Multifaceted Diabetes and Depression Program aimed at increasing patient exposure to evidence-based depression psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy in two public safety net clinics. Patient medical care costs and utilization were captured from Los Angeles County Department of Health Services claims records. Patient- reported outcomes included Short-Form Health Survey-12 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9-calculated depression-free days. Results: Intervention patients had significantly greater Short-Form Health Survey-12 utility improvement from baseline compared with controls over the 18-month evaluation period (4.8%; P < 0.001) and a corresponding significant improvement in depression-free days (43.0; P < 0.001). Medical cost differences were not statistically significant in ordinary least squares and log-transformed cost regressions. The average costs of the Multifaceted Diabetes and Depression Program study intervention were $515 per patient. The program's cost-effectiveness averaged $4053 per quality-adjusted life-year per MDDP recipient and was more than 90% likely to fall below $12,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Conclusions: Socioculturally adapted collaborative depression care improved utility and quality of life in predominantly low-income Hispanic patients with diabetes and was highly cost-effective.

Naturally, an unexpected surge in demand may negatively affect the quality of care and thus patient outcomes, such as in-hospital mortality. We estimate models explaining patient outcomes depending on demand, unobservable patient selection and seasonal factors, as well as patient-specific risk factors and unobservable hospital and department fixed-effects. The main message of this analysis is that hospitals are well prepared to deal with this unexpected volatility in demand, as by and large it does not negatively affect patient outcomes. Hospitals seem to deal with high unexpected workload by steering the patients' length of stay relating to their severity of illness. Elective patients are discharged earlier, while discharges of high-risk emergency patients are postponed.

However, in the short run these assumptions are likely to be violated. Therefore, CEAs might overestimate cost-effectiveness in the short run. To come up with a more precise cost-effectiveness outcome, we present a model that is able to correct the long-run incremental net benefit (INB) for short-run inefficiencies. This provides decision makers with a more realistic view of the expected efficiency gains. This model starts by determining the initial efficiency losses inflicted by inflexible resources. Then the model is made dynamic in order to adjust the efficiency losses by allowing for refilling and writing off freed capacity. Finally, the model calculates the length of the short-run time frame in which such efficiency losses exist, and a correction term with which the usual long-run INB should be adjusted to account for short-run inefficiencies. The model is applied to two cases: dialysis and digitizing a radiography department. The dialysis case shows moderate short-run efficiency losses while in the radiography case short-run efficiency losses are sufficiently large to cause a switch in cost-effectiveness from favorable to inefficient in the short run.

Even though these economies differ in their economic structure and population size, they share some similarities on issues related to health-care data. There are two main institutions that collect and manage the health-care data in these economies. In Thailand, China mainland, Taiwan, and Malaysia, the Ministry of Health is responsible through its various agencies for collecting and managing the health-care data. On the other hand, health insurance is the main institution that collects and stores health-care data in South Korea and Japan. In all economies, sharing of and access to data is an issue. The reasons for limited access to some data are privacy protection, fragmented health-care system, poor quality of routinely collected data, unclear policies and procedures to access the data, and control on the freedom on publication. The primary objective of collecting health-care data in these economies is to aid the policymakers and researchers in policy decision making as well as create an awareness on health-care issues for the general public. The usage of data in monitoring the performance of the heath system is still in the process of development. In conclusion, for the region under discussion, health-care data collection is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and health insurance agencies. Data are collected from health-care providers mainly from the public sector. Routinely collected data are supplemented by national surveys. Accessibility to the data is a major issue in most of the economies under discussion. Accurate health-care data are required mainly to support policy making and evidence-based decisions.","[Aljunid, Syed Mohamed] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur 56000, Malaysia; [Aljunid, Syed Mohamed] United Nations Univ, Int Inst Global Hlth, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Srithamrongsawat, Samrit] Hlth Insurance Syst Res Off, Monthaburi, Thailand; [Chen, Wen] Fudan Univ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Bae, Seung Jin] Hlth Insurance Review & Assessment Serv, Seoul, South Korea; [Pwu, Raoh-Fang] Ctr Drug Evaluat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Ikeda, Shunya] Int Univ Hlth & Welf, Ohtawara, Japan; [Xu, Ling] Minist Hlth, Ctr Hlth Stat & Informat, Beijing, Peoples R China",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Fudan University; International University of Health & Welfare,"Aljunid, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Med, HUKM Complex, Kuala Lumpur 56000, Malaysia.",saljunid@gmail.com,"Bae, SeungJin/J-6011-2016; Pwu, Raoh Fang/AFK-8020-2022; Aljunid, Syed Mohamed/J-6009-2014","Pwu, Raoh Fang/0000-0002-0113-6917; Aljunid, Syed Mohamed/0000-0002-0380-1335; Bae, SeungJin/0000-0002-8993-8884",,,,,33,39,42,1,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S132,S138,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.004,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265060.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000024,0

Methods: This study approached the issue in both qualitative and quantitative ways. In a qualitative study, two focus groups discussed the issues of resource allocation in health care. To facilitate the discussion, a simple ranking task and a series of pairwise choice practices were implemented. A discrete choice experiment survey questionnaire was also administered to a sample of the general population. Attributes and levels were determined through literature reviews and the results from the focus group interview. We used a random-effect probit model to assess the effects of each attribute. Results: Through the focus group interviews, we found strong public support for the principle of equal opportunity. The participants thought that the severity of disease was the most important criterion when setting priorities. The majority supported the idea that the most disadvantaged should have the highest priority even when their health gains are less than those of others. The discrete choice experiment results showed that the severity of disease, health gains, and patients' socioeconomic status significantly influence their choices, with each parameter having an expected sign. Conclusion: The results showed that Koreans support not only health maximization but also equal opportunity, fair resource allocation, and equality.","[Lim, Min Kyoung] Hlth Insurance Review & Assessment Serv, Seoul, South Korea; [Bae, Eun Young] Sangji Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Wonju, South Korea; [Choi, Sang-Eun] Korea Univ, Coll Pharm, Chungnam, South Korea; [Lee, Eui Kyung] SookMyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Clin Pharm, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Tae-Jin] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea",Sangji University; Korea University; Sookmyung Women's University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Bae, EY (通讯作者)，Sangji Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 660 Woosan Dong, Kangwon Do 220702, South Korea.",eybae@sangji.ac.kr,"Lim, Min Kyung/AAL-5271-2020","Lim, Min Kyung/0000-0002-8224-2171; Choi, Sang-Eun/0000-0003-3111-1144","Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA), Seoul","Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA), Seoul","These findings are the result of work supported by Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA), Seoul.

Methods: A microsimulation model was developed to describe the variation in course of disease between individuals. Model inputs included Thai data on disease parameters and costs while impact measures were derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis of the international literature. Fluoxetine as the cheapest antidepressant drug in Thailand was analyzed for treatment of episodes plus a 6-month continuation phase and for maintenance treatment over 5 years of follow-up. CBT was analyzed for episodic treatment and for 5-year maintenance treatment. Results are presented as cost (Thai bahts) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, compared with a do-nothing scenario. Results: The cost-effectiveness ratios of all interventions were below 1 time Thailand's gross domestic product of 110,000 bahts per capita. The uncertainty ranges around the cost-effectiveness ratios overlap: maintenance treatment with CBT 11,000 bahts per DALY (8,000-14,000); episodic treatment with CBT 23,000 bahts per DALY (10,000-36,000); episodic plus continuation drug treatment 33,000 bahts per DALY (26,000-44,000); maintenance drug treatment 38,000 bahts per DALY (30,000-48,000); and episodic drug treatment 42,000 bahts per DALY (32,000-57,000). Conclusions: CBT and generic fluoxetine are cost-effective treatment options for both episodic and maintenance treatment of major depression in Thailand. Maintenance treatment has the greatest potential of health gain.","[Prukkanone, Benjamas] Minist Publ Hlth, Galaya Rajanagarindra Inst, Dept Mental Hlth, Bangkok, Thailand; [Vos, Theo; Bertram, Melanie] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Ctr Burden Dis & Cost Effectiveness, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Lim, Stephen] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Inst Hlth Metr & Evaluat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; University of Queensland; Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Prukkanone, B (通讯作者)，23 Galaya Rajanagarindra Inst, 4th Phutthamonton Rd, Bangkok 10170, Thailand.",benjamas.prukkanone@uqconnect.edu.au,"Lim, Stephen S/B-4055-2012; Vos, Theo/HLH-2955-2023",,"Wellcome Trust, UK [071842/Z/03/Z]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [301199]","Wellcome Trust, UK(Wellcome Trust); National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia)","This work was completed as part of the Setting Priorities using Information on Cost-Effectiveness project, funded by the Wellcome Trust, UK (grant number 071842/Z/03/Z) and the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (grant number 301199).",,60,16,16,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S3,S8,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.009,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265064.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000002,0

Recently, stabilized weights were developed to reduce the influence of extreme inverse probability of treatment-weighted weights in estimating treatment effects. The objective of this research was to use adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests to examine the effect of a treatment that varies over time in an observational study. Methods: We proposed stabilized weight adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests when the treatment was time-varying over the follow-up period. We applied these new methods in examining the effect of an anti-platelet agent, clopidogrel, on subsequent events, including bleeding, myocardial infarction, and death after a drug-eluting stent was implanted into a coronary artery. In this population, clopidogrel use may change over time based on a patient's behavior (e. g., nonadherence) and physicians' recommendations (e. g., end of duration of therapy). Consequently, clopidogrel use was treated as a time-varying variable. Results: We demonstrate that 1) the sample sizes at three chosen time points are almost identical in the original and weighted datasets; and 2) the covariates between patients on and off clopidogrel were well balanced after stabilized weights were applied to the original samples. Conclusions: The stabilized weight-adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests are useful in presenting and comparing survival functions for time-varying treatments in observational studies while adjusting for known confounders.","[Xu, Stanley; Shetterly, Susan; Powers, David; Raebel, Marsha A.; Tsai, Thomas T.; Ho, P.

Little is known about the mechanisms through which this intergenerational transfer occurs. This paper explores the role of time preferences. Although time preference is likely to be heritable and correlated with health investments, its role in the intergenerational transmission of smoking has not been explored previously. This is the first paper to empirically test this. Data (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2008) from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia are used. Estimates by using a pooled probit model show that there is not a direct effect of maternal time preference, measured in terms of financial planning horizon, on the likelihood that their offspring is a smoker. However, there is an indirect effect of maternal time preference. Sons of mothers that are smokers and have a shorter planning horizon are 6% more likely to smoke than if their mother had a longer planning horizon, and daughters of mothers that smoke with a shorter planning horizon are 7% more likely to smoke themselves than if their mother had a longer planning horizon.

Governments increasingly issue air quality information to enable vulnerable groups to avoid exposure. Avoidance behaviour potentially biases estimates of the health effects of air pollutants. But avoidance behaviour imposes a cost on individuals and therefore may not be taken in all circumstances. This paper exploits panel data at the English local authority level to estimate the relationship between children's daily hospital emergency admissions for respiratory diseases and common air pollutants, while allowing for avoidance behaviour in response to air pollution warnings. A 1% increase in nitrogen dioxide or ozone concentrations increases hospital admissions by 0.1%. For the subset of asthma admissions where avoidance is less costly there is evidence of avoidance behaviour. Ignoring avoidance behaviour, however, does not result in statistically significant underestimation of the health effect of air pollution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Different algorithms convert the same HAQ score to different utility values, and could therefore lead to different cost-effectiveness results. Objective: To investigate the impact of different mapping algorithms within the same cost-effectiveness model. Methods: We rebuilt an existing economic model that had previously been used for estimating the cost-effectiveness of second-line biologics in RA. We reviewed the literature to identify algorithms that converted the HAQ score to utility and incorporated them into the model. We compared the costeffectiveness results using different algorithms, exploring the reasons behind the different results and the potential effect on reimbursement decisions. Results: We identified 24 different algorithms that estimated utility on the basis of the HAQ score, age, sex, and pain. 'The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for rituximab versus diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs varied between E18,407/qualityadjusted life year and 32,039/quality-adjusted life year, which we speculate could have changed the recommendations made by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Conclusions: Using different algorithms to convert the HAQ score to utility affects the costeffectiveness of second-line biologics for the treatment of RA Using different algorithms in economic modeling for RA could lead health technology assessment bodies to make different reimbursement decisions.","[Pennington, Becky; Davis, Sarah] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Pennington, B (通讯作者)，BresMed Hlth Solut Ltd, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.",bpennington@bresmed.co.uk,"Davis, Sarah E/A-2801-2010","Pennington, Becky/0000-0002-1002-022X; Davis, Sarah/0000-0002-6609-4287",,,,,51,24,24,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2014,17,8.0,,,,,762,771,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.11.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AX4RC,25498771.0,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346918100002,0

This paper presents a systematic review of alcohol prices and gender differences in drinking and heavy drinking by adults and young adults. Starting with a database of 578 studies of alcohol demand and other outcomes, 15 studies are reviewed of adult drinking including discussion of samples, measurement issues, econometric models, special variables, and key empirical results. A similar discussion is presented for eight studies of drinking by young adults, ages 18-26 years. Four conclusions are obtained from the review. First, adult men have less elastic demands compared with women. Second, there is little or no price response by heavy-drinking adults, regardless of gender. Third, although the sample is small, price might be important for drinking participation by young adults. Fourth, the results strongly suggest that heavy drinking by young adults, regardless of gender, is not easily dissuaded by higher prices. Policy implications, primary study limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed.

The conclusions depend on whether players interact within a fixed set (fixed matching) or they are randomly matched to play the game (random matching). The relevant long run predictions are minimal sets that are closed under same or better reply operations. Under additional assumptions in each case, the predictions boil down to Nash equilibria, ex-post equilibria or minimax regret equilibria. These three paradigms exhibit nice robustness properties in the sense that they are independent of beliefs about the exogenous uncertainty of type spaces. The results are illustrated in several applications, including second-price auctions, first-price auctions and Bertrand duopolies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Shareholders demand a profitable company while governments, nongovernmental third parties, and the public at large expect a commitment to improving health in developed and, in particular, emerging economies. Current industry commercial models are mad equate for assessing opportunities in emerging economies where disease and market data are highly limited. Objective: The purpose of this article was to define a conceptual framework and build an analytic decision-making tool to assess and enhance a company's global portfolio while balancing its business needs with broader social expectations. Methods: Through a case-study methodology, we explore the relationship between business and social parameters associated with pharmaceutical innovation in three distinct disease areas. The global burden of disease-based theoretical framework using disability-adjusted life-years provides an overview of the burden associated with particular diseases. The social return on investment is expressed as disability-adjusted life-years averted as a result of the particular pharmaceutical innovation. Simultaneously, the business return on investment captures the research and development costs and projects revenues in terms of a profitability index. Conclusions: The proposed framework can assist companies as they strive to meet the medical needs of populations around the world for decades to come.","[Daems, Rutger] Planet Strategy Grp, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Maes, Edith] Maastricht Sch Management, NL-6229 EP Maastricht, Netherlands; [Mehra, Maneesha; Carroll, Benjamin; Thomas, Adrian] Janssen Global Serv, Raritan, NJ USA",Maastricht University,"Maes, E (通讯作者)，Maastricht Sch Management, Endepolsdomein 150, NL-6229 EP Maastricht, Netherlands.",maes@msm.nl,,,"Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company","Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company","This study has been supported by Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company.

Whether and how low income-families will participate in the exchanges and in states' Medicaid programs depends crucially on the structure and amounts of the premiums they will face. I take advantage of discontinuities in the structure of Wisconsin's Medicaid program to identify the effects of premiums on enrollment for low-income families. I use a 3-year administrative panel of enrollment data to estimate these effects. I find an increase in the premium from 0 to 10 dollars per month results in 1.4 fewer months enrolled and reduces the probability of remaining enrolled for a full year by 12 percentage points, but other discrete changes in premium amounts do not affect enrollment or have a much smaller effect. I find no evidence of program enrollees intentionally decreasing labor supply in order to avoid the premiums. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the case where a sub-vector of parameters or their identified set can be estimated separately from the rest, possibly subject to a priori restrictions. Our procedure constructs the second-stage set estimator and confidence set by taking appropriate level sets of a criterion function, using a first-stage estimator to impose restrictions on the parameter of interest. We give conditions under which the two-stage set estimator is a set-valued random element that is measurable in an appropriate sense. We also establish the consistency of the two-stage set estimator.

Methods: The monetary values for ambulance emergency services were calculated for two different time factors, response time, which is the time from when a call is received by the emergency medical service call taking center until the response team arrives at the emergency scene, and operational time, which includes the time to the hospital. The study was performed in two steps. First, marginal effects of reduced fatalities and injuries for a 1-minute change in the time factors were calculated. Second, the marginal effects and the monetary values were put together to find a value per minute. Results: The values were found to be 5.5 million Thai bath/min for fatality and 326,000 baht/min for severe injury. The total monetary value for a 1-minute improvement for each dispatch, summarized over 1 year, was 1.6 billion Thai baht using response time Conclusions: The calculated values could be used in a cost-benefit analysis of an investment reducing the response time The results from similar studies could for example be compared to the cost of moving an ambulance station or investing in a new alarm system.","[Jaldell, Henrik] Karlstad Univ, Dept Econ, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Lebnak, Prachaksvich; Amornpetchsathaporn, Anurak] Emergency Med Inst Thailand, Bangkok, Thailand",Karlstad University,"Jaldell, H (通讯作者)，Karlstad Univ, Dept Econ, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",henrik.jaldell@kau.se,,"Jaldell, Henrik/0000-0002-9667-2260",Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Source of financial support: Financial support from the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs is acknowledged.,,35,12,12,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2014,17,5.0,,,,,555,560,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.05.006,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1PE,25128048.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341084700009,0

It is less clear whether the total amount of time patients waited in secondary care, from first referral to outpatient clinic until treatment, has also fallen. We used Hospital Episode Statistics inpatient data for patients undergoing total joint replacement during a period of active monitoring of targets (between 2006/7 and 2008/9) and linked it to outpatient data to reconstruct patients' pathway in the 3years before surgery and provide alternative measurements of waiting times. Our findings suggest that although official waiting times decreased drastically in our study period, total waiting time in secondary care has not declined. Patients with shorter official waits spent a longer time in a work-up' period prior to inclusion in the official waiting list, and socio-economic inequities persisted in waiting times for joint replacement. We found no evidence that target policies achieved efficiency gains during our study period.

Methods: A stepwise literature search specifically designed to identify indirect evidence was conducted to extend the original clinical review from the latest National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) VTE technology appraisal. Different network sizes or network orders, based on the successive searches, informed three network meta-analyses (NMAs), which were compared with a replicated base case. The resulting comparative estimates were inputted in an economic model to investigate the effect of network size on cost-effectiveness probabilities. Results: Searches increased the number of indirect comparisons between VTE interventions, progressively widening the relevant network of studies for NMA. Precision around mean relative treatment effects was increased as the network was extended from the base case to first-order NMA, but further extensions had limited effect Cost-effectiveness analysis results were largely insensitive to variation in clinical inputs from the different NMA orders. Conclusions: No standard methodology is currently recommended by NICE to identify the most relevant network of studies for NMA. Our study showed that optimizing the identification of studies for NMA can extend the evidence base for analysis and reduce the uncertainty in relative effectiveness estimates. Although in our example network extensions did not affect the acceptability of available treatments in VIE prevention based on cost-effectiveness results, it may in other applications.","[Dequen, Pascale; Sutton, Alex J.; Abrams, Keith R.] Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Scott, David A.] Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Oxford, England",University of Leicester,"Dequen, P (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Adrian Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",pascale.dequen@le.ac.uk,"Abrams, Keith/AAA-2557-2020","Sutton, Alexander/0000-0002-8934-9940; Scott, David Alexander/0000-0001-6475-8046; Abrams, Keith/0000-0002-7557-1567","Pfizer Ltd.; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [NF-SI-0508-10061]; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [DRF-2012-05-484] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [DRF-2012-05-484, NF-SI-0512-10159] Funding Source: researchfish",Pfizer Ltd.(Pfizer); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This study was funded by Pfizer Ltd. via an unrestricted educational grant to the University of Leicester.

Methods: Samples of 307 and 311 members of the UK general population valued 99 health states selected from a total of 3125 health states defined by each of the measures using the time trade-off technique. The article presents the results of the nonparametric model and compares it with the original model estimated using a conventional parametric random-effects model. The different methods are compared theoretically and in terms of empirical performance across the two data sets. It also reports the effect of respondent characteristics on health state valuations. Results: The nonparametric models were found to be better at predicting health state values within the estimation sample than without in terms of root mean square error and the patterns of standardized residuals. Some respondent characteristics were found to explain variation in health state values, but these did not have a significant effect on the health states values when estimates were adjusted for sample differences with the general population. Conclusions: The nonparametric Bayesian models are theoretically more appropriate than previously used parametric models and provide better utility estimates from the two condition-specific measures. Furthermore, the model is more flexible in estimating the effect of covariates.","[Kharroubi, Samer A.] Univ York, Dept Math, York YO24 3NB, N Yorkshire, England; [Brazier, John E.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Yang, Yaling] Univ Oxford, Dept Primary Care Hlth Serv, Oxford, England",University of York - UK; University of Sheffield; University of Oxford,"Kharroubi, SA (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Math, York YO24 3NB, N Yorkshire, England.",samer.kharroubi@york.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Kharroubi, Samer/AAQ-4583-2020","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",University of Sheffield; Medical Research Council Health Service Research Collaboration,University of Sheffield; Medical Research Council Health Service Research Collaboration(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"During the study, Yaling Yang was funded by a PhD studentship of the University of Sheffield.

We prove that any such rule is a weighted multicameral rule: a policy is collectively approved at a given level if and only if it is approved by a minimal number of chambers the dimension of the rule where each chamber evaluates a different aspect of the policy using a weighted rule, with each evaluator's weight or authority possibly varying across chambers depending on his area(s) of expertise. These results imply that a given rule is only suitable for evaluating finite-dimensional policies whose dimension corresponds to that of the rule, and they provide a rationale for using different rules to pass different policies even within the same organization. We further introduce the concept of compatibility with a rule and exploit its topological properties to propose a method to construct integer weights corresponding to evaluators' possible judgments under a given rule, which are more intuitive and easier to interpret for policymakers. Our findings shed light on multicameralism in political institutions and multi-criteria group decision-making in the firm. We provide applications to peer review politics, rating systems, and real-world organizations. (C) 2014 The Authors.

However, the length of recall period in self-reported health care questions varies between surveys, and this variation may affect the results of the studies. This study uses a large survey experiment to examine the role of the length of recall periods for the quality of self-reported hospitalization data by comparing registered with self-reported hospitalizations of respondents exposed to recall periods of one, three, six, or twelve months. Our findings have conflicting implications for survey design, as the preferred length of recall period depends on the objective of the analysis. For an aggregated measure of hospitalization, longer recall periods are preferred. For analysis oriented more to the micro-level, shorter recall periods may be considered since the association between individual characteristics (e.g., education) and recall error increases with the length of the recall period.

A frequent challenge when implementing metrics for BRA is to weigh the importance of effects on a chronic condition against the risk of severe events during the trial. The lifetime component of the QALY model has a counterpart in the BRA context, namely, the risk of dying during the study. Methods: A new concept is presented, the hazard of death function that a subject is willing to accept instead of the baseline hazard to improve his or her chronic health status, which we have called the quality-of-life-adjusted hazard of death. Results: It has been proven that if assumptions of the linear QALY model hold, the excess mortality rate tolerated by a subject for a chronic health improvement is inversely proportional to the mean residual life. Conclusions: This result leads to a new representation of the linear QALY model in terms of hazard rate functions and allows utilities obtained by using standard methods involving trade-offs of life duration to be translated into thresholds of tolerated mortality risk during a short period of time, thereby avoiding direct trade-offs using small probabilities of events during the study, which is known to lead to bias and variability.","[Garcia-Hernandez, Alberto] Astellas Pharma Global Dev Europe, Leiden, Netherlands",Astellas Pharmaceuticals,"Garcia-Hernandez, A (通讯作者)，Astellas Pharma Europe BV, Global Data Sci, Sylviusweg 62, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands.",alberto.garciahernandez@astellas.com,"Garcia-Hernandez, Alberto/Z-3174-2019","Garcia-Hernandez, Alberto/0000-0001-5265-8160",,,,,25,2,2,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2014,17,2.0,,,,,275,279,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.11.013,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AD6EB,24636387.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333346600016,0

The theory is based on the notion of strictly nested sets in a set system. For each maximal strictly nested set, we define a unique marginal contribution vector. Using these marginal contribution vectors several solutions concepts are introduced. The gravity center or GC-solution of a game is defined as the average of the marginal vectors over all maximal strictly nested sets. For union stable set systems, buildings sets, the GC-solution differs from Myerson-type solutions. The half-space or HS-solution is defined as the average of the marginal vectors over the class of so-called half-space nested sets and is appropriate for example when feasible coalitions represent social networks. The normal tree or NT-solution is defined as the average of the marginal vectors over all so-called NT-nested sets and is appropriate when feasibility of a coalition is based on bilateral communication between players. For graphical building sets, the NT-solution is equal to the average tree solution. We also study core stability of the solutions and show that the conditions under which the HS- and NT-solutions belong to the core are weaker than conditions under which the GC-solution is stable. For a more general set system, there exists a unique minimal building set containing the set system, its building covering. As solutions for games on an arbitrary set system of feasible coalitions we propose to take the solutions for its building covering with respect to the M-extension of the characteristic function of the game.

Optimal wage schemes in such context are largely discriminatory, but we show that the extent of the discrimination crucially depends on the existence of moral hazard. More precisely, for teams with a flat structure, the domain of production technologies giving rise to discrimination is broader when agents' actions are observable and contractible. For teams with a sequential structure, the result reverses and the domain of production technologies giving rise to discrimination is broader when there exists moral hazard. Finally, in more cooperative environments in which agents are allowed to collude, optimality does not entail discrimination, with or without moral hazard. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We also develop methods for estimating and evaluating, using price data alone, a general encompassing model for volatility dynamics where volatility activity is unrestricted. The nonparametric application to VIX data, along with model estimation for S&P index returns, suggests that volatility moves are best captured by an infinite variation pure-jump martingale with a symmetric jump compensator around zero.

However, not much is known about inequalities in health capital accumulation in the womb in response to fetal health shocks, which is essential for finding the earliest sensitive periods for interventions to reduce inequalities. We identify inequalities in birth weight accumulation as a result of fetal health shocks from the occurrence of one of the most common birth defects, oral clefts, within the first 9weeks of pregnancy, using quantile regression and two datasets from South America and the USA. Infants born at lower birth weight quantiles are significantly more adversely affected by the health shock compared with those born at higher birth weight quantiles, with overall comparable results between the South American and US samples. These results suggest that fetal health shocks increase child health disparities by widening the spread of the birth weight distribution and that health inequalities begin in the womb, requiring interventions before pregnancy.

Here, we present a framework for economic policy analysis that provides a novel integration of several fundamental concepts at the heart of Granger's contributions to time-series analysis. We work with a dynamic structural system analyzed by White and Lu (2010) with well defined causal meaning; under suitable conditional exogeneity restrictions, Granger causality coincides with this structural notion. The system contains target and control subsystems, with possibly integrated or cointegrated behavior. We ensure the invariance of the target subsystem to policy interventions using an explicitly causal partial equilibrium recursivity condition. Policy effectiveness is ensured by another explicit causality condition. These properties only involve the data generating process; models play a subsidiary role. Our framework thus complements that of Ericsson et al. (1998) (EHM) by providing conditions for policy analysis alternative to weak, strong, and superexogeneity. This makes possible policy analysis for systems that may fail EHM's conditions. It also facilitates analysis of the cointegrating properties of systems subject to policymaker control. We discuss a variety of practical procedures useful for analyzing such systems and illustrate with an application to a simple model of the US macroeconomy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: PRO label claims granted for new molecular entities and biologic license applications from 2006 through 2010 were reviewed to evaluate consistencies and discrepancies in PRO label claims granted by the FDA and the EMA and to highlight trends in the acceptance of PRO claims across agencies. Methods: Products approved by both the FDA and the EMA were identified. By using US Drug Approval Packages and European Public Assessment Reports packages, any PRO label claims made for the same product by the same company were compared. Results: Both agencies approved a total of 75 products. Of these, 35 (47%) had at least one EMA-granted PRO label claim compared with 14 (19%) by the FDA. Most FDA-grated claims focused on symptoms; however, EMA-granted claims were more likely to include higher order concepts. Few (similar to 12%) were granted the same label claims. Despite this discordance between the two agencies, where PRO label claims were granted by both the FDA and the EMA, there was similarity in the type of label claim. Conclusions: The EMA is more likely than the FDA to grant PRO claims and for higher order constructs. On a macro level, there appears to be poor concordance between claims granted by both agencies. On close examination, however, there appears to be greater concordance than previously recognized, which may be instructive in formulating future PRO strategies. Further research to create strategic alignment across agencies may be beneficial.","[DeMuro, Carla; Clark, Marci; Doward, Lynda; Evans, Emily; Mordin, Margaret] RTI Hlth Solut, Patient Reported Outcomes, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Gnanasakthy, Ari] Novartis Pharmaceut, Patient Reported Outcomes, E Hanover, NJ USA",Research Triangle Institute; Novartis,"DeMuro, C (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",demuromercon@rti.org,"Doward, Lynda/IXD-2462-2023","Doward, Lynda/0000-0002-6236-469X; Romano, Carla/0000-0002-5528-5037; Mordin, Margaret/0000-0002-6048-0275; Gnanasakthy, Ari/0000-0001-9176-3983",Novartis Pharmaceuticals,Novartis Pharmaceuticals(Novartis),This study was supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.,,11,60,61,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2013,16,8.0,,,,,1150,1155,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.08.2293,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,274XV,24326168.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328640400005,0

The objectives of this study were to investigate the cost-effectiveness of adding mifamurtide to standard three- or four-agent chemotherapy for high-grade, resectable, nonmetastatic osteosarcoma following surgical resection and the issues of obtaining robust cost-effectiveness estimates for ultra-orphan drugs, given the shortage of data. Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of the UK's National Health Service as part of the manufacturer's submission to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The disease process was simplified to a transition through a series of health states, modeled by using a Markov approach. Data to inform the model were derived from patient-level data of Study INT-0133, published literature, and expert opinion. the final efficacy measure was life-years gained (LYG), and utilities were used to obtain quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: For a 60-year time frame and a discount rate of 3.5% for outcomes, patients receiving mifamurtide benefited from an average additional 1.57 years of life and 1.34 QALYs, compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 58,737 per LYG and 68,734 per QALY. Because treatment effects were both substantial in restoring health and sustained over a very long period, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence changed its guidance to allow a discount of 1.5% for outcomes to be applied in these special circumstances. By using this discount factor, it was found that patients receiving mifamurtide had an average additional 2.58 years of life and 2.20 QALYs compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone, resulting in an ICER of 35,765 per LYG and 41,933 per QALY. Conclusion: Mifamurtide's ICER is cost-effective compared with that of other orphan and ultra-orphan drugs, for which prices and corresponding cost-effectiveness estimates are high.","[Johal, Sukhvinder; Knight, Christopher] RTI Hlth Soult, Veloc House Business & Conference Ctr, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Ralston, Stephen] Takeda Global Res & Dev Ctr Europe Ltd, London, England",Research Triangle Institute; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Development Centre Europe Ltd.,"Knight, C (通讯作者)，BresMed Hlth Solut, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.",cjknight1001@gmail.com,,"Knight, Christopher/0000-0001-6428-0505",Takeda Global Research & Development Centre (Europe) Ltd.,Takeda Global Research & Development Centre (Europe) Ltd.,"This study was funded by Takeda Global Research & Development Centre (Europe) Ltd.

The method is based on the use of a kernel-smoothed likelihood function which provides an explicit solution for the maximization problem for the unknown density function without losing information in the asymptotic limit. We consider both standard stratified sampling and variable probability sampling, and allow for the population shares of the strata to be either unknown or known a priori. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We present a simple method of computing the matrix corresponding to the Hasse diagram and prove its correctness. This methodology is applied to analyze the hierarchy of countries that have won at least one Olympic medal. Four different definitions of dominance are given, leading to four different hierarchies and Hasse diagrams. We also prove that any of these definitions preserve any ordering based on giving different weights to gold, silver, and bronze medals. We study dominance between adjacent strata and note how the system changes with time. We present a case analysis for Poland as an illustration of the set of data that can be computed for any country.

Results show both the probability of having unsecured debt and the amount of debt increase after an adverse health event among households with low financial assets, who are uninsured, or who have less generous health insurance. The effect of health problems on borrowing is caused by both medical expenditures and disruptions to the income stream.

Neither differentiability nor continuity is required of such sets, which include: level sets of utility functions, quasi-indifference classes associated with a preference relation not given by a utility function, mean-variance frontiers, production possibility frontiers, and Pareto efficient sets. By Lebesgue's density theorem, efficient sets have p-dimensional measure zero. As Lebesgue measure provides an imprecise description of small sets, we then prove the stronger result that each efficient set in RP has Hausdorff dimension at most p - 1. This may exceed its topological dimension, with the two notions becoming equivalent for smooth sets. We apply these results to stable sets in multi-good pillage games: for n agents and m goods, stable sets have dimension at most m (n-1) 1. This implies, and is much stronger than, the result that stable sets have m (n 1)-dimensional measure zero, as conjectured by Jordan. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To be specific, I show that the set of SP equilibria can be determined by a finite number of systems of linear inequalities, which are efficiently solvable when there are two players. This is more or less surprising because the Hart and Mas-Colell bargaining model and the SP equilibrium both seem to be rather complicated, and it is well known that an arbitrary Nash equilibrium is hard to compute, even when there are only two players. Using this algorithm, it is shown that players of Prisoners' Dilemma can cooperate to some extent in the Hart and Mas-Colell bargaining, and full cooperation is attainable as rho, a parameter of this model, approaches to 1.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of treatment with BOG in previously treated patients with chronic hepatitis C in the United States using treatment-related data from RESPOND-2 and PROVIDE studies. Methods: We developed a Markov cohort model to project the burden of HCV disease, lifetime costs, and quality-adjusted life-years associated with PR and two BOG based therapies response-guided therapy (BOC/RGT) and fixed duration therapy for 48 weeks (BOC/PR48). We estimated treatment-related inputs (efficacy, adverse events, and discontinuations) from clinical trials and obtained disease progression rates, costs, and quality-of-life data from published studies. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for BOG-based regimens as studied in RESPOND 2, as well as by patient's prior response to treatment and the IL-28B genotype. Results: BOG-based regimens were projected to reduce the lifetime incidence of liver-related complications by 43% to 53% in comparison with treatment with PR. The ICER of BOG/RGT in comparison with that of PR was $30,200, and the ICER of BOC/PR48 in comparison with that of BOC/RGT was $91,500. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000, the probabilities of BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 being the preferred option were 0.74 and 0.25, respectively. Conclusions: In patients previously treated for chronic HCV genotype-1 infection, BOG was projected to increase quality-adjusted life-years and reduce the lifetime incidence of liver complications. In addition, BOG-based therapies were projected to be cost-effective in comparison with PR alone at commonly used willingness-to-pay thresholds.","[Chhatwal, Jagpreet] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Chhatwal, Jagpreet; Ferrante, Shannon A.; Brass, Cliff; El Khoury, Antoine C.; Burroughs, Margaret; Elbasha, Elamin H.] Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, Whitehouse Stn, NJ USA; [Brass, Cliff] Novartis, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Bacon, Bruce] St Louis Univ, Sch Med, St Louis, MO USA; [Esteban-Mur, Rafael] Valle Hebron Hosp, Serv Med Interna Hepatol, Barcelona, Spain",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Merck & Company; Novartis; Saint Louis University; Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron,"Chhatwal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, 130 De Soto St,Crabtree Hall A647, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",chhatwal@pitt.edu,"Ferrante, Shannon Allen/AAI-2766-2021","esteban, rafael/0000-0001-5280-392X","National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [KL2TR000146]; Merck Sharp Dohme Corp.; Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ","National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)); Merck Sharp Dohme Corp.(Merck & Company); Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ(Merck & Company)","Source of financial support: Dr. Chhatwal's effort was in parts supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under award number KL2TR000146.

Ken; Mladsi, Deirdre",,,The Faces of Personalized Medicine: A Framework for Understanding Its Meaning and Scope,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,companion diagnostic; diagnostic test; individualized medicine; personalized medicine; pharmacogenetics; stratified medicine,COST-EFFECTIVENESS,"The objective of this article was to provide a framework for understanding the different definitions of the term personalized medicine. The term personalized medicine is used regularly but interpreted in different ways. This article approaches the term by starting with a broad view of clinical medicine, where three components can be distinguished: the questions (e.g., what is the diagnosis?), the methods used to answer them (e.g., a test), and the available actions (e.g., to give or not give a particular drug). Existing definitions of personalized medicine disagree about which questions, methods, and actions fall within its domain. Some define the term narrowly, referring to the use of a diagnostic test to predict drug response, thereby clarifying whether or not a patient will benefit from that drug. An example of this combination is the HER2/neu test to predict the effectiveness of trastuzumab in breast cancer. Many who adopt this definition associate the concept of personalized medicine with fields such as genetics, genomics, and other types of -omics. In contrast, others view personalized medicine as a concept that has always existed, because medicine has always considered the needs of the individual. One definition of personalized medicine that accommodates both interpretations is the use of combined knowledge (genetic or otherwise) about a person to predict disease susceptibility, disease prognosis, or treatment response and thereby improve that person's health. This predictive ability can increase over time through innovations in various technologies, resulting in further improvements in health outcomes. Moreover, these developments can lead to a better understanding of the underlying causes of disease, which can eventually lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of individual patients. In that sense, a truly personalized form of medicine can also be seen as an ideal, a goal that will be achieved only after multiple advances in science. Although the term personalized medicine was rechristened somewhat recently, our ability to personalize medicine will continue to advance in unimaginable ways as we come to learn more about the heterogeneity that exists among individuals and diseases.","[Redekop, W.

Methods: National pharmacoeconomic guidelines were obtained through the ISPOR Web site. Guidance was extracted by using a developed data extraction sheet. Extracted data were divided into subcategories on the basis of consensus meetings. Results: Of the 26 included guidelines, 20 (77%) advised to identify patient heterogeneity. Most guidelines (77%) provided general methodological advice to acknowledge patient heterogeneity, including justifications for distinguishing subgroups (65%), prespecification of subgroups (42%), or methodology to acknowledge patient heterogeneity (77%). Stratified analysis of cost-effectiveness was most commonly advised (20 guidelines; 77%); however, guidance on the specific application of methods was scarce (9 guidelines; 34%) and generally limited if provided. Guidance to present patient heterogeneity was provided by 15 guidelines (58%), most prominently to describe the definition (31%) and justification (31%) of subgroups. Conclusions: The majority of national pharmacoeconomic guidelines provide guidance on acknowledging patient heterogeneity in economic evaluations. However, because guidance is mostly not specific, its usefulness is limited. This may reflect that the importance of acknowledging patient heterogeneity is usually recognized while there is a lack of consensus on specific methods to acknowledge patient heterogeneity. We advise the further development of national pharmacoeconomic guidelines to provide specific guidance on the identification of patient heterogeneity, methods to acknowledge it, and presenting the results. We present a checklist that can assist in formulating these recommendations. This could facilitate the systematic and transparent handling of patient heterogeneity in economic evaluations worldwide.","[Ramaekers, Bram L.

Although item-level concepts are considered fundamental elements, the field lacks structures for evaluating and organizing them for decision making. This article proposes a grammar using item stems, response options, and recall periods to systematically identify item-level concepts. The grammar uses core concept, evaluative component, and recall period as intuitive terms for communicating with stakeholders. Better characterization of concepts is necessary for classifying instrument content and linking it to treatment benefit. Methods: Items in 2 generic and 21 disease-specific instruments were evaluated to develop and illustrate the use of the grammar. Concepts were assigned International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health codes for exploring the value that the grammar and a classification system add to the understanding of content across instruments. Results: The 23 instruments include many core concepts; emotional function is the only concept assessed in all instruments. Concepts in disease-specific instruments show obvious patterns; for example, arthritis instruments focus on physical function. The majority of instruments used the same response options across all items, with five-point scales being the most common. Most instruments used one recall period for all items. Shorter recall periods were used for conditions associated with flares, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and skin disease. Every diagnosis, however, showed variation across instruments in the recall period used. Conclusions: This analysis indicates the proposed grammar's potential for discerning the conceptual content within and between health outcomes instruments and illustrates its value for improving communication between stakeholders and for making decisions related to treatment benefit.","[Erickson, Pennifer] OLGA, State Coll, PA USA; [Willke, Richard J.] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA",Pfizer,"Erickson, P (通讯作者)，OLGA On Line Guide Qual Of Life Assessment, 1316 Deerfield Dr, State Coll, PA 16803 USA.",pae6@psu.edu,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,554,563,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.01.008,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796289.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900014,0

A series of retirement policy changes in Norway reduced the retirement age for a group of workers but not for others. Difference-in-differences estimation based on monthly birth cohorts and treatment group status show that the early retirement programme significantly reduced the retirement age; this holds true also when we account for programme substitution, for example into the disability pension. Instrumental variables estimation results show no effect on mortality of retirement age; neither do estimation results from a hazard rate model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, I first extend it by getting a representation of beliefs such that the probabilistic beliefs over each ambiguous event are represented by a nondegenerate interval, while the ones over each unambiguous event are represented by a number. I then suggest a behavioral definition of ambiguity. It provides a choice theoretical foundation for the Knightian distinction between ambiguity and unambiguity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A fundamental question about public reporting is whether it causes providers to select healthier patients for treatment. In the nursing home post-acute setting, where patients must achieve a minimum length of stay to be included in quality measures, selection may take the form of discharge from the nursing home using rehospitalization, a particularly costly and undesirable outcome. We study the population of post-acute patients of skilled nursing facilities nationwide during 1999-2005 to assess whether selective rehospitalization occurred when public reporting was instituted in 2002, using multiple quasi-experimental designs to identify effects. We find that after public reporting was implemented, rehospitalizations before the length-of-stay cutoff increased. We conclude that nursing homes rehospitalize higher-risk postacute patients to improve scores, providing evidence for selection behavior on the part of nursing home providers in the presence of public reporting.

We propose a generalized necessary and sufficient functional form for a class of non-metric distance measures of the Bregman type which ensure consistency of the ordering when the target is observed with noise.

First, we find that the main determinants of VPHI are different in each country, reflecting differences in the underlying healthcare systems, but in most countries, education levels and cognitive abilities have a strong positive effect on holding a VPHI policy. We also analyse the effect of holding a voluntary additional health insurance policy on out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare spending. We adopt a simultaneous equations approach to control for self-selection into VPHI policy holding and find that, only in the Netherlands, VPHI policyholders have lower OOP spending than the rest of the population, whereas in some countries (Italy, Spain, Denmark and Austria), they spend significantly more. This could be due to not only increased utilisation but also cost-sharing measures adopted by the insurers to counter the effects of moral hazard and to keep adverse selection under control.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of GEP TOO testing versus usual care was conducted from a US third-party payer perspective. Methods: Data on recommendation changes for chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, blood tests, imaging investigations, and hospice care were obtained from a retrospective, observational study of patients whose physicians received GEP TOO test results. The effects of chemotherapy recommendation changes on survival were based on the results of trials cited in National Comprehensive Cancer Network and UpToDate guidelines. Drug and administration costs were based on average doses reported in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Other unit costs came from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee schedules. Quality-of-life weights were obtained from literature. Bootstrap analysis estimated sample variability; probabilistic sensitivity analysis addressed parameter uncertainty. Results: Chemotherapy regimen recommendations consistent with guidelines for final tumor-site diagnoses increased significantly from 42% to 65% (net difference 23%; P < 0.001). Projected overall survival increased from 15.9 to 19.5 months (mean difference 3.6 months; two-sided 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2-3.9). The average increase in quality-adjusted life-months was 2.7 months (95% CI 1.5-4.3), and average third-party payer costs per patient increased by $10,360 (95% CI $2,982-$19,192). The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $46,858 (95% CI $13,351-$104,269). Conclusions: GEP TOO testing significantly altered clinical practice patterns and is projected to increase overall survival, quality-adjusted life-years, and costs, resulting in an expected cost per quality-adjusted life-year of less than $50,000.","[Hornberger, John; Degtiar, Irina; Gutierrez, Hialy; Shewade, Ashwini] Cedar Associates LLc, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Hornberger, John] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Henner, W.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce a local dependence measure that gives a precise mathematical description and interpretation of such phenomena. We propose a new local dependence measure, a local correlation function, based on approximating a bivariate density locally by a family of bivariate Gaussian densities using local likelihood. At each point the correlation coefficient of the approximating Gaussian distribution is taken as the local correlation. Existence, uniqueness and limit results are established. A number of properties of the local Gaussian correlation and its estimate are given, along with examples from both simulated and real data. This new method of modelling carries with it the prospect of being able to do locally for a general density what can be done globally for the Gaussian density. In a sense it extends Gaussian analysis from a linear to a non-linear environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Prior studies have almost exclusively relied on making connections between national or market-level advertising volume/expenditures and national or individual-level usage of medications. This is the first study to: estimate the impact of individual-level exposure to DTCA on individual-level use of antidepressants; estimate the impact of individual-level exposure to television DTCA on individual-level use in any drug class: consider the relative and interactive impact of DTCA in two different media in any drug class; and, consider the heterogeneity of impact among different populations in an econometric framework in the antidepressant market. There are also important limitations to note. Unlike prior market level studies that use monthly data, we are limited to aggregated annual data. Our measures of potential advertising exposure are constructed assuming that media consumption patterns are stable during the year. We are also not able to study the impact of advertising on use of antidepressants for conditions other than depression, such as anxiety disorders. We find that: DTCA impacts antidepressant use in a statistically and economically significant manner; that these effects are present in both television and magazine advertising exposure but do not appear to have interactive effects; are stronger for women than for men in the magazine medium, but are about equally strong for men and women in the TV medium; and, are somewhat stronger for groups suffering from more severe forms of depression. The overall size of the effect is a 6-10 percentage point increase in antidepressant use from being exposed to television advertising; the corresponding magazine effects are between 3 and 4 percentage points.

This literature, however, ignores the possibility that the effect could vary throughout the BMI distribution or across socioeconomic and demographic groups due to differences in underlying obesity risks or preferences for health. We evaluate heterogeneity in the long-run impact of cigarette price on BMI by performing quantile regressions and stratifying the sample by race, education, age, and sex. Cigarette price has a highly heterogeneous negative effect that is more than three times as strong at high BMI levels - where weight loss is most beneficial for health - than at low levels. The effects are also strongest for blacks, college graduates, middle-aged adults, and women. We also assess the implications for disparities, conduct robustness checks, and evaluate potential mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

An increasing type of health insurance in Vietnam is voluntary health insurance. Although there are many studies on the implementation of voluntary health insurance in Vietnam, little is known on the causal impact of voluntary health insurance. This paper measures the impact of voluntary health insurance on health care utilization and out-of-pocket payments using Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys in 2004 and 2006. It was found out that voluntary health insurance helps the insured people increase the annual outpatient and inpatient visits by around 45% and 70%, respectively. However, the effect of voluntary health insurance on out-of-pocket expenses on health care services is not statistically significant.

This paper investigates factors that explain differences in resource use for appendectomy. We analysed 106 929 appendectomy patients treated in 939 hospitals in 10 European countries. In stage 1, we tested the performance of three models in explaining variation in the (log of) cost of the inpatient stay (seven countries) or length of stay (three countries). The first model used only the diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) to which patients were coded, the second model used a core set of general patient-level and appendectomy-specific variables, and the third model combined both sets of variables. In stage two, we investigated hospital-level variation. In classifying appendectomy patients, most DRG systems take account of complex diagnoses and comorbidities but use different numbers of DRGs (range: 2 to 8). The capacity of DRGs and patient-level variables to explain patient-level cost variation ranges from 34% in Spain to over 60% in England and France.

It is the most common method for treating symptomatic gallstones. Despite the existence of well-established treatment guidelines, the rate of cholecystectomy varies widely across Europe. We analyse patients in 10 countries that had undergone surgery for the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. We test the performance of three models in explaining variation in the (log of) cost of the inpatient stay (seven countries) or length of stay (three countries). The first model includes only the diagnosis-related group (DRG) variables to which cholecystectomy patients were coded (MD), the second uses a core set of patient characteristics and episode-specific explanatory variables (MP), and finally, the third model combines both sets of variables (MF). Countries vary both in the number of DRGs used to classify cholecystectomy patients (range: 28), and in the percentage of patients covered by a single DRG (range: 50%92%). The ability of combining both DRGs and patient level variables to explain cost variation among patients ranges from 58% in Spain to over 81% in Finland. The comparison of models' performance suggests that incorporating relevant patient characteristics may significantly improve DRG systems.

Methods: We analyzed data from 75 couples in the Family and Cancer Therapy Selection study. Paired patients and family members were independently asked about their willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical new treatment that cures prostate cancer without side effects if they could reconsider their treatment decision by indicating the maximum amount they would be willing to pay given 11 separate bids ranging from $0 to $1500 per month. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted for patients and family members controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and health status; Spearman correlations were also examined. Results: Among 75 couples analyzed, the income-adjusted mean WTP estimates per month were $400.8 (standard error [SE] $54.3) for patients and $650.2 (SE 72.2) for family members. The WTP between patients and family members was correlated (Pearson rho 0.30; P = 0.01). After adjusting for covariates, the adjusted mean WTP per month was $588.1 (SE 65.77) for patients and $819.4 (SE 74.33) for family members. Wanting to avoid side effects at baseline predicted higher WTP for patients (P = 0.010). Experiencing sexual side effects was predictive of higher WTP for family members (P = 0.047). Conclusions: Fairly high WTP amounts for a hypothetical treatment without side effects suggests that patients and their partners are experiencing important burdens 1 year after treatment. The higher amounts partners are willing to pay and the correlation with sexual side effects suggest that they are perceptive of significant treatment burdens.","[Li, Chunyu; Hall, Ingrid J.; Smith, Judith Lee; Ekwueme, Donatus U.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Canc Prevent & Control, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA; [Zeliadt, Steven B.; Moinpour, Carol M.; Ramsey, Scott D.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Publ Hlth Serv Div, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Zeliadt, Steven B.] VA Puget Sound Hlth Care Syst, Hlth Serv Res & Dev Ctr Excellence, Seattle, WA USA; [Penson, David F.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Vanderbilt Inst Med & Publ Hlth, Nashville, TN USA; [Thompson, Ian M.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Urol, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Keane, Thomas E.] Med Univ S Carolina, Urol Serv, Charleston, SC 29425 USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Vet Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System; Vanderbilt University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio; Medical University of South Carolina,"Li, CY (通讯作者)，Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Canc Prevent & Control, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, 4770 Buford Highway NE,MS K-55, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA.",Cli11@cdc.gov,,"Thompson, Ian/0000-0003-0833-952X; Lee Smith, Judith/0000-0001-9479-4152; Penson, David/0000-0002-2580-2697","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Prevention Research Centers Program, through the University of Washington Health Promotion Research Center [SIP 25-04 1-U48-DP-000050]","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Prevention Research Centers Program, through the University of Washington Health Promotion Research Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA)","This study was supported by Cooperative Agreement Number SIP 25-04 1-U48-DP-000050 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Prevention Research Centers Program, through the University of Washington Health Promotion Research Center.

Instead, its asymptotic properties rely on assuming only that these distributions satisfy an invertibility condition, and that the underlying equilibrium selection mechanism is degenerate. Our methodology relies on a pairwise-differencing procedure which, unlike Aradillas-Lopez (2010), does not require computing the equilibria of the game. Furthermore, if normal-form payoffs are linear in the parameters of interest, our procedure results in an estimator with a closed-form expression. We contribute to the pairwise-differencing econometric literature by introducing the first model, where both the control variables being matched and the regressors in the index function parameterized by theta contain nonparametric functions. In particular, the asymptotic theory developed in Aradillas-Lopez et al. (2007) does not cover this setting. We describe conditions under which nonparametrically estimated plug-ins yield root N-consistent and asymptotically normal estimator for the parameter of interest. A consistent specification test based on semiparametric residuals is also developed. It appears to be the first test of this type for a model involving nonparametric or generated regressors. Several extensions of our method are also discussed. A series of Monte Carlo experiments are used to investigate the properties of our estimator and our specification test. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The sample consisted of 2359 subjects identified from primary care settings, with 1193 having a confirmed diagnosis of depression. Data came from six countries (Australia, Brazil, Israel, Russia, Spain, and the United States) involved in a large international study, the Longitudinal Investigation of Depression Outcomes. The structure of the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index follows that of the WHOQOL-BREF assessment. Internal consistency was measured by using Cronbach's alpha. Convergent validity was assessed by using correlations with different measures for mental health (Symptom Checklist 90), physical health (self-evaluation), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF and short form 36 health survey). Discriminant group validity was assessed between diagnosed depressed and nondepressed patients. Differential item functioning and unidimensionality were analyzed by using Rasch analysis. Factor structure was assessed with structural equation modeling analyses. Results: Internal consistency was acceptable (ranged between 0.72 and 0.81 across countries), and the index discriminated well between depression (t = 6.31-20.33; P < 0.001) across all countries. Correlations between the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index and different measures-Symptom Checklist 90 (r = -0.42), physical health (r = -0.42), WHOQOL-BREF domains (r = 0.61-0.77), and short form 36 health survey (r = 0.58)-were all significant (P < 0.001). The index is unidimensional with desired item fit statistics. Two items (daily living activities and enough money to meet your needs) had residuals exceeding 4. Differential item functioning was observed with general quality of life, general health, relationships, and home items for age. A common one-factor structure with acceptable fit was identified in three out of six countries (comparative fit index = 0.85, root mean square error of approximation = 0.11). Conclusions: The EUROHISQOL 8-item index showed acceptable cross-cultural performance and a satisfactory discriminant validity and would be a useful measure to include in studies to assess treatment effectiveness.","[da Rocha, Neusa Sica; Fleck, Marcelo P.] Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Grad Program Med Sci Psychiat UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Fleck, Marcelo P.] Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Dept Psychiat & Legal Med, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Power, Mick J.] Univ Edinburgh, Sect Hlth & Clin Psychol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"da Rocha, NS (通讯作者)，Psychiat Serv, Ave Ramiro Barcelos,2350 4 Andar, BR-90003035 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",neusa-rocha@via-rs.net,"Fleck, Marcelo P/B-6706-2009; da Rocha, Neusa Sica/U-8296-2019","da Rocha, Neusa Sica/0000-0002-7260-3033; Power, Michael/0000-0001-9481-9225",FIPE-HCPA (Brazil); CNPQ (Brazil),FIPE-HCPA (Brazil); CNPQ (Brazil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This study was partially funded by FIPE-HCPA (Brazil), CNPQ (Brazil).",,56,152,160,0,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2012,15,3.0,,,,,449,457,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.035,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,941CN,22583455.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303940600008,0

A related concern is that challenges disproportionately target high-sales drugs, reducing market life for these blockbusters. To study these questions, we examine new data on generic entry over the past decade. We show that challenges are more common for higher sales drugs. We also demonstrate a slight increase in challenges over this period, and a sharper increase for early challenges. Despite this, effective market life is stable across drug sales categories, and has hardly changed over the decade. To better understand these results, we examine which patents are challenged on each drug, and show that lower quality and later expiring patents disproportionately draw challenges. Overall, this evidence suggests that challenges serve to maintain, not reduce, the historical baseline of effective market life, thereby limiting the effectiveness of evergreening by branded firms.

Our analyses categorize physicians into three types according to the frequency with which they provided additional medical services at their patients' requests: frequent, occasional, and rare. The proportion of information-savvy patients is significantly and positively correlated with demand-induced supply for the frequent or occasional type, but not among physicians in the rare type. Efforts to contain healthcare costs through utilization control need to recognize the pattern of responses from physicians who treat an increasing number of information-savvy patients.

The method, although general, is applied to an example of birth weight disparities and to their effect on subsequent mortality. The method provides the between-group results obtainable from current methods (i.e. how Hispanics generally fare relative to non-Hispanic Whites) but adds measures of within-group disparities (i.e. which specific Hispanics experience the greatest disparate treatment). Our application to birth weights and receipt of prenatal care, which may provide an upper bound because of omitted variables, shows that the time-of-birth disparities are associated with increased infant mortality within the first year of life.

Students make their college major decisions in part due to the future earnings streams associated with the different majors. We survey students about what their expected earnings would be both in the major they have chosen and in counterfactual majors. We also elicit students' subjective assessments of their abilities in chosen and counterfactual majors. We estimate a model of college major choice that incorporates these subjective expectations and assessments. We show that both expected earnings and students' abilities in the different majors are important determinants of a student's choice of a college major. We also consider how differences in students' forecasts about what the average Duke student would earn in different majors versus what they expect they would earn both influence one's choice of a college major. In particular, our estimates suggest that 7.8% of students would switch majors if they had the same expectations about the average returns to different majors and differed only in their perceived comparative advantages across these majors.

We define a new stability concept called weak stability and investigate its existence problem. We show that when the preferences of firms satisfy an extension of substitutability and two new conditions called increasing choice and no external effect by an unchosen worker, then a weakly stable matching exists. We also show that a weakly stable matching may fail to exist without these restrictions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We identify another ex ante moral hazard that runs in the opposite direction. Lower levels of self-protection and the associated chronic conditions and behavioral patterns such as obesity, smoking, and malnutrition increase the incidence of many diseases and consumption of treatments to those diseases. This increases the reward for innovation and thus benefits the innovator. It also increases treatment innovation which benefits all consumers. As individuals do not take these positive externalities into account, their investments in self-protection are inefficiently high. We quantify the lower bound of this externality for obesity. The lower bound is independent of how much additional innovation is generated. The results show that the externality we identify offsets the negative Medicare-induced insurance externality of obesity. The Medicare-induced obesity subsidy is thus not a sufficient rationale for soda taxes, fat taxes or other penalties on obesity. The quantitative finding also implies that the other ex ante moral hazard that we identify can be as important as the ex ante moral hazard that has been a central concept in health economics for decades.

Methods: This study utilized a survey research method. Opioid-dependent patients who participated in the outpatient MMT program in 2009 and met the eligibility criteria were recruited from five hospitals. The impact of MMT on self-perceived health was assessed by using questionnaires. This study assessed the participants' quality of life and treatment outcomes during 3-month follow-up visits, before evaluating the direct effects of regional and individual characteristics. Multilevel linear models were used to estimate whether regional levels influenced individual behavior and treatment outcomes. Results: Three hundred thirty-four opioid-dependent patients agreed to participate in this study. After the follow-up period, 127 participants completed the study (completion rate = 38%). Participants receiving MMT demonstrated significant improvements in psychological state, HIV risk-taking behavior, social functioning, and health. Regional characteristics, such as the lower than junior high school rate, low-income family rate, and related crime rates, of the study regions were negatively associated with improvements in drug abuse behavior. Conclusions: This study shows that MMT can significantly improve the HIV risk-taking behavior and health of the study participants. Disadvantaged regions, however, exhibit poor treatment outcomes. This study suggests actions to minimize the treatment variations between regions.","[Yang, Ming-Chin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Dept Publ Hlth, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Chen, Chia-Yu; Yang, Ming-Chin] Chang Hua Hosp, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Puxin Township, Changhua County, Taiwan; [Ting, Shuo-Yen] Chang Hua Hosp, Dept Hlth, Puxin Township, Changhua County, Taiwan; [Tan, Happy Kuy-Lok] Taoyuan Mental Hosp, Dept Hlth, Tao Yuan, Taoyuan County, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Yang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Dept Publ Hlth, 17 Xu Zhou Rd,Room 637, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",mcyang637@ntu.edu.tw,,"YANG, MING-CHIN/0000-0001-7326-8671",Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan [DOH98-NNB-1057],Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan,These finding are the result of work supported by Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (grant number DOH98-NNB-1057).,,28,9,10,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S60,S64,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.010,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265069.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000011,0

As an example, we apply this result to the Anderson (1978) core convergence theorem, and demonstrate how our normalization leads to an intuitive, unitless upper bound on the discrepancy between an arbitrary core allocation and the corresponding competitive equilibrium allocation.

Methods: A systematic search was undertaken to identify clinical studies of patients with visual disorders where health state utility values were measured and reported. Data were extracted to assess the validity and responsiveness of the measures. A narrative synthesis of the data was undertaken due to the heterogeneity between different studies. Results: There was considerable heterogeneity in the 31 studies identified in terms of patient characteristics, visual disorders, and outcomes reported. Vision loss was associated with a reduction in scores across the preference-based measure, but the evidence on validity and responsiveness was mixed. The EQ-5D healthrelated assessment instrument's performance differed according to condition, with poor performance in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy. The more limited evidence on the HUI-3 instrument found it performed best in differentiating between severity groups of patients with glaucoma, AMD, cataracts, and diabetic retinopathy. One study reported data on the SF-6D instrument and showed it was able to differentiate between patients with AMD. Conclusions: The performance of the EQ-5D in visual disorders was mixed. The HUI-3 seemed to perform better in some conditions, but the evidence on this and SF-6D is limited. More head to head comparisons of these three measures are required. The new five-level version of EQ-5D may do better at the milder end of visual function.","[Tosh, Jonathan; Brazier, John; Evans, Philippa] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",University of Sheffield; Brunel University,"Tosh, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",j.tosh@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Tosh, Jonathan/0000-0002-8288-4270; Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Medical Research Council as part of the Medical Research Council-National Institute for Health [G0901486]; MRC [G0901486] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0901486] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council as part of the Medical Research Council-National Institute for Health; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This project was funded by the Medical Research Council as part of the Medical Research Council-National Institute for Health Research Methodology Research programme (G0901486).,,45,105,109,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,,,,118,127,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.08.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GU,22264979.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299318500014,0

The merged CRSP/Compustat database was augmented by macroeconomic variables and comprehensive dynamic models were estimated by maximum likelihood taking into account heterogeneity across firms. Likelihood ratio statistics were developed for sequentially testing hypotheses regarding the adequacy of macroeconomic variables in the models. The main findings were that the estimated coefficients of lagged stock prices in simple dynamic random effects models were in the interval 0.90-0.95. Second, comprehensive dynamic models for stock prices showed that the firms' earnings per share, total assets, long-term debt, dividends per share, and unemployment and interest rates were significant predictors; there were significant interactions between firms' long-term debt and interest rates.

Nevertheless, we are unaware of any similar research on the impacts of retiree health insurance per se. Accordingly, the present paper utilizes a unique data file on respondents to the Health and Retirement Study, to explore how employer-provided retiree health insurance may influence net household wealth among public sector employees, where retiree healthcare benefits are still quite prevalent. Key findings include the following: - Most full-time public sector employees anticipate having employer-provided health insurance coverage in retirement, unlike most private sector workers. - Public sector employees covered by RHI had substantially less wealth than similar private sector employees without RHI. In our data, Federal workers had about $82,000 (18%) less net wealth than private sector employees lacking RHI; state/local workers with RHI accumulated about $69,000 (or 15%) less net wealth than their uninsured private sector counterparts. - After controlling on socioeconomic status and differences in pension coverage, net household wealth for Federal employees was $116,000 less than workers without RHI and the result is statistically significant; the state/local difference was not.
