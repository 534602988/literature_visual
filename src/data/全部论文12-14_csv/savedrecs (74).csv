It suggests a model based on Technology Acceptance Model (Davis et al., 1989) extended by two added constructs Trust and Risk. These two constructs are considered as external variables and supposed to enhance E-entrepreneurship acceptance. The study was conducted at two public and private Business Schools. The National School of Business and Management located in Agadir city, south of Morocco represented the public institution. As fee the private one, authors are limited to the High School of Management located at Rabat, North of Morocco. It concerned 115 students at their last year and considered as future entrepreneurs. They represented 89.84% of the target population (128 students). Results showed that, the suggested model explained 28% of total variance in the intention to accept E-entrepreneurship by future entrepreneurs. They also revealed that Perceived Usefulness, Trust and Risk influenced significantly this intention. However, Attitude showed no significant impact on future entrepreneurs' intention. Furthermore, this commnnication generates a useful knowledge on E-entrepreneurship that could help policymakers to succeed digital strategies, and support future entrepreneurs to succeed their investment in projects based Information Technologies (IT projects).","[Oumlil, Rachid] Univ Ibn Zohr, LaRGe, ENCG Agadir, Agadir, Morocco; [Bennani, Az-Eddine] UTC, RMS, Compiegne, France",Ibn Zohr University of Agadir,"Oumlil, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ibn Zohr, LaRGe, ENCG Agadir, Agadir, Morocco.",r.oumlil@uiz.ac.ma; Az-eddine.bennani@reims-ms.fr,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,1300,+,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100134,0

This small open economy is represented by two variations of a medium scale nonlinear dynamic stochastic model of a general equilibrium with fiscal and monetary policy. This model framework is based on a Portuguese approach introduced by Almeida (2009). We decided to use this model, because it captures the important features of the Czech economy in a reasonable detail. Since this concept was primarily constructed for the estimation of an economy in a currency union, we had to add a Taylor type monetary policy and a nominal exchange rate into the model. Both model variations are estimated with the use of bayesian techniques with the same priors, in order to analyse structural changes linked to the Great Recession. With the use of the shock decomposition we will analyse the impact of the exogenous shocks on the development of the Czech output. Especially, we will focus on the effects of the fiscal policy in the period of the Great Recession and the European debt crisis.","[Pisca, Vratislav; Vasicek, Osvald] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Pisca, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",385260@mail.muni.cz; osvald@econ.muni.cz,"Vašíček, Osvald/AAR-5742-2021","Vašíček, Osvald/0000-0003-3805-4939",,,,,4,0,0,0,1,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,807,812,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900139,0

Therefore, SME entrepreneurial activities are in the center of incubation focus. However, there is a tendency to let those incubation activities escape by systematic review due to lack of data. To fill in this gap an observation of chosen incubator samples was carried out which was drawn of the existing body of knowledge in the area of business incubation and its relation to entrepreneurship.

Data, in the form of probability distribution functions (PDFs) for key input variables were collected from interviews with investors and other professionals active in the U.S. wind power industry using a formal expert elicitation protocol. This study presents the first quantitative estimates of the effect of the U.S. voluntary Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) market on renewable energy generation. The results indicate that the investment decisions of wind power project developers in the United States are unlikely to have been altered by the voluntary REC market. The problem with the current voluntary REC market is that it does not offer developers a reliable risk-adjusted revenue stream. Consequently, the claims by U.S. green power retailers and promoters that voluntary market RECs result in additional wind power projects lack credibility. Even dramatic increases in voluntary market REC prices, in the absence of long-term contracts, were found to have only a small effect on investor behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Data are collected via a survey administered to a sample of 2302 adult drivers in 21 of the largest cities in the United States. Almost two-thirds of the respondents provided incorrect answers to basic factual questions about PEVs and, of those, approximately 75% underestimated their private value or advantages. The vast majority (94.5%) of respondents were not aware of the current state and local incentives in place in their locale to encourage PEV purchase and use. Based on a review of consumer theory, multivariate models are developed and used to assess the factors associated with consumer interest in the two major types of PEV technologies, Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). Results show demographic and attitudinal characteristics having the largest influence on interest in either type of PEV. Misperceptions about purchase price and expected fuel and maintenance savings are likewise significant, although their impacts differ between BEVs and PHEVs. Better informing consumers about already available public incentives and advantageous aspects of existing PEV technologies offer promising steps toward their mass commercialization.

Due to the predominantly remote locations of offshore wind farms, the majority of future connections will be high-voltage direct current (HVDC) connections. In order to make the construction of offshore infrastructure more efficient, the North Sea states are currently discussing the development of a common offshore grid. Although this development still stands at the very beginning, we argue in this paper that some crucial elements should be standardized from the outset; the most important one being a common voltage level. Without such standardization, the development of a European offshore grid may be suboptimal, not cost-efficient and might even be prevented from coming into existence. We examine the technical and legal issues associated with introducing a common voltage level for the use of HVDC VSC technology, and discuss the optimal standard as well as the way in which this common standard can best be achieved.

Main barriers to grid development are the insufficient regulatory framework, an inefficient allocation of planning and authorization competences and a lack of public acceptance of new grids. As response to these barriers, Germany has implemented a fundamental reform of the planning and authorization of high voltage power lines. We analyze the new regime as to what extent it is able to eliminate existing barriers to grid expansion and thus can serve as model for other countries. We find that the establishment of a single authority competent for planning, authorization and regulation may abolish existing lack of coordination. Also, the implementation of early participation on basis of various consultations phases has been proved to be very successful in the establishment of the first grid development plan. Stricter administrative time-limits and sanctions are likely to have an accelerating effect. And an increased openness to new technologies on basis of pilot project gives grid operators more flexibility in grid development. Recently, the European Commission adopted the German approach in its policy guidelines for other EU members. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the majority of this work has not investigated the real-world issues affecting the widespread deployment of storage. This paper is designed to address this gap by drawing on the systems innovation and socio-technical transitions literature to identify some of the most important contextual factors which are likely to influence storage deployment. Specifically it uses a coevolutionary framework to examine how changes in ecosystems, user practices, business strategies, institutions and technologies are creating a new selection environment and potentially opening up the energy system to new variations of storage for both electricity and heat. The analysis shows how these different dimensions of the energy regime can coevolve in mutually reinforcing ways to create alternative pathways for the energy system which in turn have different flexibility requirements and imply different roles for storage technologies. Using this framework three pathways are developed - user led, decentralised and centralised - which illustrate potential long-term trajectories for-energy storage technologies in a low-carbon energy system.

Today the production of biogas is much more controversially debated than several years ago. At the same time it could be proven that even among farmers themselves the acceptance of biogas production in some regions is somewhat dampened due to accompanying collateral damages. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to identify relevant influencing factors that determine the acceptance of the innovation biogas among farmers by applying a causal analysis. Initial results among the five investigated determinants show that not only an individual attitude toward biogas but also the farmers' personal innovativeness strongly and significantly influences an individual's acceptance of the innovation biogas.

The analysis draws on a theoretical framework which introduces emotional fear arousal as a direct behavioural antecedent of coping behaviour into a model based on cognitive centred Protection Motivation Theory (PMT, Maddux and Rogers, 1983; Rogers, 1983) and the Extended Parallel Processing Model (EPPM, Witte, 1992, 1998). Hypothesized relations are tested in a nationally representative online study conducted in April and May 2012, one year after the Fukushima accident. Results support the hypothesized influences of perceived threat, fear arousal and perceived coping efficacy. Support for the proposed effects of fear control is rather limited. Findings contribute to extending previous knowledge on the role of cognitive and emotional appraisal processes induced by awareness of threats from nuclear power as behavioural antecedents of both opposing nuclear power and adopting green electricity. Findings of the study have implications for nuclear power policy and activism, as well as for institutional and commercial promoters of voluntary residential green electricity adoption.

Former benchmark studies promised high revenues especially for this case. The benefits could provide an incentive to customers to buy an electric vehicle. The business case is analyzed for the German market as a case study. Specific regulations for this market, real driving patterns and real market data are taken into account when calculating revenues. Secondary reserve is strictly regulated, requiring a very high level of availability. As a result, simulated revenues are lower than assumed. Simulation shows average revenues of less than 5 per month and vehicle. As a major bottleneck for an offer of secondary reserve, fully charged batteries are identified. Additionally an issue is made of costs for communication and customer compensation. Based on the simulation results, it is argued that the market for secondary reserve should not be accessed with these small units. For electric vehicles, easier accessible markets with lower related costs should be considered instead. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Opportunities for production of electricity by on-shore wind facilities are greatest, however, in the north and west of the country. Using high resolution wind data derived from the GEOS-5 assimilation, this study shows that investments in off-shore wind facilities in these spatially separated regions (Bohai-Bay or BHB, Yangtze-River Delta or YRD, Pearl-River Delta or PRD) could make an important contribution to overall regional demand for electricity in coastal China. An optimization analysis indicates that hour-to-hour variability of outputs from a combined system can be minimized by investing 24% of the power capacity in BHB, 30% in YRD and 47% in PRD. The analysis suggests that about 28% of the overall off-shore wind potential could be deployed as base load power replacing coal-fired system with benefits not only in terms of reductions in CO2 emissions but also in terms of improvements in regional air quality. The interconnection of off-shore wind resources contemplated here could be facilitated by China's 12th-five-year plan to strengthen inter-connections between regional electric-power grids.

Furthermore, the paper identifies a set of crucial factors that determine whether or not star scientists engage in intraregional knowledge transfer activities.","Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Reg Dev & Environm, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Trippl, M (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Reg Dev & Environm, Nordbergstr 15, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",michaela.trippl@wu.ac.at,,,,,,,37,91,101,12,99,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Our results show that there is a difference between the short-term and the long-term results and that climate policy are more likely to affect emission over the long-term than over the short-term. Climate policies should therefore be aimed at a time horizon of at least 8 years and year-on-year changes in emissions contains little information about the trend path of emissions. In the long-run capital accumulation is the main driver of emissions. Productivity growth reduces the energy intensity while the real oil price reduces both the energy intensity and the carbon intensity. The real oil price effect suggests that a global carbon tax is an important policy tool to reduce emissions, but our results also suggest that a carbon tax is likely to be insufficient decouple emission from economic growth. Such a decoupling is likely to require a structural transformation of the economy. The key policy challenge is thus to build new economic structures where investments in green technologies are more profitable. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Andersson, Fredrik N.

Previous research has demonstrated that prospect theory could be sufficient to explain an energy paradox in the market for automotive fuel economy. This paper analyzes data from questions added to four commercial, multi-client surveys of 1000 U.S. households each in 2004, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Households were asked about willingness to pay for future fuel savings as well as the annual fuel savings necessary to justify a given upfront payment. Payback periods inferred from household responses are generally consistent over time and across different formulations of questions. Mean calculated payback periods are about 3 years, but there is substantial dispersion among individual responses. The calculated payback periods do not appear to be correlated with the attributes of respondents. Respondents were able to quantitatively describe their uncertainty about both vehicle fuel economy and future fuel prices. Simulation of loss averse behavior based on respondents' stated uncertainty illustrates how loss aversion could lead consumers to substantially undervalue future fuel savings relative to their expected value.

For example, for identification and inference of causal effects in regression discontinuity designs it is typically assumed that the density function of a conditioning variable is continuous at a cutoff point that determines assignment of a treatment. Also, discontinuity in density functions can be a parameter of economic interest, such as in analysis of bunching behaviors of taxpayers. To facilitate researchers to conduct valid inference for these problems, this article extends the binning and local likelihood approaches to estimate discontinuity of density functions and proposes empirical likelihood-based tests and confidence sets for the discontinuity. In contrast to the conventional Wald-type test and confidence set using the binning estimator, our empirical likelihood-based methods (i) circumvent asymptotic variance estimation to construct the test statistics and confidence sets; (ii) are invariant to nonlinear transformations of the parameters of interest; (iii) offer confidence sets whose shapes are automatically determined by data; and (iv) admit higher-order refinements, so-called Bartlett corrections. First- and second-order asymptotic theories are developed. Simulations demonstrate the superior finite sample behaviors of the proposed methods. In an empirical application, we assess the identifying assumption of no manipulation of class sizes in the regression discontinuity design studied by Angrist and Lavy (1999).","[Otsu, Taisuke] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Xu, Ke-Li] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Matsushita, Yukitoshi] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Tsukuba,"Otsu, T (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",t.otsu@lse.ac.uk; keli.xu@econmail.tamu.edu; matsushita@dpipe.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Xu, Keli/ITU-4079-2023; Matsushita, Yukitoshi/B-8862-2015",,,,,,32,24,27,3,25,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

To achieve the goal of this study, the non-stationary panel techniques were used to examine the hypothesis from 1980 to 2009. Based on the Pedroni cointegration test results, it was found that the variables are cointegrated. Moreover, the Fully Modified OLS results showed that energy consumption and GDP growth increase CO2 emission while foreign direct investment inflows have a long run negative relationship with CO2 emission. Furthermore, based on the short run Granger causality test results, FDI has no short run causal relationship with CO2 emission and energy consumption while energy consumption and GDP growth have a positive causal relationship with CO2 emission. Thus, the results of this study indicate that energy consumption and GDP growth are the source of pollution in the GCC countries and not the foreign direct investment inflows. Thus, the study recommended that these countries should utilize policies to encourage inward foreign investment since it plays an important role in stimulating GDP growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Earnings are conceptualized as a function of human capital, decomposed into the portion acquired in the home country and the portion acquired in the receiving country. It is hypothesized that poor transferability of human capital acquired at home dampens wages more for new than for old immigrant groups. Further, it is hypothesized that upon arrival in the destination, new immigrant groups accumulate human capital faster than old immigrant groups. The empirical analysis focuses on Albanians in the United States as a representative of a new immigrant group and Italians as a representative of an old immigrant group. The analysis is based on pooled data from the 2000 US Census 5 % sample, and the 2001-2007 American Community Survey (ACS) 3 % sample. Findings suggest that (1) Albanian immigrants earn substantially less than Italian immigrants; (2) human capital acquired at home has a positive impact on wages, but the level of human capital transferability is low for Albanians; (3) upon arrival, both Italian and Albanian immigrants accumulate human capital, but the speed of human capital accumulation is faster for Albanians than for Italians.","[Mane, Kate M.] Purdue Univ, Dept Consumer Sci & Retailing, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Waldorf, Brigitte S.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Mane, KM (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Consumer Sci & Retailing, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",kmhutchi@purdue.edu; bwaldorf@purdue.edu,,,,,,,28,2,4,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The GHG burden of hemp cultivation is intermediate between perennial and traditional annual energy crops, but net fuel chain GHG abatement potential of 11 t/CO2 eq./ha/year in the mid yield estimate is comparable to perennial crops, and 140% and 540% greater than for OSR and sugar beet fuel chains, respectively. Gross margins from hemp were considerably lower than for OSR and sugar beet, but exceeded those from Miscanthus when organic fertilizers were used and in the absence of establishment grants for the latter crop. Extrapolated up to the EU scale, replacing 25% of OSR and sugar beet production with hemp production could increase net GHG abatement by up to 21 Mt CO(2)eq./year. Hemp is a considerably more efficient bioenergy feedstock than the dominant annual energy crops. Integrated into food crop rotations, hemp need not compete with food supplies, and could provide an appealing option to develop more sustainable non-transport bioenergy supply chains.

J,"Smith, WJ",,,,"Smith, William J.",,,Projecting EU demand for natural gas to 2030: A meta-analysis,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Natural gas; Projection; Demand,,"Gas demand projections for the EU27 from a variety of sources are compared. Projected demand varies widely between sources, even when similar rates of economic growth and policy strength are assumed. The divergence is shown to result from differing assumptions concerning future energy intensity, on the one hand, and the future contribution of nuclear power and renewables (RES) to electricity generation on the other. The variation with time of some of these projections is also examined. It is found that the gas demand projected by both the International Energy Agency (LEA) and the European Commission (EC) for 2020 and for 2030 has tended to decrease with each successive projection. This is understandable, since the penetration of RES-E has continued to exceed expectations. However, in an economically depressed, post-Fukushima Europe, estimates of future growth in both RES and nuclear generation may need significant revision. The Energy Efficiency Directive, as agreed by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament in April 2012 (Council of the European Union, 2012), will also impact significantly on future gas demand, even though the measures incorporated are weaker than the original proposal. The analysis presented here shows that a nuclear decline due to the Fukushima disaster is seen to moderate, rather than reverse, projected demand decay. A significant shortfall in projected RES capacity, if it were to occur, constitutes a potential source of additional gas demand. Although the emphasis in this paper is on the EU27 as a whole, consideration is given to the regional heterogeneity of each of these impacts. Hence, although aggregate demand growth for the next decade or two is likely to be moderate or (more probably) negative, local demand growth in some regions may be significant. Ensuring adequate access to these specific regions - via interconnection to their EU27 neighbours, and/or directly from extra-EU sources - will therefore be essential. Hence, implementation of the Third Energy Plan should remain a priority. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Study of the variation in temporal CO2 emissions generated by the driving forces in Beijing can provide guidance for policy decisions on CO2 emissions mitigation in global metropolises. Based on input-output structural decomposition analysis (IO-SDA), we analysed the driving forces for the increment in CO2 emissions in Beijing from both production and final demand perspectives during 1997-2010. According to our results, the CO2 emission growth in Beijing is driven mainly by production structure change and population growth, partly offset by CO2 emission intensity reduction as well as the decline in per capita final demand volume during the study period. Final demand structure change has a limited effect on the change in the CO2 emissions in Beijing. From the final demand perspective, urban trades, urban residential consumption, government consumption and fixed capital formation are mainly responsible for the booming emissions. This study showed how the top-down IO-SDA methodology was implemented on a city scale. Policy implications from this study would be helpful for addressing CO2 emissions mitigation in global capital cities and metropolises. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The first ethanol production method (EP 1) directly purchased electricity and steam from the grid and the factory, and the second ethanol production method (EP 2) derived the required electricity and steam from the cogeneration system using the sugarcane bagasse as boiler fuel. Data pertaining to GHG emissions from power generation were collected from published studies. A process for ethanol production from sugarcane bagasse was designed, and a simulator was developed to generate the process data using Microsoft Excel. Results show that power generation is the preferential option when the grid emission factors are higher than 0.45 kg CO2 eq/kWh. The EP 1 was advantageous in mitigating the GHG emissions when the grid emission factors were lower than 0.19 kg CO2 eq/kWh, and the EP 2 might be the most environmentally beneficial when the grid emission factors were between 0.19 and 0.45 kg CO2 eq/kWh.

It is a historical marine trade route between the former Soviet countries and the western world. From the perspective of special nuclear materials transportation, this route can also be a nuclear materials trade route due to the nuclear policy of former Soviet countries and world nuclear market. In addition, TS can also be an optional route of integrated transportation ways for the shipping states that pursue to reach the destination points using the Black Sea countries or the North-Eastern Part of Turkey. Consequently maritime transportation of special nuclear materials has arisen as a critical concept for TS, where the risks should be understood and analyzed effectively. Accordingly, this study will aim at conducting a risk assessment for the TS from the special nuclear material transportations perspective via two hypothesized scenarios which are (i) ship collision accident in the case of special nuclear materials (SNM) Transportation through TS (ii) ship fire accident in the case of nuclear smuggling through IS with oil tanker.

We compare the performance of various policy combinations for food and fuel prices, fuel mix and fuel consumption. We also analyze the economic costs and benefits of alternative policy combinations and their distributional effects for consumers and producers in the transportation and agricultural sector in the US. Using a dynamic, multi-market, partial equilibrium model of the transportation and agricultural sectors, we find that combining the RFS with an LCFS policy leads to a reduction in first generation biofuels and an increase in second generation biofuels compared to the RFS alone. This policy combination also achieves greater reduction in GHG emissions even after considering offsetting market mediated effects. Imposition of a carbon price with the RFS and LCFS policy primarily induces fuel conservation and achieves larger GHG emissions reduction compared to the other policy scenarios. All these policy combinations lead to higher net economic benefits for the transportation and agricultural sectors relative to the no policy baseline because they improve the terms of trade for US.

Renewable energy generation alleviates balance-of-payments constraints and reduces the exposure of a regional economy to the volatility of the price of fossil fuels and to negative environmental and health externalities deriving from non-renewable energy generation.

The analysis is performed by decomposing the changes in energy intensity by means of energy efficiency, fuel mix and structural changes using sectoral and sub-sectoral levels of data. The results show that the driving forces behind the decrease in energy intensity in Australia are efficiency effect and sectoral composition effect, where the former is found to be more prominent than the latter. Moreover, the favourable impact of the composition effect has slowed consistently in recent years. A perfect positive association characterizes the relationship between energy intensity and carbon intensity in Australia. The decomposition results indicate that Australia needs to improve energy efficiency further to reduce energy intensity and carbon emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A bivariate probit model is estimated using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). Significant residual correlation is estimated, which suggests that satisfaction and attachment tap both cognitive and affective aspects of individual attitudes.

The model includes electricity trade between BC, Alberta and the US, the influence of a carbon emissions tax, contributions from the aging gas-fired Burrard Thermal plant and production from a proposed dam called Site C on the Peace River in northern BC. Model results suggest: If load increases as anticipated at 1.4%/year, BC will need to import significant amounts of electricity within two decades. Operating the Burrard plant at full capacity to 2025 and bringing Site C on line in 2020 delays the need to import by only 6 years, while realizing net electricity export sales of $5.9 billion by 2040. Bringing Site C on line but imposing a tax of $30/t of CO2 emitted on gas-fired generation causes immediate closure of the Burrard plant on economic grounds and reduces net export revenue to $0.63 billion by 2040. BC has options, however, including demand side management and development of additional generation capacity. In the absence of these measures, imported power may be more significant in BC's electricity future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This tool combines optimal generation mix techniques with Monte Carlo. simulation and portfolio analysis methods to determine expected overall generation costs, associated cost uncertainty and expected CO2 emissions for different possible generation portfolios. A case study of an electricity industry with coal, Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT), Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGT) and wind generation options that faces uncertain future fossil-fuel prices, carbon pricing, electricity demand and plant construction costs is presented to illustrate some of the key issues associated with growing wind penetrations. The case study uses half-hourly demand and wind generation data from South Eastern Australia, and regional estimates of new-build plant costs and characteristics. Results suggest that although wind generation generally increases overall industry costs, it reduces associated cost uncertainties and CO2 emissions. However, there are some cases in which wind generation can reduce the overall costs of generation portfolios.

This policy mix has been subject to strong criticism. It is mainly argued that RES-E schemes contribute nothing to emissions reduction and undermine the cost-effectiveness of the EU ETS. Consequently, many scholars suggest the abolition of RES-E schemes. However, this conclusion rests on quite narrow and unrealistic assumptions about the design and performance of markets and policies. This article provides a systematic and comprehensive review and discussion of possible rationales for combining the EU ETS with RES-E support schemes. The first and most important reason may be restrictions to technology development and adoption. These may be attributed to the failure of markets as well as policies, and more generally to the path dependency in socio-technical systems. Under these conditions, RES-E schemes are required to reach sufficient levels of technology development. In addition, it is highlighted that in contrast to the EU ETS RES-E support schemes may provide benefits beyond mitigating climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy conservation measures are nearly inexistent yet they can potentially lead to substantial reductions in energy demand growth, environmental damages and public expenditures. This paper presents an analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of mandatory standards for energy efficiency for four different household appliances (refrigerator/freezers. AC split units, washing machines and lighting) over the period 2013-2027. Our results show potential savings in electricity consumption reaching 2054 GW h annually in 2027 as well as a reduction of subsidies paid to the public utility of 3.6 billion USD in 2027 while CO2 emissions avoided amount to 8.9 million tons over the period of analysis. Furthermore, we propose a financially attractive refrigerator/freezer replacement program for low income households. If this program would cover all existing low-income households in 2013, the savings in electricity consumption would lead to a reduction in subsidies of 9 billion USD (NPV) over the period 2013-2027, while full funding for this program would cost the government 223.8 million USD. This program would thereby benefit consumers, the government and further economic development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Two main options arise in a cap and trade framework: (i) buying/selling emission allowances; and (ii) reducing emissions by investing in abatement technologies. In this context, each industry must choose the best strategy considering its particular features. This work proposes a systematic tool to assist decision-makers in the design of coal-fired energy production with carbon management in existing power plants. Our approach relies on a novel mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) that minimizes the cost of electricity (COE) for a given price of CO2 allowance on the trade market. We demonstrate the capabilities of this MINLP through a case study that addresses the retrofitting of a coal-fired power plant. Results show that the price of the CO2 allowance on the market that effectively induce the investment in carbon capture falls in the range 22-30 $/tCO(2)eq depending on the quantity of allowances distributed for free. In this solution, carbon capture is accomplished by implementing the oxy-fuel combustion technology (which is preferred to the post-combustion capture using mono-ethanolamine as solvent).

The current economic climate however has meant that budget cuts have affected almost all government departments; consequently such policies have been adversely impacted. The alterations/modifications to many schemes have resulted in either a reduction in the funding available through these, changes to the eligibility of certain technologies or scales of generation or policy cancellations. The programmes affected include the Feed-In Tariff Scheme, Renewable Heat Incentive and Low Carbon Buildings Programme, among others. The adjustments for these are detailed herein, followed by the impacts these have had on the deployment rates of decentralised energy, especially microgeneration. Since costs are often one of the most significant factors constraining deployment of these technologies, reductions in funding opportunities have made these less financially-viable. Whilst there are still applications for funding under the available schemes, there has been considerably reduced levels of requests for financial support, thus future deployment rates will most likely be negatively affected. The prospects of these technologies in this context are then considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, distributed applications of PV on rooftops, brownfields, and other similar applications - hold great technical potential. In order for this potential to be realized, however. PV must be cost-effective-that is, it must be sufficiently financially appealing to attract large amounts of investment capital. Electricity costs for most commercial and industrial end-users come in two forms: consumption (kWh) and demand (kW). Although rates vary, for a typical larger commercial or industrial user, demand charges account for about similar to 40% of total electricity costs. This paper uses a case study of PV on a large university campus to reveal that even very large PV installations will often provide very small demand reductions. As a result, it will be very difficult for PV to demonstrate cost-effectiveness for large commercial customers, even if PV costs continue to drop. If policymakers would like PV to play a significant role in electricity generation - for economic development, carbon reduction, or other reasons - then rate structures will need significant adjustment, or improved distributed storage technologies will be needed.

One concern is the possibility of emissions leakage due to a lack of coherence in the geographic scope of the regional electricity market and the C&T program. Leakage in the context of regulating CO2 emissions is defined as the short-run displacement of CO2 emissions from the capped region to other uncapped regions due to the imposition of a regional C&T scheme. However, the presence of transmission congestion could interact with regulations in an unanticipated way to determining whether leakage would occur and its magnitude if happens. In this paper, we use a two-node network to study the conditions under which the CO2 leakage would happen in a radial network under a C&T program. These conditions are related to transmission capacity, merit order change, and relative production cost between capped and uncapped regions. Since CO2 leakage would likely occur in a radial network during the time when there is surplus transmission capacity, if regional CO2 policies could influence power grid management and operations decisions, then there might be space for a better multi-objective coordination.

Instead of increasing electricity from renewable resources or nuclear power facilities, an alternative approach to reducing emissions in the electric power sector is changing the dispatch order of fossil fuels. Important differences between fossil fuels, and in the technologies used to burn them, make it possible to substantially reduce emissions from the sector. On average, each gigawatt-year of electricity generation switched from coal to natural gas reduces CO2 emissions by 59 percent. As a result of significant investments in natural gas fired power plants in the United States between 1998 and 2005, there is an opportunity for electricity producers to take advantage of underutilized capacity. This is the first study to closely examine the new capital additions and analyze the technical potential for reductions in emissions. The analysis finds that 188 GW of capacity May be available to replace coal-fired baseload electricity generation. Utilizing this excess gas-fired capacity will reduce the sector's CO2 emissions by 23 to 42 percent and reduce overall U.S. CO2 emissions between 9 percent and 17 percent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Guertler, P",,,,"Guertler, Pedro",,,Can the Green Deal be fair too? Exploring new possibilities for alleviating fuel poverty,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fuel poverty; Energy efficiency; Green Deal,,"Energy efficiency and social programmes have failed to stem the dramatic increase in the number of fuel poor households in recent years. As the 2016 deadline for eradicating fuel poverty nears, energy efficiency and fuel poverty programmes are undergoing significant changes. The ambitions for Britain's Green Deal, the overhaul of supplier obligations alongside the winding down of Warm Front, and the introduction of an incentive for renewable heat combine to form a sea change in how energy efficiency and fuel poverty objectives are financed and delivered. Green Deal Finance (GDF) eliminates the up-front capital cost of energy efficiency measures to the household by linking repayments to energy savings and spreading them over many years. This paper asks whether and how GDF could be beneficial to fuel poor households. Using scenarios modelled on the English House Condition Survey, it explores the extent to which fuel poverty could be reduced, allowing for repayments incurred by GDF. It examines how much further fuel poverty could be alleviated were the capital cost subsidised or repayments supported, and concludes that a flexible design for GDF is necessary if it is to contribute to alleviating fuel poverty.

These goals are not certain to be met, however, because many RPSs apply cost caps that alter requirements if costs exceed targets. We analyze here the 2008 Illinois RPS, which is fairly typical, and find that at current electricity prices, complete implementation will require significant decreases in renewables costs even given the continuation of federal renewables subsidies. Full implementation is possible but not assured. The statutory design raises additional concerns about unintended potential consequences. The fact that windpower and solar carveouts fall under a single cost cap means that in failure mode, a less cost-effective technology can curtail deployment of a more cost-effective one. Adjacent-state provisions mean the bulk of the RPS can be met by existing wind facilities, and that new wind builds will likely occur in Iowa. The Illinois RPS, like that of many other states, appears to combine objectives inherently in conflict: preferences for local jobs, for specific technologies, for environmental benefits, and for low costs. Revisiting the legislation may be needed to make legislative success likely and to ensure that failure modes do not compromise goals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Professional services industries are increasingly concentrating in cities due to both greater market potential and the critical role of frequent face-to-face contact. From the labor supply perspective, urban areas offer the full range of urban amenities, a large pool of employers allowing for improved skills matching as well as better employment prospects for two income-earner families. Rural areas, on the other hand, offer rural lifestyles and natural amenities, location attributes that have dominated in regional migrations in the United States, for example. Concentration of professionals in cities could thus simply reflect the urban concentration of the demand for their services, rather than a labor supply location choice. In this study, we examine the location choices of veterinarians in western Canada, as an example of highly trained professionals for whom there is a rural demand base in the livestock industry. Our results show that a rural community's attractiveness for veterinarians is more responsive to its population size than to the livestock concentrations. Further, the presence of professional peers and a vibrant rural community is an added advantage. We conclude that the urban location choices of veterinarians are in part labor supply choices rather than only the imperatives of labor demand.","[Olfert, M.

Taking a power plant fueled with the natural gas transported by the second West-to-East Pipeline as an example, it is found that the on-grid power price fluctuates upward with the rise of gas price and downward with the increase of annual utilization hours, and the influences of tax policies on the on-grid power price prove to be highly significant. As the analysis and calculation indicate, the environmental benefits of natural gas power generation ought to be strongly emphasized, compared with coal-fired power generation.

Typically, NG is extensively distributed on urbanized territory and can be exploited by using different technologies. As a consequence, primary energy is usually consumed directly in buildings, allowing high efficiency conversion but also producing pollutants in urban areas. In this paper a comprehensive analysis on NG use in the Italian domestic and tertiary building sector has been carried out, in order to evaluate energy and environmental impact of this fuel on different climatic and geographical contexts, also considering the temporal fluctuation of consumption. The aim of the work is to trace a reliable and up-to-date scenario of NG employment for building heating in Italy, which is one of the EU countries where this source is more widely used. The study was carried out under the research program Analysis and evaluation of the current status of the reduction measures of environmental impacts due to heating energy consumption in Italy, funded by the Italian Ministry of Environment.

Further, the paper examines the barriers to adopting higher minimum standards of fabric energy efficiency, in particular the German Passivhaus standard. By comparing methodological differences and outcomes associated with these different energy performance standards, an estimate of the real world energy and carbon savings has been determined.

However, the share of renewable energy in the Netherlands is small and hardly increasing. In 2010, renewable energy in the Netherlands accounted for only 3.8% of the national energy use, and has decreased with 0.4% compared to 2009. A cause of the stagnating renewable energy generation in the Netherlands is the absence of a nation-wide, clear and consistent long-term policy on the introduction of renewable energy. In order to overcome the current standstill in renewable energy adoption, several Dutch municipalities take the initiative and establish Local Energy Companies (LECs). However, to date, it is unclear which LEC type performs best. This research aims to compare the performance of existing LECs on three aspects: technology, finance, and organization. Furthermore, the performance of existing LECs is compared with theoretical reference LECs, in order to estimate efficiencies and opportunities for improvements. Finally, the influence of the recent changes in the Dutch subsidy scheme on LEC performance is examined. In order to achieve these aims, the benchmark method Data Envelopment Analysis is employed.

Estimates show that power generation accounts for 37.2% of the Chinese CO2 emissions. Even though there is an increasing number of studies using life cycle analysis (LCA) to examine energy consumption and CO2 emissions required by different types of power generation technologies, there are very few studies focusing on China. Furthermore, the nexus between water consumption and energy production has largely been ignored. In this paper, we adopt input-output based hybrid life cycle analysis to evaluate water consumption and CO2 emissions of wind power in China. Our results show that China's wind energy consumes 0.64 l/kWh of water and produces 69.9 g/kWh of CO2 emission. Given that the Chinese government aims to increase the wind power generation capacity to 200 GW by 2020, wind power could contribute a 23% reduction in carbon intensity and could save 800 million m(3) of water which could be sufficient enough for use by 11.2 million households. Thus, given the often postulated water crisis, China's energy policy would reap double benefits through progressive energy policies when increasing the share of wind power as part of overall efforts to diversify its electricity generation technologies.

Under such condition, precise forecasting of demand for electricity should be an integral part of the planning process as this enables the policy makers to provide directions on cost-effective investment and on scheduling the operation of the existing and new power plants so that the supply of electricity can be made adequate enough to meet the future demand and its variations. Official load forecasting in India done by Central Electricity Authority (CEA) is often criticized for being overestimated due to inferior techniques used for forecasting. This paper tries to evaluate monthly peak demand forecasting performance predicted by CEA using trend method and compare it with those predicted by Multiplicative Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (MSARIMA) model. It has been found that MSARIMA model outperforms CEA forecasts both in-sample static and out-of-sample dynamic forecast horizons in all five regional grids in India. For better load management and grid discipline, this study suggests employing sophisticated techniques like MSARIMA for peak load forecasting in India. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate a dynamic model of innovation behaviour, and explicitly account for the likely endogeneity of our measure of the stringency of environmental regulations (pollution abatement costs). Our results indicate that while on the one hand environmental R&D and investment in environmental capital are stimulated by greater pollution abatement pressures, on the other hand there is not a positive impact of environmental regulation on total R&D or total capital accumulation. We find some evidence that this is because more stringent environmental regulations directly lower the optimal expenditure on non-environmental innovations. In addition, we find that environmental R&D may crowd out non-environmental R&D, although there is no evidence that environmental capital crowds out non-environmental capital. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In terms of urban sustainability, such measures affect energy efficiency as well as environmental, economic and social aspects. Numerous publications dealt with such methodological approaches in the past, whilst the subject of sustainable urban areas and cities is constantly gaining interest. Furthermore, energy performance depends on building density, occupancy and consumer profile, climatic conditions, not least construction quality, factors linked, directly or not, to socioeconomic aspects. Greek cities are known for their density, their polymorphic structure and their complexity. Thus, planning energy conservation measures is a difficult task, demanding a precise methodological approach, which will embody most of these aspects to a great extent.

In an effort to measure this sentiment, a survey of the Western Regional Science Association's membership was conducted in early 2011 in advance of the Association's 50th anniversary conference. The survey prompted respondents for both quantitative information, in terms of number of meetings attended and basic socio-demographic characteristics, as well as more qualitative information, such as favorite meeting locations and meeting recollections. This paper provides an analysis of both the quantitative and narrative elements of the survey. In addition, it provides a profile of current membership, based on survey respondents. The results suggest that respondents do, indeed, view the WRSA as special, and that this sentiment is a result of both longstanding conference quality and an environment of collegiality and friendship.

The methodology presented has the following major improvements: it simulates private car ownership on an income-level basis, takes into account car purchase prices, separates sales into purchases for fleet growth and for replacements of scrapped vehicles, and examines various possible vehicle scrappage patterns for China. The results show that the sales of private light-duty passenger vehicles in China could reach 23-42 million by 2050, with the share of new-growth purchases representing 16-28%. The total vehicle stock may be 530-623 million by 2050. We compare this study to other publicly available studies in terms of both projection methodology and results. A sensitivity analysis shows that vehicle sales are more affected than levels of vehicle stock by the model parameters, which makes projecting sales more difficult owing to the lack of reliable input data for key model parameters. Because it considers key factors in detail, the sales and stock projection module of the FEEI model offers many advantages over previous models and is capable of simulating various policy scenarios.

However, in terms of its practical implementation it, firstly, faces a number of complex institutional barriers, while, secondly, involves a risk of being dominated by a narrow technocratic agenda for energy/carbon reduction that may overtake the socially progressive pursuits of housing policy. Energy efficiency strategies for the residential sector must, therefore, be multidimensional, fully synergised with housing policy, and incorporating the principles of equity, access and a balanced geographical development. This paper discusses a strategic policy framework, which was designed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) to address those important needs in international policy. The document - Action Plan for Energy-efficient Housing in the UNECE Region - outlines a number of goals, targets and actions structured at three dimensions: (i) governance and finance, (ii) technological advancement, and (iii) access and affordability.

Under the assumption of more efficient energy provision which benefits customers a large number of former energy monopolists have been privatized in line with the liberalization of energy markets in Germany at the end of the 1990s. However, current re-municipalizations are justified by similar arguments in the public debate. Based on a dataset on the ownership structure of energy providers we find that public property or private property itself is not the decisive factor for lower retail and wholesale prices. Rather, a high ownership concentration leads to low prices, regardless of the type of owner. As public investors often seek total ownership of a provider, households, which are less willing to switch, benefit at least indirectly from public ownership. Tests for robustness of our results applying different owner and concentration measures confirm the results independently from the underlying estimation specification. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the application of solar energy is limited in practice due to various barriers. Based on data collected from a survey of practice, this paper identifies the key barriers to the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy systems in Hong Kong. These include high initial and repair cost, long payback period, inadequate installation space and service infrastructure, lack of participation of stakeholders/community in energy policy and lack of incentives by legislation and regulation. Recommendations for addressing these barriers are proposed. For example, the high cost of solar PV energy systems can be reduced by the development and mass production of low-cost fabrication technologies and high performance PV technologies. Solar thermal applications should be encouraged as they are much more economical than solar PVs. It is also recommended that the Hong Kong Government adopt strategies to encourage a greater use of solar energy systems. The results from this study not only provide useful information for the Government, the private sector and consumers in Hong Kong but are also likely to apply equally to other similar regions around the world.

Energy analysis determined that the system paid back its embodied energy in just 4.5 years. LCA revealed that the embodied impacts were offset by the electricity generated to provide a net environmental benefit in most categories. Only carcinogens, ecotoxicity and minerals had a small net lifetime burden. A financial analysis was undertaken from the householder's perspective, alongside cost-benefit analysis from a societal perspective. The results of both indicated that the systems are unlikely to pay back their investment over the 25 year lifetime. However, the UK is in an important period (2010/11) of policy transition with a move away from the 'technology subsidies' of the Low Carbon Buildings Programme (LCBP) and towards a 'market development policy' of feed-in tariffs. Representing the next stage on an innovation S-curve this is expected to facilitate rapid PV uptake, as experienced in countries such as Germany, Denmark, and Spain. The results of the present study clearly demonstrate the importance of the new government support scheme to the future uptake of BIPV.

Using a data set on twenty-nine Chinese provinces for the period 1985-2008, this paper establishes a threshold model to analyse the relationship between spillover effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) and regional innovation in China. There is clear evidence of double-threshold effects of regional innovation on productivity spillovers from FDI. Specifically, only when the level of regional innovation reaches the minimum innovation threshold will FDI in the region begin to produce positive productivity spillovers. Furthermore, positive productivity spillovers from FDI will be substantial only when the level of regional innovation attains a higher threshold. The double threshold divides Chinese provinces into three super-regions in terms of innovation, with most provinces positioned within the middle-level innovation super-region.

In the Polish-German border region, the fund scores well on the first four conditions, related to the promotion of individual trust. It performs less well on the three conditions for scaling up individual trust to form social capital.

In addition to extending the analysis of the Great Recession with the latest monthly figures available for the world as a whole, we have introduced regional and country level analysis, and also a broader view using annual data for periods of around twenty years. The results generally confirm what was observed by Eichengreen and O'Rourke and other authors who have dealt with industrial activity. However, our approach emphasizes two elements that we believe should be incorporated into the debate: the actual development of the industrial sector (especially the manufacturing subsector) in the years preceding each crisis and the stage of development of the prevailing technological paradigm when the productive contraction occurred.","[Parejo, Antonio] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Sudria, Carles] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; University of Barcelona,"Parejo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",,"Sudrià, Carles/H-9023-2015","Sudrià, Carles/0000-0002-0922-1382",,,,,50,3,3,0,16,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

This study explores the extent of that process, identifying sub-centres of employment using the double threshold methodology of job concentration and employment density in Mexico City (Mexico), Lima (Peru) and Fortaleza (Brazil). The results, although partial due to an absence of data on informal employment, indicate that Latin American metropolises are moving towards polycentric structures. But the identified employment sub-centres are mostly located in or near the metropolitan core, which practically excludes the formation of polycentric nodes in the metropolitan periphery.","[Fernandez-Maldonado, Ana Maria] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Romein, Arie] Delft Univ Technol, OTB Res Inst, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Verkoren, Otto] Univ Utrecht, NL-3731 EP De Bilt, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology; Utrecht University,"Fernández-Maldonado, AM (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, POB 5043, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",a.m.fernandezmaldonado@tudelft.nl; a.romein@tudelft.nl; verko053@planet.nl; renatappp@gmail.com,,"Fernandez-Maldonado, Ana Maria/0000-0002-9587-1671",,,,,66,65,70,3,69,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Spanish regional unemployment revisited: the role of capital accumulation, Regional Studies. This paper provides new evidence for the evolution of regional unemployment rates in Spain over the period between 1980 and 2000. It argues that interactive dynamic systems of labour demand, wage setting and labour force equations (1) allow for a richer interpretation of regional disparities, and (2) can capture the unemployment effects of growing variables such as capital stock. After classifying the seventeen Spanish regions into high and low unemployment groups using kernel and cluster techniques, a structural labour market model is estimated for each group and the unemployment contributions of investment, benefits, taxes and the oil price are evaluated. It is found that the main driving force of regional unemployment swings is capital accumulation.","[Bande, Roberto] Univ Santiago de Compostela, GAME IDEGA, Dept Econ, Fa Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, E-15782 Santiago De Compostela, A Coruna, Spain; [Karanassou, Marika] Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; University of London,"Bande, R (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, GAME IDEGA, Dept Econ, Fa Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Ave Burgo S-N, E-15782 Santiago De Compostela, A Coruna, Spain.",Roberto.bande@usc.es; m.karanassou@qmul.ac.uk,,"Bande Ramudo, Roberto/0000-0002-0780-6803",,,,,65,17,17,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We find that the test is unbiased, has considerable power and approximates the asymptotic normal distribution even for medium-sized sample sizes, empirically confirming the theoretical results of Kelejian and Prucha. However, some caution is needed, since the statistic turns out to be sensitive to misspecification in the form of heteroscedasticity.

Given the predictable relationship between polarization and conflict, it would seem logical to evaluate the degree to which the distribution of countries - for example, in terms of their CO2 emissions per capita - would be structured through groups which in themselves are antagonistic, as well as their evolution over time. This paper takes the concept of polarization to explore this distribution for the period 1992-2010, looking at different analytic approaches related to the concept. Specifically, it makes a comparative evaluation of the results associated with endogenous multi-polarization measures (i.e. EGR and DER indices), exogenous measures (i.e. Z-K or multidimensional index) and strict bipolarization measures (i.e. Wolfson's measure). Indeed, the interest lies not only in evaluating the global situation of polarization by comparing the different approaches and their temporal patterns, but also in examining the explanatory capacity of the different proxy groups used as a possible reference for designing global environmental policy from a group premise.

It is assumed that when countries cooperate they coordinate their investments so as to minimize the agreement costs of controlling emissions. Further it is assumed that in such cases they also pool their R&D efforts so as to fully internalize the spillover effects of their investments in R&D. In order to analyze the scope of cooperation, an agreement formation game is solved in three stages. First, countries decide whether or not to sign the agreement. Then, in the second stage, signatories (playing together) and non-signatories (playing individually) select their investment in R&D. Finally, in the third stage, each country decides on its level of emissions non-cooperatively. For linear environmental damages and quadratic investment costs, our findings show that the maximum participation in a R&D agreement consists of six countries and that participation decreases as spillover effects increase until a minimum participation consisting of three countries is reached.

Lai and Tsai (J Urban Econ 63:536-543, 2008) generalize the traditional Alonso-Mills-Muth model by introducing a monopoly vendor and show that the vendor will choose a boundary location. We generalize their model by allowing for inter-city shopping, which is very common in the real world. The location choice of a monopoly vendor and the consequent changes of urban configuration in two adjacent cities are discussed. This paper shows that as the distance between two CBDs decreases, the vendor may choose to locate at an inner city boundary, at the mid-point between the two cities, and at one of the outer boundaries, respectively.

Hence, we propose a two-step analysis focusing on Italian regions for the period 2000-2009. In the first step, we verify by means of Stochastic Frontier Approach that Central and Northern Italy regions are more efficient than Southern Italy ones in the matching process between demand and supply of jobs for disabled people. Then, the efficiency results are analyzed using a Markov Spatial Transition Matrix in order to provide insights into the transitions of regions between different efficiency levels, taking their local context into account. The results of this analysis show that good neighbors are important in promoting the improvement of regions' performance. However, the effects produced by bad neighbors should not be underestimated, especially when they are concentrated in an area of the country and show a time-space persistence. The effect of a persistent dualism on the performance of Italian regions with respect to the application of Law 68/99 represents a problem for policy-makers. Hence, they must seriously consider it, especially when regions with low efficiency scores are surrounded by neighbors with poor efficiency score and show an unhealthy poorly performing labor market.","Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ, I-65127 Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Agovino, M (通讯作者)，Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.",agovino.massimo@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,8,8,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This paper challenges the proposition that Germany suffers from an economic East-West gap. Since core-periphery patterns are common anywhere, peripheral East Germany should not be expected to converge to Western metropolitan areas. Studying growth patterns for cores and peripheries separately, no specific East-West differences in growth are found. Poor peripheries grow faster than richer ones throughout Germany, while income gaps among cores seem to be increasing. Since poorer cores are relatively prevalent in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), this resembles an East-West issue. In fact, the distribution of growth in Germany occurs along core-periphery lines rather than an East-West division.","Univ Groningen, Dept Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Maseland, R (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",r.k.j.maseland@rug.nl,,"Maseland, Robbert/0000-0003-1631-7734",,,,,48,7,7,2,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In order to design and implement effective energy policy instruments, it is necessary to have information on energy demand price and income elasticities in addition to sound indicators of energy efficiency. This research combines the approaches taken. in energy demand modelling and frontier analysis in order to econometrically estimate the level of energy efficiency for the residential sector in the EU-27 member states for the period 1996 to 2009. The estimates for the energy efficiency confirm that the EU residential sector indeed holds a relatively high potential for energy savings from reduced inefficiency. Therefore, despite the common objective to decrease 'wasteful' energy consumption, considerable variation in energy efficiency between the EU member states is established. Furthermore, an attempt is made to evaluate the impact of energy-efficiency measures undertaken in the EU residential sector by introducing an additional set of variables into the model and the results suggest that financial incentives and energy performance standards play an important role in promoting energy efficiency improvements, whereas informative measures do not have a significant impact.

The total reduction potential is 499.8 million t-CO2 by 2030. 4.8 Gt-CO2 potential will be achieved cumulatively to 2030. By 2030, total primary energy consumption of Chinese building sector will rise continuously to 1343 Mtce in the reference scenario and 1114 Mtce in the carbon reduction scenario. Total carbon dioxide emission will rise to 2.39 Gt-CO2 and 1.9 Gt-CO2 in two scenarios separately. The average carbon abatement cost of the aforementioned technologies is 19.5 $/t-CO2.

A. Do regions with entrepreneurial neighbours perform better? A spatial econometric approach for German regions, Regional Studies. A Neoclassical production function is used to analyse the effects of knowledge spillovers via entrepreneurship on economic performance of 337 German districts. To take the spatial dependence structure of the data into account, a spatial Durbin model was estimated. The importance of the choice of the appropriate weight matrix is highlighted. Positive knowledge spillover effects via entrepreneurship and competitiveness - improving the effects of entrepreneurship capital within a certain region as well as between regions - are found. However, the significance of the spatial spillover effects largely depends on the choice of the weight matrix. This is seen as evidence that positive and negative spatial spillover effects of entrepreneurship capital cancel out.","[Pijnenburg, Katharina; Kholodilin, Konstantin A.] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Pijnenburg, K (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",kpijnenburg@diw.de; kkholodilin@diw.de,"Kholodilin, Konstantin/ABA-7108-2021; Kholodilin, Konstantin/AAI-9535-2020","Kholodilin, Konstantin/0000-0001-7165-0228",,,,,48,30,32,2,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This research evaluates a unique case in which the marketability of gypsum by-product produced from sulfur dioxide (SO2) scrubbing operations at coal-fired electric plants has a theoretically ambiguous impact on pollution emissions. Intuitively, the ability to market flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum provides incentives for electricity generating plants to operate their scrubbers more efficiently by providing gypsum revenues, and lowering gypsum disposal costs. Gypsum marketability also creates incentives for plants to burn coal with higher sulfur content in order to increase their gypsum (CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O) production. The overall impact of FGD gypsum marketability on boiler-level SO2 emissions is therefore the empirical question of interest. Electricity boiler-level fixed-effect estimations suggest annual SO2 emissions decline by 3494 tons (39%) as a result of gypsum marketing. An upper bound on the total external benefits associated with the reduced SO2 emissions is estimated at $350.6 billion (2011$), or roughly 2.1% of the total benefits of the U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA) from 1990 to 2010.

The calculations were based on a rigorous theoretical model, which allows to determine photoconversion efficiency, optimal electric power output and other photovoltaic electrical characteristics at arbitrary angles of solar irradiance incidence on an a-Si:H-based SC. Parameters of the a-Si:H SC under consideration provide photoconversion efficiency of 10% at 12:00 noon on equinox day at the 45 degrees N latitude despite small total thickness of 0.7 mu m of the a-Si:H SC structure up to the rear contact. Normalization of the obtained results by maximal values enables one to infer respective time dependencies for other types of SCs. In combination with the data on average numbers of sunny days per year (or average annual sunshine hours) for certain geographical regions, this provides a way for understanding the feasibility of solar electricity generation in these regions. Based on this study, we identify regions of Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, for which electricity generation exceeds the average values by over 30%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Its objectives included addressing the health impacts of solid fuel use in households. Fourteen years later, and with household electrification at over 80%, millions still use solid fuels and yet ambitious policy objectives to address this situation are not being met. Using three theoretical frameworks; institutional capacity, policy inheritance and the symbolic use of policy, this paper analyses the reasons why household energy policy objectives related to solid fuels and health, as stated in the 1998 South African energy policy, have not. been implemented. The results of the analysis show that the symbolic use of policy, including meanings of objects used for meeting policy objectives is the most critical explanation. The paper illustrates that political and historical contexts are critical to understanding policy outcomes in developing and transition countries which often experience tensions between implementing what may seem as objective policies, and that matches their political and historical experiences and aspirations. We recommend that policy analysts in the energy sector complement currently common methods to include political contexts of policy development and implementation in order to better understand why policy makers chose to implement certain policies over others.

Industrial location and spatial dependence: an empirical application, Regional Studies. This paper tries to resolve some of the main shortcomings in the empirical literature on location decisions for new plants, that is, spatial effects and over-dispersion. Spatial effects are omnipresent, being a source of over-dispersion in the data as well as a factor shaping the functional relationship between the variables that explain a firm's location decisions. Using count data models, empirical researchers have dealt with over-dispersion and excess zeros by developments of the Poisson regression model. This study aims to take this a step further by adopting Bayesian methods and models in order to tackle the excess of zeros, spatial and non-spatial over-dispersion, and spatial dependence simultaneously. Data for Catalonia (Spain) are used and location determinants are analysed to that end. The results show that spatial effects are determinant. Additionally, over-dispersion is decomposed into an unstructured independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) effect and a spatially structured effect.","[Liviano, Daniel] Univ Oberta Catalunya UOC, Av Tibidabo 39-43, E-08035 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ QURE CREIP, E-43204 Reus, Catalonia, Spain; [Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria] Inst Econ Barcelona IEB, E-08034 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Liviano, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oberta Catalunya UOC, Av Tibidabo 39-43, E-08035 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",dliviano@uoc.edu; josepmaria.arauzo@urv.cat,"Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria/D-6612-2013","Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria/0000-0002-3801-223X",,,,,64,15,16,2,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In many cases, political obstacles have prevented full and effective implementation of donor-promoted reforms. This paper examines the political economy of power sector reform in Fiji from 1996 to 2013. Reform has been pursued with political motives in a context of clientelism. Policy inconsistency and reversal is explained by the political instability of ethnic-based politics in Fiji. Modest success has been achieved in recent years despite these challenges, with Fiji now considered a model of power sector reform for other Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) in the Pacific. The experience demonstrates that reform is possible within difficult political environments, but it is challenging, takes time and is not guaranteed. The way in which political motives have driven and shaped reform efforts also highlights the need for studies of power sector reform to direct greater attention toward political drivers behind reform.

The imprudent use of antibiotics is threatening the capacity of the healthcare system internationally. Similarly, in Australia the increasing reliance on air-conditioning to maintain thermal comfort is contributing to rising peak demand and electricity prices, and is placing an inequitable health and financial burden on vulnerable heat-stressed households. This paper analyses policy responses to these problems through the lens of social practice theory. In the health sector, campaigns are attempting to emphasise the social health implications of antibiotic use. In considering this approach in relation to the problem of air-conditioned cooling and how to change the ways in which people keep cool during peak times, our analysis draws on interviews with 80 Australian households. We find that the problem of peak electricity demand may be reduced through attention to the social health implications of air-conditioned cooling on very hot days. We conclude that social practice theory offers a fruitful analytical route for identifying new avenues for research and informing policy responses to emerging health and environmental problems.

We study the peer effect, or social interaction, process catalyzed by SCOs to understand the impact of these organizations on the residential PV market. Using a standardized search methodology across spatial scales (state; city; neighborhoods), we identify and characterize the operations of 228 SCOs formed in the U.S. between 1970 and 2012. We also present case studies of four successful SCOs and find that a common thread of why these SCOs are successful involves effectively leveraging trusted community networks combined with putting together a complete information and financial-tools package for use by interested communities. Finally, our findings suggest that empirical studies that attempt statistical identification and estimation of peer effects should pay close attention to the role of SCOs, as the social interactions engendered by SCOs may be correlated both with the level of social learning and the socio-demographic characteristics of the communities of interest.

In this way, we end up with three income panels; namely, high income, middle income, and low income panels. In the empirical part, we draw on the growth theory and augment the classical growth model, which consists of capital stock, labor force and inflation, with foreign direct investment and energy. Generally, we show mixed results about the interrelationship between energy consumption, FDI and economic growth. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The study projected energy demand and CO2, CO, HC, NOx, and PK10 emissions for Business-As-Usual (BAU) and alternative scenarios and compared the results while aiming to determine optimal transportation policies to reduce energy demand and emissions. The results indicated that the adoption of EURO 4 emission standards provides the greatest reduction in energy use at 10.8%, while the best cases for the various gas emissions were split among different options. In addition, a combination of all of the alternatives is expected to lower energy use by 27.8% and to reduce CO2, CO, HC, NOx and PM10 by 30.3%, 60.3%, 59.0%, 48.2% and 66.4%, respectively.

Bilateral negotiations in the free market have been scarce. In 2011 wind farms were allowed to bid in 'A minus 5 (A-5)' auctions, for energy with first delivery date 5 years ahead. This new design was expected to stimulate negotiations in the free market, as the 20-year contract in the regulated market eases financing while the 5-year grace period grants wind farms the option to sell whatever energy is generated beforehand in the free market. We modeled bidders' price derision in A - 5 auctions as Real Options and concluded that given the low prices averaging USD 50/MW h, winners are tempted to defer investment, expecting more favorable equipment and energy prices, or a better knowledge of the wind site. Construction is likely to begin in 2-3 years, with little time left for the free market. Bidders that consider the option of eventually abandoning the project are more price competitive, increasing chances that some wind farms will never materialize. Therefore, this attempt to foster the free market may not pay-off and, moreover, it may have the unfavorable effect of turning Brazil's energy expansion planning a more difficult task.

The model incorporates controls for earnings of both spouses preceding the move, and explicitly addresses unmeasured heterogeneity in the family decision to migrate.

This study assesses the impact of structural changes and outliers on volatility persistence of three crude oil markets - Brent, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) - between January 2, 1985 and June 17, 2011. We identify outliers using a new semi-parametric test based on conditional heteroscedasticity models. These large shocks can be associated with particular event patterns, such as the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, the Operation Desert Storm, the Operation Desert Fox, and the Global Financial Crisis as well as OPEC announcements on production reduction or US announcements on crude inventories. We show that outliers can bias (i) the estimates of the parameters of the equation governing volatility dynamics; (ii) the regularity and non-negativity conditions of GARCH-type models (GARCH, IGARCH, FIGARCH and HYGARCH); and (iii) the detection of structural breaks in volatility, and thus the estimation of the persistence of the volatility.

It is crucial to know the level of acceptance of MRE among Malaysians in order to push the technology forward. A survey was conducted to investigate public acceptance of MRE in SS2, Petaling Jaya. In addition, a face-to-face interview was conducted to understand the concerns of an investor about investing in renewable energy (RE) projects. The results of analysis showed that 82.8% of the respondents support MRE implementation in Malaysia. However, 56.8% of the respondents are reluctant to pay for green electricity. The reason is directly linked to the NIMBYist (NIMBY=Not in My Backyard) attitudes of Malaysian citizens. They are unwilling to support green energy by involving themselves, participating or paying money. Furthermore, the interviewee, on behalf of investors, expressed some opinions on concerns about investment in RE projects. Several ministries and departments are suggested as being important in MRE development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Scope: The method determines a combination of energy saving measures that have been optimised in regards to the future cost for energy. Subsequently, the method evaluates the cost of undertaking the retrofit measures as compared to the cost of demolishing the existing building and thereafter erecting a new one. Several economically beneficial combinations of energy saving measures can be determined. All of them are a trade-off between investing in retrofit measures and buying renewable energy. The overall cost of the renovation considers the market value of the property, the investment in the renovation, the operational and maintenance costs. A multi-family building is used as an example to clearly illustrate the application of the method from macroeconomic and private financial perspectives. Conclusion: The example shows that the investment cost and future market value of the building are the dominant factors in deciding whether to renovate an existing building or to demolish it and thereafter erect a new building. Additionally, it is concluded in the example that multi-family buildings erected in the period 1850-1930 should be renovated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The potential failure of national industry agreements to take into account productivity levels in the least productive regions has been considered as one of the causes of regional unemployment in European countries. This paper investigates the role of the collective bargaining structure in the relationship between regional wage and productivity differentials. Using a rich Belgian-linked employer-employee dataset, it is found that the more an industry is decentralized in terms of wage setting, the more regional differences in productivity are reflected in wages. It is concluded that the current Belgian wage-setting system already includes mechanisms that allow regional productivity to be taken into account.","[Rusinek, Michael] Cent Econ Council, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium; [Tojerow, Ilan] Univ Libre Bruxelles, SBS EM Dulbea Ceb, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Tojerow, Ilan] FNRS, Brussels, Belgium; [Tojerow, Ilan] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Rusinek, M (通讯作者)，Cent Econ Council, 17-21 Ave Joyeuse Entree, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",miru@ccecrb.fgov.be; itojerow@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Since the global financial crisis in 2008, SWFs' investments have resulted in national security concerns of host countries because SWFs continue to expand rapidly and have become increasingly active in real-time strategic transactions. Given this background, China, which has the biggest SWF in the world, is facing severe challenges of energy resources shortages while its plan is to accomplish social and economic development goals. Energy security is a key driving force of the energy investment policy of China's SWFs. This makes the SWF investments more complicated and more politically sensitive. The combination of sovereign rights and the strategic importance of energy also makes geopolitics more complicated and brings more uncertainty to SWF investments. This article explores the relationship between energy security and energy investments of China's SWFs. It is recognised that the energy investment of SWFs must follow a sustainable path to coordinate energy security, economic growth, return on investment and national security concerns. Government policymakers are urged to balance the financial and political returns on SWFs against potential negative effects. The conclusion presents insights for policymakers, energy scholars and SWF researchers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Historically, production costs have fluctuated as influenced by the cost-increasing effects of depletion versus the cost-reducing effects of technological progress. This paper aims to review several methods for assessing current and long-term costs. Despite the uncertainty of such estimation, evidence shows that production costs in the foreseeable future might not increase dramatically and actually could decrease as petroleum development methods improve and additional supplies come online. Recent examples include the commercially viable production of unconventional oil and gas resources that has kept energy prices contained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Specific focus is given to the implementation of a downstream form of regulation known as the first-deliverer policy. Under this policy, importers (i.e., first-deliverers) of electricity into California are responsible for the emissions associated with the power plants from which the power originated, even if those plants are physically located outside of California. We find that, absent strict non-economic barriers to changing import patterns, such policies are extremely vulnerable to reshuffling of import resources. The net impact implies that the first-deliverer policies will be only marginally more effective than a conventional source-based regulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of their generally-acknowledged significant contribution to the society, researches on the management of their finance are not much. This research therefore advances the frontiers of knowledge by comparatively analysing the financial management practices of two non-profit organizations - a faith-based and a community-interest organization. The research adopted a field-based approach by evaluating the financial management practices of study organizations using methods such as interviews, study of documents, artefacts and published annual reports. The research found out that though the two organizations are fully aware of the risks involved in the management of finance, different strategies are adopted to mitigate the risks. Though not established for commercial purposes, Non-Profit organizations are encouraged to embark on cost control and reduction to justify their funding by financiers.","[Femi, Oladeji Tolulope; Babajidemichael, Oyewo; Abosede, Akinjare Victoria] Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Sch Business, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,,tolulope.oladeji@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; oluwajide.oyewo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; victoria.akinjare@covenantuniversitv.edu.ng,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,2541,2560,,,,,,20,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308101039,0

Agreed rules should lead to long-term balanced and sustainable public finances. It would be correct to assume that the respect of agreed rules would lead to long-term balanced budgets. In our previous research we established an indicator A1 which gives a level of non-compliance with the required rules. Surprisingly, it was found that despite the compliance with required criteria a large number of countries would be facing an increase in the level of debt.

For this purpose both directly observable variables as well as a set of unobservable factors are used. These unobservable factors are characterized by additional time series of auxiliary economic observable variables bearing the influence (dynamic) of these factors. To perfectly grasp the influence of factors usually the bigger amount of auxiliary variables are required. For this experiment we use macroeconomic data on inflation (CPI), interest rate, and the GDP growth rate. To generate the factors, we take data on technological level and monetary policy. For a proper estimation of parameters in the VAR model, we use a two step procedure. In the first step we apply the principal component method to estimate the factors from auxiliary time series. In the second step a standard method of estimation technique for a VAR model is used, where the unobservable factors are represented by their estimates from the first stage. The results of a modified VAR model obtained by using this approach on the data of the Czech economy are compared with the ones from traditional methods and they confirm the superiority of this method to traditional ones.","[Kodera, Jan; Quang Van Tran] Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kodera, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",kodera@vse.cz; tran@se.cz,"Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022",,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,443,448,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900077,0

Moreover, for each service individually, the marketing-mix has to be adjusted to the characteristics enlightened. Health care services are no different. Some scientists stated that a more suitable approach for services would be composed of 6Ps, 8Ps or 7Ps while for the health care services some experts replaced the 4Ps with 4Rs.

However, there are no publications that objectively determine the influence of a landscape on the terroir. The hypothesis that 5 odorant compounds could come from the shrub flora of vitivinicultural geographical areas has been posed. The selected plant was jarilla (gender Larrea) and the study proceeded with leaves, stems, primary and secondary roots, flowers, pollen and fruits of jarilla in order to find in fact any of the 5 compounds. The methodology was to analyze the odorant components of jarilla, the jarilla's surrounding soils and vines of different geographical areas, the volatile compounds absorption by the vine roots and the mechanisms of volatile compounds setting of the bloom. For all the studies, there were seventy-one volatile compounds used as variables, obtained by gas chromatography, by application of a multivariate statistical model for classification and by cluster method. It was proved that there is a hierarchical relationship of the aromatic variables between pollen, roots and leaves of jarilla on one side, and the vineyards soils, vine blossoms and wines on the other. This study confirms that the volatile compounds of jarilla, arrive to the vineyards in form of pollen and fruits to be later absorbed by vine roots as well as by blooms, forming so an interactive ecosystem unity. It is concluded that the 5 volatile compounds could act as molecular markers of geographical areas.","[Romano, R.; Trebes, V.; Gargantini, R.] Natl Inst Vitiviniculture, Special Analyt Stand Dept, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina",,"Romano, R (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Vitiviniculture, Special Analyt Stand Dept, San Martin 430, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina.",raquelromano@inv.gov.ar,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,7,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2014,3.0,,1.0,,,,,,,10.1051/bioconf/20140302005,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BB8BQ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346256100020,0

Therefore, teacher education draws more and more attention. On the basis that foreign teacher educational pattern is analyzed, this thesis discusses enlightenment which teacher education patterns in foreign countries bring to Chinese teacher education reform. Since the 1980s, overall quality of basic education in all countries of the world has declined and benefits have been low, which arouses all social sectors' worries and draws much attention from them. In order to improve educational quality practically, America begins to carry out reform of high quality education in order to improve educational quality and benefits. During this period, Britain changes the method nationally uniform course practically, which has never been used before, and improves all schools' teaching ability by national uniform standard in order to provide better education for students. At the same time, countries like France, Germany and Japan carry out comprehensive reform and put forward higher requirements for teacher education. In the quality-oriented education reform which is still being developed in China, teachers are an important factor that affects effectiveness of new curriculum reform undauntedly. Besides, improvement in overall quality of teachers depends on overall quality of teacher education in the country. Therefore, as new curriculum reform develops, teacher education reform draws more and more attention. For this, we should consult advanced experience in teacher education in foreign countries actively, which is quite helpful for improvement in teacher educational conditions.","[Zhang, Xiaoxia] Hebei North Univ, Zhangjiakou 075000, Peoples R China",Hebei North University,,,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-62520-34-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2014,13.0,,,,,,197,201,,,,,,5,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC0SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349486900044,0

Reforming energy subsidies have important implications for sustainable development through their effects on energy price, energy use and CO2 emission. This paper applies a price-gap approach to estimate China's fossil-fuel related subsidies with the consideration of the external cost. Results indicate that the magnitude of subsidies amounted to CNY 1214.24 billion in 2008, equivalent to 4.04% of GDP of that year. Subsidies for oil products are the largest, followed by subsidies for the coal and electricity. Furthermore, an input-output model is used to analyze the impacts of energy subsidies reform on different industries and general price indexes. The findings show that removal of energy subsidies will have significant impact on energy-intensive industry, and consequently push up the general price level, yet with a small variation. Removing oil products subsidies will have the largest impact, followed by electricity, coal and natural gas.

To date, however, the overall life cycle impact of the HEMS itself has not been taken into account. Thus, no assessment has been made whether the amount of energy saved (e(saved)) outweighs the energy needed for production, use and disposal (e(invested)). Therefore, an eco-cost and a Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) method were used to analyze three distinct types of HEMS. Based on the literature, six scenarios were developed in order to find the break-even point, where e(invested) = e(saved). The results show that the overall impact is dependent on the type of HEMS, and that if the duration of use is short and the achieved savings are small, the benefits do not always outweigh the environmental costs. Care should be taken not to develop HEMS with unnecessarily elaborate parts or functionalities and that their own electricity consumption is minimized. The paper concludes by discussing the implication for polices concerning the implementation of smart meters and HEMS and their design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[van Dam, S.

At the same time, European Member States have launched support mechanisms to stimulate the deployment of renewable electricity sources (RES-E). RES-E injections displace CO2 emissions within the sectors operating under the EU ETS and they reduce the demand for European Union Allowances (EUAs), thereby reducing the EUA price. This paper presents the results of an ex post analysis to quantify the impact of RES-E deployment on the EUA price and CO2 emissions in the Western and Southern European electricity sector during the period from 2007 to 2010, following from an operational partial equilibrium model of the electricity sector. This study shows that the CO2 displacement from the electricity sector to other ETS sectors due to RES-E deployment can be up to more than 10% of historical CO2 emissions in the electricity sector. The EUA price decrease caused by RES-E deployment turns out to be likely significant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The amount of these adverse impacts is assessed through a general equilibrium model which endogenizes both the reduction of oil exportation revenues under international climate policy and the macroeconomic effect of carbon pricing on Middle-East's economy. We show that compensating the drop of exportation revenues does not offset GDP and welfare losses because of the time profile of the general equilibrium effects. When considering instead compensation based on GDP losses, the effectiveness of monetary transfers proves to be drastically limited by general equilibrium effects in opened economies. The main channels of this efficiency gap are investigated and its magnitude proves to be conditional upon strategic and policy choices of the Middle-East. This leads us to suggest that other means than direct monetary compensating transfers should be discussed to engage the Middle-East in climate policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

On average, we estimate that the levelized cost of coal, including externalities, is $84/MWh. It is efficient to abate air pollutants (SO, NOx and PM2.5) but not CO2. With abatement the cost wrought by environmental externalities equals $23/MWh or 27% of total cost. Depending on the price of coal, the levelized cost may vary between $72 and $99/MWh. The levelized cost of wind is $144/MWh with capacity factor of 24%. This cost includes backup capacity to maintain LOLP, which equals $13/MWh or 9% of total cost. The levelized cost of wind varies between $107/MWh with capacity factors of 35% to $217/MWh with capacity factors of 15%. Wind is competitive only with capacity factors around 35% and very high coal prices. Alternatively, a carbon price of $73/tCO(2) ($268/tc) would make coal and wind equally costly. But this value implies a marginal damage at the 98th percentile of the distribution deduced from Tol's (2011) estimates, rather far from the mean, $16/tCO(2) ($59/tc). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to understand the dynamics of systems adoption and operation, that have fostered market based adoption of solar lighting, we interviewed rural households from six districts that had purchased solar lighting systems using loans at market rates, the rural banks that provided loans and the solar firms that marketed the technology. We found that a large proportion of households in our sample were connected to the grid but chose to install solar lighting because they considered the power supply from the grid to be unreliable. Households in our sample reported savings on electricity costs and reduced kerosene usage for lighting. In addition to providing credit, banks also play a key role in ensuring good service and maintenance; the viability of the SLS market is thus critically dependent on the role that the banks play as intermediaries between consumers and solar firms in rural areas. Government programs should be carefully designed to match the incentives of firms, banks and consumers if the successes of the 'Karnataka model' are to be repeated and amplified.

They are expected to shift from a passive role as consumer of electricity to an active role as co-provider. In this article, the extent to which current technologies, products and services empower end-users to take up an active role as co-providers is evaluated. Based on a review of literature and related pilot projects, current approaches were found to be driven by technical and financial considerations. There appears to be a lack of product and service design that supports end-users in their role as co-providers in a smart grid. This is reflected in the lack of thought given to how the end-users' process of behavioral change can be supported to enable the transition from consumer to co-provider. Several recommendations are provided for product and service designers towards fostering the role of co-provider, which comes under under: (a) user interaction needs, (b) approaches to behavioral change and (c) community initiatives and management of resources. Designers are considered to play a bridging role between policy Making and engineering, while facilitating involvement of end-users in the design process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In many countries, the regulators of this sector apply frontier methods such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) or stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to estimate the efficient cost of operation. In Finland, a new StoNED method was adopted in 2012. This paper compares DEA, SFA and StoNED in the context of regulating electricity distribution. Using data from Finland, we compare the impacts of methodological choices on cost efficiency estimates and acceptable cost. While the efficiency estimates are highly correlated, the cost targets reveal major differences. In addition, we examine performance of the methods by Monte Carlo simulations. We calibrate the data generation process (DGP) to closely match the empirical data and the model specification of the regulator. We find that the StoNED estimator yields a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4% with the sample size 100. Precision improves as the sample size increases. The DEA estimator yields an RMSE of approximately 10%, but performance deteriorates as the sample size increases. The SFA estimator has an RMSE of 144%. The poor performance of SFA is due to the wrong functional form and multicollinearity.

Clean energy consumption at aggregated level of total renewable energy consumption and disaggregated levels of hydroelectric, new renewables, and nuclear energy consumption are tested within a production function framework. A cointegration test reveals a long-term equilibrium relationship between real output, capital, labor, and renewable and non-renewable energy consumption at aggregated level, and a long-term equilibrium relationship between real output, capital, labor, and hydroelectric/new renewables/nuclear and fossil fuel energy consumption at disaggregated level. The capital, labor, and new renewables elasticities of real output are positive and statistically significant, other energy consumption item's elasticities are insignificant. The results from error correction model reveal the interdependencies between new renewables, nuclear, fossil fuel, and total non-renewable energy consumption and economic growth, the unidirectional causality from hydroelectric/total renewable consumption to economic growth, the substitutability between new renewables and fossil fuel consumption, and the substitutability between new renewables and nuclear energy consumption.

This study examines the short-term consumption-side distributional impacts of expanding low-carbon electric supply in the state of Maharashtra, India with a focus on the influence of regulatory discretion in pricing. Households' welfare impacts from economy-wide electricity price shocks are simulated against a baseline that is calibrated to actual household economic and electricity service conditions, including actual electricity budgets, block tier prices and supply rationing. Industrial price impacts are propagated to households using a Leontief input output analysis. Regulatory pricing decisions are evaluated based on social welfare metrics for economic efficiency and income inequality. The analysis reveals new linkages between climate change mitigation, electricity policy and income distribution. Low-income households can be shielded from mitigation impacts without losses in aggregate welfare to the extent that regulators can recover mitigation costs through industrial price increases. Regulators' flexibility to distribute costs across households is constrained by industrial customers migration off the grid. Reduced supply interruptions to the rural poor from the resulting demand contraction are a potential co-benefit of mitigation. Distributional impacts, therefore, depend on other electricity policies that are driven by the political economy of the sector. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The report submitted to Forum of Regulators (FoR) in this regard has recommended uniform rate of increase of BRPO of states and studied the impact of RPO on tariff for FY 2011-2015. However, more rigorous analysis is needed for fixing BRPO in a scientific manner and for fair allocation of incentives to promote RE. This paper attempts to evaluate all states on a common platform to find BRPO, giving due weightage to the state-wise energy demand and RE generation, ensuring minimum change in BRPO of consecutive years and hence less impact of RPO on tariff. To encourage the states to align their actual RPO with BRPO, a financial incentive scheme is proposed giving due weightage to RE consumption, RE capacity addition and RPO compliance of the states. The methods are illustrated for the Indian states using real system data. A study of RPO's impact on electricity tariff of Indian states is also conducted and reported for FY 2011-2015, considering Renewable Energy Certificate (REC). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a matched employer-employee dataset for Sweden, we estimate the influence spatial employment density has on the probability of inter-firm job switching of private sector workers. Our estimates suggest that a doubling of employment density per square kilometer increases the probability that a random worker switches employer by 0.2 % points. The same effect is substantially higher for more skilled workers. While the effect of a doubling of density is limited, the actual differences in density across the regions in our data amount to a factor over 40, rendering differences in density an important explanation for regional variations in rates of inter-firm job switching.","[Andersson, Martin] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Karlskrona, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] BTH, Sch Management, Karlskrona, Sweden; [Thulin, Per] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Thulin, Per] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Blekinge Institute Technology; Royal Institute of Technology,"Andersson, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Karlskrona, Sweden.",martin.andersson@circle.lu.se; per.thulin@indek.kth.se,"Andersson, Martin/AAB-5164-2021","Thulin, Per/0000-0001-8377-1633",,,,,37,15,16,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, several market, economic, institutional, technical, and socio-cultural barriers hinder countries in moving from high to low emission pathway.

Wood and wood products have been the most widely used RES for heat production (RES-H). The lower prices were one of the main reasons which motivated district heating companies to switch fuel to biomass. At the same time subsidies, soft loans, EU Structural Funds for 2007-2013 and some fiscal measures, which are currently available for RES-H promotion, also have some impact on the increase of RES consumption. However, seeking to achieve a 23% national RES target, additional support measures are essential. A qualitative analysis based on the selected set of criteria and consultation with stakeholders showed that energy policy package for RES promotion in the Lithuanian heating sector could encompass the following measures: tax relieves (differentiated VAT and personal income tax breaks), subsidies, soft loans, standardization, support for research, development and demonstration.

Results showed that agricultural phase is the critical step in the production line. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment analysis for the biodiesel production line with mineral diesel production showed environmental advantages of the biofuel production, however requiring a higher land demand. Therefore, biodiesel may not the optimal solution on large scale but might be a good alternative to fossil fuel. This would depend upon the entire production cycle taking place in a limited area.

We critically examine some aspects of the statistical model that may be restrictive in empirical analyses. Specifically, we focus on three aspects. First, we examine the endogeneity of the network or peer groups. Second, we investigate simultaneously alternative definitions of links and the possibility of peer effects arising through multiple networks. Third, we highlight the representation of the traditional linear-in-means model as an autoregressive model, and contrast it with an alternative moving-average model, where the correlation between unconnected individuals who are indirectly connected is limited. Using data on friendship networks from the Add Health dataset, we illustrate the empirical relevance of these ideas.","[Goldsmith-Pinkham, Paul] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Imbens, Guido W.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Harvard University; Stanford University,"Goldsmith-Pinkham, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",pgoldsm@fas.harvard.ed; imbens@stanford.edu,"imbens, guido/P-2333-2019",,"NSF [0631252, 0820361, 0961707]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0961707] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0631252, 0820361] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Financial support for this research was generously provided through NSF grants 0631252, 0820361, and 0961707.

Optimal planning of the power sector with consideration of carbon mitigation for a long-term future remains a complex task, involving many technical alternatives and an infinite number of possible plants installations, retrofitting, and decommissioning over the planning horizon. Previously the authors built a multi-period optimization model for the planning of China's power sector during 2010-2050. Based on that model, this paper executed calculations on the optimal pathways of China's power sector with two typical decision-making modes, which are based on full-information and limited-information hypothesis, and analyzed the impacts on the optimal planning results by two typical types of carbon tax policies including a continuous and stable one and a loose first and tight later one. The results showed that making carbon tax policy for long-term future, and improving the continuity and stability in policy execution can effectively help reduce the accumulated total carbon emissions, and also the cost for carbon mitigation of the power sector. The conclusion of this study is of great significance for the policy makers to make carbon mitigation policies in China and other countries as well. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent literature underlines the need to take a closer look at the composition of the RES-E investor group in order to understand the motives and investment processes of different types of investors. However, existing energy policies generally consider RES-E investments made on a regional or national level, and target investors who evaluate their RES-E investments according to least-cost high-profit criteria. We present empirical evidence to show that RES-E investments are made by a heterogeneous group of investors, that a variety of investors exist and that their formation varies among the different types of renewable sources. This has direct implications for our understanding of the investment process in RES-E and for the study of motives and driving forces of RES-E investors. We introduce a multi-dimensional framework for analyzing differences between categories of investors, which not only considers to the standard economic dimension which is predominant in the contemporary energy literature, but also considers the entrepreneurship, innovation-adoption and institutional dimensions. The framework emphasizes the influence of four main investor-related factors on the investment process which should be studied in future research: motives, background, resources and personal characteristics.

The production of oleaginous derived biodiesel produced by small-scale farmers is a key objective of PNPB. The Social Fuel Seal is one of the instruments for achieving this goal. Five years after the mandatory implementation of program, Brazil is among the world's leading producers of biodiesel. However, the goal of the productive insertion of small-scale farmers in Brazil's less favored regions has not been fully achieved. The Brazilian government has faced difficulties to promote regional development based on PNPB, consequently not reaching the audacious goals that were set at the beginning of the program. In this context of difficulties, the productive arrangements with palm oil should be emphasized. This paper submits in detail the model developed by Agropalma - in partnership with public agencies - together with family farming in the North of the country. These social projects are taken as reference and can promote social inclusion in the country's national biodiesel productive chain. Moreover, this case can serve as an assessment tool for other countries that seek to invest in the production of biodiesel with the concern for the social production inclusion of disadvantaged small-scale family farmers.

In this paper, we analyze their effect on labor productivity growth for German labor market regions for the period from 1994 to 2006. A spatially augmented multiplicative interaction model based on neoclassical growth theory is used, which allows us to assess the marginal effect of regional policy proxied by overall payments of the main German regional development program on the region's convergence speed conditional on its initial income position as well as policy-related spillovers from its spatial neighborhood. Our results show a statistically significant positive effect of regional policy on labor productivity growth, which increases, the further away the supported region is from its steady-state income level, and the more grants are provided to its geographical neighborhood. The latter effect highlights the existence of positive spatial spillover effects from regional policy in Germany, which enhance the attractiveness of the whole macro region for private sector investments. The additional growth stimulus provided by a 1 % increase in the region's funding volume is thereby related to an up to 0.3 % gain in terms of labor productivity growth. For regions with the highest initial gaps to steady-state income in the sample distribution, the regional policy stimulus accounts for almost 8 % of the regions' productivity growth performance.","[Alecke, Bjoern; Untiedt, Gerhard] Gesell Finanz & Regionalanalysen GEFRA, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Mitze, Timo] Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Mitze, T (通讯作者)，Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",Alecke@gefra-muenster.de; Mitze@rwi-essen.de; Untiedt@gefra-muenster.de,,"Mitze, Timo/0000-0003-3799-5200",,,,,42,13,15,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, with the depletion of natural resources, their sustainable development is challenging and transition is important. The Chinese government has made great efforts to help resource-based cities. The purpose of this study is to investigate transition policies and their implementation. Firstly, we reviewed previous studies and summarized the essential elements of some successful resource-based cities, which are useful experiences for Chinese resource-based cities. Secondly, we studied the development of resource-based cities over the past 10 years with a focus on economic development, industrial structure, government revenue and environmental conditions. We found that resource-based cities were less developed compared to other cities. The main reasons are the after-effects of a planned economy, an unreasonable tax system, planning mistakes and misguided resources exploitation policies. Thirdly, we analyzed several aspects of the policy responses after the introduction of transition policies, including designating 69 resource-exhausted cities, supporting cities with funds and projects, formulating transition plans and evaluating transition performance. However, there are some deficiencies in the process of policy implementation. Finally, some recommendations were provided to improve transition performance and sustainable development for resource-based cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The projected average annual demand for metals in the SET-Plan technologies for the decades up to 2020 and 2030 is compared to the known global production volume in 2010. From an initial inventory of over 50 metals, 14 metals were identified that will require 1% or more of the 2010 world supply per annum between 2020 and 2030. These 14 metals are cadmium, dysprosium, gallium, hafnium, indium, molybdenum, neodymium, nickel, niobium, selenium, silver, tellurium, tin and vanadium. These metals were examined further by analysing the effect of market and geo-political factors of supply and demand, which highlighted five metals to represent a high risk to large-scale technology deployment, namely: neodymium, dysprosium, indium, tellurium and gallium. The five metals were further analysed with respect to the wind and solar sectors, showing that the demand of these metals could increase significantly depending on future sub-technology choices. Mitigation strategies to alleviate potential shortages are also discussed, e.g. extending primary output; re-use, re-cycling and waste reduction; and substitution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We show there is considerable latent demand, and suggest that these tolls contradict the aim of greater territorial cohesion.","[McArthur, David Philip; Kleppe, Gisle; Thorsen, Inge] Stord Haugesund Univ Coll, N-5528 Haugesund, Norway; [Uboe, Jan] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Western Norway University of Applied Sciences; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"McArthur, DP (通讯作者)，Stord Haugesund Univ Coll, Bjrnsonsgate 45, N-5528 Haugesund, Norway.",david.mcarthur@hsh.no; gisle.kleppe@hsh.no; inge.thorsen@hsh.no; jan.uboe@nhh.no,"McArthur, David Philip/AAB-4163-2019; McArthur, David/E-9954-2011","McArthur, David Philip/0000-0002-9142-3126; McArthur, David/0000-0002-9142-3126",,,,,36,4,4,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

In the near future, NG will become one of the major energy suppliers for new towns and industrial parks, and work for electric peak shaving when used in distributed energy system/combined cold, heat and power (DES/CCHP). However, as an efficient approach to improve the energy utilization efficiency, DES/CCHP cannot only increase the current energy efficiency from 33% to 50.3% (the world's average), but also reduce the cost of terminal supplies of power, cold, steam and hot water. It will become one of the most important means to control CO2 emissions in the next 20 years, and is essential to China's low carbon industrialization and urbanization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Domestic organic production is thought to play a role in relocalized food networks. However, little is known about the market orientation of organic producers in England and Wales. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach, this paper characterizes national, regional and local markets for organic food from a supply perspective. It identifies local, regional and national market orientations and considers the concentration of marketing channels using the HerfindahlHirschman Index. The analysis demonstrates the heterogeneity of the sector and an uneven geography of organic marketing in England and Wales.","[Lobley, Matt; Butler, Allan; Winter, Michael] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Ctr Rural Policy Res, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Lobley, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Ctr Rural Policy Res, Amory Bldg,Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",m.lobley@exeter.ac.uk; Allan.J.Butler@exeter.ac.uk; D.M.Winter@exeter.ac.uk,,"Lobley, Matt/0000-0003-4774-8422",,,,,47,15,16,0,77,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A fuel cycle screening methodology is introduced that provides a systematic, objective, and traceable method for evaluating and categorizing nuclear fuel cycles according to their performance in meeting sustainability objectives. The goal of the systems engineering approach is to transparently define and justilj the research and development (R&D) necessary to deploy sustainable fuel cycle technologies for a given set of national policy objectives. The approach provides a path for more efficient use of limited R&D resources and facilitates dialog among a variety of stalceholder groups interested in U.S. energy policy, Furthermore, the use of systems engineering principles will allow the FCT Program to more rapidly adapt to future policy changes, including any decisions based on recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. Specifically, if the relative importance of policy objectives changes, the FCT Program will have a structured process to rapidly determine how this impacts potential fuel cycle performance and the prioritization of needed R&D for associated technologies.","[Price, Robert R.; Singh, Bhupinder P.] US DOE, Off Systems Engn Integration NE 51, Germantown, MD 20874 USA; [Mackinnon, Robert J.; Sevougian, S.

The proposed test statistic compares restricted and unrestricted estimators of the difference between the joint distributions, and it can be implemented under minimal smoothness requirements on the underlying honparametric curves and without resorting to smooth estimation. The finite sample properties of the proposed test are examined by means of a Monte Carlo study.

Although, economically, there are many technological opportunities available, the Dutch built environment has difficulty to harvest this potential. This paper applies a sectoral innovation system approach to investigate this apparent paradox. This approach allows to identify and assess systemic barriers that prevent improvement in overall energy efficiency of the Dutch housing sector. Twenty-one experts were interviewed, and a qualitative data analysis was applied to identify barriers, and relate them to key dimensions in the sectoral innovation system framework. From this analysis, we identified poor regulatory design, lack of market demand, and some institutional characteristics of the construction sector as the key systemic barriers that hamper the diffusion of green energy innovations in the Dutch housing sector.

Drawing on the findings of 11 follow-up qualitative interviews with householders involved in a 'Visible Energy Trial', the paper suggests that: (i) over time, smart energy monitors gradually become 'backgrounded' within normal household routines and practices; (ii) the monitors do increase householders' knowledge of and confidence about the amount of electricity they consume; (iii) but, beyond a certain level and for a wide variety of reasons, the monitors do not necessarily encourage or motivate householders to reduce their levels of consumption; and (iv) once equipped with new knowledge and expertise about their levels of electricity consumption, household practices may become harder to change as householders realise the limits to their energy saving potential and become frustrated by the absence of wider policy and market support. The paper concludes by reflecting on the policy and research implications of these findings in relation to future transition pathways to a low-carbon economy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we conduct a survey of energy-saving behavior to clarify the differences among such factors across five major Asian cities. The results from these surveys in Dalian, Chongqing, Fukuoka, Bangkok, and Ho Chi Minh indicate that global warming consciousness, environmental behavior, and social interaction significantly affect energy-saving behavior. Income and age also had weak positive effects on energy-saving behaviors. Social interaction was strongly linked to energy-saving behaviors, particularly in the rural areas of Dalian and Chongqing.

A comprehensive technique used to estimate overall cost and environmental impact of vehicles is known as life cycle assessment (LCA). In this article, a comparative LCA of diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) powered heavy duty refuse collection vehicles (RCVs) is conducted. The analysis utilizes real-time operational data obtained from the City of Surrey in British Columbia, Canada. The impact of the two alternative vehicles is assessed from various points in their life. No net gain in energy use is found when a diesel powered RCV is replaced by a CNG powered RCV. However, significant reductions (approximately 24% CO2-equivalent) in GHG and criteria air contaminant (CAC) emissions are obtained. Moreover, fuel cost estimations based on 2011 price levels and a 5-year lifetime for both RCVs reveal that considerable cost savings may be achieved by switching to CNG vehicles.

Economically, the important parameter is not a physical limit to resources in the ground, but whether market price signals and costs of extraction will indicate the efficiency of extracting conventional or nonconventional resources as opposed to making substitutions over time for other fuels and technologies. We present a hybrid approach to the peak-oil question with two models in which the use of logistic curves for cumulative production are supplemented with data on projected extraction costs and historical rates of capacity increase. While not denying the presence of large quantities of oil in the ground, even with foresight, rates of production of new nonconventional resources are unlikely to be sufficient to make up for declines in availability of conventional oil. Furthermore we show how the logistic-curve approach helps to naturally explain high oil prices even when there are significant quantities of low-cost oil yet to be extracted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Within a bivariate framework, imposed on us due to data limitations, and in an effort to increase the robustness of our results, we employ a variety of causality tests, namely, Hsiao, Toda-Yamamoto, and vector error correction based Granger causality tests. We find strong evidence of a bidirectional relationship both in the short-run and in the long-run, indicating that energy is a limiting factor to economic growth in Lebanon. From a policy perspective, the confirmation of the feedback hypothesis warns against the use of policy instruments geared towards restricting energy consumption, as these may lead to adverse effects on economic growth. Consequently, there is a pressing need to revise the current national energy policy that calls for a 5% energy conservation target. Also, to shield the country from external supply shocks, given its substantial dependence on energy imports, policymakers should emphasize the development of domestic energy resources. Further, the most pertinent implication is that relaxing the present electric capacity shortages should be made a national priority, in view of its potential positive effect on the economy.

Using an industry-level panel dataset for the 1997-2003 period. empirical results show that pollution abatement fees, a proxy for environmental regulations, is positively related to R&D expenditure, implying that stronger environment protection induces more R&D. On the other hand, pollution abatement capital expenditures do not have a statistically significant influence on R&D. Further evaluation of the influence of induced R&D by environment regulations on industrial productivity shows a significant positive association between them. This finding supports the Porter hypothesis that more stringent environmental regulations may enhance rather than lower industrial competitiveness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Such goods are commonly called convenience goods. We modify Hotelling's model of spatial competition so that we can analyze the price equilibrium of duopolists that retail a convenience good. Certain features of the duopolists' demand functions suggest that price competition is more severe in the convenience goods model than in the Hotelling model. The same features complicate the analysis because they mean that a pure strategy price equilibrium does not exist for many locational configurations. Although we are not able to find the mixed strategy price equilibrium analytically, we do present some numerical results on equilibrium prices that broadly confirm this suggestion. We also provide a more general product differentiation interpretation of the convenience good model.","[Eaton, B.

Energy code adoption typically results in an increase in aggregate social welfare by cost effectively reducing energy expenditures. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, I test if relative state funding, a new, objective, multivariate regression-derived measure of government capacity, as well as a vector of control variables commonly used in comparative state research, predict commercial building energy code adoption. The research shows little political influence over historical commercial building energy code adoption in the sample. Colder climates and higher electricity prices also do not predict more frequent code adoptions. I do find evidence of high government capacity states being 60 percent more likely than low capacity states to adopt commercial building energy codes in the following year. Wealthier states are also more likely to adopt commercial codes. Policy recommendations to increase building code adoption include increasing access to low cost capital for the private sector and providing noncompetitive block grants to the states from the federal government.

Even after the Chinese government introduced a policy to develop a standardized, unified, and technologically advanced nuclear power sector in the early 2000s, different technologies continue to be imported. This study uses an institutional lens to explore the decoupling of policy intentions and implementation. The three phases of nuclear technology imports that occurred between the 1980s and 2010 are examined and compared. Data are collected from multiple sources, including the diary of a major decision-maker, news articles, project websites, a regulation database, domestic journal articles, and interviews with industry experts. Using interactive content analysis, this study identifies the multiple policy principles and goals of different domains that led to different import arrangements and interpretations of the available foreign technology. New arrangements do not replace but overlap the existing ones that are perpetuated by the actors who benefit from them. The results show that the multiplicity of China's nuclear power sector, coupled with the government's late attempts at standardization, contributes to diversified policy implementation. They provide important policy implications for the sustainable development of the sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Chi, Cheryl S.

We find that votes on these laws are indeed increasingly partisan, with Republicans supporting RPS laws especially less than Democrats. However, Republicans' support for these laws is higher in states with weaker fossil fuel industries. Furthermore. Republicans tend to support the laws where median household income is lower, environmental organizations are weaker, labor-environmental coalitions are absent, and the proportion of Democrats in the legislature is lower, suggesting a reactive effect against green energy policies in more progressive settings.

If history is any guide, one direct consequence of the calamity in Japan will be more stringent safety requirements and regulatory delays that will inevitably increase the costs of nuclear power and further undermine its economic viability. For nuclear power to play a major role in meeting the future global energy needs and mitigating the threat of climate change, the hazards of another Fukushima and the construction delays and costs escalation that have plagued the industry will have to be substantially reduced. One promising direction for nuclear development might be to downsize reactors from the gigawatt scale to less-complex smaller units that are more affordable. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are scalable nuclear power plant designs that promise to reduce investment risks through incremental capacity expansion; become more standardized and reduce costs through accelerated learning effects; and address concerns about catastrophic events, since they contain substantially smaller radioactive inventory. Given their lower capital requirements and small size, which makes them suitable for small electric grids. SMRs can more effectively address the energy needs of small developing countries.

It is the first component of a family of sectoral bottom-up models of technology, designed for integration into the global macroeconometric model E3MG. ITC occurs as a result of technological learning produced by cumulative investment and leads to highly nonlinear, irreversible and path dependent technological transitions. The model uses a dynamic coupled set of logistic differential equations. As opposed to traditional bottom-up energy models based on systems optimisation, such differential equations offer an appropriate treatment of the times and structure of change involved in sectoral technology transformations, as well as a much reduced computational load. Resource use and depletion are represented by local cost-supply curves, which give rise to different regional energy landscapes. The model is explored for a single global region using two simple scenarios, a baseline and a mitigation case where the price of carbon is gradually increased. While a constant price of carbon leads to a stagnant system, mitigation produces successive technology transitions leading towards the gradual decarbonisation of the global power sector.

In this paper, we illustrate the major challenges existing in the coal industry from a supply chain viewpoint, and propose technical and policy suggestions to address them. First, we provide quantitative information about water withdrawal, consumption, waste water recycling and treatment and pollution from coal mining, preparation, to final conversion for China's power generation and coal-to-chemical industry. We then analyze scenarios of water use in China's coal industry between 2020 and 2030. Our results show that water issues are becoming increasingly severe constraints for coal development in China, especially in North and West China, where water is more scarce and ecological systems are more vulnerable than other regions. Without implementing effective water-saving measures or regulations the water demand in the coal industry could dramatically increase and probably exceed China's water supply capacity in the near-term future, bringing substantial uncertainty to sustainable development of China's energy economy. We also illustrate that coal-fired power generation, with appropriate technical improvement and proper policy supports, has the greatest potential for water savings in the coal industry. Our conclusions also underscore the importance of expanding energy efficiency and renewable energy in China so as to limit the country's dependence on coal. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing studies on immigration and FDI have all looked at aggregate flows at the national level, arguing that immigrant networks lower the risk of foreign investment through increased information flows and a built in market. However, these national-level studies suffer from identification problems since many of the factors that attract immigrants also attract FDI. This study improves upon identification by looking at the regional distribution of both FDI and immigration from 10 source countries to the 50 US states. Using a unique measure of immigrant network size in each state, I find that immigration is not only positively correlated with FDI, it tends to lead it as well. Comparing a state with an average sized immigrant network to one with a network twice as large, I estimate that the stronger network state will get on average 20 more foreign-owned affiliates opening per year, an effect that is quite persistent over time. On average, more skilled immigrant communities attract more FDI, while the pull effect of immigration on FDI also increases with immigrant ties to native countries and with immigrant influence in local communities. These results suggest that immigration creates a positive externality in foreign investment that must be considered when assessing the costs and benefits of labor mobility.","San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Foad, H (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",hfoad@mail.sdsu.edu,,"Foad, Hisham/0000-0001-7482-8730",,,,,21,34,40,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

It has been recommended by the World Commission on Dams that to gain public acceptance, public involvement is necessary in the decision-making process (WCD, 2000). As financially-significant actors in the planning and implementation of large-scale hydropower projects in developing country contexts, the paper examines the ways in which public involvement may be influenced by international financial institutions. Using the case study of the Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project in Laos, the paper analyses how public involvement facilitated by the Asian Development Bank had a bearing on procedural and distributional justice. The paper analyses the extent of public participation and the assessment of full social and environmental costs of the project in the Cost-Benefit Analysis conducted during the project appraisal stage. It is argued that while efforts were made to involve the public, there were several factors that influenced procedural and distributional justice: the late contribution of the Asian Development Bank in the project appraisal stage: and the issue of non-market values and discount rate to calculate the full social and environmental costs.

The 'MESSAGE-Access' model is employed to assess the cost effectiveness of centralized and Decentralized Distributed Generation (DDG) technologies. Delivery mechanisms are modelled to include mini-grid and stand-alone systems and the analysis includes an estimation of rural household electricity demand from lighting and appliances. We assume two future demand scenarios with a 'minimum threshold' and a 'higher threshold' of electricity consumption of 65 and 420 kW h per household per year, respectively. We find that the cost of delivering electricity by centralized generation and grid distribution is up to four times the cost of stand-alone and mini-grid DDG options in the case of 'minimum threshold' demand scenario. These results are robust to alternate assumptions regarding costs of technologies. We also estimate that public subsidy bill for kerosene can be substantially reduced if all households switch to electricity as their primary source of lighting. Thus, promoting DDG options can reduce capital investments needed to meet access goals significantly and have an important role to play, in meeting the goal of universal electrification by 2030.

For a country that was already uneasy about energy security, the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which caused a nuclear catastrophe in TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, turned this unease into outright anxiety. With the temporary and/or permanent closure of many nuclear reactors Japan has had to replace lost power. Tokyo has had no choice but to secure additional fossil fuels, a strategy that has negatively affected Japan's economy due to rising fuel costs. The increase in Japan's fossil fuel consumption has also caused a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, and affected Tokyo's commitment to Kyoto targets. This paper analyzes the consequences of the 2011 nuclear disaster for Japan's energy security. Recognizing that Japan's future energy policy choices are constrained and path dependent, the paper outlines energy policy recommendations for Japan's government. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

An analysis of how Europe has compensated for these missing gas volumes shows that this situation has not affected security of supply. However, this situation would change if the North African uprising were to spread to Algeria. Since Algeria is a much more important gas supplier to Europe than is Libya, more severe consequences would be likely. Applying a natural gas infrastructure model, we investigate the impact of supplier disruptions from both countries for a summer and winter period. Our analysis shows that disruptions in the low-demand summer months could be compensated for, mainly by LNG imports into several European countries. An investigation of a similar situation at the beginning of the winter shows that security of supply would be severely compromised and that disruptions to Italian consumers would be unavoidable.

The evaluations were conducted using common system boundaries, allocation, and calculation methods. In addition, we disaggregate within sectors, such as with blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) steel and scrap-based electric arc furnace (Scrap-EAF) steel. The results reveal that characteristics vary by sub-sector. Regional differences in specific energy consumption are relatively large in the power, BF-BOF steel, and cement sectors. For coal power generation and BF-BOF steel production, continual maintenance and rehabilitation are of key importance. We confirm these key factors identified in the previous work on our estimated numerical values. In BF-BOF steel production, corrections for hot metal ratios (pig iron production per unit of BOF crude steel production) and quality of raw materials have a large effect on the apparent specific energy consumption. Available data is not yet sufficient for straightforward evaluation of the steel and cement sectors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, the costs of biodiesel production from oil palm and Jatropha were analyzed under different scenarios. They include the participation of associations of smallholders and commercial producers as raw material provides in biodiesel business in Peru. The scenarios considered have a strong social dimension in which they explicitly consider how productions' costs change when smallholders supply a proportion of the feedstock to the industry. Production cost profiles were generated using the chemical process simulation and economical evaluation software packages provided by Aspen Technology. Total production cost found for oil palm biodiesel production ranged between 0.23 and 0.31 USD/L and Jatropha biodiesel production costs were between 0.84 and 0.87 USD/L. These production costs were analyzed and compared to biodiesel ex-factory prices and diesel fuel production cost factors. The results suggest that including smallholders in the supply chain can be under some conditions competitive with liquid biofuel production systems that are purely large scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It derives a Lagrangian multiplier (LM) test and shows that in terms of generalized residuals of Gourieroux (1987) it reduces to the LM test of Breusch and Pagan (1980). Because of the tendency of the LM test to over-reject in panels with large N (cross-section dimension), we also consider the application of the cross-section dependence test (CD) proposed by Pesaran (2004). In Monte Carlo experiments it emerges that for most combinations of N and T the CD test is correctly sized, whereas the validity of the LM test requires T (time series dimension) to be quite large relative to N. We illustrate the cross-sectional independence tests with an application to a probit panel data model of roll-call votes in the US Congress and find that the votes display a significant degree of cross-section dependence.","[Hsiao, Cheng; Pesaran, M.

Since 2004, China has implemented policies to improve vehicle technologies and lower the fuel-consumption rates of individual vehicles. Policy evaluation requires accurate and adequate information on vehicle fuel-consumption rates. However, such information, especially for Chinese vehicles under real-world operating conditions, is rarely available from official sources in China. For each vehicle type we first review the vehicle technologies and fuel-economy policies currently in place in China and their impacts. We then derive real-world (or on-road) fuel-consumption rates on the basis of information collected from various sources. We estimate that the real-world fuel-consumption rates of vehicles in China sold in 2009 are 9 L/100 km for light-duty passenger vehicles, 11.4 L/100 km for light-duty trucks, 22 L/100 km for intercity transport buses, 40 L/100 km for urban transit buses, and 24.9 L/100 km for heavy-duty trucks. These results aid in understanding the levels of fuel consumption of existing Chinese vehicle fleets and the effectiveness of policies in reducing on-road fuel consumption, which can help in designing and evaluating future vehicle energy-efficiency policies.

This is particularly important in the Great Lakes States where lessons from other offshore environments are not directly applicable. This paper presents the framework developed for conducting a preliminary assessment of offshore wind potential. Information on lake bathymetry and wind resources were combined in simulating alternative scenarios of technically feasible turbine construction depths and distance concerns by stakeholders. These yielded estimates of developable offshore wind areas and potential power generation. While concerns about the visibility of turbines from shore reduce the power that can be generated, engineering solutions that increase the depths at which turbines can be sited increase such potential power output. This paper discusses the costs associated with technical limitations on depth and the social costs related to public sentiments about distance from the shoreline, as well as the possible tradeoffs. The results point to a very large untapped energy resource in the Michigan's Great Lakes, large enough to prompt policy action from the state government. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It describes research aimed to determine whether the higher cost of the larger systems was justified by additional household benefits. To assess the development impact of these different sizes of SHS the research used a combination of participatory and quantitative tools. Participatory exercises were conducted with seventy-seven small groups of SHS users in twenty-four rural communities and supplemented with a household survey of 195 SHS users. The combined results of these evaluation processes enabled the three sizes of SHS to be compared for two types of benefits those associated with carrying out important household tasks and attributes of SHS which were advantageous compared to the use of non-electric lighting sources. The research findings showed that the small, 10 W-p SHS provided much of the development impact of the larger systems. It suggests three significant implications for the design of SHS programs in contexts such as East Timor: provide more small systems rather than fewer large ones; provide lighting in the kitchen wherever possible; and carefully match SHS operating costs to the incomes of rural users.

As various kinds of clean energy and renewable energy have been focused and applied to CCHP systems, it is urgent to find a practical decision making methodology for CCHP systems driven by different energy sources. In this paper, an evaluation model which integrates fuzzy theory with multi-criteria decision making process is proposed to assess the comprehensive benefits of CCHP systems from technology, economic, society and environment criterions. Grey relation analysis and combination weighting method are also employed to compare the integrated performances of CCHP systems driven by natural gas, fuel cell, biomass energy and combined gas-steam cycle respectively with a separation production system. Finally, a baseline residential building in Beijing, China is selected as a case to obtain the optimal CCHP system alternative. The results indicate that gas-steam combined cycle CCHP system is the optimum scheme among the five options. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our paper looks at the challenges facing network governance for natural resources (primarily logging and forestry) and energy (primarily renewable energy and energy efficiency) in Asia. The paper investigates what network governance is, and what types of challenges networks have to tackle. It then develops a qualitative analytical framework to evaluate the effectiveness of networks consisting of five criteria: (1) clarity of roles and objectives among members, (2) having strong, independent, continual sources of funding, (3) institutional formality (having a permanent secretariat, budget, full time staff, etc.), (4) efficacy (ability to accomplish its mission and goals at the least possible cost); and (5) level of interdependency among members. Finally, we apply this framework to four case studies: the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Centre for Energy, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), ASEAN Regional Knowledge Network on Forests and Climate Change (FCC), and ASEAN Regional Knowledge Network on Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG). These cases illustrate effective (or ineffective) environmental and energy networks and the factors that are associated with network governance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Gasification of rice husks at paddy mills combines the benefits of reasonably efficient delivery of energy with a reasonably high carbon char and ash mixture. The ca. 35% carbon content of the rice husk char is possibly a consequence of the protective shield of silica, preventing full exposure of the biomass to oxidation in the gasifier. In this paper we undertake an evaluation of the sustainability of this 'gasification-biochar system' (GBS) in Cambodia, where a rapid deployment of gasifiers is underway. In Part I, we describe the context and analyse (some of) the physical and chemical properties of the biochar. While there are some potential health, safety and environmental issues that require further analysis, they are problems that could be readily addressed in further research and appear to be resolvable. In Part II, we present results from field trials, summarise the data on the carbon abatement of the gasification-biochar system and present some preliminary economic data.

COOPER; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; INDUSTRY; OUTPUTS; ENERGY; MODELS,"Energy policy depends on a proper use of methodology in guiding a large energy issue such as the global warming and climate change. DEA is one of such methodologies that are often used for preparing environmental policy, which is closely linked to various energy issues. Unfortunately, the use of DEA applied to environmental policy is insufficient, often misguiding policy makers and other individuals who are involved in energy issues. This study provides three guidelines for a use of DEA in preparing environmental assessment. First, it is important to prepare both primal and dual formulations to confirm whether information regarding all production factors (i.e., inputs, desirable and undesirable outputs) is fully utilized in DEA assessment. Second, DEA has model variations in radial and non-radial measurements. It is necessary for us to examine environmental issues by different models in order to avoid a methodological bias existing in those empirical studies. Finally, DEA environmental assessment needs to incorporate the concept of natural and managerial disposability. The natural disposability indicates that a firm negatively adapts a regulation change on undesirable outputs. In contrast, the managerial disposability indicates that a firm positively adapts the regulation change because the firm considers the regulation change as a new business opportunity.

This paper describes a physical model of electricity generation designed for long-term simulations, including the reproduction of decades of historical data, and its application to key policy questions. The simulation uses a dynamic, physical input-output model for the basic material and energy industries, embedded in an economy-wide stocks and flows framework (SFF). The historical reproduction, illustrated for the state of Victoria, is based on integrating bottom-up technical data on physical processes as inputs, and validating output against top-down aggregate data. We show that while greenhouse gas emissions would decrease significantly with the aggressive introduction of cleaner generation technology, long-term reductions are difficult to maintain against ongoing growth in consumption. Additionally, our sensitivity analysis identifies the importance of rapid action due to the age structure of operating power stations. We also identify significant imposts of alternative power generation on land and water resources, though a business-as-usual scenario would impose greater losses of water resources.

The presence of specific spatial effects is tested on the reduced form of a spatial autoregressive model evaluating the implicit common factor restriction. The empirical analysis considers the main regional policies in the period 1996-2001 in the South of Italy.

This paper presents empirical evidence on how the size of FDIs is determined by agglomeration and other state-level factors. The results indicate that FDI agglomeration and urbanization affect investment size and that taxes, markets, labour, land and the concentration of scientific knowledge are important determinants in the size composition of FDI.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Inst Sociol & Polit Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Halvorsen, T (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Inst Sociol & Polit Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",thomas.halvorsen@svt.ntnu.no,,,,,,,67,20,21,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Dimensions of proximity and knowledge bases: innovation between spatial and non-spatial factors, Regional Studies. Innovations face the challenge of integrating knowledge from heterogeneous sources by establishing an appropriate level of proximity. Proximity is thereby not a purely spatial phenomenon, but also includes organizational, institutional, social and cognitive dimensions. Geographical and social proximity are thereby auxiliary factors, whereas organizational, institutional and cognitive proximity act as critical enablers for learning. These dimensions can be connected to synthetic, analytical and symbolic knowledge bases. They thereby trigger a dynamic trade-off between various forms of proximity, whereby the proximity form varies depending on the underlying knowledge base.

The key to realizing the energy producing potential of the region is the development of transnational export routes to take oil and gas from the landlocked Caspian Sea basin to world markets. The evaluation and selection of alternative transnational export routes is a complex multi-criteria problem with conflicting objectives. The decision makers (DMs) are required to consider a vast amount of information concerning internal strengths and weaknesses of the alternative routes as well as external opportunities and threats to them.

This paper gives an overview of the economic and emissions situation in Shenzhen and focuses on the development of the Shenzhen ETS regulatory framework. It is devised as an ETS with an intensity-based cap, output-based allocation and a market for trading of allowances. The design of the Shenzhen ETS attaches great importance to coordinate the dynamic relationships between economic growth, industrial transition and emissions control. The cap and its allocation are determined by carbon intensity reduction targets and economic output, with an aim to slow down emissions growth while mitigating shocks from economic fluctuation and industrial adjustment to market stability. The Shenzhen ETS features extensive coverage consisting of three types of regulated entities and four categories of covered emissions, in order to control carbon emissions by both improving energy efficiency and restraining growing energy demand. A competitive game theory method is created for allocation of free allowances to manufacturing enterprises. Mechanisms for carbon offsets and market stabilization are developed to promote active and orderly trading in the carbon market. Moreover, several challenges and their policy choices are detailed for the development of the Shenzhen ETS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis suggests that China's national oil companies offer the best hope for overcoming the innovation problem.

Regional resilience in Italy: a very long-run analysis, Regional Studies. Resilience is a concept referring to the manner in which systems react to, and recover from, shocks. According to several recent analyses 'resilience' can explain different regional economic performances. However, this study indicates that this explanation is quite unconvincing when applied to the Italian regions in the very long run (1890-2009). Only few shocks emerge to have specific impact effects differing across regions, while the recovery experience is ever spatially homogeneous. Hence, it is difficult to discern genuine differences in regional resilience. This evidence can be interpreted as a reason why the regional differences in Italy are huge and persistent.","[Cellini, Roberto] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, I-95129 Catania, Italy; [Torrisi, Gianpiero] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England",University of Catania; University of Portsmouth,"Cellini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy.",cellini@unict.it; Gianpiero.Torrisi@port.ac.uk,"Torrisi, Gianpiero/HDM-8439-2022","Cellini, Roberto/0000-0003-1991-9685",,,,,41,92,102,12,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Supportive policies and actions at the national and local levels have encouraged heat planning that confers significant autonomy to local governments. By examining how power is distributed and shared by different levels of governments in the planning process, this paper investigates how comprehensive energy planning in Denmark has supported the development of highly cost-effective district heating systems. Lessons from the Danish approach to heat planning are considered for their relevance to the United States, where significant technical district heating potential exists, yet remains well outside the typical energy policy discussions. While the specific Danish political context may not be transferable to other locations, the practical aspects of power sharing, socio-economic cost-benefit analyses, and communal decision-making may inform approaches to local heat planning around the world.

Three key contributions of this extended model are: (i) the unrealistic assumption that regions are independent of one another no longer has to be made, (ii) the magnitude and significance of so-called spillover effects can be empirically assessed, and (iii) both the temporal and spatial propagation of labour demand shocks can be investigated. Using annual data from 1986-2010 for 112 regions across eight EU countries, both the non-spatial and spatial models are estimated. It is found that the majority of the spillover effects are highly significant. Consistent with economic theory, the impact of a region-specific demand shock is largest in the region where the shock instigates. The shock also propagates to other regions, especially impacting the first and second-order neighbours.","[Vega, Solmaria Halleck; Elhorst, J.

A structured telephone survey of 263 livestock farmers, predominantly located in the west or 'marginal' upland areas of England captured data on attitudes towards straw use and DECs. Combined with farm physical and business data, the survey results show that 7.2% and 6.3% of farmers would respectively consider growing SRC and miscanthus, producing respective maximum potential English crop areas of 54,603 ha and 43,859 ha. If higher market prices for straw occurred, most livestock farmers would continue to buy straw. Reasons for not being willing to consider growing DECs include concerns over land quality, committing land for a long time period, lack of appropriate machinery, profitability, and time to financial return; a range of moral, land quality, production conflict and lack of crop knowledge factors were also cited. Results demonstrate limited potential for the production of DECs on livestock farms in England. Changes in policy support to address farmer concerns with respect to DECs will be required to incentivise farmers to increase energy crop production. Policy support for DEC production must be cognisant of farm-level economic, tenancy and personal objectives. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Wilson, P.; Glithero, N.

However, the presence of low-cost, lowcarbon hydro resources could also inhibit wind energy development. This paper examines the tension between wind-hydro complementarity and competition through a case study of Quebec, Canada. The case highlights that debate over the societal conception of the hydroelectric system, or regime, and its potential to enable wind, creates different innovation pathways. The paper calls attention to the value of shielding and nurturing renewable energy niches to create transformative pressures that activate the complementary potential of existing technologies. To maintain momentum a wind-hydro development block will need to expand towards incorporating new technologies and geographies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing the varying impacts of exogenous shocks,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Low-carbon transition; Electricity demand; Fukushima accident; Intervention analysis,CHOICE,"In the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear crisis, Japan began contemplating energy policy reforms that drew inspiration from low-carbon research. This article focuses on a question central to advancing low-carbon research in Japan and elsewhere: namely, how does an exogenous shock affect the onset, magnitude, and permanence of changes in electricity consumption? The article employs intervention analysis with an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model to answer this question. The data analysis reveals that post-Fukushima electricity use underwent a sudden, significant, and sustained reduction across Japan. The shock not only affected the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) coverage area but the more distant Kansai Electric Power Company (KEPCO) coverage area. Large electricity users responded with an immediate and significant reduction in electricity consumption that rebounded to below pre-crisis levels; households responded more gradually with no rebound. Two of the more interesting results from the data analysis - the persistence in reductions in the more distant KEPCO coverage area and the rebound among large users - are then explained with a review of survey data and policy trends.

Yet, information on the potential for wind power generation is still highly uncertain in many regions of the globe, particularly those with complex terrain features. We focus on an area by the foothills of the Appalachian region. Because we do not have precise wind measurements for this area, we do not attempt to produce an actual wind map, but instead use a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model to demonstrate the calculation of high resolution wind speeds with complex terrain information. Using this approach, we show how finer wind speed information can impact the status of an overlooked region in terms of its wind potential and improve wind prospecting by enabling investors to focus on the most promising sub-regions of a study area. Since private sector investors might not have the incentive to invest in finer-scale wind resource assessment that can be easily observed by competitors, public sector incentives or direct investments can help to promote wind power generation in overlooked but viable regions.

While energy metabolism includes both direct and indirect consumptions among sectors, few researchers have studied indirect consumption due to a lack of data. In this study, we used input-output analysis to calculate the energy flows among directly linked sectors. Building on this, we used ecological network analysis to develop a model of urban energy flows and also account for energy consumption embodied by the flows among indirectly linked sectors (represented numerically as paths with a length of 2 or more). To illustrate the model, monetary input-output tables for Beijing from 2000 to 2010 were analyzed to determine the embodied energy consumption and associated carbon footprints of these sectors. This analysis reveals the environmental pressure based on the source (energy consumption) and sink (carbon footprint) values. Indirect consumption was Beijing's primary form, and the carbon footprint therefore resulted mainly from indirect consumption (both accounting for ca. 60% of the total, though with considerable variation among sectors). To reduce emissions, the utilization efficiency of indirect consumption must improve. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulation results using the WITCH model show that changes in the kilometres driven per year using light duty vehicles have a notable impact on investments related to the development of battery related technologies. As a result, different mobility futures have notably different optimal vehicle fleet compositions. As climate policy becomes more stringent, achieving abatement with increased mobility implies large investments in battery related technologies in comparison to the 2010 level. The model results also show that the Electric Vehicles Initiative goal of a 2% share of vehicles in 2020 could be achieved with climate policy in place.

Currently, these operations rely on the Alberta electricity system and on-site generation to satisfy their steam and electricity requirements. Most of the on-site generation units produce steam and electricity through the process of cogeneration. It is unclear to what extent new and existing operations will continue to develop cogeneration units or rely on electricity from the Alberta grid to meet their energy requirements in the near future. This study explores the potential for reductions in fuel usage and CO2 emissions by increasing the penetration of oil sands cogeneration in the provincial generation mixture. EnergyPLAN is used to perform scenario analyses on Alberta's electricity system in 2030 with a focus on transmission conditions to the oil sands region. The results show that up to 15-24% of CO2 reductions prescribed by the 2008 Alberta Climate Strategy are possible. Furthermore, the policy implications of these scenarios within a deregulated market are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A methodology for the simultaneous treatment of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity is developed. Spatial dependence is introduced in the economic model by assuming a spatial Durbin model specification.

Although both frameworks can account for differences in strategies among these firms, horizontal interaction is particularly significant for providing additional explanations beyond producer-buyer linkages and learning.","[Li, Peng-Fei] E China Normal Univ, Inst China Innovat, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Li, Peng-Fei] E China Normal Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Econ, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; East China Normal University,"Li, PF (通讯作者)，E China Normal Univ, Inst China Innovat, 3663 North Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",pfli@re.ecnu.edu.cn,"Li, Pengfei/HLG-4495-2023","Li, Pengfei/0000-0002-5511-6751",,,,,59,16,18,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

One such data source is the seldom used UK Energy Saving Trust's Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED), which this paper investigates using Norfolk UK local authorities as a case study. The HEED's reactive and longitudinal data collection strategies contribute to underlying biases, which is the likely reasoning for its differences with the English Housing Survey and UK 2001 Census. These differences had a cascading effect in that they manifested themselves in the indicative financial and carbon assessments undertaken. Similarly, sampling concerns also implicated correlations surrounding influences of current dwelling insulation levels. Providing one is transparent about potential biases and data concerns, the HEED can play a substantial role in guiding policy decisions and understanding dwelling stock characteristics (e.g. what makes dwellings 'Hard to Treat'). In particular, its vast (national) geographic coverage yet high resolution enables local context to be explored: a factor that this study shows to significantly shape insulation levels.

One particular rebound mechanism is re-spending of money savings associated with energy savings on energy intensive goods or services. We calculate the average magnitude of this re-spending rebound for different fuels and countries, and for both energy and carbon (CO2) emissions. We find that emerging economies, neglected in past studies, typically have larger rebounds than OECD countries. Since such economies play an increasingly important role in the global economy the re-spending rebound is a growing concern. The re-spending effect is generally larger for gasoline than for natural gas and electricity. Paradoxically, stronger financial incentives to conserve energy tend to increase the rebound. This suggests that with climate regulation and peak oil the re-spending rebound may become more important. We discuss the policy implications of our findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, Korea has many limitations in uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing under the current Korea-U.S. nuclear agreement, although they are economically and politically important to Korea due to a significant problems in nuclear fuel storages. Therefore, in this paper, we first examine those example countries - Japan, Vietnam, and Iran - that have made nuclear agreements with the U.S. or have changed their agreements to allow the enrichment of uranium and the reprocessing of spent fuel. Then, we analyze those countries' nuclear energy policies and review their strategic repositioning in the relationship with the U.S. We find that a strong political stance for peaceful usage of nuclear energy including the legislation of nuclear laws as was the case of Japan. In addition, it is important for Korea to. acquire advanced technological capability such as sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) because SFR technologies require plutonium to be used as fuel rather than uranium-235. In addition, Korea needs to leverage its position in nuclear agreement between China and the U.S. as was the case of Vietnam. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We first clarify the probability limit of the FE estimator and argue that this probability limit can be regarded as a pseudo-true parameter. We then establish the asymptotic distributional properties of the FE estimator around the pseudo-true parameter when n and T jointly go to infinity. Notably, we show that the FE estimator suffers from the incidental parameters bias of which the top order is O(T-1), and even after the incidental parameters bias is completely removed, the rate of convergence of the FE estimator depends on the degree of model misspecification and is either (nT)(-1/2) or n(-1/2). Second, we establish asymptotically valid inference on the (pseudo-true) parameter. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic properties of the clustered covariance matrix (CCM) estimator and the cross-section bootstrap, and show that they are robust to model misspecification. This establishes a rigorous theoretical ground for the use of the CCM estimator and the cross-section bootstrap when model misspecification and the incidental parameters bias (in the coefficient estimate) are present. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the finite sample performance of the estimators and inference methods, together with a simple application to the unemployment dynamics in the U.S.","[Galvao, Antonio F.] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Kato, Kengo] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Iowa; University of Tokyo,"Galvao, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, W284 Pappajohn Business Bldg,21 E Market St, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",antonio-galvao@uiowa.edu; kkato@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [22730179, 25780152]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780152, 22730179] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","K.

Beginning in the early 1980s, the Chinese government has developed a variety of building energy codes to improve building energy efficiency and reduce total energy demand. This paper studies the impact of building energy codes on energy use and CO2 emissions by using a detailed building energy model that represents four distinct climate zones each with three building types, nested in a long-term integrated assessment framework GCAM. An advanced building stock module, coupled with the building energy model, is developed to reflect the characteristics of future building stock and its interaction with the development of building energy codes in China. This paper also evaluates the impacts of building codes on building energy demand in the presence of economy-wide carbon policy. We find that building energy codes would reduce Chinese building energy use by 13-22% depending on building code scenarios, with a similar effect preserved even under the carbon policy. The impact of building energy codes shows regional and sectoral variation due to regionally differentiated responses of heating and cooling services to shell efficiency improvement.

Oil makes up 59% of total final energy consumption (TFC). Import dependency, low fuel diversity and volatile prices leave Ireland vulnerable in terms of energy security. This work models energy security scenarios for Ireland using long term macroeconomic forecasts to 2050, with oil production and price scenarios from the International Monetary Fund, within the Irish TIMES energy systems model. The analysis focuses on developing a least cost optimum energy system for Ireland under scenarios of constrained oil supply (0.8% annual import growth, and 2% annual import decline) and subsequent sustained long term price shocks to oil and gas imports. The results point to gas becoming the dominant fuel source for Ireland, at 54% total final energy consumption in 2020, supplanting oil from reference projections of 57% to 10.8% TFC. In 2012, the cost of net oil imports stood at (sic)3.6 billion (2.26% GDP). The modelled high oil and gas price scenarios show an additional annual cost in comparison to a reference of between (sic)2.9bn and (sic)7.5bn by 2020 (1.9-4.9% of GDP) to choose to develop a least cost energy system.

In this context, the main aim of this paper is to carry out a quantitative analysis of the impact of the takeover in question on electricity prices and quantities, consumer and producer surpluses, dead weight loss and emissions. The scope of the study covers the Polish power generation sector and the analysis was carried out for 2009. A game theory-based electricity market equilibrium model developed for Poland was applied. The model includes several country-specific conditions, such as a coal-based power generation fuel-mix, a large share of biomass co-combustion, etc. For the sake of clarity, only four scenarios are assumed. The paper concludes that the declared synergy savings did not compensate for the increase in dead weight loss and the transfer of surplus from consumers to producers caused by increased market power.

Retail clusters and their place in urban space are assessed from several angles. The probability of a specific type of retail unit to be established in a 250 by 250 m square is modelled as a function of (i) the presence of other similar retail establishments, (ii) the presence of stores that belong to other retail sectors and (iii) other characteristics of the square area, and its access to demand in the pertinent urban landscape. The analysis clarifies which types of retail clusters one can expect to find in a metropolitan region, as well as their relationship to the urban landscape. We analyse three distinct types of stores: clothing, household appliances, and specialized stores. Stores with high intensities of interaction are co-located, and predominantly located close to the urban cores, consistent with predictions from bid rent theory and central place theory. We further document negative location tendencies between shops that sell frequently purchased products and shops that sell durables. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of demand in the close surroundings, which is particularly strong for small-scale establishments.","[Larsson, Johan P.; Oner, Ozge] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Larsson, Johan P.; Oner, Ozge] Ctr Entrepreneurship & Spatial Econ, Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Öner, Ö (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden.",johan.p.larsson@jibs.hj.se; ozge.oner@jibs.hj.se,,"Oner, Ozge/0000-0001-9590-8019; Larsson, Johan P./0000-0001-7432-7442",,,,,45,23,26,1,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Our results suggest that regional spillovers are very important in local labor markets and in defining the relationship observed at the national level. The MSA level data further supports asymmetries in Okun's law. The weaker direct relationship between GDP and unemployment at the local level suggests that while federal fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate aggregate demand during periods of economic recovery may be effective, over time, in reducing the unemployment rate, local economic development policies are not effective in achieving the substantial short-term reduction in unemployment needed during recovery. The strong business cycle effects observed in the state MSA, relative to the U.S., suggests that countercyclical policies are fundamentally important and should be targeted more generally to exploit regional spillovers.","Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Pereira, RM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",rmpereira@wm.edu,,,,,,,35,11,11,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The within-sector unemployment rate is negatively affected by firm market access and is positively related to the intensity of firm screening among heterogeneous candidate workers. The regional unemployment rate, on the other hand, is related to the sectoral share of job searching across sectors within each region. We find the coexistence of a smaller within-sector unemployment rate and a larger local unemployment rate in the region with firm agglomeration.

To guide the process, the researchers created an outline of recommended steps for the districts to follow. Although there were variations in the sequence and perceived ease of the steps, the Energy Task Force members involved in the process found the outline to be a supportive guide. Further analysis of the cases involved interviewing members of the Energy Task Forces to identify facilitating and obstructing factors. The study concluded that factors such as level of environmental literacy, along with aspects of the school culture and leadership, interacted to influence the successful drafting of school energy policies and education plans.

We argue that successful renewable energy policy must satisfy both the need for new project development and the obligation to procedural justice. To suggest how it can do so, we analyze existing state- and county-level siting processes in Washington state, finding that both fall short on measures of procedural justice. To overcome this limitation and address the tension between procedural justice and project development, we then propose a collaborative governance approach to wind facility siting, in which state governments retain ultimate authority over permitting decisions but encourage and support local-level deliberations as the primary means of making those decisions. Such an approach, we argue, would be more just, facilitate wind development by addressing community concerns constructively and result in better projects through the input of diverse stakeholders.

It assessed the feasibility and economic viability of RE resources that can provide sustainable electricity and enhance ICT development for rural communities cut off from the national grid. Hypothetical rural communities made up of 200 homes, a school and health centre was conceived. Specific electrical load profile was developed to suite the rural communities. The required load was analyzed as 358 kWh per day, with 46 kW primary peak load and 20 kW deferrable peak load. The meteorological data utilized were obtained from the Nigeria Meteorological Department spanning 1987-2010. Assessment of the design that will optimally meet the daily load demand with LOLP of 0.01 was carried out by considering standalone PV, Wind and Diesel, and a hybrid design of Wind-PV. The Diesel Standalone system was taken as the basis for comparison. The optimization tool employed after the feasibility analysis with RETScreen (R) software was the HOMER software. The outcome showed that the most economically viable alternative for power generation at most of the sites is the wind standalone system. It proved to be the optimal means of producing renewable electricity in terms of life cycle cost and levelised cost of energy which ranged between $0.129/kWh for Jos and $0.3271kWh for Benin City. This is very much competitive with grid electricity.

In the literature there has been a wide range of estimates of their correlation: from positive, to zero, to negative. We find that the correlation has varied over time, from moderately high (0.7) in normal periods, to negative during each of five interruptions; the average correlation has been 0.19. Saudi Arabia's oil market behavior depends upon circumstances, but its primary goal is the stability of OPEC and the world oil market. It will coordinate export reductions with the Rest of OPEC when faced with declining demand, but it will increase exports when faced with interruptions elsewhere in OPEC. Allowing for such differences provides evidence of intelligent, context-dependent consistency. But ignoring context - by wrongly assuming the same Saudi response in Normal periods and Interruptions - can lead to a conclusion of Saudi inconsistency because the difference in the responses has been obscured.

This paper analyzes basic features of Chinese herbal medicine additive, introduces common Chinese herbal medicine additives and their important functions in aquaculture, sets forth the problems of Chinese herbal medicine additives in aquaculture and proposes corresponding countermeasures. With continuous economic development in China in recent years, aquaculture industry has gained great development. It is worth noting that disease phenomena of aquatic products become increasingly serious. The varieties and number of fish chemicals used in aquaculture continue to rise. Frequent application of antibiotics and vermifuges give rise to large-scale residue of chemicals in fish bodies, thus leading to pathogen resistance and the decrease in the quality of aquatic products. The health of modern people is jeopardized. Besides, the environment is polluted. Thus, development and production of safe and efficient pollution-free aquaculture chemicals has become the key to better and faster development of aquaculture industry. Chinese herbal medicine additives own numerous advantages such as nature, efficiency, small toxic and side effects and rich resources. They not just have drug property and nutrition in the process of preventing and curing fish diseases, but also can improve production property and high efficiency of feed utilization of aquatic livestock. In view of these, it is urgently necessary to popularize and apply Chinese herbal medicine additives to prevent and cure fish diseases.","[Guo, Chaolan; Liang, Linlin; Cao, Ke] Hainan Univ, Ocean Coll, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China",Hainan University,,,,,,,,,5,4,5,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-62520-34-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2014,13.0,,,,,,180,183,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BC0SS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349486900040,0

The results show the income development was negatively influenced in all examined groups and categories. Relatively highest impact (compared to the previous trend) can be observed for the income of the poorest households, which basically stopped growing. Second, this article examines whether there is an observable income convergence in the specific country groups, both unconditional and dependent on the income level group. The results show the half-life of convergence is around 12.4 years for the median income category in the EU27 country group. The convergence rate is slightly faster with increasing income category.

The aim of the work will be to try to relax this condition.","Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, CR-18208 Prague 4, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kanková, V (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, CR-18208 Prague 4, Czech Republic.",kankova@utia.cas.cz,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,384,389,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900067,0

Most countries' energy demands declined during the economic depression of 20082009 when a worldwide economic crisis occurred. As an export-oriented economy, China suffered a serious exports decline in the course of the crisis. However, it was found that energy consumption continued to increase. Against such a background, this paper aims to assess and explain the factors causing the growth of energy consumption in China. First, we will explain the impact of domestic final use and international trade on energy consumption by using decomposition analysis. Second, embodied energy and its variation across sectors are quantified to identify the key sectors contributing to the growth. Lastly, the policy implications for long-term energy conservation are discussed. The results show that the decline in exports was one of the driving forces for energy consumption reduction in the crisis, but that the growth of domestic demand in manufacturing and construction, largely stimulated by economic stimulus plans, had the opposite effect on energy consumption. International trade contributed to decreasing energy consumption of China during and after the crisis because the structure of exports and imports changed in this period. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We explore an institutional arrangement that allows lower levels of government to set tax relief (tax cuts and exemptions) for food goods in a so-called basic basket food. Next, we examine the relationship between the VAT and the 'Fund Against Poverty' (FAP) financed by VAT rate increases on cigarettes and gas. Our findings indicate that the state tax function responds positively to the neighbour's redistributive policy. Moreover, we estimate that the degree of spatial tax interaction among states has increased since the establishment of the FAP, suggesting that FAP resources are viewed as a complementary pro-poor policy rather than either a fiscal equalisation (substitute policy) or a possible slackness in the constraint of redistributive policies.","[Mattos, Enlinson] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Politi, Ricardo] Fed Univ ABC, Santo Andre, SP, Brazil",Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE); Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC),"Politi, R (通讯作者)，Fed Univ ABC, Rua Santa Adelia 166, Santo Andre, SP, Brazil.",rbpoliti@gvmail.br,"Politi, Ricardo B/O-7109-2015",,,,,,28,3,3,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The solution to the problem consists of determining a minimum cost set of vehicle routes starting and ending at a depot node, such that the total demand of arcs is fully satisfied while the arcs time windows and vehicle capacity being respected.

The main differences are in responses to productivity shocks in tradables and to shocks in government expenditures, while the biggest similarities are in responses to productivity shocks in non-tradables and to shocks in investment efficiency.","Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Slanicay, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",slanicay@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,914,919,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900157,0

Analysis of measured temperatures in a sample of solid wall dwellings in the UK, conducted as part of the CALEBRE research project, is included. The review suggests that, for periods when occupation was likely, there has been little or no increase in winter and spring-time average living room temperatures over the last 40 years, with average recorded living room temperatures having been historically lower than the WHO-recommended value of 21 C. Correspondingly, for periods of likely occupation, average bedroom temperatures appear to have increased. Compared with non-domestic buildings, there have been fewer investigations of domestic thermal comfort, either in the UK or elsewhere, and hence the paper also calls for further detailed investigations of domestic indoor temperatures during occupied hours together with thermal comfort evaluations in order to better understand domestic thermal environments. Based on suggestions from the limited range of studies available to date, living room temperatures may need to be maintained within the range 2022 C for thermal satisfaction, though this requires confirmation through further research. The study also emphasises that improving the energy efficiency of homes should be the primary means to effect any increases in indoor temperatures that are deemed essential. Considerations for future policy are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Vadodaria, K.; Loveday, D.

One of the main ideologists of the liberal justification of Charities, defended as a public service, was the Galician economist and specialist in administrative law Manuel Colmeiro. His thought has an added value in this respect, in its-ideological evolution from a relatively critical Catholic social liberaligm until 1848 toward a liberalism that, from 1850 onwards, can be described as individualistic and doctrinaire. Colmeiro evolved from an integral concern for poverty and pauperism caused by industrialization until the disappearance of this moral concern about the distributional problems of industrialization, to focus on the groups of the helpless, the object of the narrow liberal healthcare system.","Univ Vigo, Pontevedra, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Pousada, RV (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Pontevedra, Spain.",,"Pousada, Rafael Vallejo/M-8695-2016","Pousada, Rafael Vallejo/0000-0002-6122-9330",,,,,115,0,0,0,2,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

No study to-date has directly compared the environmental implications of this technology with more conventional CSP backup energy options. This study compares the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, and direct, onsite land use associated with one MW h of electricity production from CSP plants with wet and dry cooling and with three energy backup systems: (1) minimal backup (MB), (2) molten salt thermal energy storage (TES), and (3) a natural gas-fired heat transfer fluid heater (NG). Plants with NG had 4-9 times more life cycle GHG emissions than plants with TES. Plants with TES generally had twice as many life cycle GHG emissions as the MB plants. Dry cooling reduced life cycle water consumption by 71-78% compared to wet cooling. Plahts with larger backup capacities had greater life cycle water consumption than plants with smaller backup capacities, and plants with NG had lower direct, onsite life cycle land use than plants with MB or TES.

Low energy efficiency of constructions and cold climate increase the problem, which also affects native forests. The aims of this study are to characterize energy consumption in dwellings of this region, investigate the reduction potential, and study social and environmental consequences of high consumption of firewood. Actual energy consumption is studied with information from surveys, potential for reduction is modeled with software and other consequences are analyzed from previous studies. Results for the city of Valdivia show high firewood consumption per household, with a media bulk volume near 12 m(3)/year. Thermal regulations are softer compared with other countries. Moreover, around 85% of buildings were built before enforcing codes in 2007, and has almost no thermal protection. The reduction potential due to thermal improvements is found to be very high (62%) if buildings are refurbished to comply with the present Chilean Norm of 2007, but it reaches a 77% reduction if refurbished according to stricter foreign regulations. Therefore, an energy efficiency program strongly addressing existing buildings has the largest potential for reducing firewood use, and therefore mitigate environmental and health impacts.

Six sites were selected, mostly in central Australia and the occurrence and duration of gaps in the availability of energy inputs to solar thermal generation were tallied. In a three month period late in 2010 12 periods of three or more days with an overall average DNI of 2.3 kWh/m(2)/day occurred. The relationship between DNI and solar thermal generation efficiency was examined and this indicated that on many more days power output would have been very low or zero. The relation between daily total DNI and hourly average DNI was also found to be important, as a high total might be made up of many hours in which DNI was too low for significant generation. These two factors show that there is a significant problem of intermittency for solar thermal systems. Although the annual output of each plant may be commercially viable a solar thermal system might not be capable of meeting demand reliably. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Along with its dramatic development since 2005, its curtailment ratio has been rising. Although this could be attributed to both physical and institutional factors, it is the institutional obstacles, mainly resulting from the adjustment difficulties of interests distribution, that have exercised a greater impact. The stakeholders relating to wind power integration are thermal power companies, grid companies and local governments. The extent to which wind power deployment affects these vested interests determines the core institutional obstacles to be addressed. Mainly based on quantitative and case analyses, we argue that currently wind deployment in China has a little impact on the interests of thermal companies, moderate impact on the interests of grid companies and great impact on local governments. We recommend that it is crucial to elevate the role of environmental protection and renewable energy increase while de-emphasize the role of economic growth in the evaluation of local governments' performance, as well as provide incentives for grid companies to attend more to their social responsibilities rather than their scale expansion and revenue growth.

Refurbishment is therefore often suggested as one of the most useful solutions for the current real estate crisis in consolidated areas like the EU. On the other hand, it is imperative to construct buildings according to sustainable principles regarding economic, environmental and social issues. Therefore, proper decision-support methods are needed to help designers, investors and policy makers to choose the most sustainable solution for a refurbishment project, especially for energy retrofit works. This paper reviews the works relating to sustainable refurbishment decision-support tools which have already been developed. For this purpose we have analysed and classified 40 different methods, with particular focus on their main common aims. They are also compared with other classifications proposed.

Technical efficiency scores are computed via both stochastic frontier analysis and data envelopment analysis. Mixed results are obtained from the neoclassical convergence approaches. In addition, distribution dynamics methods reveal some evidence of club-formation and this result is supported with the occurrence of gamma-divergence. Taken as a whole, technical efficiency is found to diverge among the utilities operating in the power pool. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Lester, TW",,,,"Lester, T.

Policies that promote the Green Economy in general and energy efficiency in particular remain politically popular as potential win-win solutions that will create jobs and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, efforts to promote energy efficiency in the residential sector through rebates and incentives alone have yet to reach critical mass. This paper outlines a policy option for state and local governments to use real estate transfer taxes to generate stronger incentives for home buyers to undertake significant retrofit projects at the time of sale. The economic impact of the proposed energy efficiency transfer tax (EETT) is then modeled for the State of North Carolina, using standard input-output techniques. Ultimately, based on housing sales figures from 2010, a new EETT of 2.5 percent on home purchases would generate a net positive increase of approximately 3485 direct construction jobs and 5900 annually total jobs for the state.

It evaluates estimated costs, risks and CO2 emissions following the mean-variance portfolio theory. The efficiency frontier is estimated for three CO2 prices scenarios: no CO2 prices, low CO2 price and high CO2 price. The planned portfolio in Brazil presented in the DPEE 2020 is relatively close to the efficient frontier, however there is still room for risk mitigation by diversifying the energy portfolio. As there is currently no CO2 price in Brazil, the tendency is that diversification increases fossil fuel share in the energy mix, but the introduction of a CO2 price can be an option to promote renewables. This type of large general market framework can contribute to reduce market uncertainties by reducing the level of government's discretionary activism. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In other words, as a country grows, it is assumed that its environmental quality improves. In this study, we aim to test the EKC hypothesis for 12 Middle East countries during the period 1990-2008 by employing recently developed panel data methods. Our results provide evidence contrary to the EKC hypothesis. We found evidence favorable to the U-shaped EKC for 5 Middle East countries, whereas an inverted U-shaped curve was identified for only 3 Middle East countries. Furthermore, there appear to be no causal links between income and CO2 emissions for the other 4 countries. Regarding the direction of causality, there appears to be a unidirectional causality from economic growth to energy consumption in the short-run; in the long-run, however, the unidirectional causality chain runs from energy consumption and economic growth to CO2 emissions. We also suggest some crucial policy implications depending on these results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Flood drainage systems are infrastructures essential in urban areas, which include retention ponds that can be used as water storage volumes to damp floods and simultaneously to produce energy, constituting innovative solutions to be integrated in future smart water grid's designs. The consideration of urban flooding as a problem caused by excess water that can be harvested and reused is expected to provide a comprehensive representation of a water-energy nexus for future urban areas. The study comprises an optimization of energy recovery in SUDS of a small district area of Lisbon down-town through the use of a low-head hydropower converter. The status-quo solution based on a basin catchment for the average expected runoff is analysed, with influence of the tidal backwater effect of the Atlantic Ocean which causes difficulties to the drainage of excess flow.

The average energy consumption in the residential buildings of Belgium is 70% higher than the EU average and stands at 348 kW h/m(2)/year. Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) provides guidelines for energy performance analysis of buildings in Belgium. In this study, a holistic approach has been adopted to analyse the building stock of Liege, Belgium. This analysis is based on 'General Socio-economic survey 2001' and 'Housing quality survey 2006 in Walloon region' databases. It considers parameters such as buildings age, built-up area, type of heating system, type of fuel used, adjacency, insulation of roofs and walls and energy consumption etc. for an in depth analysis. This study concludes that about 69% of buildings which are constructed before 1945 needs serious renovation towards the improvement of roof and external wall insulation level. It then successfully identifies specific areas which need detailed study to evaluate the comfort status in the existing building stock, improvement of insulation level and its effect on heating energy consumption as well as the economic analysis on energy efficiency measurements.

The paper contributes to the international debate by offering a new evidence-based perspective on the efficacy of the CDM in a strategic sector of the most relevant non-Annex I country. The obtained empirical results can serve as evaluation instruments for both academics and policy makers involved in the elaboration of a new Protocol and its related mechanisms, while at the same time offering a stimulus for further analyses sharing similar objectives.

Some important research has been conducted to try to determine the effects of the use of an ICS in the user's health, but these studies are expensive and time consuming. Moreover, no evaluations show the impact of the technology in the user's lives. This study seeks to contribute to fill this gap. Scope: By applying cluster analysis techniques to survey data, the most relevant variables that explain adoption and impact were identified. Using these variables, two qualitative indexes are proposed: The adoption index considers the use of the new technology, the level of satisfaction, and the conditions of the stove. The impact index considers the changes in cooking practices and life quality brought about by the ICS. Both indexes are then applied to two implementation programs. The indexes show the differences between the program results and the user's perceptions of each technology. Conclusions: The proposed indexes can be used to measure the success of an ICS implementation program in terms of the benefits perceived by the users of these technologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The key element in our derivation is a result relating LATE to a causal mediation effect, which allows us to exploit partial identification results from the causal mediation analysis literature. The bounds are employed to analyze the effect of attaining a GED, high school, or vocational degree on future labor market outcomes using randomization into a training program as an invalid instrument. The resulting bounds are informative, indicating that the local effect when assigned to training for those whose degree attainment is affected by the instrument is at most 12.7 percentage points on employment and $64.4 on weekly earnings.","[Flores, Carlos A.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Flores-Lagunes, Alfonso] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Flores-Lagunes, Alfonso] IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Flores, CA (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",cflore32@calpoly.edu; aflores@binghamton.edu,,,"NSF [SES-0852211, SES-0852139]; McLamore summer research award at the University of Miami",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); McLamore summer research award at the University of Miami,"Detailed comments from the editor, associate editor, and two anonymous referees greatly improved the article and are gratefully acknowledged.

By integrating additional technical aspects and operation strategies, this paper extends the optimization model proposed by Madaeni et al., How Thermal Energy Storage Enhances the Economic Viability of Concentrating Solar Power. Using a mixed integer maximization approach the paper yields both the optimal layout decision and the operation of CSP plants. Subsequently, the economic value of CSP storage is analyzed via energy modeling of a Spanish plant location under the respective wholesale market prices as well as the local feed-in tariff. The analysis shows that investment incentives for CSP plants with storage need to appropriately account for the interdependency between the price incentives and the plant operating strategy. As the resulting revenue characteristics influence the optimal size of solar field and storage differing operating strategies also give rise to differing optimal plant layouts. Most noteworthy, the current Spanish support scheme offers only limited incentives for larger thermal storage capacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyzes the patterns of household energy use and associated air pollutant emissions in Nepal based on LEAP framework for thirteen analytical regions and three end-uses. Four scenarios involving different growth paths for socio economic and energy system development through the year 2040 are considered. The study finds that household energy use is heterogeneous across the regions and biomass for cooking dominates the country's energy-mix. Households' CO2 emissions are less significant but their local indoor pollutant emissions will continue to rise in the future. To help strengthen government's commitment to the UN's sustainable energy for all initiative, this study devises an energy development index (EDI) to assess country's energy access, and poverty across the regions. The results reveal that the current level of both energy access and energy poverty in the country is below the basic human needs and this situation will improve by little in next 30 years. The paper argues that to improve these situations require more coordinated and innovative plans and policies from the government. The paper suggests that greater emphasis will be needed in reducing dependence of biomass for cooking, promoting domestic alternative energy sources, scaling up biomass improved cookstoves programs and developing periodic regional level energy database.

Additionally a novel metric of scenario similarity is introduced in order to evaluate the difficulty of hypothesized energy system transitions. The results indicate that these tools can be valuable in identifying similar cities for the sharing of best practice, for performing comparative evaluations of energy transitions, and for reinforcing the need to complement quantitative assessments with a more holistic appreciation of local context.

How can the transformation of the German electricity sector be achieved and at what costs? This paper addresses these questions by means of a meta-analysis of 10 recent model-based mitigation scenarios for Germany. It turns out that the scenarios exploit the three basic strategic options of increasing the share of RES-E - domestic RES-E generation, electricity demand reductions, and RES-E imports - to substantially different extents. Domestic RES-E generation increases in all scenarios, particularly from onshore and offshore wind. Scenarios that rely heavily on reducing electricity demand require a relatively low expansion of domestic RES-E generation. Despite detailed technical analyses, insights on the costs of the transformation remain limited. A discussion of underlying scenario assumptions reveals that it is unclear whether (i) RES-E and system integration technology development will be as cost-competitive as postulated, (ii) implicitly assumed institutional requirements will be realized, and (iii) relevant actors in the transformation process will be incentivized accordingly. Therefore, future research should pursue a thorough assessment of strategic options for transforming the German electricity system that consistently integrates technologies, institutions, and actors.

According to Europe's Energy Efficiency Plan, the biggest energy savings potential in the EU lies in the built environment. However, the many barriers to energy efficiency have prevented the implementation of the existing potential so far. This paper evaluates the existing policy instruments aimed at energy efficiency in buildings in Spain as laid down in the 2nd National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP). The results show that the current policy package is insufficient to yield the existing energy savings potential in this sector. As much of the savings potential can be found in existing buildings and realization of this potential very much relies on voluntary action, the renovation sector is in need of an appropriate financial framework that mobilizes sufficient public and private financial resources, and transparent and efficient mechanisms to ensure the return on investment and payments from those who benefit from the renovation. Such financial framework needs to be supported by a regulatory framework that is tuned to existing buildings and an organizational framework that effectively connects the different policy layers in Spain.

Using data collected through an original survey directed at regulators, ministry departments and energy companies of the southern Mediterranean, the study is aimed at assessing the extent of agencies' independence looking at three main dimensions of independence: regulatory instruments available to regulators and decision making autonomy; regulators' organizational autonomy; and regulators accountability. Results show that those countries having established an independent regulator have a more credible regulatory framework than those countries in which such a body does not exist. In particular, the analysis shows that Turkey, Croatia and Jordan have defined a regulatory framework that limits administrative expropriation and, consequently, creates an environment more suitable for attracting investments in the electricity and renewables sector. On the institutional ground, this is probably related with the harmonization of regulatory standards promoted by the European Union through the neighboring policy, for the Jordan case, and the membership perspective, in the Turkish and Croatian cases.

This paper reports on a case study examination of the economic and greenhouse gas implications of pyrolysis plus biochar utilization. The case study involves using poplar grown on set-aside land in Taiwan with the biochar applied to rice fields. We examine both fast and slow forms of pyrolysis and find how the profitability varies under different price structures. The results show that fast pyrolysis is more profitable than slow pyrolysis under current electricity price, GHG price and crop yield as the slow pyrolysis generates relatively less electricity but lower value product-biochar. We also find that fast pyrolysis and slow pyrolysis offset about 1.4 t and 1.57 t of CO2 equivalent per ton of raw material, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to use statistical methods to study the factors that have the most influence on the amount of installed wind capacity in each state. From this analysis, we were able to use these variables to accurately predict the installed wind capacity and to gain insight into the driving factors for wind power development and the reasons behind the differences among states. Using our best model, we find that the most important variables for explaining the amount of wind capacity have to do with the physical and geographic characteristics of the state as opposed to policies in place that favor renewable energy.

The Irish economy is divided into five sectors: residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural and transport, and separate energy demand equations are estimated for all sectors. Energy demand is broken down by fuel type, and price and income elasticities are estimated for the primary fuels in the Irish fuel mix. Using the estimated price and income elasticities we forecast Irish sectoral energy demand out to 2025. The share of electricity in the Irish fuel mix is predicted to grow over time, as the share of carbon intensive fuels such as coal, oil and peat, falls. The share of electricity in total energy demand grows most in the industrial and commercial sectors, while oil remains an important fuel in the residential and transport sectors. Having estimated the baseline forecasts, two different carbon tax scenarios are imposed and the impact of these scenarios on energy demand, carbon dioxide emissions, and government revenue is assessed. If it is assumed that the level of the carbon tax will track the futures price of carbon under the EU-ETS, the carbon tax will rise from (sic)21.50 per tonne CO2 in 2012 (the first year forecasted) to (sic)41 in 2025. Results show that under this scenario total emissions would be reduced by approximately 861,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2025 relative to a zero carbon tax scenario, and that such a tax would generate (sic)1.1 billion in revenue in the same year. We also examine a high tax scenario under which emissions reductions and revenue generated will be greater. Finally, in order to assess the macroeconomic effects of a carbon tax, the carbon tax scenarios were run in HERMES, the ESRI's medium-term macroeconomic model. The results from HERMES show that, a carbon tax of (sic)41 per tonne CO2 would lead to a 0.21% contraction in GDP, and a 0.08% reduction in employment A higher carbon tax would lead to greater contractions in output.

This article presents a quantification of the economic impacts on value added, employment shares and the trade balance as well as required biomass and avoided primary energy and greenhouse gases related to large scale biomass deployment on a country level (the Netherlands) for different future scenarios to 2030. This is done by using the macro-economic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model LEITAP, capable of quantifying direct and indirect effects of a bio-based economy combined with a spread sheet tool to address underlying technological details. Although the combined approach has limitations, the results of the projections show that substitution of fossil energy carriers by biomass, could have positive economic effects, as well as reducing GHG emissions and fossil energy requirement. Key factors to achieve these targets are enhanced technological development and the import of sustainable biomass resources to the Netherlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Many rural electrification projects have failed due to lack of attention to the issues beyond financial and technical dimensions. This paper presents a standardized approach for decision making concerning the extension of electricity services to rural areas. This approach first determines whether the supply provision should be grid expansion or off-grid on the basis of levelized cost of delivered electricity. If the grid expansion is found nonviable over off-grid options then a multicriteria decision aiding tool, SMAA-2 (Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis), will evaluate off-grid technologies by aggregating 24 criteria values. While applying this approach, the delivered costs of electricity by the grid in remote areas within the 1-25 km distances vary in a range of 0.10-7.85 US $/kW h depending on the line lengths and load conditions. In the off-grid evaluation, the solar PV (photovoltaic) and biogas plants are found as the most preferable alternatives with 59% and 41% acceptability in their first rank, respectively.

This paper employs a bottom-up cohort model to simulate current energy saving policies and to make projections for future energy use and CO2 emissions for the period 2000-2030 in the Chinese service sector. The analysis shows that energy demand in the service sector will approximately triple in 2030, far beyond the target of quadrupling GDP while only doubling energy use. However, it is feasible to achieve the target of emission reduction by 40% in 2020 even under the poor state of compliance rate of building standard.

Demand is then met by dispatching electricity according to this rank, from the lowest to.the highest bid. The last capacity dispatched sets the price received by all generation, ensuring the lowest cost provision of electricity. A consequence of this system is that significant deployments of low marginal cost electricity generators, including renewables, can reduce the spot price of electricity. In Australia, this prospect has been recognized in concern expressed by some coalfired generators that delivering too much renewable generation would reduce wholesale electricity prices. In this analysis we calculate the likely reduction of wholesale prices through this merit order effect on the Australian National Electricity Market. We calculate that for 5 GW of capacity, comparable to the present per capita installation of photovoltaics in Germany, the reduction in wholesale prices would have been worth in excess of A$1.8 billion over 2009 and 2010, all other factors being equal. We explore the implications of our findings for feed-in tariff policies, and find that they could deliver savings to consumers, contrary to prevailing criticisms that they are a regressive form of taxation.

The environmental policy integrated climate (EPIC) model is used to simulate crop yields and environmental indicators in current and future potential bioenergy cropping systems based on weather, topographic and soil data. The crop yield and environmental outcome parameters from EPIC are combined with biomass transport costs and economic parameters in a representative farmer profit-maximizing mathematical optimization model. The model is used to predict the impact of alternative policies on biomass production and environmental outcomes. We find that without environmental policy, rising biomass prices initially trigger production of annual crop residues, resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion, and nutrient losses to surface and ground water. At higher biomass prices, perennial bioenergy crops replace annual crop residues as biomass sources, resulting in lower environmental impacts. Simulations of three environmental policies namely a carbon price, a no-till area subsidy, and a fertilizer tax reveal that only the carbon price policy systematically mitigates environmental impacts. The fertilizer tax is ineffectual and too costly to farmers. The no-till subsidy is effective only at low biomass prices and is too costly to government. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of studies point out the need to deliver comprehensive sustainability assessments regarding biofuels, with some presenting analytical frameworks that claim to be exhaustive. However, what is often found in the literature is an overexploitation of environmental and economic concerns, by contrast to a limited appraisal of the social aspects of biofuels. Building on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature, this paper discusses the social constraints and strengths of ethanol, with regard to the product's lifecycle stages and the actors involved. Its objective is to contribute to the development of social frameworks to be used in assessing the impact of ethanol. Main findings indicate that ethanol developments can increase the levels of social vulnerability, although there is little evidence in the literature regarding the positive and negative social impacts of 1st-generation ethanol and potential impacts of cellulosic ethanol. Further work is needed on the formulation of social criteria and indicators for a comprehensive sustainability assessment of this biofuel. Policy makers need to internalise the social dimension of ethanol in decision-making to prevent public opposition and irreversible social costs in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of the scenarios relies on GLOBIOM, a global, multi-sectoral economic model based on a detailed representation of land use. Our results reveal that RFS2 would substantially increase the portion of agricultural land needed for biofuel feedstock production. U.S. exports of most agricultural products would decrease as long as the biofuel target would increase leading to higher land conversion and nitrogen use globally. In fact, higher levels of the mandate mean lower net emissions within the U.S. but when the emissions from the rest of the world are considered, the US biofuel policy results in almost no change on GHG emissions for the RFS2 level and higher global GHG emissions for higher levels of the mandate or higher share of conventional corn-ethanol in the mandate. Finally, we show that if the projected crop productivity would be lower globally, the imbalance between domestic U.S. GHG savings and additional GHG emissions in the rest of the world would increase, thus deteriorating the net global impact of U.S. biofuel policies.

Monthly changes in 2002 and dynamics throughout the period of rapid urbanization (1987-2007) are analysed. It is found that seasonal variation led to distinct shapes and sizes of thermal pollution areas, and winter thermal pollution was highly indicative of industrial and energy transformation sources. Industrial enterprises were the dominant sources of winter thermal pollution in Xiamen. The number and ratio of industrial thermal pollution sources increased stably in the earlier years, and dramatically in the later period (2002-2007), attributable to the effects of China entering the World Trade Organization. Linear regression shows that the number of thermal pollution sources was strongly correlated with several factors of the industrial economy and energy consumption, including industrial outputs, industrial enterprise numbers, LPG and electricity. Related mitigation measures are also discussed. This research builds a link between remote sensing-detected thermal pollution information and statistical energy consumption data, as well as industrial economy statistics. It thereby enhances understanding of the relationship between urbanization, industrialization, energy consumption and related environmental effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Rising electricity prices are perceived to be the greatest effect of the scheme. The EU ETS has served to reinforce commitments to improve energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions in both companies studied. Procedures like monitoring of CO2 emissions and accounting for CO2 prices have become more significant since the introduction of the EU ETS, but the scheme has not triggered a search for innovative, low-carbon solutions. Due to differences in market factors and production factors, SCA has been more active than Norske Skog in investing in and implementing CO2-lean actions. Future studies of climate-mitigation activities, strategies and innovations in the pulp and paper industry should involve more in-depth investigation of the interactions between such factors and the EU ETS.

Across the globe there are two main public policy objectives driving the development of biofuels industries improving energy security and reducing global warming. The US and Canadian governments have respectively fostered biofuels industries for these reasons. As biofuels industries will not be financially viable without government support in the foreseeable future, government policies can be interpreted as taking options on the future. A theoretical model is developed using option value theory to determine whether the same governmental policy (subsidization) can lead to different levels of optimal subsidies in each country, where the subsidy policy is driven by two distinct motivating factors. If the reason subsidy levels differ is structural, the likelihood of a trade dispute arising increases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this perspective, Aegean islands especially Lesvos, are endowed with a considerable potential of a portfolio of renewables, a fact that the entrepreneurial interest has already been targeted. However, regulatory attempts for a massive penetration of renewables do not take seriously into account preferences and risk perceptions of local communities where the proposed projects are to be installed. The aim of this study is to investigate individual preferences and social values towards specific technologies of renewables in Lesvos island. We apply an open-ended contingent valuation survey in order to analyze factors shaping public attitudes towards a portfolio of renewable technologies and estimate the economic welfare (Willingness To Pay) of the preferred technologies.

We first estimate an income growth model to analyse the effects of self-employment on income growth. Then we investigate the independent effects of self-employment on employment growth and changes in family poverty rates. Our results indicate that higher self-employment rates are associated with statistically significant increases over time in income and employment growth, and reductions in poverty rates in non-metro counties. We find similar effects on metro county income and employment, but not on poverty dynamics.","[Rupasingha, Anil] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA; [Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, Northeast Reg Ctr Rural Dev, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Rupasingha, A (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, 1000 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",anil.rupasingha@atl.frb.org; sgoetz@psu.edu,,,,,,,63,58,72,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Owing to the setting of both agglomeration economies in wage and agglomeration diseconomies in utility and thereby different consumption patterns between regions, the present model represents a generation of inequality in educational level between regions even when households with equivalent education are given. Incentive for interregional segregation by educational level is also assumed and inequality is persistent in the result. This model demonstrates a development process starting with a low-developed initial state that represents population concentration accompanied with human capital growth and expansion of interregional inequalities.

We asked respondents about their preferences for four burden-sharing rules to reduce CO2 emissions according to their country's relative (1) historical emissions, (2) income level, (3) emissions per capita, and (4) current emissions. We found that respondents overall favored the rule that was least costly for their country. In addition, the willingness to pay was much higher in China, suggesting that how mitigation costs are shared across countries is more important for Chinese than for Americans. To some extent the willingness to pay varies with socioeconomic characteristics and attitudes. For example, university-educated respondents in the United States are willing to pay more for the rule that is the least costly for their own country, compared with those with a lower education level. At the same time, the ranking of the two most preferred rules are generally robust across all socioeconomic groups within each country. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In Colombia these services are required to operate the national power system and the international connections with the neighboring countries. The system is influenced by factors ranging from system's topology to social and political aspects, such as the large number of terrorist attacks. In light of these particularities, we consider Colombia as a learning lab for ancillary services in the region. Colombia's power system relies on three ancillary services for its operation, namely frequency regulation, voltage control, and blackstart service. From 2010 Special Protection Systems were also added. In this paper we first analyze the technical aspects, operational restrictions, financial management, and the most relevant regulatory conditions of these ancillary services of the SIN. We also take into consideration the main regulatory characteristics and statistical data related to energy exchanges that have taken place between Colombia and Venezuela and Ecuador. Thereafter, we depict the main weaknesses and policy challenges that Colombia must address in order to increase the effectiveness and coverage of ancillary services in both the SIN and in the international interconnections.

In the United States, the biofuels and biopower industries are regulated by different policies and have different drivers, which impact the maximum price the industries are willing to pay for biomass. This article describes a dynamic computer simulation model that analyzes future behavior of bioenergy feedstock markets given policy and technical options. The model simulates the long-term dynamics of these markets by treating advanced biomass feedstocks as a commodity and projecting the total demand of each industry, as well as the market price over time. The model is used for an analysis of the United States bioenergy feedstock market that projects supply, demand, and market price given three independent buyers: domestic biopower, domestic biofuels, and foreign exports. With base-case assumptions, the biofuels industry is able to dominate the market and meet the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) targets for advanced biofuels. Further analyses suggest that United States bioenergy studies should include estimates of export demand in their projections, and that GHG-limiting policy would partially shield both industries from export dominance.

Using the 2012 US Presidential Elections as a backdrop, the analysis highlights the cooption of the concepts security, independence, and sustainability in energy debates by different and often opposing interest groups. The article's first section traces the malleability of energy terminology to the vagueness of the term energy itself and notes how qualifying words like security, independence, and sustainability have been selectively exploited to introduce further ambiguity to an already fungible concept. The second section notes that while energy is a critical and complex factor of macroeconomic production, its main public visibility comes via a few partially representative numbers, like gasoline prices. This mismatch of broad social importance and piecemeal public understanding enables organized interests to leverage vague terminology in support of particular policy ideas. The third section examines three policymaking tools (1) taxation, (2) regulation, and (3) technology promotion and compares these administrative instruments. Ultimately, the article concludes that loosely defined terminology inhibits energy policy discussion and stifles meaningful public debate over and action on energy issues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The women's rights and abilities can be improved through three different dimensions: self-empowerment, social empowerment and system empowerment.","[Mu Guohua] Shandong Inst Business & Technol, Coll Foreign Studies, Jinan 264005, Peoples R China",Shandong Technology & Business University,,389152523@qq.com,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,3,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,DOCKLAND,"7 POINT PARK CRESCENT, DOCKLAND, VIC 3008, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9924140-0-9,,,,2013,,,,,,,356,360,,,,,,5,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Women's Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Women's Studies,BB3CH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342650000069,0

The reference year was 2008. Scenarios include the baseline (BL), new governmental policy (GP) and sustainable society (SS) scenarios. The growth rate of electricity demand in the GP scenario was higher than that of the BL scenario while the growth rate in the SS scenario was lower than that of the BL scenario. Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in 2050 in the BL and GP scenarios were similar with current emissions. However, emissions in 2050 in the SS scenario were about 80% lower than emissions in 2008, because of the expansion of renewable electricity in spite of the phase-out of nuclear energy. While nuclear and coal-fired power plants accounted for most of the electricity generated in the BL and GP scenarios in 2050, the SS scenario projected that renewable energy would generate the most electricity in 2050. It was found that the discounted cumulative costs from 2009 to 2050 in the SS scenario would be 20 and 10% higher than that of the BL and GP scenarios, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper uses an explorative case study design to gain more knowledge about the governance aspects of this under-researched topic. The central research question is: Which factors influence the adoption of innovative energy systems in social housing sites during renovation projects? To answer this question, eight large-scale renovation projects in The Netherlands were investigated. These case studies allowed the identification of barriers, enabling factors and perspectives from three main actors-housing associations, tenants and local authorities. It turns out that adopting IES encounters many barriers: lack of trust between project partners, delay in project progress, financial feasibility considerations, lack of support from tenants, lengthy legal permit procedures, over-ambitious project goals, poor experiences in previous projects, and IES ambitions that are not taken serious by key decision-makers. Furthermore. IES were only successfully fitted in three of the eight projects. Moreover, ambitions were lowered as the projects progressed in all the cases investigated. The study calls for further systematic, in-depth comparison of fitting IES in large-scale renovation projects in social housing. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The decomposition analysis indicates that: (a) all of the provinces except for a few experienced efficiency improvement, while around three-fourths of the provinces' economics became more energy intensive or remained unchanged; (b) consequently the efficiency improvement accounts for more than 90% of China's energy intensity change as opposed to the economic structural change. The econometric analysis shows that the rising income plays a significant role in the reduction of energy intensity while the effect of energy price is relatively limited. The result may reflect the urgency of deregulating the price and establishing a market-oriented pricing system in China's energy sector. The implementation of the energy intensity reduction policies in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (FYP) has helped reverse the increasing trend of energy intensity since 2002. Although the Chinese Government intended to change the industry-led economic growth pattern, it seems that most of the policy effects flow through the efficiency improvement as opposed to the economic structure adjustment. More fundamental changes to the economic structure are needed to achieve more sustainable progress in energy intensity reduction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study finds that there is very small bias due to the assumption of normality. Furthermore using different information criterions, importance of lag length is tested. Findings indicate that selection of lag length is important for Denmark, Ireland, Norway and Spain. It is concluded that while there exists uni-directional causality running from energy consumption to real GDP for Japan, bi-directional causality is found for Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Spain. On the other hand, uni-directional causality from GDP to energy is found for Australia, Canada and Ireland whereas no causal nexus is found for all of other nine countries. Our analyses covering the sample periods imply that Japan, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Spain should not follow energy conservation policy at the aggregated level, since the reduction of energy damages the economic growth.

In addition stress effects from aircraft obstruction markings are an emerging topic related to acceptance. As the height of wind turbines increases, so does the number of mandatory obstruction markings. Recently, obstruction markings have caused a growing number of complaints from residents. Whether obstruction markings indeed cause stress or even substantial annoyance remains an open question. To analyse the stress impact of obstruction markings, we used environmental and stress psychology methodologies. Residents (N=420) with direct sight of turbines at 13 wind farms participated in a questionnaire survey. Evidence of substantial annoyance caused by obstruction markings was not found. However, residents exposed to xenon lights reported more intense and multifaceted stress responses than exposed to LED or colour markings on blades. Moreover, xenon lights negatively affected the general acceptance of wind energy. Additionally, synchronised navigation lights were found to be less annoying than non-synchronised lights under certain weather conditions. Markings with light intensity adjustment proved to be advantageous. To reduce stress and increase social acceptance of wind power, xenon lights should be abandoned, navigation lights synchronised, and light intensity adjustment applied. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This, combined with the heteroskedasticity resulting from the interaction of unobserved ability with socioeconomic factors, identifies the causal effect.

This technology presents advantages over other renewables from the point of view of its integration into the grid and electricity markets. The reason lays mainly in its capabily of storing the received heat and producing electricity following a predetermined. This feature makes also possible its participation in reserve services, possibly increasing in this way the number of providers of this ancillary service. However, technical conditions and regulation makes this participation inefficient.

Of course, there is a broad literature on the topic. However, existing studies have shortcomings. The criteria on which the assessments rely are often neither equivalent cross-nationally nor are they communicated clearly enough (i.e., not transparent). Although ambitious efforts have been invested to rank countries in terms of their environmental performance, little systematic research exists that clearly determines leaders and laggards in terms of their policies (policy performance) and states' ranking, accordingly. To the best of our knowledge no empirical study has so far conducted a comprehensive and quantitative leader-laggard assessment policy analysis. Against this backdrop, we aim to provide such a paper. We especially strive to test the validity of common knowledge classifications or rankings derived from assessments in the literature. We demonstrate that while some known frontrunner states are indeed leaders if assessed from a broader policy data perspective, other countries commonly assigned a leader role find themselves in a lower position instead. In addition, some nations commonly excluded from the frontrunners are located unexpectedly high in the rankings. Even leader-laggard reversals occur if our results would be compared to existing classifications. Most importantly, the analyses show a considerable temporal dynamic. While often claimed or assumed, this has not been proven as clearly until now. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It therefore seems appropriate to consider the risk of a collision gas and its effects on the countries most dependent on gas (either as producers or as consumers). Thus, in this paper, we study the vulnerability of gas in several countries on four ratios developed by Cabalu (2010). Once calculated from empirical data, these ratios helped to determine indicators and to classify countries according to their vulnerability in the event of a gas shock (sudden rise in prices). A picture emerges which represents an indicative classification of the countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper shows the overall effects under different assumptions for fossil fuel prices, domestic installations and international trade. The results are sensitive to assumptions on the development of RE world markets and German exports to these markets. Almost all of these scenarios exhibit positive net employment effects. Under medium assumptions net employment of RE expansion will reach around 150 thousand in 2030. Only with assumptions for German RE exports below today's level, net impacts are slightly negative.

The author argues for a different stance by developing an urban economics model for tourist cities. The model illustrates that in the presence of significant side effects, foreign investors' and a tourist city's preferences regarding openness of the city greatly diverge. Foreign investors tend to shape a city's policymaking toward greater openness. Therefore, policymakers in tourist cities concerned about sustainable development should carefully regulate foreign capital inflows at an optimal level.

This study analyses the energy use of and output from seventeen industry subsectors in California and performs decomposition analysis to assess the influence of different factors on California industry energy use. The logarithmic mean Divisia index method is used for the decomposition analysis. The decomposition analysis results show that the observed reduction of energy use in California industry since 2000 is the result of two main factors: the intensity effect and the structural effect. The intensity effect has started pushing final energy use downward in 2000 and has since amplified. The second large effect is the structural effect. The significant decrease of the energy-intensive Oil and Gas Extraction subsector's share of total industry value added, from 15% in 1997 to 5% in 2008, and the increase of the non-energy intensive Electric and electronic equipment manufacturing sector's share of value added, from 7% in 1997 to 30% in 2008, both contributed to a decrease in the energy intensity in the industry sector.

This research presents a summary of the local efforts in China's ecological industrial parks (EIPs) to assess GHG emissions and identify potential mitigation measures. Through field study and interviews in Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), in Jiangsu Province, we conducted an energy-based GHG emissions inventory for SIP area from 2005-2010, with forecasts to 2015. The area emitted a total of 10.30 MMT CO2E in 2010. Three development strategies including business-as-usual (BAU), existing and pending regulations (EPR) and voluntary mitigating efforts (VME) were introduced to estimate the energy-related GHG emissions in 2015. The results projected that emissions will increase to 17.16 Mt in 2015 with no change in policy or practice, but 3.42 Mt of emissions are avoidable with full compliance with national and provincial energy policies (1.41 Mt), as well as local efforts (2.01 Mt).

The life cycle considers microalgae cultivation, harvesting, drying, oil extraction, anaerobic digestion, oil transportation, esterification, biodiesel transportation and biodiesel combustion. The investigation results show that the fossil energy requirement for the biodiesel production is 0.74 MJ/MJ biodiesel, indicating that 1 MJ of biodiesel requires an input of 0.74 MJ of fossil energy. Accordingly, biodiesel production is feasible as an energy producing process. The environmental impact loading of microalgal biodiesel is 3.69 PET2010 (Person Equivalents, Targeted, in 2010) and the GWP is 0.16 kg CO2-eq/MJ biodiesel. The effects of photochemical ozone formation were greatest among all calculated categorization impacts. The fossil energy requirement and GWP in this operation were found to be particularly sensitive to oil content, drying rate and esterification rate. Overall, the results presented herein indicate that the cultivation of microalgae has the potential to produce an environmentally sustainable feedstock for the production of biodiesel.

Efforts to gain these energy savings are led at national level by policy instruments such as the Energy Performance Certificate, covenants, economic and information tools. These instruments reflect a policy style described as consensus based and incentivising. However, this approach has been subject to criticism with suggestions that alternatives are required. As a first step towards conceptualising alternatives previous evaluations and stakeholder interviews are used to assess instruments. Elements from the theory based evaluation method combined with concepts from policy instrument and energy policy literature form an evaluation framework. Results demonstrate weak impact of some key instruments. Underlying theories associated with instruments are often lost during implementation or remain unsubstantiated. Policy instrument and energy policy concepts are evident but are far from pervasive. Results show that current instruments are poorly equipped to forge a long-term energy saving strategy for existing dwellings. It is further demonstrated that complexity with existing dwellings is not only limited to frequently cited barriers but to the intricacies of designing and operating a well-orchestrated instrument mix.

Such an assessment is important because scholars have pointed out that increases in renewable electricity will not necessarily lead to declines in carbon emissions. We examine the effects of a range of policies across 39 states. We find significant and robust decreases in carbon emissions associated with the introduction of public benefit funds, a form of carbon tax adopted by 19 states to date. Our aim in this paper is not to provide a final judgment on these policies, many of which may not have been in place long enough to show strong effects, but to shift the attention of the research community away from proximate measures such as increases in clean electricity generation and onto measurement of lower carbon emissions.

The descriptive statistics show that average annual growth of energy consumption per capita after trade liberalization varies among countries; hence it is a possibility that the effect of trade liberalization is conditional on factors other than liberalization per se. The regression results show that trade liberalization per se does not affect the growth of energy consumption of the developing countries analyzed, but its interaction with capital per labor reduces the growth of energy consumption as capital per labor increases. However, the effect is only significant after a certain minimum threshold level capital per labor is reached. On the other hand, economic growth increases energy consumption and its effect is not conditioned on trade liberalization. These two different effects mean that, with regards to energy consumption, countries at a higher level of economic development are more likely to reap the benefit of liberalization relative to less developed countries.

Although this sector has been undergoing liberalisation (privatisation, introduction of TPA regulations and competition etc.), the consolidation efforts shown by Polish governments have resulted in a significant increase in concentration of both installed capacity and production. The methodology applied in this study includes typical ex-post structural and behavioural measures employed to estimate potential for market power, namely: concentration ratios (for the largest and the three largest suppliers), the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, entropy, Supply Margin Assessment, the Residual Supply Index and the Lerner Index. Furthermore, an analysis based on the Gini coefficient was employed to obtain an insight into inequalities. The results of this study show that governmental decisions led to a significant increase in the potential to exercise market power held by key power generation companies. Of key importance was the 2007 consolidation, resulting in an increase in the HHI to 1374 (in terms of installed capacity) and 1945 (in terms of electricity production).

The paper develops a methodology to study the interference by analysing the economic and technical behaviour of a hybrid energy system. The hybrid energy system in this case consists of an existing cogeneration unit extended with a new installation of thermal solar panels. This puts two complementary heating technologies in juxtaposition. The two technologies are supported with distinct regional support instruments in each region. The design and operation of the energy system is optimised from the point of view of the investor according to the different support instruments. The optimal configuration is analysed as well as its effect on reduced CO2-emissions during the lifetime of the project. The methodology is applied to a case-study for two neighbouring regions, the Netherlands and Flanders. The policies in the Netherlands show a beneficial synergy. In Flanders, the hybrid energy system is not interesting, indicating unbalanced high support for cogeneration in this case. From the point of view of the authorities, a more balanced regional policy as in the Netherlands provides a larger CO2-emission reduction for a smaller cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The current paper adopts the logarithmic Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model to simulate the relationship between CO2 emissions and other economic development factors in China. Three groups of outliers are found using samples from 1989 to 2008 and the Partial Least Square (PLS) regularity test method. The outlier analysis reveals three important areas for CO2 reduction: (a) decreasing the share of coal to the total energy consumption and replacing it with non-fossil energies; (b) controlling vehicles used in the cities as well as (c) adjusting industrial structure. Furthermore, based on the social and economic realities of China, the current paper designs six feasible development scenarios for the period covered by the 12th Five-Year Plan and predicts the values of each factor in each scenario. The values can test the implementation of China's CO2 control development concept. The experiences obtained by outlier analysis can be of significant reference value for realizing the predicted scenarios. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

GA has been utilized in the optimization of the parameters of the SD model to reduce implementation subjectivity. The chain of Economic development-coal demand-coal production-environmental pollution load of China in 2030 was predicted, and scenarios were analyzed. Results show that: (1) GA performs well in optimizing the parameters of the SD model objectively and in simulating the historical data; (2) The demand for coal energy continuously increases, although the coal intensity has actually decreased because of China's persistent economic development. Furthermore, instead of reaching a turning point by 2030, the environmental pollution load continuously increases each year even under the scenario where coal intensity decreased by 20% and investment in pollution abatement increased by 20%; (3) For abating the amount of three types of wastes, reducing the coal intensity is more effective than reducing the polluted production per tonne of coal and increasing investment in pollution control.

Future technology roadmaps, CO2 emission pathways and energy mix transitions leading Japan are calculated using the AIM/Backcasting Model based on backcasting methodology with taking into consideration that one of the keys for technological market penetration is the preferences of consumers. Under the CO2 emission target of 80% reduction as compared to 1990 level by 2050, it is found from the results that the target is feasible in Japan by implementing actions toward low-carbon society as early as possible. From the perspective of minimizing the total costs, it would be best to target a reduction rate of 16-20% in 2020,31-35% in 2030 and 53-56% in 2040 within the range of Scenarios A and B. During this process, major investment will be needed in the early stage of the analytical periods, especially in the residential, commercial and transport sectors. However, viewed in the long term, this can be recovered by reduction in energy consumption. Moreover, the analysis suggests that returns that balance the total investment may be possible.

It is also an important indicator used to forecast these emissions in integrated climate-economic models. This paper develops scenarios for global passenger car stock until 2050. The study adopts a global regionalized approach, encompassing 11 world regions. Car stock projections are obtained using a multi-model approach, which includes a consumer demand model based on utility maximization, a non-linear Gompertz model and a panel estimate of the income elasticity of demand for cars. The main hypothesis underlying these projections is that preferences for purchasing cars are similar across cultures and nations and that the demand for cars is largely determined by disposable income. We apply scenarios for the average traffic volume and fuel efficiency developed in previous work together with the average carbon content of fuels to obtain the CO2 emissions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper considers whether these standards create an incentive for firms to increase vehicle size by presenting an oligopolistic-equilibrium model in which automotive firms can modify vehicle dimensions, implement fuel-saving technology features, and trade off acceleration performance and fuel economy. Wide ranges of scenarios for consumer preferences are considered. Results suggest that the footprint-based CAFE standards create an incentive to increase vehicle size except when consumer preference for vehicle size is near its lower bound and preference for acceleration is near its upper bound. In all other simulations, the sales-weighted average vehicle size increases by 2-32%, undermining gains in fuel economy by 1-4 mpg (0.6-1.7 km/L). Carbon-dioxide emissions from these vehicles are 5-15% higher as a result (4.69 x 10(11) -5.17 x 10(11) kg for one year of produced vehicles compared to 4.47 x 10(11) kg with no size changes), which is equivalent to adding 3-10 coal-fired power plants to the electricity grid each year. Furthermore, results suggest that the incentive is larger for light trucks than for passenger cars, which could increase traffic safety risks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates whether a declining EROI is associated with an increasing oil price and speculates on the implications of these results on oil policy. A model of the relationship between EROI and oil market prices was developed using basic economic and physical assumptions and non-linear least-squares regression models to correlate oil production price with EROI using available data from 1954-1996. The model accurately reflects historical oil prices (1954-1996), and it correlates well with historical oil prices (1997-2010) if a linear extrapolation of EROI decline is assumed. As EROI declines below 10, highly non-linear oil price movements are observed. Increasing physical oil scarcity is already providing market signals that would stimulate a transition away from oil toward alternative energy sources. But, price signals of physical oil scarcity are not sufficient to guarantee smooth transitions to alternative fuel sources, especially when there is insufficient oil extraction technology development, a declining mark-up ratio, a non-linear EROI-cost of production relationship, and a non-inear EROI-price relationship.

Most of the respondents to our telephone survey claim to support offshore wind energy development, and independent survey data suggest that the observed levels of support may be indicative of the broader population in this region. Overall, we find very little impact of coastal wind turbines on aggregate recreational visitation; loss in annual consumer surplus associated with wide spread wind development in the coastal zone is insignificant at $17 (or about 1.5% of annual consumer surplus). Results suggest that NC local coastal tourists are averse to wind farms in the near-shore zone; average compensating variation for wind farms one mile from the shore is estimated at $55 per household. On average, we find no evidence of aversion to wind farms 4 miles out in the ocean, or for wind farms located in coastal estuaries.

Regions in Europe, Japan and the United States, characterized by a critical mass in terms of technological activity within biotechnology, are identified as clusters. Fixed-effect panel data analyses with fifty-nine biopharmaceutical firms (for the period 1995-2002) provide evidence for a positive, albeit diminishing (inverted 'U'-shape) relationship between the number of technology clusters in which a firm is present and its overall technological performance.

The Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) included for the first time a binding target for energy intensity, while a binding target for CO2 intensity was included later in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011-2015). Using panel data for a sample of industrial firms in China covering 2005 to 2009, we investigate the drivers of energy intensity reduction (measured in terms of direct primary energy use and electricity use) and associated CO2 intensity reduction. Rising electricity prices were associated with decreases in electricity intensity and increases in primary energy intensity, consistent with a substitution effect. Overall, we find that energy intensity reduction by industrial firms during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan translated into more than proportional CO2 intensity reduction because reducing coal use in direct industrial use as well as in the power sector was a dominant abatement strategy. If similar dynamics characterize the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), the national 17 percent CO2 intensity reduction target may not be difficult to meet and the 16 percent energy intensity reduction target may result in significantly greater CO2 intensity reduction.

Yet, we observe that only some firms self-generate while others do not. In this paper we give a transaction cost explanation for such divergent behavior. Using a primary survey of 107 firms from India, we construct a distinct variable to measure the transaction-specificity of electricity use. The 'make or buy' decision is then econometrically tested using probit model. Results are highly responsive to transaction-specificity and the likelihood of captive power generation is positively related to it. At the industrial level, this explains why food and chemical firms are more likely to make their own electricity. Since the burden of poor grid supply is highest on smaller sized and high transaction-specific firms, the grid access policies need to account for firm-level characteristics if government wants to incentivize captive power generation.

The EPA rule fails to account for inefficiencies in or emissions resulting from the production of electricity and as a result greatly overestimates the life cycle efficiency of covered vehicles, which would be evident using exergy analysis. The DOE rule accounts for conversion efficiencies, but includes a long-standing, policy based factor (originally developed to reduce oil consumption by promoting alternatively fueled vehicles). This factor disproportionately raises the calculated performance of electrically powered vehicles. As a result, both the EPA and DOE rules incentivize policies that are not substantiated by the immediate technical merits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This low-density, spatially expansive urban development pattern can have a highly marked impact on municipal budgets. Thus, local governments may see sprawl as a potential source of finance, in terms of building-associated revenues and increased transfers from upper tiers of government. At the same time, sprawl leads to increased levels of expenditure, as it may raise the provision costs of certain local public goods and requires greater investment in extending basic infrastructure for new urban development. What, therefore, is the net fiscal impact of urban sprawl? Do local governments consider the long-run net fiscal impact of new urban growth or do they simply focus on its short-term benefits, ignoring future development costs? This paper addresses these questions by analysing the dynamic relationship between urban sprawl and local budget variables. To do so, we estimate a panel vector autoregressive model using data for 4,000 Spanish municipalities for the period 1994-2005. Computed generalized impulse response functions show: (i) that sprawl considerably increases demand for new infrastructure; (ii) that the capital deficit generated by this new infrastructure is covered in the main by intergovernmental transfers and, to a lesser extent, by revenues linked to the real estate cycle; and (iii) that sprawl leads to a short-term current surplus, as the increase in current revenues offsets the increase in current expenditures due to public service provision for new developments. Overall, these findings point to a moral hazard problem for local governments in which inordinate intergovernmental transfers and development revenues encourage excessive urban sprawl.","[Hortas-Rico, Miriam] Univ Complutense Madrid, Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Hortas-Rico, Miriam] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Publ Finance & Tax Syst, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid,"Hortas-Rico, M (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",,"Rico, Miriam Hortas/AAU-3013-2021","Hortas Rico, Miriam/0000-0001-8112-3325",,,,,71,37,40,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Initiatives of this type can realise efficiency savings of up to 30%, and are likely to remain politically popular while preferred by the public to legislation or fines. While widespread, such programmes can have mixed performance, with savings often not reaching potential. This article investigates whether existing theoretical models can usefully be combined for evaluations of such message-oriented programmes. To do this it examines relationships between the variables of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) using empirical data from participants exposed to energy behaviour change projects. Analysis revealed that when used together, the theories may offer insight into the impact of messaging. While a single exploratory study can only describe what has occurred, it offers initial evidence to advocate further analysis of the potential of the combined framework. The author offers an illustration of how the framework might be utilised by other schemes by example of its application to a major EU project to save energy in Europe's public buildings.

Therefore, it is extremely urgent and important to study the problems related to fossil fuel consumption in the industry. This paper adopts the factor decomposition and the EG co-integration methods to investigate the influencing factors of fossil energy consumption and measure the saving potential of fossil fuel. The paper concludes that the influencing factors can be divided into positive driving factors (labor productivity effect and sector scale effect) and negative driving factors (energy intensity effect and energy structure effect). Among them, labor productivity and energy intensity are the main factors affecting fossil fuel demand. The largest saving potentials of fossil fuels are predicted to be 23.3 Mtce in 2015 and 70.6 Mtce in 2020 under the middle scenario and 46.8 Mtce in 2015 and 100.5 Mtce in 2020 under the ideal scenario, respectively.

We demonstrate that, since 2007, energy transition policies have led to a harvesting turn within the French forest policy framework, meaning that priority is given to wood mobilisation, mainly for biomass uses. In addition, our findings suggest that the political authority wielded by the state over forest policy has shifted from forest administrative services to energy agencies and local authorities. Finally, we show that, although implementation of the harvesting turn is a cause of sectoral and inter-sectoral tensions, energy transition challenge also contributes to a process of (re)institutionalisation of mediation relationships among forestry stake-holders and wood-based industries representatives. The article concludes by arguing that sectors should retain relevant institutional frameworks for actors when choosing political arrangements required for implementing energy transition policy.

Whilst these are known to be imperfect they are widely used to prioritise actions and often in a way that is incorrect. In particular, whilst their use for measures which have positive costs and a net reduction in carbon emissions can correctly rank the measures for effectiveness, use for ranking measures which have a net negative cost, including a wide range of energy efficiency measures, is entirely inappropriate and leads to perverse and incorrect outcomes. As a result, many assessments of low carbon actions are fundamentally flawed in their ranking of effectiveness and action is needed to overcome this and allow an optimum outcome. An alternative approach is suggested here.

Until the early 1990s, China had long been a net energy exporter. The country became a net oil importer in 1993, the first time since the 1960s. For China, energy security first means oil supply security. China turned into a net natural gas importer in 2007 and then a net coal importer in 2009. In other words, China is now a net importer of all three types of fossil energy oil, natural gas, and coal. In the context of rising oil imports and implementation of China's 12th Five-Year Program from 2011 to 2015, this paper examines China's energy security strategies with a focus on three leading elements, namely overseas oil investment, strategic petroleum reserves (SPR)and unconventional gas development Our findings suggest that the Chinese government has promoted overseas investment strongly; its SPR program has been established though the progress for Phase II has been slower than expected and the government intends to boost the unconventional gas sector development However, the challenges are enormous as well. As for future research, other elements for each dimension of energy security should be reviewed to reach a comprehensive conclusion about how well China has done and what steps are needed to move forward.

Reverse FiT auctions, where the FiT rights for a predetermined capacity are auctioned, can overcome this problem but can be plagued by non-delivery risks, particularly of competitively priced proposals. In 2012 and 2013 the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government in Australia conducted a FiT reverse auction for 40 MW of large-scale solar generating capacity, the first such auction undertaken in the country. The auction was highly competitive in relation to price and demonstrating low delivery risks. Proposal capital costs, particularly engineering, procurement and construction costs, as well as internal rates of return, were lower than expected. The auction process revealed limited land availability for large-scale solar developments in the ACT as well as a significant perceived sovereign risk issue. The auction process was designed to mitigate non-delivery risk by requiring proposals to be pre-qualified on the basis of delivery risk, before considering FiT pricing. The scheme is likely to be used by the ACT.

This article provides a theoretical insight into this issue using a double differentiation framework. We assume that consumers perceive a label as a sign of quality compared to an unlabeled product, but that they cannot fully assess the environmental quality associated with each label and only see each label as a particular variety of a similar product. We analyze the pricing strategies of three firms, each one providing one product: a labeled product, with high or medium environmental quality, according to the eco-label, or an unlabeled product. We infer lessons for eco-labeling policies, according to the identity of the certifying organization: the regulator, an NGO or the firms. We show that the firm supplying the eco-labeled product with a high environmental quality is weakened by consumer confusion while the firm selling the unlabeled product suffers from strict labeling standards, to the benefit of the firm providing the labeled product with a lower environmental quality, which gains a competitive advantage. Most labeling policies consist of harmonizing labeling criteria, but only certification by a third party, the regulator or a NGO, guarantees the high environmental quality of labeled products, whereas certification by firms leads to a uniform undemanding standard. However, when both labels are provided by two different certifiers, including a firm, harmonization of environmental standards does not occur and the NGO's or regulator's eco-labeling standard will be much more stringent than the firm's one, preventing NGO's or public eco-labeling policy to significantly enhance quality of the environment and welfare.

And yet, up until recently, the UK was considered a laggard in terms of deploying renewable energy. How can this burst of offshore wind activity be explained? An economic analysis would seek signs for newfound competitiveness for offshore wind in energy markets. A policy analysis would highlight renewable energy policy developments and assess their contribution to economic prospects of offshore wind. However, neither perspective sheds sufficient light on the advocacy of the actors involved in the development and deployment of the technology. Without an account of technology politics it is hard to explain continuing policy support despite rising costs. By analysing the actor networks and narratives underpinning policy support for offshore wind, we explain how a fairly effective protective space was constructed through the enroling of key political and economic interests.

Renewable portfolio standards are a policy tool likely to persist for many decades due to the long term goals of many state RPSs and the likely creation of a federal RPS alongside any comprehensive climate change bill. Even though RPSs have become a popular policy tool, there is little empirical evidence about their costs. Using the temporal and regional variation in RPS requirements, I estimate the long-run price elasticity of supply of renewable electricity generation to be 2.67 (95% CI of 1.74, 3.60). Using my preferred elasticity estimate, I calculate the marginal cost of abatement from RPSs is at least $11 per ton of CO2 compared to a marginal cost of abatement of $3 per ton in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

This study aims to provide recommendations for the instruments to be used to prompt demand response with a view to maximizing energy and environmental efficiencies of various countries. The present study suggests that. different DSM models should be deployed depending on the specific generation mix in any given country. Beside the natural benefits from cross-borders infrastructures, DSM improves the flexibility and reliability of the energy system, absorbing some shock on generation mix.

There. is little evidence of a link between individuals' ex post forecast accuracy and their ex ante subjective assessments.","Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 6BA, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Clements, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 6BA, Berks, England.",m.p.clements@reading.ac.uk,,"Clements, Michael/0000-0001-6329-1341",,,,,47,55,57,0,11,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

The analysis indicated that the average in-use fuel consumption was higher than the type-approval one by 11% for petrol cars and 16% for diesel cars. Comparison of this dataset with the Travelcard database in the Netherlands showed that the deviation increased for late model years and in particular for cars with low type-approval values. The deviation was higher than 60% for vehicles registered in 2012 within the 90-100 gCO(2)/km bin. Unrealistic vehicle resistances used in type-approval were identified as one of the prime reasons of the difference. A simplified linear model developed in the study may be used to predict in-use fuel consumption based on data publicly available. The model utilizes the fuel consumption measured in type-approval, the mass, and the engine capacity to provide in-use fuel consumption. This may be either used to correct fuel consumption factors currently utilized by emission models (e.g. COPERT, HBEFA, VERSIT+, and others) or could be used independently to make projections on how fuel consumption may develop on the basis of changing future passenger cars characteristics.

A literature review of existing material considered the history and drivers of sustainability, the types of energy efficient technologies and factors concerning CSR and consumer behaviour in relation to the supermarket industry. Interviews with 15 senior store managers were recorded and transcribed. The opinions of the senior store managers were then sought and analysed using qualitative research software NVivo software. Validity of the data was achieved at a later stage through workshops. The results of this paper suggested that there is a. definite lack of awareness and knowledge amongst customers regarding energy efficient technologies. From the findings, it was further established that the key driver for retailers who integrate energy efficient technologies is fiscal incentives, although it was suggested some retailers use CSR strategies to report there are environmental achievements it was ultimately found that cost savings were the primary driver.

The main goal of this paper is to analyze whether the EKC hypothesis holds within the period 1980-2025 under four different scenarios. This paper uses co-integration techniques (Stock and Watson, 2010) to test the existence of the EKC hypothesis in Ecuador in the medium term using Jaunky's (2011) specification. Our proposal goes a step further than previous contributions, and intends to see under which conditions a country could approach the fulfilment of this hypothesis in the medium term. Results do not support the fulfilment of the EKC, nevertheless, our estimations show that Ecuador could be on the way to achieving environmental stabilization in the near future if economic growth is combined with an increase in the use of renewable energies, an improvement of the productive sectoral structure, and the use of a more efficient fossil fuel technology.

The control group consists of municipalities that did not. The response variable measures the number of new square meters of solar thermal systems installed in 2010. The analysis leads to the conclusion that municipalities that established a property tax bonus had installed, on average, 102.245 to 122.389 square meters more. These results indicate that the percentage increase in squares meters installed in municipalities which adopted the tax bonus promotion ranged from 70.74% to 98.38%.

This paper introduces a systematic and quantitative method to evaluate the influence of China's oil import risks (OIR) on the national economy and industrial sectors from a perspective of apply chain process. For this analysis, China's OIR is quantified by integrating oil exporting country risk and the risks from oil transportation routes. Country risk is defined as the oil-exporting country's political risk caused by political changes or internal conflicts. Transport risk is defined as the risk of shipping routes affected by pirate attacks and geopolitics. Second, the relationship between China's OIR and oil import costs is analyzed using a multiple linear approach. Third, an input-output analysis method is used to research the effect of the cost of China's oil imports on the cost of investment within China's domestic sectors. This research finds that the corresponding impact on GDP is 3494.5 million dollars given an increasing by 10% of China's OIR. And the impact on domestic sectors differs from sector to sector. Finally, this paper puts forth recommendations to improve long-term oil supply security in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These CCS projects may develop any combination of three types of operating levels: pilot, demonstration and full-scale, representing progressing levels of electric power generation capability. Several projects have commenced at the demonstration level, with full-scale commercial levels planned for approximately 2020. Taking the perspective of a funding agency, we employ a real options framework for determining an optimal project selection and funding strategy for the development of full-scale CCS plants. Specifically, we formulate and solve a stochastic dynamic program (SDP) for obtaining optimal funding solutions in order to achieve at least one successfully operating full-scale CCS plant by a target year. The model demonstrates the improved risk reduction by employing such a multi-stage competition. We then extend the model to consider two sensitivities: (1) the flexibility to spend that budget among the time periods and (2) optimizing the budget, but specifying each time period's allocation a priori. State size and runtimes of the SDP model are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We separated the volatilities of oil price into expected, unexpected and negatively expected categories to identify how oil prices influence bulk commodity markets. We contrasted the results between different periods and among classified indices, in order to discover the significant changes in recent years and the differences at an industry level. Our results indicate that the aggregate commodity market was affected by both expected and unexpected oil price volatilities in China. The impact of unexpected oil price volatilities became more complex after 2007. The metals and grains indices did not significantly respond to the expected volatility in oil prices, in contrast to the petrochemicals and oilfats indices. These results not only contribute to advancing the existing literature, but also merit particular attention from policy makers and market investors in China.

Currently, a number of federal policies are in place to incentivize deployment of PEVs to mainstream consumers with demographics and vehicle attribute preferences most common to today's new vehicle purchasers. This article argues that policies intending to give PEVs a foothold in the market should not focus on mainstream consumers and should instead focus on niche markets-specifically carsharing and postal fleets-and early adopters including green consumers. Two arguments can be made in support of eliminating the mainstream market bias of current policies toward a policy of cultivating niche markets. The first is efficiency: so far PEV policies featuring a mainstream market bias have proven to be inefficient and costly. The second is effectiveness: it is becoming increasingly evident that PEV policies would be more effective in achieving potential societal benefits if they focused on early adopters and niche markets using such approaches as strategic niche management, accessible loans and financing, and appropriately targeted incentives.

To address this challenge a diffusion model was set up and applied to office building stock across New South Wales (NSW) in Australia, accommodating a high spatial resolution and temporal capability for projecting uptake of technology packages characterised by multiple variables. Six retrofit packages were set up for the diffusion model, which ranged from inexpensive services and manuals through to mid-priced packages involving energy efficient T5 lighting and solar hot water through to expensive packages such as chilled beams and Solar PV. We evaluated the model using a base case and two policy programs, representing the Green Building Fund and Environmental Upgrade Agreements. These were recent incentive programs funded by the Australian government to accelerate the uptake of retrofit packages, by providing financial support to upfront expenditures and removing barriers to retrofit. By forecasting uptake of each retrofit package to 2032 under each program, we demonstrate how the model can be a valuable resource in tailoring expensive government programs and increasing their effectiveness.

Presently however, there is no power sector specific cyber security mandates or policies in India. The Stuxnet, Shamoon and Anonymous incidents have shown that cyber attacks can cause significant damage and pose a risk to National Critical Infrastructure. A lack of security planning as part of designing the Smart grids can potentially leave gaping holes in the country's power sector stability. The paper highlights key cyber security threats across the entire power sector value chain from generation, to transmission and distribution.

Using the final equations approach we show that while it is possible to write such a panel as a collection of infinite order autoregressive equations, the innovations of these equations are not vector white noise. This causes the univariate autoregressive sieve bootstrap to be invalid in such panels. We illustrate this result with a small numerical example using a simple DGP for which the sieve bootstrap is invalid, and show that the extent of the invalidity depends on the value of specific parameters. We also show that Monte Carlo simulations in small samples can be misleading about the validity of the univariate autoregressive sieve bootstrap. The results in this article serve as a warning about the practical use of the autoregressive sieve bootstrap in panels where cross-sectional dependence of general form may be present.","[Smeekes, Stephan; Urbain, Jean-Pierre] Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Smeekes, S (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",S.Smeekes@maastrichtuniversity.nl; J.Urbain@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Smeekes, Stephan/0000-0002-0157-639X",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This research was supported financially by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

This article investigates the feasibility of these targets by testing their consistency under possible economic development scenarios. We analyse these targets from two perspectives: consistency with the overall economic growth and consistency with the international society's expectation on China's greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement responsibilities. The main findings are: under the recently announced 2020 target of gross domestic product (GDP) that is double the 2010 level, the adoption of a 15% clean energy target could result in excessive primary energy demand; and then with 40-45% GDP CO2 intensity reduction, CO2 emissions in 2020 could substantially exceed the International Energy Agency (IEA) 450 ppm scenario for China. Thus we propose a 17% clean energy target that can reconcile the domestic plan with international expectation. Our article also outlines the pathways to realise clean energy development into 2020 and proposes policy recommendations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the effects of this diversity for native employees at the local level. The higher is high-skilled foreign employment, the higher are local wages and employment levels for natives. These effects are reinforced the more diverse is the group of high-skilled foreigners. For low-skilled foreigners benefits from diversity are also found, but only conditional on the overall size of this group. These results suggest that cultural diversity benefits native workers by raising local productivity.","[Suedekum, Jens] Univ Duisburg Essen, IZA, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany; [Suedekum, Jens] CESifo, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany; [Wolf, Katja] IAB Nurnberg, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Blien, Uwe] IABNurnberg, IZA, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Blien, Uwe] Univ Bamberg, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Duisburg Essen; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Suedekum, J (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, IZA, Lotharstr 65, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.",jens.suedekum@uni-due.de; katja.wolf@iab.de; uwe.blien@iab.de,,,,,,,36,47,54,5,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Our results show that the logarithmic score of the predictive densities for U.S. GDP growth increase almost monotonically, as new information arrives during the quarter. While the ranking of the model classes changes during the quarter, the combined density nowcasts always perform well relative to the model classes in terms of both logarithmic scores and calibration tests.

Although there is broad consensus that the Indian building sector will grow and evolve over the coming century, there is little understanding of the potential nature of this evolution over the longer term. The present study uses a technologically detailed, service based building energy model nested in the long term, global, integrated assessment framework, GCAM, to produce scenarios of the evolution of the Indian buildings sector up through the end of the century. The results support the idea that as India evolves toward developed country per-capita income levels, its building sector will largely evolve to resemble those of the currently developed countries (heavy reliance on electricity both for increasing cooling loads and a range of emerging appliance and other plug loads), albeit with unique characteristics based on its climate conditions (cooling dominating heating and even more so with climate change), on fuel preferences that may linger from the present (for example, a preference for gas for cooking), and vestiges of its development path (including remnants of rural poor that use substantial quantities of traditional biomass).

However, biomass is not distributed evenly across the globe and regions with a potentially high demand might be constrained by limited domestic supply. Therefore, climate mitigation policies might create the incentive to trade biomass internationally. This paper uses scenarios generated by the integrated assessment model WITCH to study trade of woody biomass from multiple perspectives: the volume of biomass traded, its value, the impact on other power generation technologies and on the efficiency of mitigation policy. The policy scenarios consist of three representative carbon tax policies (4.8 W/m(2), 3.8 W/m(2) and 3.2 W/m(2) radiative forcing values in 2100) and a cap-and-trade scheme (3.8 W/m(2) in 2100). Results show that the incentive to trade biomass is high: at least 50% of biomass consumed globally is traded internationally. Regions trade 13-69 EJ/yr of woody biomass in 2050 and 55-81 EJ/yr in 2100. In 2100 the value of biomass traded is equal to US$ 0.7-7.2 Trillion. Trade of woody biomass substantially increases the efficiency of the mitigation policy. In the tax scenarios, abatement increases by 120-323 Gt CO2 over the century. In the cap-and-trade scenario biomass trade reduces the price of emission allowances by 34% in 2100 and cumulative discounted policy-costs by 14%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly, in its economic-social and environmental dimensions, some of the aspects that are often referred to as sustainability GNP or GDP are inconvenient measures. For this reason it is necessary to take both economic and environmental aspects into account. Alternative indicators are often used for such a measure of sustainable economic performance.

However if we consider the same process in the space of square summable sequences we get an invertible process. Unfortunately, the stationary processes are not contained in this space. This trouble can be removed when we consider the centered processes stationary up to certain time far in the past then having terms the variances of which tend to zero. It does not conflict with real computations since the data are always finite. The auto-regressive operator of the random walk process is the difference operator. Its inverse in the Hilbert space of all square summable sequences l(2) (L-2) is unbounded operator whose domain is everywhere dense in l(2) (L-2) . It is a source of instability.

The key to new ways of system integration in the business cyberspace will be most of all the ability to perfect the environment of system integration, namely with the goal of achieving modern control in a hierarchically ordered cyberspace, for instance e-business with information. The ultimate aim of this article is to review the current trends in modern modelling and simulation methods for the design of a system-integrated e-business model, namely considering the already verified cybernetic applications in practice and the use of selected cybernetic, artificial intelligence and mathematical modelling for a new design of intelligent business models featuring optimal structures and adaptable behaviour. The article is based on the solution of certain specific research tasks carried out at the university, with emphasis on the fact that new economy will increasingly rely on information, knowledge and system-defined modern control environment represented in particular by the use of system engineering theory and creation of cybernetic and system-theory applications for the development of future intelligent e-business models integrated and integrable with information, data, knowledge and visions. Competition will always be understood in the global sense and gradually defined by intelligent means obtained by the system solution of models, modelling and simulation, particularly those of the complicated hierarchical structures of electronic business with the state functions required for control, namely in the system integration cyberspace in the area of cybernetic applications.","[Jankova, Martina; Dvorak, Jiri] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Informat, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,jankova@fbm.vutbr.cz; dvorakj@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,1469,1476,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100153,0

Current economic literature often examines the influence of fiscal variables on economic growth, but the influence of volatility of these variables is less frequently dealt with. The government expenditure uncertainty may even represent a much more problematic factor than the level of expenditure. The aim of this paper is thus to describe the effect of government expenditure on long-term economic growth with a special emphasis on the impact of volatility of government expenditure. To ensure the comprehensiveness of the model, both government expenditure and tax burden are investigated. The taxation is measured not only using a standard tax quota, but also an alternative World Tax Index. The empirical analysis in this article is based on a dynamic panel model which uses data for OECD countries for 2000-2010. The results confirm the assumptions about the negative impact of volatility of government expenditure on growth in model with tax quota as well as in model with World Tax Index.","[Kotlan, Igor; Machova, Zuzana; Drobiszova, Agata] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Kotlán, I (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",igor.kotlan@vsb.cz; zuzana.machova@vsb.cz; agata.drobiszova@vsb.cz,"Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020; Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021","Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216; Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600",,,,,33,0,0,0,4,PALACKY UNIV OLOMOUC,OLOMOUC,"KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,477,482,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900083,0

However, the fuzzification was not done properly. The reciprocity of fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices was not taken into account, even though it is strictly required in the AHP. We propose new formulas for computing the fuzzy maximal eigenvalue of a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix. For the sake of simplicity, only triangular fuzzy numbers are used.

According to the market efficiency theory, an individual firm's stock price reflect market-level, industry-level, and firm-specific information. King (1966) shows that stock prices covary with market and industry returns, but Roll (1988) finds that the market and industry level information can only explain a small part of the individual stock returns' movement in US market, with market model R2 around 20%similar to 30%.

The model is constructed by composition from carefully selected distributions and involves copula components. It allows for the strong nonlinear relationships between the sales and visit variables to be explored in detail, and can be used to construct sales predictions. The model is readily estimated using maximum likelihood, making it an attractive choice in practice given the large sample sizes that are commonplace in online retail studies. We examine a number of top-ranked U. S. online retailers, and find that the visit duration and the number of pages viewed are both related to sales, but in very different ways for different products. Using Bayesian methodology, we show how the model can be extended to a finite mixture model to account for consumer heterogeneity via latent household segmentation. The model can also be adjusted to accommodate a more accurate analysis of online retailers like apple.com that sell products at a very limited number of price points. In a validation study across a range of different Web sites, we find that the purchase incidence and sales amount are both forecast more accurately using our model, when compared to regression, probit regression, a popular data-mining method, and a survival model employed previously in an online retail study.

The conclusions are based on data collected for the period between 1975 and 2012, from Japan and the USA, both countries with solid manufacturing sectors in their industries.","[Tibulca, Ioana-Laura] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,tibulca.laura@gmail.com,"Tibulca, Ioana Laura/E-9952-2014","Tibulca, Ioana Laura/0000-0002-5157-0543",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,769,775,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100083,0

This work concerns ideas on social network interventions which have been successfully applied in other domains but which have seldom been applied to energy policy questions. We employ a dynamical multi-parameter network model where households are represented as nodes on a network for which the uptake of technologies is influenced by both personal benefit and social influences. This is applied to demonstrate the usefulness of this type of model in assessing the likely success of different roll-out strategies that a local authority could pursue in promoting the uptake of domestic energy technologies. Local authorities can play a key role in the retrofit of energy-efficiency and low-carbon energy-generation technologies in order to realise carbon reductions and alleviate fuel poverty. Scenarios are modelled for different local authority interventions that target network interactions and uptake threshold effects, and the results provide insights for policy. The potential for the use of this type of modelling in understanding the adoption of energy innovations in the domestic sector and designing local-level interventions is demonstrated.

Yet, this growth was rather uneven across the different Spanish regions which raised the interest on the drivers ultimately effecting these disparities. Especially controversial were the arguments about the influence of the administrative procedure and the landscape policy on the development of GCPVS on-floor. This study therefore discloses both two elements and evaluates their impact in a group of PV prominent Spanish regions and Catalonia, the latter used as a benchmark because of its comprehensive and stringent regulation on landscape protection, which was accused by the PV industry of thwarting the development of the GCPVS on-floor. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were carried out. In particular two indexes were elaborated to determine the consistency of the arguments pointing to the landscape protection policy as a decisive barrier to GCPVS growth. First, when the analysis is made in relative terms, the ranking of PV prominent regions changes and many of the differences vanish. Second, rather than the preeminence of a landscape protection policy what really matters for GCPVS on-floor growth is the administrative procedure and the processing enabling its implementation.

An assessment of the governability of transport biofuels in the EU,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Governability; Transport biofuels; Controversy,LAND-USE CHANGES; IMPLEMENTATION; BIOENERGY; DILEMMA; EUROPE,"Transport biofuels are currently the subject of heated debate in the EU. In the past decade the deployment of these technologies has been justified by claims of attractive environmental, geopolitical and rural development benefits. However, expectations have rapidly turned into deep criticism regarding the sustainability of these technologies and the desirability of pursuing the biofuel path. This situation has generated an on-going controversy and policy deadlock at EU level. This study explores these issues from a governance perspective. Employing the concept of system governability, derived from interactive governance theory, it attempts to shed some light on the problems facing the governance of biofuels and on how the quality of the governance system could be improved. The analysis showed that the governability of the system decreased substantially in the period 2003-2012 due to increasing governing needs and decreasing governing capacity. The quality of the governance system can be improved by (i) improving governing capacity by reducing conflicts among governing actors, advancing consistency among institutions and creating capacity at international and global level; and (ii) promoting advanced technologies and adjusting societal ambitions and expectations regarding biofuels.

However, a complete picture of universities' contribution to regional, national and international knowledge transfer is still missing. In this paper, we pull together the strings of various scholarly works produced by economic geographers, economists, regional scientists and others, thereby taking stock of achievements and shortcomings and elaborating avenues for further scientific work. We analyse the various functions of universities by using four conceptual frameworks, namely the regional innovation systems approach, the new production of technology theory, the triple helix model and social network theory. These different frameworks help to integrate the functions of universities into local-regional, national and international relationships theoretically. Empirically, universities' relationships have been investigated by case studies, surveys and increasingly by social network analysis. Our exercise results in a critical discussion of a predominantly regional focus of investigation. Looking at knowledge transfer from a regional, national and international perspective leads to a different way of developing theoretical concepts and matching them with empirical tools. In particular, we find that social network analysis and its theoretical basis, i.e., social network theory, will give more body to understanding knowledge transfer functions of universities.","[Fromhold-Eisebith, Martina; Werker, Claudia] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Chair Econ Geog, Dept Geog, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Werker, Claudia] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Technol Policy & Management, Sect Econ Innovat, Delft, Netherlands",RWTH Aachen University; Delft University of Technology,"Werker, C (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Dept Technol Policy & Management, Sect Econ Innovat, Delft, Netherlands.",c.werker@tudelft.nl,,"Werker, Claudia/0000-0002-1922-7235",,,,,124,39,43,2,117,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Raising barriers to development can prevent households from moving in response to either job relocations or job growth at certain locations in a timely manner through restrictions in the local housing supply. This situation may also result in longer commuting distances, times, and costs, as well as greater spatial mismatches. To examine the possible adverse effects of the regulations, this study analyzes how intraregional population-employment interactions vary across metropolitan areas that substantially differ in the restrictiveness of land use regulations. First, an exploratory correlation analysis of 40 large U.S. metropolitan areas reveals that highly regulated regions, particularly those with lengthy approval processes, are likely to show a lower correlation between census tract-level population and employment changes and an increase in mean commuting time between 1990 and 2000. Secondly, regression analysis suggests that the lower correlation in highly regulated metropolitan areas could be attributed to the limited responsiveness of the population to employment redistribution within the regions.","[Kim, Jae Hong] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Planning Policy & Design, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Hewings, Geoffrey J.

We find that there are significant changes in the causal relation between energy consumption and economic growth over the sample period under investigation. Our results show that total final energy consumption and total primary energy consumption have significant predictive content for real economic activity in the U.S. economy. Furthermore, the causality running from energy consumption to output growth seems to be strongly apparent particularly during the periods of economic downturn and energy crisis. We also document that output growth has predictive power in explaining total energy consumption.

Japan is one of the pioneers in smart grid deployment. The Japanese model is characterised by a government-led, community-oriented, and business-driven approach with the launch of four large-scale smart-community demonstration projects. Our case study of large smart grid demonstration projects in Japan found that the Japanese government has demonstrated its high governing capacity in terms of leadership, recombinative capacity, institutional capacity, enabling capacity, and inducement capacity. However, the major limitations of the government in introducing some critical regulatory changes have constrained the smart grid deployment from advancing to a higher-order form of smart grid developments. This paper calls for more attention to be given to the importance of regulatory changes that are essential to overcome the technological lock-in, and the complementary soles of non-state actors such as the business sector and consumers to strengthen the governing capacity of the state.

A random sample of 236 Japanese households participated in the field experiment and the participants were offered two interventions, such as monetary rewards, depending on their reduction in electricity consumption and comparative feedback. The average saving rates of the (i) reward-intervention group (5.9%) and the (ii) reward with comparative feedback group (8.2%) are statistically larger than those of the (iii) control group (1.7%). Our study demonstrates the following. First, our econometric analysis confirmed a significant response by households to financial incentives but a more inconclusive response to the treatment that provided non-financial, additional information. Second, we found a positive influence of treatment externalities across time and households on energy saving. Third, there is a heterogeneous treatment effect in the reward-intervention group, with the households having a high New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) score being more likely to respond to the reward programme and save electricity than those that do not. Finally, and most interestingly, differences in responses to the questionnaire before and after the experiment suggest that the participants had underestimated the marginal costs of saving electricity before they actually started to do so.

Both the energy uses embodied in final demand and interregional trade are investigated from the regional and sectoral insights. Significant net transfers of embodied energy flows are identified from the central and western areas to the eastern area via interregional trade. Shanxi is the largest energy producer and interregional embodied energy deficit receiver, in contrast to Guangdong as the largest energy user and surplus receiver. By considering the impacts of interregional trade, the energy uses of most eastern regions increase remarkably. For instance, Shanghai, Hainan, Zhejiang, Beijing, Jiangsu and Guangdong have their embodied energy requirements 87.49, 19.97, 13.64, 12.60, 6.46 and 6.38 times of their direct energy inputs, respectively. In contrast, the embodied energy uses of some central and western regions such as Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Shaanxi and Guizhou decrease largely. The results help understand the hidden network linkages of interregional embodied energy flows and provide critical insight to amend China's current end-reduction-oriented energy policies by addressing the problem of regional responsibility transfer.

Natural gas is considered the alternative fuel that, in the short-medium term, can best substitute conventional fuels in order to reduce their environmental impact, because it is readily available at a competitive price, using technologies already in widespread use. It can be used as compressed gas (CNG) or in the liquid phase (LNG), being the former more suitable for light vehicles, while the latter for heavy duty vehicles. The purpose of this paper is to outline the potential of LNG as vehicle fuel, showing positive and negative aspects related to its introduction and comparing the different supply options with reference to the Italian scenario, paying particular attention to the possibility of on site liquefaction. The analysis has highlighted that purchasing LNG at the regasification terminal is convenient up to a terminal distance of 2000 km from the refuelling station. The liquefaction on site, instead, asks for liquefaction efficiency higher than 70% and low natural gas price and, as liquefaction technology, the let-down plants at the pressure reduction points along the pipeline are the best option to compete with direct supply at the terminal.

This paper studies the strategic energy planning efforts, energy resource development, and energy efficiency policies established by tribes within the continental US. The paper analyzes the results of a survey of various tribes' energy resource development and planning efforts and supplements the responses with publicly available information on resources, economics, and demographics. We find that incentives and advisory services from the federal government are key to developing the capacity of the tribes to pursue energy planning and energy resource development. These incentives largely avoid the misdeeds of past federal policy by promoting tribal control over energy planning and energy resource development efforts. Tribes with formal energy plans or visions are more likely to develop energy resources than tribes without them and are engaged in a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to energy resource development and energy efficiency.

Wind and solar systems send electricity to the grid. Nuclear plants operate at full capacity with variable steam to turbines to match electricity demand with production (renewables and nuclear). Excess steam at times of low electricity prices and electricity demand go to hybrid fuel production and storage systems. The characteristic of these hybrid technologies is that the economic penalties for variable nuclear steam inputs are small. Three hybrid systems were identified that could be deployed at the required scale. The first option is the gigawatt-year hourly-to-seasonal heat storage system where excess steam from the nuclear plant is used to heat rock a kilometer underground to create an artificial geothermal heat source. The heat source produces electricity on demand using geothermal technology. The second option uses steam from the nuclear plant and electricity from the grid with high-temperature electrolysis (HTR) cells to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is primarily for industrial applications; however, the HTE can be operated in reverse using hydrogen for peak electricity production. The third option uses variable steam and electricity for shale oil production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the captured energy resource, once isolated, must somehow be translated from its point of origin to its point of use; and in doing so, its owner must expend energy. In this paper it is argued that, in a sustainably fueled future: (i) renewable energy in its initially transportable form will be overwhelmingly electrical; (ii) energy frugality will dictate long-distance transport of energy as electricity; (iii) intermediate-term (less than a fortnight) storage of energy will be via compressed air energy storage or pumped hydro- or electrochemical batteries, which can not be comparatively evaluated without extensive expensive development and demonstration; and (iv) massive conversion of electrical energy into synthetic fuels will be restricted to selected transportation applications.

Under the effort of the Chinese government and the society, China's building energy efficiency has made certain achievements. However, the implementation of building energy efficiency in China is still far from its potential. Based on the analysis of the existing policies implemented in China, the article concluded that the most essential and the most effective ways to promote building energy efficiency is the government's involvement as well as economic and financial incentives. In addition, the main barriers in the process of promoting building energy efficiency in China are identified in six aspects. It has been found that the legal system and administrative issues constitute major barriers, and the lack of financial incentives and the mismatching of market mechanism also hamper the promotion of building energy efficiency. Finally, in view of the existing policies and barriers analysis, three corresponding policy proposals are presented. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The UK has been developing policy in this area since 2002 (Heffron, 2013). Finally, as the decade passed, in November 2012 an Energy Bill was put before the UK Parliament. One of the chief purposes of this Energy Bill is to establish the right environment for new electricity generation infrastructure in the low-carbon sector. There is significant debate on how this will be achieved and, indeed, whether this piece of legislation will actually deliver this outcome. This conference aimed to examine the dynamics of policy delivery Throughout the day, there was entertaining discussion as a variety of conference presenters provided interesting contributions on how to deliver such policy goals. In total, there were twelve speakers throughout the day representing the UK (University of Oxford, Pinsent Masons Law Firm, University of Stirling, University of Dundee and University of Aberdeen), and also those who provided lessons from abroad from the University of Copenhagen, Central European University, Milieu Ltd., Pillsbury Law Firm (Washington DC, US) and the Conservation Law Foundation (MA, US).

Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology is considered by the International Energy Agency (IEA) as an essential technology capable of reducing CO2 emissions in the cement sector by 56% by 2050. The study compares CO2 capture technologies for the cement manufacturing process and analyses the economic and financial issues in deploying CO2 capture in the cement industry. Post-combustion capture with chemical absorption is regarded as a proven technology to capture CO2 from the calcination process. Oxyfuel is less mature but Oxyfuel partial capture which only recycles O-2/CO2 gas in the precalciner is estimated to be more economic than post-combustion capture. Carbonate looping technologies are not yet commercial, but they have theoretical advantages in terms of energy consumption. In contrast with coal-fired power plants, CO2 capture in the cement industry benefits from a higher concentration of CO2 in the flue gas, but the benefit is offset by higher SO, and NO levels and the smaller scale of emissions from each plant. Concerning the prospects for financing cement plant CO2 capture, large cement manufacturers on average have a higher ROE (return on equity) and lower debt ratio, thus a higher discount rate should be considered for the cost analysis than in power plants. IEA estimates that the incremental cost for deploying CCS to decarbonise the global cement sector is in the range US$350-840 billion. The cost estimates for deploying state-of-the art post-combustion CO2 capture technologies in cement plants are above $60 to avoid each tonne of CO2 emissions. However, the expectation is that the current market can only provide a minority of financial support for CO2 capture in cement plants. Public financial support and/or CO2 utilisation will be essential to trigger large-scale CCS demonstration projects in the cement industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study overcomes the problem of calculating forward linkage effects in the previous studies by running the SAM model with (1) changes in output converted to final demand shocks and (2) regional purchase coefficients for all the directly impacted industries (fish harvesting and processing industries) set equal to zero. The impacts of the shift in harvest opportunities in response to the Steller sea lion protection measures are displayed in terms of changes in output, employment, value added, household income, and state and local government revenue.","[Seung, Chang K.] NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Seung, CK (通讯作者)，NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, F AKC2,7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",Chang.Seung@noaa.gov; edwaters@hotmail.com,,,,,,,26,15,17,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

It offers a definition of green investment and analyzes the trends and determinants of this investment over the last decade for 35 advanced and emerging countries. We use a new multi-country historical dataset and find that green investment has become a key driver of the energy sector and that its rapid growth is now mostly driven by China. Our econometric results suggest that green investment is boosted by economic growth, a sound financial system conducive to low interest rates, and high fuel prices. We also find that some policy interventions, such as the introduction of carbon pricing schemes or feed-in-tariffs, which require use of ''green energy, have a positive and significant impact on green investment. Other interventions, such as biofuel support, do not appear to be associated with higher green investment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We apply this method to data from five well-known double-bounded contingent valuation surveys. The predictions of our model match closely with parametric outcomes. Further, we find that the inconsistency patterns generally vary for different data sets and different bid intervals within data sets. Therefore no single behavioral model can explain all latent inconsistency patterns either within or across data sets. In addition, we examine the impact of inconsistency in responses on bias and efficiency of the double-bounded format in the absence of correction for inconsistency. We conclude that the commonly cited benefits of the double-bounded format hold only in the special case of nearly perfect consistency between initial and follow-up response distributions. Our method provides a simple tool researchers can use to determine the similarity in response distributions between the initial and follow-up responses and whether incorporating collected follow-up responses are likely to actually increase efficiency without introducing bias.

We find when risk enters through exports, policy makers face a tradeoff between welfare improvements and reducing risk of invasion. Estimates of visitor demand elasticity for ecotourism are low, so price policies are not likely to reduce risk, though they can raise tax revenue. If demand is elastic enough to reduce risk, trade effects can cause loss of income greater than the risk of the invasion.

Mail surveys were conducted in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. The first survey took place before the accident in Fukushima (Autumn 2010), the second survey immediately after the accident (March 2011), and the third survey half a year after the accident (October 2011). A sample of 463 persons participated in all three surveys. The accident had a negative impact on the acceptance of nuclear power. The mean change was moderate, and high correlations between the measurement points were observed. Overall, participants thus showed rather stable attitudes towards nuclear power across the three measurement waves. Results of the present study demonstrate the importance of prior beliefs and attitudes for the interpretation of an accident. The evaluation of the various scenarios was strongly influenced by participants' pre-Fukushima attitudes towards nuclear power. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, wind power is not allowed to be traded in ancillary service markets although it has been proven technically feasible to be regulation services. This paper aims to explore the market potential of trading wind power as regulation services in the California electricity market. A model for wind power trade in the day-ahead (DA) market is established considering the uncertainties of market prices and wind power. An optimal trading strategy for wind power producers is derived by using an analytical algorithm. Trading wind power as regulation is tested by using actual data and the impacts of market control on the market outcome are discussed. The results show that, based on the current framework of the California electricity market, wind power producers can earn much more money if they bid in the DA energy and regulation markets than if they only bid in the DA energy market. The results also show that the potential to enhance profit for wind power producers is larger in the regulation down market than in the regulation up market. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the current trend is heading towards at least 4 degrees C by 2100 and little effective action is being taken. This paper commences the process of developing contingency plans for a scenario in which a sudden major global climate impact galvanises governments to implement emergency climate mitigation targets and programs. Climate activists assert that rapid mitigation is feasible, invoking the scale and scope of wartime mobilisation strategies. This paper draws upon historical accounts of social, technological and economic restructurings in several countries during World War 2 in order to investigate potential applications of wartime experience to radical, rigorous and rapid climate mitigation strategies. We focus on the energy sector, the biggest single contributor to global climate change, in developed and rapidly developing countries. We find that, while wartime experience suggests some potential strategies for rapid climate mitigation in the areas of finance and labour, it also has severe limitations, resulting from its lack of democratic processes.

More recently commentators have expressed concerns that also renewable electricity exports can have adverse economic impacts on exporting countries. My paper analyzes to what extent the resource curse applies in the case of large-scale renewable electricity exports. I develop a comprehensive model that integrates previous works and provides a consolidated view of how non-renewable resource abundance impacts economic growth. Deploying this model I analyze through case studies on Laos, Mongolia, and the MENA region to what extent exporters of renewable electricity run into the danger of the resource curse. I find that renewable electricity exports avoid some disadvantages of non-renewable resource exports including (i) shocks after resource depletion; (ii) macroeconomic fluctuations; and (iii) competition for a fixed amount of resources. Nevertheless, renewable electricity exports bear some of the same risks as conventional resource exports including (i) crowding-out of the manufacturing sector; (ii) incentives for corruption; and (iii) reduced government accountability. I conclude with recommendations for managing such risks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that the degrees of specialization and concentration show increasing trends throughout the sample period, while high-tech industry sector has increasingly concentrated in costal regions. It is also found that the implementation of high-technology-oriented export policy and subsidy for science and high-technology activities encourage specialization and concentration, whereas local governments' protection for local high-tech enterprises results in convergence in regional industrial structure and obstructs regional concentration of high-tech industries. The estimation result is robust not only to the use of various estimation techniques, but also to the control for other factors proposed by theories such as transport costs and knowledge resources. Our findings support the idea that economic policies might play an important role in determining the geographic distribution of high-tech industries in China.","[Zheng, Dan; Kuroda, Tatsuaki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Social & Human Environm, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Kuroda, T (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Social & Human Environm, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",zheng.dan@c.mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp; tkuroda@cc.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23530225] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,36,22,22,0,75,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The article identifies the factors that affect the propensly of a state to use disruption of natural gas supply in order to promote foreign policy goals. The article is based on the study of thirty five supply relations and two case studies. The article claims that disruption of supplies can be initiated not only by supplier states, but transit and consumer states. It claims that natural gas supply relations generally take three forms: neither side is dependent on the gas trade, one side is dependent on the gas trade, or the sides are interdependent in the gas trade. Cases of significant asymmetry of the degree of dependence in the gas trade are most likely to be exploited by the less dependent party for foreign policy gain: The article claims that the prevailing political relations between gas trading states are only one of the factors affecting the stability of supply.

The transparency of the model, and the consideration of clear-cut policies, provides a clear picture of how main mechanisms of land-use competition work, and how they influence the food and bioenergy systems. The model is subjected to a detailed characterization, in which parameters critical to the results and conclusions are detected and their impacts depicted. A large-scale introduction of bioenergy would raise food prices in all cases/scenarios investigated, and relative price increases of extensively produced crops would be at least twice as high as compared to intensively produced crops. Banning production of bioenergy from the most productive land (limiting production to marginal land) would reduce this price impact. However, we show that bioenergy is unlikely to ever be produced on any commercial scale only on land of low productivity. The economic incentives would be strong for owners of more productive land to grow bioenergy anyway and out-compete the more costly production on low yielding land. Large-scale deforestation would become attractive in response to increased bioenergy demand, especially for extensive production systems such as grazing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Usually, cities are provided with better and more modern infrastructure; cities have better supply of physical, financial and human capital, and connected services, and cities have a more modern industrial structure in the sense that their shares of growing industry are higher. Thus, it is possible that policies for entrepreneurship, which in general are designed for urban areas, might be less effective when they are implemented in rural areas. A first step to test the validity of this hypothesis could be to investigate the differences between cities and countryside regarding self-employment propensity and factors affecting the choice to become self-employed. Based on an exceptionally rich data set containing very detailed socio-economic and geographical information on all residents in Sweden, this paper examines: (a) the scope and structure of self-employment propensity in urban and rural areas, respectively, in Sweden, divided into full-time and part-time self-employment, and (b) the importance of a number of attributes that may have an impact on individuals' propensity to start an enterprise in the two area types. Variables being tested are connected to demography and education, labor market status, plant characteristics, self-employment experience, financial resources, family links and regional attributes. The main results indicate that self-employment entry is influenced by the same factors in the same way in urban and rural areas. However, countryside's industrial structure has a smaller share of growing industries. The fact that countryside's startups follow the existing industrial structure means that this modernity gap between densely built up areas and countryside remains. From a policy perspective, this must be seen as a serious problem for countryside's growth potential. This gives an argument for designing a special entrepreneurship policy for the countryside in order to increase its share of growing trades and thereby modernize its industrial structure.","[Eliasson, Kent] Swedish Agcy Growth Policy Anal, Ostersund, Sweden; [Eliasson, Kent] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, Umea, Sweden; [Westlund, Hans] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Urban & Reg Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Westlund, Hans] JIBS, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Westlund, Hans] IRSA Inst Dev & Strateg Anal, Ljubljana, Slovenia",Umea University; Royal Institute of Technology,"Eliasson, K (通讯作者)，Swedish Agcy Growth Policy Anal, Ostersund, Sweden.",kent.eliasson@tillvaxtanalys.se; hans.westlund@abe.kth.se,,,,,,,60,27,27,0,71,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

We develop asymptotic theory for preaveraging estimators in the case of autocorrelated microstructure noise and propose an explicit test for serial dependence. Moreover, we extend the theory on preaveraging estimators for processes involving jumps. We discuss several jump-robust measures and derive feasible central limit theorems for the general quadratic variation. Using transaction data of different stocks traded at the New York Stock Exchange, we analyze the estimators' sensitivity to the choice of the preaveraging bandwidth. Moreover, we investigate the dependence of preaveraging-based inference on the sampling scheme, the sampling frequency, microstructure noise properties, and the occurrence of jumps. As a result of a thorough empirical study, we provide guidance for optimal implementation of preaveraging estimators and discuss potential pitfalls in practice.","[Hautsch, Nikolaus] Humboldt Univ, Inst Stat & Econometr, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Hautsch, Nikolaus] Humboldt Univ, CASE, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Hautsch, Nikolaus] CFS, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Podolskij, Mark] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Appl Math, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Hautsch, N (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Stat & Econometr, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",nikolaus.hautsch@wiwi.hu-berlin.de; m.podolskij@uni-heidelberg.de,"Hautsch, Nikolaus/B-5815-2017","Hautsch, Nikolaus/0000-0001-9702-3871",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [CRC 649]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [W 1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"For helpful comments, we thank the editor and an anonymous referee.

From the mid-2000s, the Commission contributed to a shift in political norms, successfully framing import dependency as a problem requiring an EU-level solution, based on the institution's pre-existing preferences for a diversified energy supply and internal energy market. Whilst Member States retain significant sovereignty, the Commission has achieved since 2006 creeping competencies in the internal, and to a lesser extent external, dimensions of EU energy policy.

This high-resolution data, aggregated at the state-level and classified in broad road and vehicle type categories, is compared to a commonly used national-average approach. We find that the use of national averages incurs state-level biases for road groupings that are almost twice as large as for vehicle groupings. The uncertainty for all groups exceeds the bias, and both quantities are positively correlated with total state emissions. States with the largest emissions totals are typically similar to one another in terms of emissions fraction distribution across road and vehicle groups, while smaller-emitting states have a wider range of variation in all groups. Uncertainties in reduction estimates as large as +/-60% corresponding to +/-0.2 MtC are found for a national-average emissions mitigation strategy focused on a 10% emissions reduction from a single vehicle class, such as passenger gas vehicles or heavy diesel trucks. Recommendations are made for reducing CO2 emissions uncertainty by addressing its main drivers: VMT and fuel efficiency uncertainty. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite its intended benefits, the primary CDM market decreased from US$5.8 billion in 2006 to US$1.5 billion in 2010. One of the primary reasons for the reduction of market size is that developed countries as investors have a high level of risks caused by the volatility of the market price for certified emission reductions (CERs). Another issue to be resolved is that developing countries as host countries cannot claim any right to the CERs produced on their own land. This paper presents a real option-based model for both parties (developed and developing countries) to have their fair share of profits and risks by controlling the uncertainty associated with the future value of CERs.

This paper sets out to explore the approach for realizing China's national mitigation targets submitted to the UNFCCC as part of the Copenhagen Accord; that is, to reduce the intensity of CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45% by 2020, as well as reducing the energy intensity and increasing the share of non-fossil fuel consumption, through regional allocation of emission allowance over China's provinces. Since the realization of China's mitigation target essentially represents a total amount emission allowance allocation problem, an improved zero sum gains data envelopment analysis optimization model, which could deal with the constant total amount resources allocation, is proposed in this study. By utilizing this model and based on several scenarios of China's economic growth, CO2 emissions, and energy consumption, a new efficient emission allowance allocation scheme on provincial level for China by 2020 is proposed. The allocation results indicate that different provinces have to shoulder different mitigation burdens in terms of emission intensity reduction, energy intensity reduction, and share of non-fossil fuels increase.

In this study, we answer two related questions about the development of CCS and power generation technologies in China: (1) what is the break even carbondioxide price to justify CCS installation investment for Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and pulverized coal (PC) power plants, and, (2) what are the risks associated with investment for CCS. To answer these questions, we build a net present value model for IGCC and PC plants with capacity of 600 MW, with assumptions best representing the current technologies in China. Then, we run a sensitivity analysis of capital costs and fuel costs to reveal their impact on the carbon price, and analyze the risk on investment return caused by the carbon price volatility. Our study shows that in China, a breakeven carbon price of $61/tonne is required to justify investment on CCS for PC plants, and $72/tonne for IGCC plants. In this analysis, we also advise investors on the impact of capital and fuel costs on the carbon price and suggest optimal timing for CCS investment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We identify three generic modes of organizational coordination: modular, vertical, and horizontal. By relying on comparative institutional analysis, we compare the modes' performance characteristics in terms of short-term and long-term coordination, preparedness for shocks, and responsiveness to shocks. We derive general lessons, including the identification of three shortcomings of integrated Japanese electric utilities: (1) decision instability that can lead to system failure after a large shock, (2) poor incentives to innovate, and (3) the lack of defense-in-depth strategies for accidents. Our suggested policy response is to introduce an independent Nuclear Safety Commission, and an Independent System Operator to coordinate buyers and sellers on publicly owned transmission grids. Without an independent safety regulator, or a very well established safety culture, profit-maximizing behavior by an entrenched electricity monopoly will not necessarily lead to a social optimum with regard to nuclear power plant safety. All countries considering continued operation or expansion of their nuclear power industries must strive to establish independent, competent, and respected safety regulators, or prepare for nuclear power plant accidents.

Farmers need to choose these crops in preference to conventional rotations for this to be achievable. This paper looks at the potential level and variability of perennial energy crop incomes and the relation to incomes from conventional arable crops. Assuming energy crop prices are correlated to oil prices the results suggests that incomes from them are not well correlated to conventional arable crop incomes. A farm scale mathematical programming model is then used to attempt to understand the affect on risk averse farmers crop selection. The inclusion of risk reduces the energy crop price required for the selection of these crops. However yields towards the highest of those predicted in the UK are still required to make them an optimal choice, suggesting only a small area of energy crops within the UK would be expected to be chosen to be grown. This must be regarded as a tentative conclusion, primarily due to high sensitivity found to crop yields, resulting in the proposal for further work to apply the model using spatially disaggregated data.

Configuring the new regional world: on being caught between territory and networks, Regional Studies. Recent years have witnessed a tremendous appeal in debating the relative decline in territorially embedded conceptions of regions vis-a-vis the privileging of relational and unbounded conceptions. Nevertheless, the most recent skirmishes have seen some scholars emphasize how it is not the privileging of one or other that is important, but recognizing how it is increasingly different combinations of these elements that seem to be emerging in today's new regional world. Here emphasis is being placed on a need to analyse how the different dimensions of socio-spatial relations (for example, territory, place, network, scale) come together in different ways, at different times, and in different contexts to secure the overall coherence of capitalist, and other, social formations. The purpose of this paper is to make visible the politics of transformation in North West England by uncovering the role and strategies of individual and collective agents, organizations and institutions in orchestrating and steering regional economic development. For it is argued that the unanswered question is not which socio-spatial relations are dominant, emerging or residual in any given spacetime, but understanding how and why they are dominant, emerging or residual. The paper suggests the answer to this and other questions is to be found at the interface between emergent spatial strategies and inherited socio-spatial configurations.","Univ Loughborough, Dept Geog, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Harrison, J (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Dept Geog, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",j.harrison4@lboro.ac.uk,"Harrison, John/D-1485-2010","Harrison, John/0000-0002-6434-5142",,,,,77,102,106,2,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

The major findings indicate that although rising income and population are the main driving forces, they are neither necessary nor sufficient for increasing emission, rather energy structure and emission intensities are the crucial determinants, pointing towards the fact that a country with higher income and population with proper energy policy may be a low emitter and vice-versa. Since modern energy-intensive production limits the scope of reduction in total energy use, it is necessary to decouple the quantum of energy use from emission through technological upgradation. The results indicate that liberalisation resulted in higher emission. The paper attempts to illustrate the required adjustments in energy structure and suggests necessary policy prescriptions.

Clean coal-fired power technology is essential for the global GHG emission reduction. Recently, advanced supercritical (SC)/ultra-supercritical (USC) technology has made remarkable progress in China and greatly contributed to energy saving and emission reduction. This study analyzes the dynamics of SC/USC development in China from an integrated perspective. The result indicates that, besides the internal demand, the effective implementation of domestic public policy and technology transfer contributed greatly to the development of SC/USC technology in China. In future low carbon scenario, SC/USC coal-fired power technology might still be the most important power generation technology in China until 2040, and will have a significant application prospect in other developing countries.

Employing per ton damage estimates for the co-pollutants produced by an integrated assessment model, co-pollutant damage estimates per ton carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) are developed for over 10,000 sources of GHGs in the lower 48 states including both transportation sources and electric power generation. For coal-fired electric power generation, the co-pollutant damages are larger in magnitude than recent peer-reviewed estimates of the marginal damage for GHGs. The co-pollutant damage per ton CO(2)e varies considerably across source types and source location. The paper estimates the welfare gain from adopting a policy that encompasses the spatially variant co-pollutant damage to be between $1 million and $85 million annually. The range depends on the slope of the marginal abatement cost curve. The paper also shows that a distortionary aggregate emission cap reduces the advantage of differentiated policy. Provided an excessively strict cap, the spatially differentiated policy may reduce aggregate welfare. This result has important implications for GHG policy in the United States: although co-pollutant benefits of abating GHGs have been shown to be significant in magnitude, tailoring climate policy to reflect these source-specific co-benefits is not necessarily socially beneficial. This bolsters arguments for upstream policy designs. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM.

The number of publications concerning liquid biofuels from mass media, scientific community and government with ethanol production are correlated, seeking for causality between ethanol production and those stakeholders' agendas. Text-mining techniques were used to explore 2016 mass-media news sources, 455 scientific papers and 854 government documents published between 1997 and 2006. Granger-causality tests were performed to analyse the causality concerning stakeholders' agendas. The results indicate that scientists emphasise environmental, agronomic and technological matters, while journalists are more interested in covering economic, environmental, geopolitical and political issues. Although policies on this subject appear to be more in line with science, the trend analysis indicates that the mass media are gaining prominence amongst policy-makers. The causation analysis suggests that ethanol production and public policy present a bi-directional causality at t-2 time lag. At t-1 time lag, ethanol production precedes the publication of scientific documents, which present a bi-directional causality with public policy on ethanol and precedes the mass-media news. In conclusion, ethanol production precedes the presence of liquid biofuels on the agendas of scientists, journalists and policy-makers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The study employed the bounds-testing procedure for cointegration which examines the short-run and long-run estimates. Dynamic short-run causality test is applied to determine the causality direction between electricity consumption and its determinants, by using Wald-F statistics. The results reveal that determinants of electricity consumption function are cointegrated and influx of foreign direct investment, income and population growth is positively related to electricity consumption in Pakistan. However, the intensity of these determinants is different on electricity consumption. If there is 1% increase in income, foreign direct investment and population growth: electricity consumption increases by 0.973%; 0.056% and 1.605%; respectively. This infers that income, foreign direct investment and population growth induce an increase in electricity consumption in Pakistan. Dynamic short-run causality test indicates that there has been unidirectional causality which is running from population growth to electricity consumption in Pakistan. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is believed that creative people and occupations generate external effects which foster economic growth. However, the degree to which these externalities affect production and consumption is as yet not clear. As part of this debate, we investigate the ability of creative individuals to internalize the rents accruing from creative occupations in comparison with other types of activities. In order to do this, the paper analyzes the employment opportunities and wages earned by graduates in artistic occupations (Bohemians) and compares them with those of non-Bohemians. Using a uniquely longitudinal dataset of UK university graduates, we examine these issues using a Mincer-type framework, both in the short and in medium term after graduation. Our findings suggest that there is a persistent gap between Bohemian and non-Bohemians in terms of both the wages earned and employment status. This observation sharpens the need to better understanding the nature and extent of the externalities associated with the creative class which remains an unresolved issue.","[Faggian, Alessandra] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Abreu, Maria; McCann, Philip] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Comunian, Roberta] Univ Kent, Sch Arts, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England",University of Southampton; University of Groningen; University of Kent,"Faggian, A (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",A.Faggian@soton.ac.uk,"Comunian, Roberta/H-3766-2011; Faggian, Alessandra/B-5332-2012; Faggian, Alessandra/K-8548-2019; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013; Comunian, Roberta/S-7397-2018","Faggian, Alessandra/0000-0002-2479-2933; McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654; Comunian, Roberta/0000-0001-8784-8765",,,,,55,26,29,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The certification test is performed over a single driving cycle, (New European Driving Cycle-NEDC). The dynamics of NEDC and the fact that it does not account for other factors results in CO2 emissions which are non-representative of real-world performance. Using available data from the CO2 monitoring database and literature and employing simple vehicle dynamics model and stochastic techniques, this paper attempts to calculate the average gasoline and diesel passenger car characteristics, investigate how the evolution of certain vehicle characteristics affects real world vehicle performance and to combine the above in order to evaluate the progress in terms of real world emissions and possible correction of existing emission factors. The analysis reveals that reductions over NEDC are generally reflected over real world. There were indications particularly for diesel vehicles that the NEDC-real world CO2 emissions gap gradually widens and that existing emission factors should be amended accordingly. Currently this difference between certification and real world emission is estimated between 20 and 25%. The benefit of diesel vehicles compared to their gasoline equivalents in terms of CO2 emissions appears to reduce. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

NZ has a poor history of housing regulation, so existing houses are often poorly insulated and rental properties are not required to have insulation or heating. Average indoor temperatures are cold by international standards and occupants regularly report they are cold, because they cannot afford to heat their houses. Fuel poverty is thought to be a factor in NZ's high rate of excess winter mortality (16%, about 1600 deaths a year) and excess winter hospitalisations (8%). We examined the link between indoor cold and health in two community trials, the Housing, Insulation, and Health Study and the Housing. Heating, and Health Study and both interventions demonstrated encouraging benefit/cost ratios. NZ governments have translated this and other research into major policy programmes designed to retrofit insulation and efficient heating into existing houses. However, houses are predominantly electrical resistance heated and a largely unregulated electricity market has seen rapidly rising residential electricity prices. These rising energy prices, combined with low rates of economic growth, rising unemployment and generally rising income inequality, are likely to further increase levels of fuel poverty in NZ, unless broader policy action is taken.

More specifically, it discusses how the policy instrument changed over time and what the drivers of that change were. The UK was the first country in Europe that introduced obligations on suppliers to save energy at the customer end in 1994. Since then this policy changed rapidly and is now the principal instrument to deliver energy savings in the housing stock. The paper aims to answer three questions: First, how did the policy instrument change over time? Second, what were the key drivers of that change?

Worryingly, the cost attribute is often among those attributes that are likely to be ignored by respondents. We use probabilistic decision process models (similar in form to latent class models, but where we define the classes to describe specific heuristics) to facilitate situations where respondents adopt cost thresholds and cut-offs. We further develop this model to address the potential confounding between preference heterogeneity and processing heterogeneity by simultaneously allowing for a segmentation of respondents based on their sensitivities to cost. Results, based on an empirical dataset on the existence value of rare fish species in Ireland, provide further confirmation that a share of respondents did not attended to cost. Importantly, however, when heterogeneity to cost levels is accounted for the inferred incidence of complete non-attendance is markedly lower, to the extent that when cost thresholds and cut-offs are also accommodated it almost disappears. This modelling approach leads to significant gains in model fit and has important implications for welfare analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

According to the prediction based on the basic coal reserve data, coal production in China will reach its peak in the 2030 s while that of Shanxi and Henan provinces will be achieved by the 2040 s and 2020 s respectively. This article also assesses the influential factors of China's coal peak and revises the forecast of Lin and Liu (2010) about China's coal demand by taking the CO2 intensity constraint into consideration, and then predicting the corresponding coal import. The results show that China would import 983 million tonnes of coal in 2020; which takes as high as 27% of China's total coal consumption. This article demonstrates that even if China fulfills CO2 intensity constraint, the country's energy situation would still be grim as a result of its high GDP growth rate. Therefore, China has to consider both CO2 intensity and energy security constraints when establishing strategic energy plan. Finally, this article suggests an adjustment of energy structure by which those constraints can be addressed and further assesses the effect of the adjusted energy structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, PSO optimal Fourier method, seasonal ARIMA model and combined models of PSO optimal Fourier method with seasonal ARIMA are applied in the Northwest electricity grid of China to correct the forecasting results of seasonal ARIMA. The modification models forecasting of the electricity demand appears to be more workable than that of the single seasonal ARIMA. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the three residual modification models is higher than the single seasonal ARIMA model and that the combined model is the most satisfactory of the three models.

The welfare effects of efforts to raise energy prices closer to world levels are examined in this paper. Reform of energy prices is an important element of the Economic Reform Plan (2010-2014) for Iran. We first analyze the relationship between energy consumption, energy and non-energy prices by estimating the household expenditure function. The results show that a higher energy prices will decrease energy consumption by Iranian households. Second, we evaluate the impact of a rise of energy prices on the household welfare by measuring the compensating variation (CV) in five steps with a compensating payment. The results show that Iranian household welfare will increase with a 100% or 200% rise in energy prices, if the government pays 20%, 30% or 50% of the $20 billion income resulting from removing energy subsidies. While, in contrast, Iranian household welfare will decrease with a 400% and 500% rise in energy prices, if the government payment is 20% or 30% of $20 billion income. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the data allow us to track the same workers over the years, we are in the unusual position of obtaining the individual wages before and after the migration process. As a significant share of workers changed States in the sample period, it is possible to examine to what extent the wage differentials reflect the concentration of high-skilled individuals in some States. The results show that the overall wage variability across States drops to almost one third of its original value and the ranking of the State effects is significantly altered after we take into account the workers' fixed effects.

This paper investigates whether this policy has an additional benefit in terms of economic resilience by protecting the EU from the macroeconomic consequences due to an oil price rise. We use the GEM-E3 computable general equilibrium model to analyse the results of three scenarios. The first one refers to the impact of an increase in the oil price. The second scenario analyses the European climate policy and the third scenario analyses the oil price rise when the European climate policy is implemented. Unilateral EU climate policy implies a cost on the EU of around 1.0% of GDP. An oil price rise in the presence of EU climate policy does imply an additional cost on the EU of 1.5% of GDP (making a total loss of 2.5% of GDP), but this is less than the 2.2% of GDP that the EU would lose from the oil price rise in the absence of climate policy. This is evidence that even unilateral climate policy does offer some economic protection for the EU. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

(2010) (HRV) to promote electricity transmission network expansion in the Peruvian electricity transmission system known as SEIN (Sistema Electric Interconectado Nacional). The HRV mechanism combines the merchant and regulatory approaches to promote investment into transmission grids. This mechanism gives incentives for efficient investment in expansion of the network by rebalancing over time the fixed and variable charges of a two-part tariff in the framework of a wholesale electricity market with locational pricing. The expansion of the network is carried out through the sale of Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) for the congested lines. The mechanism is applied for 103 nodes of the SEIN using detailed characteristics of generators, nodes and transmission lines. Under Laspeyres weights and linear cost of expansion of transmission capacity, it is shown that prices converge to lower price levels as a result of increased transmission capacity.

A second relevant issue is whether new member regions where capital cities are located are benefiting from the same network effect that stimulated growth in old member capital regions during the 1980s and early 1990s. We find evidence, by means of spatial econometrics tools, of significant spatial effects in the enlarged Europe which seems to be formed by a group of old member regions, slowly becoming more homogeneous, and a newcomers group which represents a separate convergence club but whose capital regions are rapidly integrating into the west.

The 2005 Renewable Energy Law and related policies have driven the rapid increase in wind power installed capacity in China over the past half-decade, with capacity doubling annually since 2005. However, a large number of wind farms generate electricity well below their installed capacity, resulting in considerable wastage of resources. Non-grid-connected wind power theory proposes that large-scale wind power output does not necessarily have to be fed into the grid, but can be used directly in industrial production. Thus, the use of the theory can promote the sustainable development of the wind power industry by obviating the need for power grid. In this paper we analyze the influence of government policy on wind power industry from the perspective of institutional change, by employing the basic theories of new institutional economics. A development model for non-grid-connected wind power is proposed in order to implement institutional change in accordance with the specific characteristics of wind power industry in China. This model requires the government to play an active role in institutional development by increasing economic efficiency in order to promote the sustainable development of wind power.

The classical location factors, e.g., infrastructure availability, have been confirmed to play a role, and there is a weak evidence that authorization demands have targeted communities that suffer less environmental damage. However our findings have also revealed that power producers are likely to avoid potentially suitable sites if they host a highly activistic community.

Major driving forces are the increasing car use in developing countries and the global growth in air travel. Meeting the 2 degrees C climate target, however, requires a deep cut in CO2 emissions. In this paper, we explore how extensive emission reductions may be achieved, using a newly developed travel model. This bottom-up model covers 26 world regions, 7 travel modes and different vehicle types. In the experiments, we applied a carbon tax and looked into the model's responses in terms of overall travel demand, modal split shifts, and changes in technology and fuel choice. We introduce two main scenarios in which biofuels are assumed to be carbon neutral (not subject to taxation, scenario A) or to lead to some greenhouse gas emissions (and therefore subject to taxation, scenario B). This leads to very different outcomes. Scenario A achieves emission reductions mostly through changes in fuel use. In Scenario B efficiency improvement and model split changes also play a major role. In both scenarios total travel volume is affected only marginally. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Nearly all OECD countries currently have significant negatively trending energy-GDP ratios; but for several countries those negative trends are recent, and two countries have recent significant positive trends. For several countries, energy intensity had a significant positive trend followed by a break and then a significant negative trend. Those break-dates, however, appear to have little to do with level of development (GDP per capita). Alternatively, the volatile energy prices of the 1970s and early 1980s played a role in many of the countries that experienced inverted-V breaks. These findings have implications for future modeling and forecasting of energy consumption as well as for the role of energy price policy in developed and developing countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Of the world's energy poor, 95% are in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Within Asia, almost 80% of electricity-deprived and 86% of biomass-dependent populations are in the Big 5 countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan. In this paper, we discuss the broad contours of the political economy of energy access in these countries. The political economy is assessed through an examination of three sustainability objectives: accessibility of physical infrastructure; energy service delivery; and conformance to social goals. The key areas of concern include emphasis on supply-driven grid electricity; vested power dynamics favouring affluent and urban areas; unreliability of energy service provision; and misdirected and misappropriated subsidies. The above-mentioned issues are responsible for limiting accelerated achievement of universal energy access in the Big 5 countries and need to be addressed through innovative approaches. The paper emphasizes the need for firm commitments, policy convergence, and the implementation of 'pro-poor' equitable energy policies through a broad-based energy framework of bench-marked, technology-neutral energy provisioning that ensures reliability and equity. It highlights the need for reorienting of the subsidy regime and incorporating energy service delivery indicators in monitoring and reporting mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

(Agribusiness 3(4):393-402, 1987) for a small, open economy by incorporating the effect of transport cost on production cost. We then used the model to investigate the welfare impacts of rising transport cost in terms of consumer and producer surpluses, using the vegetable sector in Hawaii as a case study. We showed that the two key parameters affecting the adjustments in Hawaii's vegetable sector in response to the change of transport cost and the subsequent welfare impact are the transport cost content of the imported product and the local farm share of retail price. Using the import statistics of 10 major vegetable crops in 2006-2007, we found that every 1% increase in transport cost is expected to enhance the self-sufficiency of Hawaii's vegetable sector by approximately 0.5%, but at a cost of $0.27 million surplus loss.","[Yu, Run] Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Yu, Run; Leung, Ping Sun] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Ocean University of China; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Yu, R (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.",run@hawaii.edu; psleung@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,17,1,2,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Despite the strong case for the use of the US dollar as a vehicle currency in the oil trade, we provide an alternative view. We develop a simple network effects model to identify the conditions under which either a complete switch in the oil invoicing currency or parallel invoicing in different currencies is possible and economically sensible. We calibrate the model using low actual values for the transaction costs of using euro and/or US dollars, as well as a proxy for information costs, which decline with the increase in the use of the new currency. The results show that there will be a switch to parallel invoicing in both currencies when two conditions are met: first, oil exporters expect that a certain minimum number of other oil exporters will also start using the new currency; and second, the information costs associated with quoting oil contracts in two currencies are low.

Meta-analyses of empirical studies emphasize the absence of class-size effects but detractors have argued against such pessimistic conclusions because many of the underlying studies have not paid attention to the endogeneity of class size. This article uses a stringent method to address the endogeneity problem using Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study data on 47 countries. We measure the class size effect by relating the difference in a student's achievement across subjects to the difference in his/her class size across subjects. This (subject-differenced) within-pupil achievement production function avoids the problem of the non-random matching of children to specific schools, and to classes within schools. The results show a statistically significant negative effect of class size in 14 countries, but the effect size is small in most cases. Several robustness tests are carried out, including control for students subject-specific ability and subject-specific teacher characteristics, and correction for possible measurement error. Thus, our approach to addressing the endogeneity problem confirms the findings of meta-analyses that find little support for class size effects. Additionally, we find that class size effects are smaller in countries with higher teacher quality.","[Altinok, Nadir] Univ Nancy 2, Dept Econ BETA CNRS, Fac Droit Sci Econ & Gest, F-54035 Nancy, France; [Kingdon, Geeta] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1H 0PD, England",Universite de Lorraine; University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Altinok, N (通讯作者)，Univ Nancy 2, Dept Econ BETA CNRS, Fac Droit Sci Econ & Gest, 13 Pl Carnot, F-54035 Nancy, France.",nadir.altinok@gmail.com; g.kingdon@ioe.ac.uk,"Kingdon, Geeta/AAQ-2321-2021","Kingdon, Geeta/0000-0002-1583-5540",,,,,22,30,42,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Three studies were conducted to assess whether key arguments used by government within this consultation might have influenced public opinion about the technology. Participants first read a passage of text that made salient certain positive (climate change mitigation, increased energy security) or negative (nuclear waste) aspects of the nuclear debate. Participants then completed a task that required them to create an electricity mix for the UK by varying the contributions made by each of five energy sources (coal, gas, nuclear, renewables and electric import). Study 1 seemed to indicate that pitching the debate in terms of climate change mitigation was effective in increasing endorsement of nuclear power. The results of studies 2 and 3, however, contested this conclusion, suggesting that these arguments were having little direct impact upon participants' preferences for nuclear power. The results of these studies hold implications for UK energy policy and attitude assessment and can contribute to the understanding of how the arguments used by government in the 2007 consultation might have influenced public opinion.

However, they may also increase the demand for electricity during peak periods, thereby requiring the construction of new generating units and increasing total costs to electricity consumers. We evaluate the economic costs and benefits of policies that shift charging demand from daytime to off-peak nighttime hours, using data for two different independent system operators and considering a number of sensitivity analyses. We find that the total savings from demand-shifting run into the billions of dollars, though as a percentage of total electricity costs they are quite small. The value of smart charging policy varies significantly across electric grids. Time-of-use pricing is worthwhile under all of the cases we study, but the economic benefits of optimal charging of electric vehicles do not appear to justify investing in the smart grid infrastructure required to implement real-time pricing.

Although 88% of surveyed homes had purchased a major appliance in the last 2 years, only 16% had any idea of the energy rating of their new appliances. Use of energy saving light bulbs is predominant in kitchens compared to other rooms. 70-80% of householders undertook some kind of day-to-day energy efficiency measures. 20-35% of householders would like to invest in energy-saving measures but found cost to be a key barrier. Approximately 84% of those surveyed were unaware of the energy rating of their household appliances. Price and brand were the most important factors determining the purchase of a new appliance.

However, economic disparities within European Monetary Union member states are an equally important policy issue. This paper considers a country with a large regional divide - Italy - at a fine level of territorial disaggregation (NUTS-3). It is shown that economically backward regions display greater inflation persistence. Moreover, higher persistence is linked to a lower degree of competitiveness in the retail sector. Finally, the inflation persistence at the national level does not present any geographical aggregation bias, because it equals the mean of inflation persistence of provincial data.","[Vaona, Andrea] Univ Verona, Dept Econ Sci, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Ascari, Guido] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Vaona, Andrea; Ascari, Guido] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",University of Verona; University of Pavia; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Vaona, A (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Econ Sci, Palazzina 32 Sci Econ Ex Caserma Passalacqua,Vial, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",andrea.vaona@univr.it; gascari@eco.unipv.it,,"ASCARI, GUIDO/0000-0002-5037-1964",,,,,51,14,14,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Under the pressure of the economic crisis in the country, the Italian government has restructured renewable energy support schemes, introducing a new program in 2013. In this paper, the effects of the previous and current support schemes on the optimal plant size, feedstock mix and profitability were investigated by introducing a spatially explicit biogas supply chain optimization model, which accounts for different incentive structures. By applying the model to a regional case study, homogenization observed to date is recognized as a result of former incentive structures. Considerable reductions in local economic potentials for agricultural biogas power plants without external heat use, are estimated. New plants are likely to be manure-based and due to the lower energy density of such feedstock, wider supply chains are expected although optimal plant size will be smaller. The new support scheme will therefore most likely eliminate past distortions but also slow down investments in agricultural biogas plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

China's electricity sector is currently in a slow progress towards a more competitive and market-based system. Both equal share dispatching policy and regulated wholesale and retail pricing policies pose significant challenges for implementation of ETS in China's electricity sector. One of the important points of ETS is to give a price for carbon emissions and establish a cost pass-through mechanism (reminded that the essential of carbon pricing is to put a price on carbon emissions that is equal to discounted value of the external damages). It should be regarded as a part of broader policy package for energy and resources price reform. This will require that any low-carbon power policy should be considered as a part of whole policy package aiming at further liberalizing the electricity sector in China. Three policy options are identified to incorporate ETS with electricity reform under different circumstances. A combination of those three options is also proposed to break the lock and reinforce the positive interaction between ETS and the transition towards a competitive electricity system, in link with current pilot ETS designs. A roadmap to introduce ETS in a stepwise manner is suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

With the retirement of diffusion enrichment facilities, enrichment prices have declined by one-third since 2009 and are likely to remain below $100-kgSWU for the foreseeable future. Here, initial uranium prices are set at $90/kgU and reprocessing costs at $2500 per kilogram of heavy-metal throughput, representative of new-build costs for reprocessing facilities. Substantial reprocessing cost reductions must be achieved if MOX is to be competitive, i.e., if it is to improve the sustainability of the LWR. However, results indicate that preserving the MOX alternative for spent fuel management later in this century has a large present value under several sets of assumptions regarding uranium price increases and reprocessing cost decreases.

The cornerstone of this regulation is a (hypothetical) EPA mandate for an emission standard of 80 kg of CO2 per MWh of electricity generated. The mandate would go into effect at the end of 2027 for all power generating facilities that come into operation after 2017. Fossil-fuel power plants could meet the standard by capturing between 80 and 90% of their current CO2 emissions. While the initial cost of complying with this standard is relatively high for first-of-a-kind facilities, learning effects are projected to reduce this cost substantially by the end of 2027, provided new facilities consistently adopt carbon capture technology in the intervening years. We identify a combination of investment- and production tax credits that provide the required incentives for new facilities to be willing to comply with the standard ahead of the mandate. Due to the anticipated learning effects, the incremental cost associated with the stricter emission limit is projected to about 1.2 not subset of per kWh of electricity in the long run.

This study combines various aspects of environmental protection and establishes a non-radial network DEA approach to evaluate the performance of an environmental protection system. The empirical methodology assumes that the system consists of three stages: administrative, executive processes, and protection effectiveness. The executive process includes waste treatment and pollution auditing divisions. In addition to assessing efficiencies, the empirical evaluation further explores the internal and external influences on performances and contributes implications and suggestions for environmental policy makers. The proposed model is utilized to gauge the performance of an environmental protection system for 20 municipalities in Taiwan. The results indicate the following; (1) for improving environmental quality, the government needs to put forth greater efforts in environmental audits; (2) improving productivity per unit so as to increase achievements in the executive process is more important for raising performance on environmental work, in addition to increasing workers and equipment for environmental protection; (3) a high degree of industrialization negatively influences administrative efficiency and educated residents have a greater comprehension for administrative operations, which can help in efficient budget utilization.

Climate change creates unprecedented uncertainty about future land values and species habitat ranges, such that conservation scientists cannot map costs and benefits with certainty anymore. This paper contributes to the literature on the economics of conservation in the face of climate change uncertainty. It advances a new method for using modern portfolio theory to choose lands to protect that yield total conservation returns with less uncertainty. It explores the implications for portfolio recommendations of variation in the correlations between ecological and land-value responses to climate change. It also tests the robustness of the method to shortcuts that might be taken to simplify analysis, identifying problems that arise if conservation costs are ignored in portfolio analysis and demonstrating when portfolio recommendations are sensitive to how ecological benefits are quantified.

The requirement system stipulating the sustainable development of the building sector is usually based on the analysis of a few reference buildings, combining energy efficiency measures and HVAC systems. The risk of this method is that depending on the assumptions either the requirements do not provide sufficient incentives for energy saving measures and renewables or the requirements cannot be fulfilled with rational solutions in many cases. Our method is based on the artificial generation of a large building sample, where the buildings are defined by geometric and other parameters. Due to the large number of combinations, the effect of many variables appear in the results, with the deviations reflecting the sensitivity of the energy balance. The requirements are set based on some fundamental considerations and the statistical analysis of the sample. The method is demonstrated on the example of setting the requirements for residential buildings in Hungary. The proposed requirements are validated against the common European targets. The suggested method is suitable for developing building energy regulation threshold values, certification schemes or benchmarking values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It argues that institutional change has functional externalities for energy security. The German gas market provides a useful case study, as Germany is the biggest continental gas market, a major hub and transport country which has largely privatised, unbundled and separated its natural gas undertakings. Transition is ongoing, tending towards an internal market. Inter/national natural gas economics is in flux. Institutional evolution has repercussions for corporate and market structures, the operating of the system and the realization of transactions. Changes in the institutional framework crucially affect energy security, which is often associated with institutional stability. On the basis of this case study, it is argued herein that the security of natural gas supplies should be reexamined in the context of the developments described above, since overall the institutional changes in natural gas security lag behind the EU's internal natural gas market development.

Multiple elements in the link may act as. a barrier, except for one crucial concept often ignored: Energy Services (ES), the closest contact between end-uses of energy and human satisfaction. This study explores the link through such concept by analysing how 17 predictors associate to six dimensions of ES satisfaction in two income groups. Data is gathered from two locations within one political region (Mexico), so as to control for culture and climate, and the analysis is made based on regional comparisons of principal component analyses and regressions on the data. The findings suggest that ES and commodities are prioritised differently as income rise, and that materially-based gains on ES show general decreasing returns to scale, being largest on essential ES in the lower incomes. Additionally, household characteristics seem to be the most relevant within these material predictors, placing energy use and commodities (including better technology) second in importance. These results suggest crucial theoretical and policy implications on development strategies also discussed in the study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were taken from the Social Hotspots Database on all categories for all the related themes and all indicators available. To limit the amount of data, only high and very high risk indicators were considered for each combination. The risks identified per life cycle phase were listed for each fuel assessed and the results were then aggregated by counting the number of high and very high risk indicators for that fuel. All the fossil fuels and biofuels analysed were found to display high or very high risks of negative impacts. Country of origin seemed to be of greater importance for risks than fuel type, as the most risk-related and least risk-related product systems referred to the same type of fuel, fossil oil from Russia/Nigeria and fossil oil from Norway, respectively. These results suggest that in developing policy, strict procurement requirements on social performance should be set for both fossil fuel and biofuel. However, the results must be interpreted with care owing to some limitations in the assessment, such as simplifications to life cycles, method used and data collection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that oil trade has formed a global competition pattern and that the role played by the Asian-Pacific region in the evolution of this competition pattern is becoming increasingly prominent. In addition, global competition intensity has continued to rise, and non-OECD countries have become the main driving force for this increase in global competition intensity. The large oil importers are the most significant parts of the global oil-trading competition pattern. They are not only the major participants in the competition for oil resources but also play important roles in the transmission of oil-trading competition. China and the United States especially display the feature of globalization, whose impacts of transmission reach across the whole oil-trading competition network. Finally, a 5C (changeability, contestability, cooperation, commitment and circumstances) policy framework is put forward to maintain the stability of oil trade and improve the energy security of oil importers in various aspects.

Given the limited research on effective energy conservation in China's industrial sectors, this paper analyzes the total factor energy efficiency and the corresponding energy conservation potential of China's iron and steel industry using the excessive energy-input stochastic frontier model. The results show that there was an increasing trend in energy efficiency between 2005 and 2011 with an average energy efficiency of 0.699 and a cumulative energy conservation potential of 723.44 million tons of coal equivalent (Mtce). We further analyze the regional differences in energy efficiency and find that energy efficiency of Northeastern China is high while that of Central and Western China is low. Therefore, there is a concentration of energy conservation potential for the iron and steel industry in the Central and Western areas. In addition, we discover that inefficient factors are important for improving energy conservation.

Empirical evidence from the Spanish electricity market,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy policy; Electricity market; Renewable energy; Feed-in tariffs; Merit order effect,PRICES; POWER,"Renewable energy promotion and its cost are at the heart of the energy policy debate in many countries. The question from an economic perspective is how expensive the promotion of renewable sources through price-based incentive schemes is. This paper addresses this issue empirically. We analyze the Spanish electricity market during the period 2008-2012, where renewable energy production rose by 57%. To determine how expensive it was, we first measure the savings due to the spot price reduction driven by the merit order effect and, second, we compute the amount paid as incentives to green energy by the electricity system; the difference between the two is the net cost of green energy to the electricity markets. We present aggregate results for renewable sources as a whole, as well as individual results for each technology. We show that at the initial stages, when renewable capacity was low, green energy promotion paid for itself (2008-2009); however, from 2010 on, when renewable production reached a relatively high level, it started to impose a positive net cost on the system. Finally, we found substantial differences among technologies: wind energy implied the lowest net cost, while solar photovoltaic was the most expensive. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the current level of LNG supply reliability in Korea is much lower than that in other industrialized countries. In order to improve the reliability of the LNG supply, diverse policy measures are required, which come at an additional cost paid by society. This study aims to investigate the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for improving the reliability of the LNG supply by increasing the LNG storage rate from the current level (11%) to 20%. To this end, the contingent valuation (CV) method is applied by using national survey data of 1000 households. In particular, this study employs a one-and-one-half-bound (OOHB) dichotomous choice model, combined with a spike model, to address the responses from the CV survey with zero WTP. The annual mean WTP is estimated to be KRW 9641 (USD 8.68) per household. Expanding the value to the national population provides a value of KRW 169.43 billion (USD 152.55 million). The results indicate that people are willing to shoulder the burden of safeguarding a reliable supply of LNG. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the survey explores which specific components of the CSP production chain could be manufactured in Morocco today and which would require moderate or significant changes being made in that country over the next decade. This paper contributes to demonstrating the potential for a CSP manufacturing industry in Morocco at the present time, ideal business models and current restrictions. Second, on the one hand this survey provides insight into the entrepreneurial, policy- and market-related barriers hampering the development of this industry and, on the other, the relative advantages offered by Morocco for the development of a CSP sector. Complementing the empirical findings on foreign direct investment determinants, this exercise stresses the key relevance of the economic context not only in terms of size, stability and predictability of the market, but also in regard to the critical importance of institutional and policy-related issues such as stability and public policy commitment. The results show that prior experience of firms in developing areas is a crucial issue in the accurate assessment of the risks and benefits associated with FDI decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To isolate the exogenous variation in culture measure, historical Protestant dissemination is employed as instruments. The estimation results suggest that Christian commercial culture has a significantly positive impact on economic performance - per capitaGDP after other important influences (i.e., capital, population, human resources, institutional quality, trade, infrastructure, geography, etc.) are controlled for.

In order to compare the results, we develop time series and ANN static models. We then use the output of time series model to develop a NARX model. The NARX model is trained with historical data from 1974 to 2004 and the results are verified with data from 2005 to 2009.

At the same time, energy efficiency is an increasing share of the electricity resource mix in many regions, and has become a centerpiece of many utility resource plans and state policies as a means of meeting electricity demand, complementing supply-side sources, and reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the electric power system. The paper describes an innovative project in the western United States to explicitly incorporate end-use efficiency into load forecasts - projections of electricity consumption and demand - that are a critical input into transmission planning and transmission planning studies. Institutional and regulatory background and context are reviewed, along with a detailed discussion of data sources and analytical procedures used to integrate efficiency into load forecasts. The analysis is intended as a practical example to illustrate the kinds of technical and institutional issues that must be addressed in order to incorporate energy efficiency into regional transmission planning activities.

In 2008, 24% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 20% of the employment around the world were linked to international trade. China exported 30% of emissions and hosted 37.5% of the jobs generated by trade worldwide. The European Union and the United States of America were the destination of 25% and 18.4% of the GHG emissions embodied in trade. The imports of these two regions contributed to the creation of 45% of the employment generated by international trade. This paper proposes the idea of including trade issues in international climate negotiations, taking into account not only the environmental burden generated by developed countries when displacing emissions to developing countries through their imports, but also the economic benefits of developing countries producing the goods exported to developed countries.

The need to reduce the energy spent in commuting has attracted the attention of academics and policy makers. The main goal. of this research is to improve knowledge of the economic, social, energy and environmental opportunity costs of inter-municipality commuting and to support policy-oriented strategies that explicitly take them into account. For this, we use hypothetical assumptions based on the baseline scenario that Portuguese households do not travel between municipalities for commuting purposes coupled with the expected changes in private final consumption. Accordingly, the direct, indirect and induced opportunity costs of inter-municipality commuting are assessed using an input-output model. The significance of the estimated virtual net benefits of commuting is analyzed according to their macroeconomic (GVA, taxes, international imports and employment), energy (primary energy consumption) and environmental (CO2 emissions) dimensions. The results obtained empirically indicate that inter-municipality commuting has significant opportunity costs in the GVA and GDP as well as in primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The results also indicate that commuters in metropolitan regions and long-distance commuters are responsible for a major share of these opportunity costs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper focuses on all mergers and acquisitions (M&As) transactions of regional relevance that occurred in the Italian banking sector between 1995 and 2006. A strong direct effect of regional economic and social characteristics on the concentration of the banking industry in Italy is found, as well as on the agglomeration of acquiring banks in well-developed regions. This effect survives to a number of robustness checks, including controls for banks' profitability and efficiency, and for their institutional characteristics, indicated by the banking literature as the key factors driving concentration in banking. Possible theoretical explanations supporting the empirical findings are also investigated, and their policy implications are discussed.","[Colombo, Luca V.

Network management is viewed as a way of dealing with uncertainty in complex policy networks, but little is known about the types of network management strategies employed by regional actors to manage vertical and horizontal relations. Two central questions guide this paper. What network management strategies were employed to manage complexity and uncertainty in regional governance networks in England? How can past lessons be harnessed to inform future network strategies for managing territorial networks? The paper concludes that regional network management strategies were effective in securing process' outcomes, but that content' outcomes, in the form of genuine discretion over policy, were unattainable without the authorization of central government.","[Ayres, Sarah] Univ Bristol, Sch Policy Studies, Bristol BS8 1TZ, Avon, England; [Stafford, Ian] Cardiff Univ, Wales Inst Econ & Social Res Data & Methods, Cardiff CF10 3BB, S Glam, Wales",University of Bristol; Cardiff University,"Ayres, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Policy Studies, 8 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TZ, Avon, England.",Sarah.ayres@bristol.ac.uk; staffordim@cf.ac.uk,"Stafford, Ian/AAR-4187-2021; Ayres, Sarah/AAD-5908-2022","Ayres, Sarah/0000-0002-5791-6955; Stafford, Ian/0000-0003-0668-643X","ESRC [ES/E000312/1, ES/F034180/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E000312/1, ES/F034180/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,84,17,19,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper analyses the role that university quality holds, among other socio-economic factors, in the sequential migration behaviour of Italian students and graduates. Regardless of the recognition of universities as key drivers of economic development, empirical evidence on the effects of their quality on the attraction and retention of students and graduates is still limited, and mainly related to Anglo-Saxon countries. This study aims at partly filling this knowledge gap. Its results indicate that both university research and teaching quality influence migration choices and, consequently, affirm that universities are 'supply' tools for policy-makers, in order to counterbalance the negative effects of brain drain on regional human capital accumulation.","Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, E-41092 Seville, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Ciriaci, D (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, C Inca Garcilaso S-N, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",daria.ciriaci@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,64,86,91,4,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper develops a model of urban land markets where both the formal and informal sectors are endogenously and mutually determined. More specifically, the informal market arises as a kind of residual effect of decisions made in the formal sector. The model posits a fixed number of rich and of poor households, all of whom are competing in the marketplace for a place to live. Rich households enact formal land use regulations in the form of minimum lot size requirements that directly reflect their preferences. The impacts of these regulations on the informal sector depend upon relative incomes and populations of poor and rich households, as well as on housing preferences. In order to assess these impacts empirically, the paper formulates a set of stylized case studies. The model results illustrate that the formal and informal sectors do not exist independently from one another, but are instead dual aspects of a single market phenomenon. In particular, an insufficient absorptive capacity of the formal sector results directly in informality.","[Heikkila, Eric J.; Lin, Michael C.

In such case, the weighted p-median problem with min-sum criterion is solved. In many cases such criterion leads to the situation, when the total social costs are minimal, but the disutility of the worst situated user is extremely high. This contribution deals with such public service system design, where the disutility of the worst situated users is minimized first and then disutility of better located users is optimized under the condition that the disutility of the worst situated users does not worsen.

First, we propose a regularized version of the hierarchical cluster analysis for categorical data with a large number of categories. It exploits a regularized version of various test statistics of homogeneity in contingency tables as the measure of distance between two clusters. Further, our aim is cluster analysis of continuous data with a large number of variables. Various regularization techniques tailor-made for high-dimensional data have been proposed, which have however turned out to suffer from a high sensitivity to the presence of outlying measurements in the data. As a robust solution, we recommend to combine two newly proposed methods, namely a regularized version of robust principal component analysis and a regularized Mahalanobis distance, which is based on an asymptotically optimal regularization of the covariance matrix. We bring arguments in favor of the newly proposed methods.","[Kalina, Jan; Vlckova, Katarina] Inst Comp Sci AS CR, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Inst Comp Sci AS CR, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic.",kalina@cs.cas.cz; vlckova@cs.cas.cz,"Kalina, Jan/E-4287-2012","Kalina, Jan/0000-0002-8491-0364",,,,,19,3,3,0,3,PALACKY UNIV OLOMOUC,OLOMOUC,"KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,378,383,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900066,0

The decision maker says which employee of the evaluated pair is better according to the given criterion. This employee gets the point. Final ranking is then determined by the sum of points of each employee. The scale method is the second most applied method in employee evaluation in practice. To assess the degree of fulfilment of the criteria considered the scales are used. Simple sum of points for each employee is the result of the scale method. Both mentioned methods are rather simple to use but there is one significant disadvantage - the different importance of the criteria are not usually taken into account. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a method applicable in various situations. When compared to the above mentioned simple methods AHP is more complex to calculate the results.

While limit orders can only guarantee the price, but not execution, market orders can always secure the execution at the best available price. In the model, we allow the fundamental value of a stock evolve as a jump process as a result of occasional news arrivals. We assume the fundamentalists may know the underlying value of the stock while the noisy traders base their decision on some noisy signal and the chartists make their decision according to the trend.

Estimating the impacts of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative,RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity market; Simulation modeling; Cost-benefit analysis; Long term; Carbon dioxide,TRANSMISSION RIGHTS; NETWORKS; POWER,"The consequences of environmental and energy policies in the U.S. can be severely constrained by physical limits of the electric power grid. Flows do not follow the shortest path but are distributed over all lines in accordance with the laws of physics, so grid operators must select which generation units to operate at each moment, not only to minimize production costs, but also to prevent the system from collapsing because of line overloads. Because of the complexity of power grid operation, computing limitations have until very recently made it impossible to solve a policy analysis or planning model that combines realistic modeling of flows with a detailed transmission system model and the prediction of generator investment and retirement. We construct and solve a model of the eastern US and Canada that combines these characteristics. Then, because a smaller model would be usable for some additional purposes, we explore the effects of transmission model simplification on the accuracy of simulation results. To evaluate the amount of detail necessary, we simulate the short- and long-term effects of imposing a price on the carbon dioxide emissions from the power plants in nine northeastern US states, as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative does. We consider three grid models that simplify the actual 62,000-node system to varying degrees. Our 5000-node model matches the 62,000-node model very closely. We use it as the basis for evaluating the more simplified models: a 300-node model and a model with just one node, i.e. no transmission constraints. With each of the three models, we predict the carbon dioxide emission impacts, electricity price impacts, and generator entry and exit impacts of the emission price, over the next 20 years. We find that most of the impact predictions produced by the 300- and one-node models differ from those of the 5000-node model by more than 20%, and some by much more. Fortunately, the 5000-node model, and others with its combination of transmission detail, realistic flows, entry prediction, and retirement prediction can be used for many useful purposes.

The unsustainable use of biomass is accompanied by several negative health and environmental impacts. As a clean energy source, solar cooking presents one alternative solution. In spite of its multiple benefits; however, solar cookers have experienced little success. Curiously, there has been little discussion about this in academic circles. Most research concerns technical improvements of solar cookers, rather than on the reasons why these cookers are not actually adopted in the field. This paper fills the gap by developing a comprehensive list of variables that influence the adoption of solar cooking: (1) economic, (2) social, (3) cultural, (4) environmental, (5) political and (6) technical. Furthermore, we can see that some solar cooking promoters are able to control for some of the variables (e.g., environmental factors), but not others (e.g. technical, social and cultural factors). The latter can only be captured through a needs assessment of the target group. This sort of assessment is a demanding but necessary step for the successful outcome of a solar cooking project.

To evaluate the extent of market losses, we calculate the shadow market price of solar electricity. From the profit and loss accounts of the PV plants and the shadow market price we estimate the total economic loss generated by PV electricity sector in the Czech Republic. The presented microeconomic approach has two main advantages: firstly, we work with real observed data, which offsets the drawback of a limited sample. Secondly, the profit accounting calculation enables sensitivity analysis with respect to key variables of the plants. We show that money invested in PV plants would generate an annual loss of 8%. Given the estimated solar assets of CZK 165.6 billion (EUR 6.6 billion) as of December 2011, this translates in at least CZK 12.6 billion lost in the Czech solar sector in 2012. About 43% of this loss is due to high technology costs and corresponds to pure dead weight loss, while the remaining 57% constitute the redistributive profit component of subsidies. Finally, we calculate that unless electricity prices increase or technology costs decrease approximately sevenfold, PV plants will remain loss making. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using one of the proposed models, three case studies on the evolution of the U.S. energy and transportation infrastructures are performed, where portfolios of optimum investments over a 40-year horizon are identified, and interdependencies between the two sectors are highlighted. The results indicate that with a gradual but aggressive introduction of PEVs coupled with investments in renewable energy, the total cost from the energy and transportation systems can be reduced by 5%, and that overall emissions from electricity generation and light-duty vehicle (LDV) tailpipes can be reduced by 10% over the 40-year horizon. The annual gasoline consumption from LDVs can be reduced by 66% by the end of the planning horizon, but an additional 800 TWh of annual electricity demand will be introduced. In addition, various scenarios of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions are investigated. It is found that GHG emissions can be significantly reduced with only a marginal cost increment, by shifting electricity generation from coal to renewable sources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we present a top-down approach to estimate the current and global historic cumulated PV R&D investments based on international PV patent applications. High growth rates of PV-related patents and R&D headcount accompany growth and development of the PV market and are an excellent indicator to analyze R&D investments. With this approach, current annual corporate PV R&D investments are found to be about 6000 m and show a rapidly increasing trend on a global scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We employ quantitative analysis to assess the impact of the required capital expenditures under a set of alternative financing strategies. We consider a best-case scenario Of full cooperation between the European TSOs. It appears that under current trends in the evolution of transmission tariffs, only half the volumes of investment currently planned could be funded. A highly significant increase in transmission tariffs will be required to ensure the whole-scale investments can be delivered. Finally, alternative strategies can dampen the impact on tariffs but they can only partially substitute for this increase in charges paid by network users. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Renewables differ in their environmental and societal impacts, and to design sound renewable energy policy, societies need to assess the trade-offs between alternative sources. To enable the evaluation and comparison of renewable energy production alternatives in Finland, this paper applies the choice experiment to elicit the monetary information on people's preferences for four renewable energy sources: wind power, hydro power and energy from crops and wood, and considers four impacts of energy production: effects on biodiversity, local jobs, carbon emissions and household's electricity bill. The nested logit analysis reveals that higher income, male gender, young age, and pro-environmental attitude increase the probability to choose renewable energy instead of the current energy mix. Wind power is, on average, the most popular renewable energy technology, but regional differences exist. Biodiversity deterioration should be avoided. The national aggregate willingness to pay, based on stated preferences rather than preferences revealed by actual market behavior, for a combination of renewable energy technologies that corresponds to Finland's climate change and energy policy is over 500 million Euros.

(2001) with recomputed critical bounds from Narayan (2005) and the Solow (1956) framework extended by Rao (2010). We also conduct the (Toda and Yamamoto (1995) test for Granger non-causality. The regression results show that short-run and long-run energy elasticities are 0.50 and 1.71, respectively for Kenya and 0.17 and 0.34, respectively for South Africa. The causality results indicate a unidirectional Granger causality running from capital per worker and energy per capita to output per worker for both countries. Moreover, in Kenya, we detect a strong unidirectional causality: (a) on output from joint consideration of capital stock and energy; and (b) on capital stock from joint consideration of energy and output. In South Africa, the joint causations are neutral. Hence, while energy and capital stock spurs growth in both countries, Kenya has a greater potential to harness growth and capital productivity via joint consideration of energy with capital and output, respectively.

These concerns have resulted in calls for reductions in CO2 emissions over time. If these calls are to be heeded, an appropriate emissions accounting method must first be agreed upon by CO2 emitting countries, none of which are more important than China. This paper estimates China's CO2 emissions in 2002 and in 2007 using firstly a production-based, and then a consumption-based, accounting method, both in aggregate and at the sectoral industry level. Our objectives are first to investigate the recent trends in Chinese emissions of CO2, and second to reveal the extent of the differences in the estimates produced by these two methods. Our estimates confirm what others have found, namely that Chinese emissions of CO2 increased. substantially over this relatively short time period. Furthermore, the consumption-based method results in China being responsible for 38% fewer emissions in 2007 than would be the case with the production-based method. Problems caused by global warming will only be ameliorated if an acceptable worldwide distribution of responsibilities for emissions reduction efforts can be found. We believe that the consumption based method is more appropriate because it allocates responsibilities according to final consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Research networks and inventors' mobility as drivers of innovation: evidence from Europe, Regional Studies. This paper investigates the importance of the labour mobility of inventors, as well as the scale, extent and density of their collaborative research networks, for regional innovation outcomes. To do so, a knowledge production function framework at the regional level is used. The empirical approach presented takes full account of spatial interactions by estimating a spatial lag model, together, where necessary, with a spatial error model. In addition, standard errors are calculated using spatial heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (SHAC) techniques. The results suggest the existence of a robust positive correlation between intra-regional labour mobility and regional innovation, whilst the relationship with networks is less clear.","[Miguelez, Ernest; Moreno, Rosina] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Spanish Econ, AQR IREA, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Miguélez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Spanish Econ, AQR IREA, Av Diagonal 690, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain.",emiguelez@ub.edu; rmoreno@ub.edu,"Miguelez, Ernest/A-1254-2017; Moreno, Rosina/D-4723-2014","Miguelez, Ernest/0000-0002-8224-6842; Moreno, Rosina/0000-0002-3500-8622",,,,,75,51,56,5,73,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Our analysis consists of a structural break test and market integration analysis. The Bai and Perron structural break test detected a break point of natural gas prices and consumption in 2005 as well as other external shocks Hurricane Katrina and the Lehman Shock - that are irrelevant to shale gas development. We eliminated the impact of these shocks by separating the data set using the breaks identified in our analysis. We found the breaks skewed the estimation; a market linkage existed between the US and Japanese markets in the original data set, while it did not in the separated data. The vector autoregressive (VAR) model also indicated a significant change before and after the break point; the US market had a one-side influence on the Japanese market before 2005, but the influence disappeared after 2005. Our results implied that the shale gas revolution, triggered by the increase in shale gas production in 2005, caused the change in the relationship between the US and Japanese natural gas markets.

In the case of New South Wales (NSW), the state government has had to deal with a complex policy problem. In order to play its role in the federal Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme, the NSW government initiated the 7 year Solar Bonus Scheme in 2010. However, in attempting to maximise community investment in small-scale solar PV systems, it relied on faulty financial modelling that applied a generous Feed-in Tariff (FiT) and underestimated the level of investor participation and installed capacity. Consequently, the scheme has resulted in very high public costs that will require policy changes that bring investors and energy retailers into conflict, and unpopular electricity retail price adjustments. This paper uses a structured case and stakeholder analysis to critically analyse the FiT policy, while also highlighting important lessons for policymakers engaging in FiT design.

In this paper, the background and the influence scale of the two power shortages are described. Second, reasons for these two large-scale power shortages are analyzed from the perspectives of power generation, power consumption and coordination of power sources and grid network construction investments. Characteristics of these two large-scale power shortages are then summarized by comparatively analyzing the performance and the formation of the reasons behind these two large-scale power shortages. Finally, some effective measures that take into account the current status of electricity market reforms in China are suggested. This paper concludes that to eliminate power shortages in China, both the supply and the demand should be considered, and these considerations should be accompanied by supervisory policies and incentive mechanisms.

Liaoning province was selected due to its typical features as one industrial province. The environmental input-output analysis and structure decomposing analysis have been conducted in order to provide a holistic picture on Liaoning's CO2 emissions during 1997-2007. Research outcomes indicate that rapid increase of per capita consumption activities is the main driver for Liaoning to have a significant CO2 emission growth, followed by consumption structure, production structure and population size. Energy intensity and energy structure partly offset the CO2 emission increase. Electricity power and heat supply and construction sectors caused the most CO2 emission, indicating that more specific mitigation policies for these two sectors should be prepared. From final demand point of view, it is clear that trade plays a leading role in regional CO2 emission, followed by fixed capital investment and urban household consumption which become increasingly important over time. Consequently, in order to realize low carbon development, local governments should consider all these factors so that appropriate mitigation policies can be raised by considering the local realities.

The basic principle of the structure is to assign a higher price for higher income consumers with low price elasticity of power demand. To capture the non-linear effects of price and income on elasticities, we set up a translog demand model. The empirical findings indicate that the higher income consumers are less sensitive than those with lower income to price changes. We further put forward three proposals of Chinese residential electricity tariffs. Compared to a flat tariff, the reasonable block tariff structure generates more efficient allocation of cross-subsidies, better incentives for raising the efficiency of electricity usage and reducing emissions from power generation, which also supports the living standards of low income households.

As far as we know, this is the first empirical study to estimate the conditional multiple-years model put forward by Stock and Wise (1990). This implies that we account for dynamic self-selection bias. We also present an extended version of this model in which the marginal value of leisure is random. For the female sample, the model is able to predict almost perfectly the age-specific hazard rates. For the male sample, we obtain a good fit. Dynamic self-selection results in a downward bias in the estimate of the marginal utility of leisure. We perform a simulation study to gauge the effects of a dramatic pension reform. Underestimation of the value of leisure translates into sizeable over-prediction of the impact of reform. Due to lack of data, results for males should be interpreted with caution since we are not able to fully correct for dynamic self-selection bias.","[Belloni, Michele] CeRP Coll Carlo Alberto & Netspar, I-10024 Moncalieri, TO, Italy; [Alessie, Rob] Univ Groningen, Netspar & Tinbergen Inst, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Belloni, M (通讯作者)，CeRP Coll Carlo Alberto & Netspar, Via Real Coll 30, I-10024 Moncalieri, TO, Italy.",belloni@cerp.unito.it; r.j.m.alessie@rug.nl,"Belloni, Michele/AAT-9072-2021","Alessie, Rob/0000-0002-5128-6753","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR)","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The authors are grateful to an anonymous referee, Victoria Prowse, Hugo Benitez-Silva, Axel Borsch-Supan, Christopher Flinn, Elsa Fornero, Eric French, Mike Hurd, Adriaan Kalwij, Consuelo Nava, Steffen Reinhold, John Rust, Daniel van Vuuren for their useful comments.

Who are the potential minority and majority migrants? This paper studies emigration intentions of the Russian speaking minority in Latvia after the 2004 EU enlargement. Using a survey on emigration intentions conducted in 2005, I show that the minority is more likely to emigrate than the majority. For the Russian speakers, higher education levels tend to be associated with higher probability of emigration, suggesting a minority brain drain.

One of the most common techniques for technology monitoring is patent analysis, which enables the identification of technological trends over time. However, few previous studies have carried out patent analysis in the energy sector. This study aims to explore patterns of innovation and of evolution in energy technologies, particularly focusing on similarities and differences across technologies. For this purpose, we first defined the relevant energy technologies and extracted the associated patent data from the United States Patents and Trademark Office (USPTO) and then adopted six patent indices and developed six patent maps to analyze their innovation characteristics. We then clustered energy technologies with similar characteristics, so defining innovation categories, and analyzed the changes in these characteristics over time to define their evolution categories. As one of the few attempts to investigate the overall trends in the energy sectors innovation and evolution, this study is expected to help develop an in-depth understanding of the energy industry, which will be useful in establishing technology strategies and policy in this rapidly changing sector.

The world is in the process of constructing policy frameworks to underwrite carbon emission reduction targets, best exemplified by the Kyoto Protocol. This requires complex technical and economical concepts to be presented in an understandable, transparent, and justifiable format. A building's energy efficiency was traditionally determined based on its annual consumption relative to some average performance level. Emissions are calculated as a derivative of consumptions and their aggregated values allow verification of the level of fulfillment of the objectives. Here we take a different approach: considering that the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) objectives must be achieved; hence, we fix the efficiency standard based on emissions objectives, and then derive the corresponding reference values of consumption. Accordingly, we propose a certification scheme for energy efficiency in buildings based on targets of GHG emissions levels. This proposed framework includes both a label, namely the Ecolabel, and a fiche showing a set of indices and complementary information. The Ecolabel is designed to provide a flexible, evolvable, simple to use at the point of application, and transparent framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, public and, mainly, local, opposition to those infrastructures may slow down or even halt that process. Thus, in the last few years a body of research has developed specifically to understand the social acceptance of technologies such as wind turbines or bioenergy plants. We argue that the use of 'acceptance' in this literature should be further discussed. We contend that using the word 'acceptance' may present some constraints for the theoretical advancement of this area of research and to the implications that may be taken from it to the wider society. This is further highlighted through the presentation of findings from surveys conducted with nationally representative samples from the UK and Norway which examined their acceptance of and support for new high voltage power lines. We conclude by suggesting that the literature on public responses towards low carbon energy and associated infrastructures should be more critical in the conceptualisation of its research agenda, become empirically more consistent and transparent, and examine other types of relations between people and energy infrastructures besides acceptance or opposition.

Besides carbon emissions from the end-use sector activities (called Scope 1+2 by WRI/MBCSD) in normal research, carbon emissions from the cross-boundary traffic and the embodied energy of key urban imported materials (namely Scope 3) were also included. The results are as follow: (1) Carbon emissions within Scope 1+2 only take up 66.14% of total carbon footprint, while emissions within Scope 3 which have usually been ignored account for 33.84%. (2) Industry is the most carbon-intensive end use sector which contributes 32.74% of the total carbon footprint and 55.13% of energy use emissions in Scope 1+2. (3) The per capita carbon footprint of Xiamen is just about one-third of that in Denver. (4) Comparing with Denver, the proportion of embodied emissions in Xiamen was 10.60% higher than Denver. Overall, Xiamen is relatively a low-carbon city with characters of industrial carbon-intensive and high embodied emissions. Further analysis indicates that the urbanization and industrialization in Xiamen might cause more material consumption and industrial emissions. These highlight the importance of management for Scope 3 emissions in the developing cities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The extent of welfare improving mergers varies inversely with the timing advantage of an excluded rival. When the rival locates alone in the first stage, the merger harms welfare. When the rival locates alone in the last stage, the merger improves welfare. These results hold true when allocating three firms across either two or three location stages.

The empirical results suggested the existence of a negative bi-directional Graoger causality running from aggregated energy consumption to real GDP. At disaggregated level of energy consumption, the results were complicated. For coal, empirical findings suggested that there was a negative hi-directional Granger causality running from coal consumption to real GDP. However, for oil and gas, empirical findings suggested a positive bidirectional Granger causality running from oil as well as gas consumption to real GDP. Though these results supported the feedback hypothesis, the negative relationship might be attributed to the growing economy production shifting towards less energy intensive sectors and excessive energy consumption in relatively unproductive sectors. The results indicated that policies with reducing aggregated energy consumption and promoting energy conservation may boost China's economic growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Though absolute numbers of installed capacity are still low, this is a promising sign. In this article we aim to contribute to the understanding of these developments by using insights from both business model and transition studies literature (i.e. Strategic Niche Management). By performing a literature study and a series of interviews we found three main types of business models: Customer-Owned, Community Shares and Third Party. Financial viability of these was found to be heavily dependent on net metering regulations which are surrounded by uncertainty and struggle about its meaning and application. Also, the overall PV niche is maturing. We found several local and national organizations lobbying for expansion of the space for PV business model experiments and enabling knowledge sharing and networking between initiatives. Furthermore, a number of regime players is getting involved in the PV niche. Considering the current economic turndown and related subsidy cuts in many other countries we believe the Netherlands, with its relatively poor and unstable support system, could serve as an example.

Attempts to alleviate poverty through oil palm plantation development resulted in internationally condemned destruction of peat lands. Sarawak subsequently turned to the inedible, low-input, exportable, biodiesel feedstock Jatropha. This case study argues that Jatropha is unlikely to make more significant socio-economic contributions than oil palm or other cash crops. The analysis suggests that companies use social capital to aggressively expand their Jatropha business among the native population in order to gain access to native customary lands, which are often underproductive peat lands. Global biofuels sector development dynamics are examined through the lenses of political economics and social, agricultural, and energy studies. The research finds that farmers' decisions to participate in the biofuels global value chain may result in negative income effects, household food security reduction, and biodiversity loss from peat land destruction. The paper concludes with a proposal for an alternative approach to evaluate both social and financial drivers in order to prevent the negative effects of biofuel-based agribusiness on human and environmental systems.

The analysis is based on an extensive literature survey and 25 in-depth personal interviews with experts on the East African solar power market. Kenya's solar market is found to be one of the world's leading markets for off-grid solar uses, with a current installed capacity of over 10 MWp and more than 320,000 solar home systems. Having developed much later than the Kenyan market, Tanzania's market still remains smaller than its neighbour's, with an installed capacity of around 4 MWp and at least 40,000 solar home systems, but is in the process of catching up. In addition to solar home systems, other applications of solar energy technologies, such as in social institutions, telecoms and tourism, are covered. Major differences and similarities between the Kenyan and Tanzanian solar markets are identified and reasons for these are analysed. Initial policy implications regarding the regulation and promotion of solar energy in East Africa suggest that awareness, availability and affordability are major drivers that all need to be present to enable the widespread adoption of off-grid solar technologies in emerging markets.

This paper presents a policy discussion and policy recommendations on a number of topics related to the regulation and incentives for fuel electricity within the LCFS. In the near-term, the LCFS will have a limited role in incentivizing the use of electricity and lowering the carbon intensity of electricity, and electricity will play a small role in meeting LCFS targets. Calculating a carbon intensity value for electricity is a complex process, requiring many decisions and trade-offs to be made, including allocation methods, system boundaries, temporal resolution and how to treat electricity demand for vehicle charging. These choices along with other regulatory decisions about who can obtain LCFS credits will influence the incentives for providing electricity and charging infrastructure relative to other low-carbon fuels as well as across different electricity providers. The paper discusses how fuel electricity would fit into an LCFS, identifying those special characteristics that could reduce the effectiveness of the policy. It also provides specific recommendations to enable better policy design that appropriately incentivizes the use of low-carbon fuels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a complementary emergy accounting (EMA) and carbon footprint accounting (CFA) method to investigate the environmental pressure generated by household consumption in Xiamen, China. We distinguish between the resource extraction, consumption and disposal stages within an urban spatial conceptual framework, comprising the Urban Footprint Region (UFR) and Urban Sprawl Region (USR), and analyze five environmental footprint categories associated with cross-boundary household emergy and carbon flows. Cross-boundary activities, which link the USR with its UFR, contributed nearly 90% of total emergy and 70% of total GHG emissions in CFA. Transport fuel, building materials and food contribute most to environmental pressure in both EMA and CFA, The results indicate a significant cross-boundary resource burden and environmental footprint associated with household activities. The employed framework, method, and scope challenge the conventional spatial boundary of the urban system, and the results have important policy implications for urban sustainability and cross-boundary environmental management.

How weak governance and corruption influence revenue management and expenditure decisions, as well as the possible welfare benefits derived from oil, are broadly discussed. How they impact upon volumes of oil produced has, however, attracted little attention. This paper combines a review of the resource curse and oil production literatures with findings from qualitative interviews with oil sector experts to appreciate the feasibility of connections between corruption and oil production below its potential. We make particular reference to environments where regulatory institutions or political accountability are weak and focus primarily on producer government and oil firm relations. Drawing on insights from geology, political science and economics, we suggest suboptimal production solutions can impact volumes of oil actually produced and create constraints on long term revenues for oil producing countries. We argue greater disclosure of information on oil production efficiency on a field-by-field and country-by-country basis will assist further investigation of the relationships between corruption and volumes of oil produced.

If the fuel tax is the main instrument to control for externalities and generate revenues, the diesel excise should be much higher than the excise on gasoline for two reasons: diesel is more polluting than gasoline and more importantly, through the better fuel efficiency, diesel cars contribute less fiscal revenues per mile.

The European Union has set ambitious GHG targets for the year 2050 (80-95% below 1990 levels), with each Member State developing strategies to contribute to these targets. This paper focuses on mitigation targets for one Member State, Ireland, an interesting case study due to the growth in GHG emissions (24% increase between 1990 and 2005) and the high share of emissions from agriculture (30% of total GHG emissions). We use the Irish TIMES energy systems modelling tool to build a number of scenarios delivering an 80% emissions reduction target by 2050, including accounting for the limited options for agriculture GHG abatement by increasing the emissions reduction target for the energy system. We then compare the scenario results in terms of changes in energy technology, the role of energy efficiency and renewable energy. We also quantify the economic impacts of the mitigation scenarios in terms of marginal CO2 abatement costs and energy system costs. The paper also sheds light on the impacts of short term targets and policies on long term mitigation pathways. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Results are derived using a stochastic agent-based simulation model of agents' decision-making and interactions. Trading rules, market structures, and agent information structures are selected to represent emerging water quality trading programs. The analysis is designed to provide a strong test of the efficiency of trading occurring through the two market structures. The Differential Evolution algorithm is used to search for market trade strategies that perform well under multiple states of the world. Our findings suggest that trading under both bilateral and clearinghouse markets yields cost savings relatively to no trading. The clearinghouse is found to be more efficient than bilateral negotiations in coordinating point-nonpoint trading under uncertainty and transaction costs. However, the market under both structures is unlikely to achieve or even approximate least-cost-pollution control allocations. Expectations of gains from water quality trading should, therefore, be tempered. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Nguyen, N. P.; Shortle, J.

The policies and measures modelled comprise meeting deployment targets for electric vehicles and compressed natural gas vehicles, an EU regulation for the improvement of vehicle efficiency, implementation of a national biofuel obligation, as well as several behavioural measures (encouraging modal shifting and reduced travel demand). The impact of the different measures simulated is measured in terms of their contribution to meeting Ireland's ambitious targets for energy savings, for renewable energy penetration and for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. The results point to a possible improvement of 32% in car stock efficiency, the achievement of 7.8% renewable energy share of road and rail transport and a 22% reduction in non-ETS private car CO2 emissions relative to 2009 levels. A scenario analysis on meeting the EV penetration target shows a significant range of CO2 emissions reductions depending on the cars (and mileage) displaced and on the electricity generation portfolio.

Based on the LMDI decomposition methodology, three influencing factors are analyzed: energy intensity, CO2 coefficient, and structure in terms of their contributions of each individual attributes to the overall percent change of them as it was proposed in Choi and Ang (2011). The energy intensity effect was the driving factor behind the main decreases of CO2 intensity, the CO2 coefficient effect contributed to less extent to mitigate it, and the structure effect tended to increased it. It is observed that CO2 intensity declined by 26.2% from 1965 to 2003, but it increased by 10.1% from 2004 to 2010. In addition, the move of Mexico from an economic model based on import-substitution to an export-oriented economy brought more importance to the Mexican industry intended to export, thus maintaining high levels of activity of industries such as cement, iron and steel, chemical, and petrochemical, while industries such as automotive, and 'other' industries grown significantly not only as far their energy consumptions and related CO2 emissions but they also increased their contributions to the national economy.

Nevertheless, this present paper argues that this assertion does not necessarily hold if the stringency of environmental regulation is subject to the influence of lobbying. A stricter enforcement policy increases the polluters' expected financial burden, and induces them to exert greater political pressure on reducing the stringency of environmental regulation. thereby resulting in a larger amount of pollution emissions. We also show that tightening the enforcement policy can reduce efficiency. We highlight the possibility of policymaking being misguided due to overlooking the political effect of enforcement policy.

This paper examines the economics that is behind these concerns by studying how a cap to the trade of carbon offsets influences innovation, technological change, and welfare. By using a standard game of abatement and R&D, we investigate the main mechanisms that shape these relationships. We also use a numerical integrated assessment model that features environmental and technology externalities to quantify how limits to the volume, the timing, and the regional allocation of carbon offsets affect climate policy costs and the incentive to invest in innovation and low-carbon technologies. Results indicate that, for moderate caps on the amount tradable emissions permits and sufficiently high technology spillovers, global innovation and technical change would increase and that this additional innovative effort could lead to economic efficiency gains. The numerical analysis confirms that when constraints are close to 15% of domestic abatement, efficiency losses are small because they are partly compensated by more technological spillovers and lower energy prices. Under a broad range of parameters, restrictions are costly for the constrained countries, but always beneficial for unconstrained ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As of today, FIT is being used by over 75 jurisdictions around the world and offers a number of design options to achieve policy goals. The objective of this paper is to propose a quantitative model, by which a specific FIT program can be evaluated and hence optimized. We focus on payoff structure, which has a direct impact on the net present value of the investment, and other parameters relevant to investor reaction and electricity prices. We combine cost modeling, option valuation, and consumer choice so as to simulate the performance of a FIT program of interest in various scenarios. The model is used to define an optimization problem from a policy maker's perspective, who wants to increase the contribution of renewable energy to the overall energy supply, while keeping the total burden on ratepayers under control.

The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has identified the potential amongst the farming industry to help meet this objective (DEFRA, 2007) but there is little published research on how organisations can successfully interact with farmers to achieve structural change. This paper reports the findings of a postal questionnaire survey of farmers in the West Midlands Region of the UK where principal component analysis revealed that personal, farm business, regulatory and behavioural drivers affected the rate of adoption of renewable energy (RE) enterprises. Of the 393 farmers who responded, 14% had adopted one or more enterprises associated with RE with solar energy production the most popular of the RE technologies available to farmers. The study found that the most influential personal level factors contributing to the adoption of RE and associated technologies were cognitive, such as level of education, but not administrative, such as the attractiveness of government schemes supporting RE and associated enterprises. Adopters also tended to be younger than non-adopters, perhaps reflecting the impact of long investment payback periods typically found with RE enterprises, they were involved with larger and more financially viable businesses that were more likely to trade as limited companies or family partnerships. Of current non adopters, 66% might decide to invest in RE technologies over the next five years. For these potential adopters, it emerged that personal, farm business and behavioural factors were the most significant drivers though contrary to expectation current non adopters assessed the policy support framework more favourably than current adopters. The explanation of this seems to be connected with timing, in that two very positive and encouraging signals in relation to Feed in Tariffs (2010) and the Renewable Heat Incentive (2011) were underway or near introduction before this research took place. The policy implications of these research findings are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The programme subsidised investments in new heating technologies, including heat pumps and pellet stoves. The success of the programme was measured by the degree of overall satisfaction with the investment by the sampled households. Theories on diffusion of innovations and planned behaviour motivate the empirical modelling of the investment satisfaction. The economic return on the investment varied substantially both within and between the two heating technologies, with heat pumps outperforming pellet stoves in this respect. Still, the economic return showed no explanatory power toward the investment satisfaction of the household. Among the economic variables, only the electricity price had any influence on investment satisfaction. Technical quality, indoor climate and heat comfort, and the availability of the supplier of the heating equipment were the most important explanatory variables. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It first reviews how solar renewable electricity certificates (SRECs) are intended to act as a support mechanism for the installation and financing of solar power in North Carolina's RPS compliance market. The paper then analyzes why SRECs have not precipitated growth in the solar industry thus far. Instead of attracting a diversity of solar installation and SREC trading businesses to create a competitive market to North Carolina, the RPS has only enabled a few large solar power producers to compete with utility companies to finance, install, and operate solar generating systems. A comparison between the SREC markets in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey reveals that transparency in prices and volumes of SRECs, limits on utility company self-ownership of solar generators, and more aggressive solar set-aside targets are required to create a competitive market environment that will attract a sustainable and growing solar industry.

Measures candidates to this tender are subjected to previously known assessment rules, and weighted criteria. Our proposal has explicitly taken avoided consumption and cost of saved kWh as decision variables for defining two societal objectives. In order to define ranges for the weights of the criteria and reference performance values, the search for the most suitable sets of weights is done by an evolutionary algorithm. Measures were used that applied for funding in previous tender calls. The results demonstrate that in face of different sets of measures, the range of weights for each criterion may vary significantly. The proposal, besides helping to obtain a more suitable set of criteria weights, can also assist in the very process of formulating the criteria, in view of the regulator's societal objectives, since it was found that some of the used criteria actually lack the ability to discriminate between candidate measures. After a post-processing analysis, the DM is presented with a set of criteria weights from which he can select the one that better reflects his preferences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and pure electric vehicles (EV) are being demonstrated in scores of large cities. We select three well-developed regions (jing-Jin-ji, Yangtze-River-Delta and Pearl-River-Delta) to explore regional growth patterns for the light-duty passenger vehicle fleet and develop various scenarios for the penetration of HEV, PHEV and EV during 2010-2030. Per-kilometre and fleet well-to-wheels (WTW) petroleum use, fossil energy and CO2 emissions are evaluated among various technology options. Promotion of PHEV and EV could help cut per-kilometre petroleum use to a great extent; however, to achieve a clear reduction benefit in oil demand for a fleet in three regions takes time. The effort to mitigate CO2 emissions is much more difficult than lowering fossil energy use or oil consumption. This is especially true for the jing-jin-ji Region where coal is an overwhelming power source. In those regions with a high share of coal power, HEV is a better option than PHEV or EV to reduce WTW CO2 emissions. In the Pearl-River-Delta region with a much cleaner electricity mix, promotion of EV could achieve a more significant CO2 reduction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, centralization policies that seek to introduce or reinforce territorial hierarchies have yet to be subject to empirical analysis. Drawing on data from Spain, we show that investment in network modes is influenced by strategies of directing funding to the regions immediately surrounding the political capital. These policies of centralization, which complement factors of efficiency-equity trade-off and the satisfaction of political partisan interests, have been facilitated in the case of roads and railways by budgetary funding models in which mobility demands have not been the main driver of investment allocation.","[Albalate, Daniel; Bel, Germa; Fageda, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Albalate, D (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Torre 6,Planta 3,Avd Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",albalate@ub.edu; gbel@ub.edu; xfageda@ub.edu,"Albalate, Daniel/N-8124-2019; Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008; Fageda, Xavier/F-6635-2018","Albalate, Daniel/0000-0002-4940-4589; Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085; Fageda, Xavier/0000-0001-8526-8169",,,,,23,35,35,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

First, we estimate a static specification of a spatial panel model, and then we check for the robustness of our results with a dynamic specification. The static analysis shows that municipalities engage in yardstick competition during pre-election years, regardless of whether they are subject to the DSP or not.

The objective is to critically examine the methodologies and associated parameters used in existing regulatory schemes for calculating GHG emissions, and to explore methodological convergences. The issues related to direct lifecycle and indirect land use change emissions have been addressed. It is found that there are commonalities between the European Renewable Energy Directive (EU-RED) and the UK's Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (UK-RTFO), but the US-EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard (US-EPA) and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard of the California Air Resources Board (CA-CARB) vary greatly not only among themselves, but also in relation to the European regulations. Agricultural practices (especially soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics), co-product credits from surplus electricity and uncertainties around economic modeling approaches for indirect land use change are the major areas where methodological divergences exist. Incorporation of domestic agricultural practices, sugarcane mills operations, and realistic modeling of indirect impacts of land use change using regional models could provide more coherence in estimations of GHG emissions. Furthermore, the Brazilian trend of novelty in all phases of sugarcane bioenergy systems should be considered when projecting GHG emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The novelty of the present work lies in the fact that it seeks to investigate this topic in a multi-country setting, exploiting data from nine OECD countries (Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Italy, South Korea, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden), and also in that it employs a latent variable model which allows us to examine the conditions necessary for the results to be comparable across different countries. Novel in this paper is also the focus on the role of environmental concern as a factor of several curtailments and efficiency investments. Our results suggest that people with higher environmental concern are on average more likely to perform energy-saving curtailments and also are more likely to have some energy-efficiency retrofits installed in dwellings. Most of the socio-economic and demographic variables have mixed effects on efficiency investments and curtailments. However, some interesting patterns emerged with respect to the age of respondents, household income, education and gender of respondents, and also the size of household. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The latter are captured by unobserved heterogeneity terms or random effects, one at the firm level and another at the worker level. This enables us to decompose the variation in job durations into the relative contribution of the worker and the firm. We also allow the unobserved terms to be correlated in a model that is primarily relevant for markets with small firms. For the empirical analysis, we use a Portuguese longitudinal matched employer-employee dataset. The model is estimated with a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation method. The results imply that unobserved firm characteristics explain almost 40% of the systematic variation in log job durations. In addition, we find a positive correlation between unobserved worker and firm characteristics.","[Horny, Guillaume] DGEI DEMS SAMIC, Bank France, F-75049 Paris 01, France; [Horny, Guillaume] Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Econ, Louvain, Belgium; [Mendes, Rute] ILO, Int Training Ctr, Turin, Italy; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] Inst Evaluat Labour Market & Educ Policy, Uppsala, Sweden; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] Inst Study Lab, Bonn, Germany",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Mannheim; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Horny, G (通讯作者)，DGEI DEMS SAMIC, Bank France, F-75049 Paris 01, France.",guillaume.horny@banque-france.fr; mendesrutept@gmail.com; givdberg@uni-mannheim.de,,"Horny, Guillaume/0000-0002-3506-208X",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology,Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank the Editor Kei Hirano, an anonymous Associate Editor, two anonymous Referees, Francois Laisney, Bo Honore, Jean-Pierre Florens, Denis Fougere, Bertrand Koebel, Franc, ois Langot, Bart Cockx, and participants in French Economic Association (AFSE), Society of Economic Dynamics (SED), Society European Meeting (ESEM), and Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) conferences, for detailed and helpful comments.

Under these rules, the EU steel sector has received free allocations in excess of their compliance needs to now, and will continue to receive some free allowances up to 2020. However, perceptions of the sector's competitive vulnerability have been largely based on inherently hypothetical analyses which rely heavily on counterfactual scenarios and abatement cost estimates often provided by firms themselves. This paper explores how the three largest steel firms in the EU (AcerlorMittal, Corus, and ThyssenKrupp) have sought to strategically exaggerate their vulnerability to carbon pricing to the effect of an inefficient policy outcome. We conduct a qualitative assessment of two of the key narratives underpinning the competitive vulnerability argument of EU steel companies - lack of abatement opportunities and inability to pass through cost increases - based on interviews, case studies, and publicly available data. We find that these arguments provide only partial and weak justifications for competitive loss and preferential treatment under the EU ETS. The strategy however remains successful due to information asymmetry and the peculiar political economy of EU climate regulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines the influence of urbanization on national transport and road energy use for low, middle and high income countries during 1975-2005, using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model. After controlling for population size, income per capita and the share of services in the economy, the main results suggest that urbanization influences national transport and road energy use positively. However, the magnitude of its influence varies among the three income groups. Changes in urbanization appear to have a greater impact on transport and road energy use in the high income group than in the other groups. Surprisingly, the urbanization elasticities of transport and road energy use in the middle income group are smaller than those of the low income group. This study not only sheds further light on the existing literature, but also provides policy makers with insightful information on the link between urbanization and transport energy use at the three different stages of development.

This paper develops a case study of the shale gas industry in British Columbia (BC), Canada to evaluate this assumption. We find that the transition fuel argument for gas development in BC is unsubstantiated by the best available evidence. Emissions factors for shale gas and LNG remain poorly characterized and contested in the academic literature, and context-specific factors have significant impacts on the lifecycle emissions of shale gas but have not been evaluated. Moreover, while the province has attempted to frame natural gas development within its ambitious climate change policy, this framing misrepresents substantive policy on gas production. The transition fuel and climate solution labels applied to development by the BC provincial government risk legitimizing carbon-intensive gas development. We argue that policy makers in BC and beyond should abandon the transition fuel characterization of natural gas. Instead, decision making about natural gas development should proceed through transparent engagement with the best available evidence to ensure that natural gas lives up to its best potential in supporting a transition to a low-carbon energy system.

However, almost 1.3 billion people in the world still lack access to electricity and 2.7 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities. In this backdrop, the issue of energy access is receiving more interest than ever before and this has brought to the fore, the need for a robust decision support tool for policy makers to measure the progress of energy access provision and also to provide direction for future policy making. The paper studies existing definitions of energy access and identifies the key requirements for an appropriate decision-making tool to measure and monitor energy access provision. In this context the paper assesses the strengths and weaknesses of the metrics currently being used to measure energy access in policy, as well as of contemporary monitoring and evaluation frameworks being used in other sectors. Based on these insights, a dashboard of indicators is proposed as an alternate decision support tool for policy makers to measure energy access. The paper concludes with a discussion on what is needed to operationalise this proposed framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The key is whether to focus on grants or public finance for sustainable development projects or move to a more diffused financing mechanism, involving investment grade financing sources like debt and equity. In other words, financing sustainable development action via grants is becoming a constraint. To address this constraint, it is important to consider the relationship between the nature and sources of financial flows. The concept of 'financial gradients' emerged while analysing the financial and business strategy developed for Lighting a Billion Lives (LaBL) campaign. This paper espouses the idea of 'financial gradients' which is a potential financial mechanism for sustainable development action. Financial gradients, can contribute in three different ways first, as an approach to analyse financial flows in projects; second, as a tool to generate a single, long term and stable inflow of finance; third, as a financial mechanism to help in creating long term strategies to sustain projects.

Employing a panel stationarity test which incorporates multiple level and slope shifts, we find clear-cut evidence of regime-wise trend stationarity after controlling for cross-correlation. Estimates of steady-state growth paths indicate that growth rates have slowed down for about one half of the states while increasing for the other half. On average, growth paths have become steeper by nearly one-and-a-half-fold in the final regime comparing with the baseline regime before the early forties. Overall, this evidence appears to contradict the key prediction of neoclassical growth theory in addition to Kaldor's (The theory of capital.

Consequently, the 2010 United Nations International Standard for Determining Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Cities promotes a harmonized protocol for quantifying the GHG emissions attributable to cities and local regions. The UN's common standard has important implications for comparison, benchmarking and policy assessment related to energy policies. This paper uses Hong Kong as a case study to illustrate these implications. Hong Kong's per capita contribution to GHG emissions are among the highest in the world, yet the local government's official statistics indicate emissions that are far below those reported by most affluent economies. This discrepancy arises from a reporting methodology that does not require inclusion of GHG emissions linked to consumption of imported goods or emissions from aviation and shipping. The Hong Kong case reveals that current inventories do not provide sufficient information to guide policymaking related to energy and climate change. They also do not provide adequate information for comparing policies of cities internationally. Alternative emissions-reporting standards that focus more on pollution from consumption will create avenues for more effective climate-related policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In relation to the goal of including biodiesel within the Brazilian energy matrix, the program can be seen to be responding dynamically and ahead of schedule. In 2010, the B5 blend was already part of the diesel consumed in Brazil, with 81% of the biodiesel coming from soybean oil and 14% from beef tallow. By contrast, the plans to diversify the feedstocks used to produce biodiesel and improve production in the poorest regions of Brazil have failed to prosper. Regarding the goal of fostering social inclusion by encouraging the participation of family-based farming, this has been partially achieved. Finally, the goal of cost-efficiently producing biodiesel is far from being achieved. The economic feasibility of the production and use of biodiesel in Brazil can be questioned since it is still strongly supported by tax incentives and production and marketing subsidies.

First, the natural decay of the pollution stock follows stochastic dynamics that drives a diffusion pollution process (stochastic uncertainty). Moreover, the damage coefficient which determines the amount of damage corresponding to each pollution stock can undergo an abrupt increase at some uncertain future time (event uncertainty). The model admits an explicit and simple dynamic characterization of the optimal emission rule and the ensuing pollution process. When only one type of uncertainty is permitted (by setting either the variance of the stochastic process or the hazard rate for the damage increase to zero) it acts to promote the intuitive response of precaution. However, allowing the two types to interact gives rise to a non-monotonic behavior, whereby increasing the stochastic variance first enhances, then diminishes the response to the hazard. The results confirm and expand recent findings based on discrete-time formulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As the world's second largest economy, China has a large scale of trade, which results in the serious problem of embodied CO2 emissions transfer. This paper analyzes the characteristics of China's CO2 emissions embodied in international and interprovincial trade from the provincial perspective. The multi-regional Input-Output Model is used to clarify provincial CO2 emissions from geographical and sectoral dimensions, including 30 provinces and 28 sectors. Two calculating principles (production accounting principle and consumption accounting principle, Munksgaard and Pedersen, 2001) are applied. The results show that for international trade, the eastern area accounts for a large proportion in China's embodied CO2 emissions. The sectors as net exporters and importers of embodied CO2 emissions belong to labor-intensive and energy-intensive industries, respectively. For interprovincial trade, the net transfer of embodied CO2 emissions is from the eastern area to the central area, and energy-intensive industries are the main contributors. With the largest amount of direct CO2 emissions, the eastern area plays an important role in CO2 emissions reduction. The central and western areas need supportive policies to avoid the transfer of industries with high emissions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We present different approaches to the valuation of physical transmission rights and perform a quantitative analysis of the results. On the one hand various challenges of modeling regional price spreads are analyzed. On the other hand we indicate a structural undervaluation of physical transmission rights in all model constellations, i.e. market prices are below theoretical prices of PTR's flexibility. We discuss several reasons for this undervaluation and finally state that regulatory modifications have to be made to avoid missing incentives for the extension of cross-border capacities.

On the other hand, the literature on RES-E support shows that the choice of design elements within RES-E support instruments is at least as important to successfully promote RES-E as the choice of specific instruments. The aim of this paper is to build a theoretical framework for dynamic efficiency analysis and assess the dynamic efficiency properties of the different design elements of feed-in tariffs. It is shown that, in fact, several design elements can have a significant impact on the different dimensions of dynamic efficiency. Particularly relevant design elements in this context are technology-specific fixed-tariffs, floor prices, degression, reductions of support over time for existing plants, long duration of support and support falling on consumers. In addition, it is shown than some design elements would be more appropriate than others to activate specific dimensions.

For this purpose, the LCOE is calculated using a life-cycle cost method, based on the net present value, the discounted cash flow technique and the technology learning curve approach. By this procedure, the LCOE corresponding to CSP electricity is calculated as a function of ten independent variables. Among these parameters, special attention has been put on the evaluation of the available solar resource, the analysis of the IEA predicted values for the cumulative installed capacity, the initial (2010) cost of the system, the discount and learning rates, etc. One significant contribution of our work is that the predicted evolution of the LCOEs strongly depend, not only on the particular values of the cumulative installed capacity function in the targeted years, but mainly on the specific curved time-paths which are followed by this function. The results obtained in this work are shown both graphically and numerically. Finally, the implications that the results could have in energy planning policies and grid parity calculations are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Research in literature shows mixed results. This paper studies the mechanisms that link energy supply and impacts on income generation. Empirical data from 264 small scale enterprises in 16 clusters of villages in the Indian Himalayas is analysed. The steps between energy supply and impacts on enterprise are stratified, studying actual energy use of energy services. The analysis shows that for the majority of typical enterprises in rural areas, which are informal enterprises with less than 6 workers, the impacts on incomes are low even though the uptake of electricity in enterprises is high. The key factor influencing impacts on incomes is limitations in access to markets for enterprise products, especially social access. For most small scale rural entrepreneurs the main impacts of energy access are on wellbeing. The findings are discussed to come to policy recommendations in the field of energy supply and complementary fields to achieving positive impacts on rural development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that rural residential energy consumption has shown obvious transition from non-commercial energy to commercial energy. The percentage of biomass energy consumption dropped from 81.5% in 2001 to 70.9% in 2008, while the percentage of commercial energy increased from 17.1% to 25.1%. Besides, other renewable energy increased very fast with annual growth rate of 19.8%. Correspondingly, total CO2 emissions from rural residential energy consumption had significant increase from 152.2 Million tons in 2001 to 283.6 Million tons in 2008. The annual growth rate of per capita CO2 emissions was nearly 2 times faster than that of urban area. The major driving force for the consumption of commercial energy was the income of rural farmers, while strong rural energy policies supported the development of renewable energy. To satisfy the goals of energy supply and CO2 emissions reduction in rural areas, it is advised to change the energy structure and improve the energy efficiency, such as to generate electricity using renewable technologies and to replace coal with modern biomass energy for cooking and heating.

It studies the case of the debate in the Parliament on the introduction of progressive rates in the inheritance tax in 1900. The debate shows that the Members of Parliament at the discussion were conscious of the importance of a sound doctrinal founding of their lines of reasoning to defend their positions, for or against progressivity. Well-known European economists were often quoted as sources of authority, and, although these quotations sometimes were not rigorous but instrumental, it can be said that MPs had a fairly good degree of knowledge of contemporary trends of fiscal thought. Despite it being on a reform of a small tax, this debate was very controversial on behalf of the concern progressive taxation in a tax on capital raised in wealthy classes, represented in the Parliament. The diffusion of the discussions in media was noteworthy, thus contributing to the dissemination of economic ideas behind arguments among cultured Spanish elites.","Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"San Julián-Arrupe, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,,"San-Julian-Arrupe, Javier/0000-0001-8896-4215",,,,,59,2,2,0,7,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,2385-3247,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

In order to comply with this law, manufacturers were forced either to create local affiliated companies or to concede assembly licenses to local agents. In spite of the 20 assembly plants which were built during the 1960s and 1970s, there was never a dynamic assembly sector. The capacity to absorb technology in this sector was modelled by the receptor environment, which was unable to appropriate new machinery and new skills, and remained at a handling level. The late industrialisation, the almost complete absence of engineers working in this sector and the severe lack of qualified workers made importation of technology the only available possibility. In this article we present two case studies, Movauto and Salvador Caetano/DFO, which highlight the characteristics of the Portuguese automobile industry, mainly concerning its business strategy and technology transfer channels.","[Sousa, Maria Luisa; Diogo, Maria Paula] Univ Nova Lisboa, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Sousa, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal.",,"Sousa, M.

This paper argues that a cap-and-trade regulatory system for indirect emissions combined with a rate-based allocation system for direct emissions can achieve market efficiency even in the presence of price and quantity controls in the electricity market This particular policy mix could provide appropriate incentives for industries to reduce their electricity consumption while inducing power producers to reduce their direct carbon emissions cost-effectively in conditions where there is strict government control of electricity prices. Another advantage of the suggested policy mix is that it allows carbon leakage in cross-border power trades to be effectively eliminated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, after making a comparison with the other Chinese pilots and emissions trading schemes in the European Union (EU) and California, the paper offers a summary of several distinct features of the Hubei ETS. First, the small numbers of entities that are covered by the scheme produce a considerable proportion of the emissions. This makes Hubei the world's third largest carbon market Second, the Hubei ETS applies several mechanisms to deal with the province's rapid growth rate.

We apply a multiregional and multisectoral model of trade flows that takes into account all the intersectoral and intercountry interdependences in the production processes. Using the World Input-Output Database we perform two different simulations. The first one considers the tax changes proposed by the reform; the second one shows the impact the reform would have entailed if it were applied also to sectors belonging to the European Trade System. The main finding of the first simulation shows that the new energy tax regime would have had a low economic cost in terms of impact on prices (less than 1% in all the countries). So, the concerns about competitiveness do not find empirical support in our results, suggesting the need for further analyses to find out the reasons that caused the failure of a reform that was an important step to introduce a taxation explicitly linked to CO2 emissions. The second simulation, however, leads to strongly different results, pointing out the relevance of maintaining significant economic incentives to reduce carbon emissions for the European Trade System sectors, by improving the emission market performance or by applying carbon taxation also to these sectors.

Intense knowledge creation occurred in the UK and northern European countries, while European research networks encouraged public-private partnerships facilitating knowledge diffusion. An analysis based on a technological innovation system (TIS) has identified challenges for the system to evolve from one phase of development to another, i.e. from pre-development to take-off phase. In order for marine energy to pass successfully through the commercialisation 'valley of death', entrepreneurial experimentation and production is crucial. Entrepreneurial initiatives were developed mainly in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway and Ireland, whereas France, Germany and Sweden were active through venture capital initiatives. Additional system-builders, such as the authorities in charge of energy policies, could offer guidance for research, ensure legitimacy and effectively mobilise resources for system development. Although public support was efficient in stimulating private investment, national targets seemed less efficient in creating a long time horizon for private investors, due to consecutive, unexpected changes. In contrast, positive interactions between technology developers and policy-makers could empower market formation.

Recent work has characterised the costs and benefits of individual smart investments. The political economy of the UK electricity system, however, has co-evolved such that there is a mismatch between where benefits accrue and where costs are incurred, leading to a problem of value capture and redeployment. Further, some benefits of smart grids are less easy to price directly and can be classified as public goods, such as energy security and decarbonisation. This paper builds on systemic treatments of energy system transitions to characterise the co-evolution of value capture and structural incentives in the electricity distribution system, drawing on semi-structured interviews and focus groups undertaken with smart grid stakeholders in the UK. This leads to an identification of municipal scale values that may be important for business models for the delivery of smart infrastructure. Municipalities may thus pursue specific economic opportunities through smart grid investment. This supports recent practical interest in an expanded role for municipalities as partners and investors in smart grid infrastructures. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, it remains to be seen if the theoretical claims made concerning how feedback works can be substantiated using empirical data. To start to address this knowledge gap, the present research used qualitative data analysis to examine how consumers use and respond to energy monitors. The findings suggest feedback may increase both the physical and conscious visibility of consumption as well as knowledge about consumption. Accordingly, support was evident for the theoretical assertions that feedback transforms energy from invisible to visible, prompts motivated users to learn about their energy habits, and helps address information deficits about energy usage. We conclude by evaluating the feasibility of feedback to substantially reduce consumption and discuss ways in which feedback could be improved to aid its effectiveness in the long term before discussing the implication our findings may have for government policy.

Many of them dismiss potential physical constraints and issues with natural resource supply, and do not consider the growth rates of the individual technologies needed or how the energy systems are to be sustained over longer time frames. A case study is presented modelling potential growth rates of the wind energy required to reach installed capacities proposed in other studies, taking into account the expected service life of wind turbines. A sustained commissioning model is proposed as a theoretical foundation for analysing reasonable growth patterns for technologies that can be sustained in the future. The annual installation and related resource requirements to reach proposed wind capacity are quantified and it is concluded that these factors should be considered when assessing the feasibility, and even the sustainability, of fast energy transitions. Even a sustained commissioning scenario would require significant resource flows, for the transition as well as for sustaining the system, indefinitely. Recent studies that claim there are no potential natural resource barriers or other physical constraints to fast transitions to renewable energy appear inadequate in ruling out these concerns.

However, its diffusion has not been as rapid as anticipated. The objective here is to analyse attitudes towards wind power among Finnish local residents and owners of second homes. First, we assess their existing knowledge of and level of interest in energy issues and wind power. Second, we analyse potential differences in attitudes between the two stakeholder groups when it comes to wind power in general and the proposed wind farm in particular. The study draws on both quantitative survey data and qualitative interview data. One of the key findings concerns the different perceptions among locals and owners of second homes in a rural area. Both groups were interested in questions of energy production and accepted wind power in general. Nevertheless, the proposed project in Ruokolahti seemed to polarize attitudes. This paper offers new insights into attitudes to wind energy among Finnish locals and owners of second homes in the same area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Many countries have ambitions to increase the share of renewable energy in their energy mix. This development entails the challenge of incorporating an increasing amount of volatile energy supply and a higher number of energy providers on distribution grid level. The smart grid could be a solution for this challenge. However, the implementation of smart grid technologies is rather slow. In this paper, we examine which barriers exist for the implementation of smart grid technologies. Fourteen in-depth expert interviews were conducted and qualitatively analysed using the grounded theory approach. First, a dynamic definition framework of the term smart grid was developed that incorporates contextual factors. Second, barriers to the implementation of smart grid technologies were gathered. We identified (1) cost and benefit, (2) knowledge, and (3) institutional mechanisms as barrier categories. Third, policy implications were derived. We recommend (1) the acceptance of a diversity of solutions, (2) the acceptance of incremental change, (3) the implementation of a stable regulatory framework, (4) the alignment of interests of individual market participants with the entire system, (5) the definition of a suitable scope of regulations, and (6) the collection of problem-specific information.

This allows us to derive the optimal timing of the production capacity expansion and the optimal transmission price which assures its connection. We find that an increasing penetration through renewables leads to investment postponement in both sectors, which goes along with increased systematic risk.

The study is divided into two main stages. During the first one, using cluster analysis methods, four groups of countries which met three energy policy targets stated in the package at similar levels were identified. During the second stage, the bootstrap Granger panel causality approach proposed by Konya (2006) was used to verify the hypothesis of causality between energy consumption and economic growth in the countries from four groups created in the previous step. The global financial crisis was also taken into account. The results obtained reveal that the level of compliance with energy policy targets influences linkages between energy consumption and economic growth. The results indicate causal relations in the group of countries with the greatest reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the highest reduction of energy intensity and the highest share of renewable energy consumption in total energy consumption. In the remaining groups the results mostly confirm the neutrality hypothesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology incorporates Building Information Modeling (BIM) as a real-time design and economic assessment tool for BIPV choices. This serves to benefit both the construction companies and potential house owners in their decision-making.

Prices of electronic products with comparable performance decreased over time. For products where the data allowed fitting the relationship, we found an exponential decrease in price with an average time constant of -0.30 [1/year], meaning that every year the product became 26% cheaper on average. The results imply that the classical approach of setting minimum efficiency performance standards (MEPS) by means of life cycle cost calculations cannot be applied to electronic products. Therefore, an alternative approach based on the improvement of efficiency over time and the variation in efficiency of products on the market, is presented. The concept of a policy action window can provide guidance for the decision on whether setting MEPS for a certain product is appropriate. If the (formal) procedure for setting MEPS takes longer than the policy action window, this means that the efficiency improvement will also be achieved without setting MEPS. We found short, i.e. less than three years, policy action windows for graphic cards, network attached storage products, network switches and televisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In modeling power plant investment decisions, most existing literature uses the expected carbon price (e.g., the price of traded permits or carbon tax) as a proxy for carbon risk. In contrast, this paper identifies expected carbon payment as a more accurate measure of carbon risk as perceived by industry practitioners. This measure of carbon risk incorporates both expected price and the probability that this price would actually be faced in the case of a particular investment. This concept helps explain both the surge of activity in 2005-2006 and the subsequent decline in interest in coal-fired power plant development in the U.S. The data for this case study comes from an extensive online survey of 700 U.S. energy professionals completed in 2006, as well as interviews conducted with industry representatives from 2007 to 2009. By analyzing industry views on policy uncertainty and future carbon legislation, we gain a better understanding of investor attitudes toward carbon risk. This understanding will help policy makers design better incentives for investing in low-carbon technologies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It finds that the CERC has been able to generate new IP through RD&D activities, though minimal IP has come from collaborative activities involving both U.S. and Chinese participants. Many participants reported that the CERC's Technology Management Plan (TMP) mitigated their IP concerns, though few have tested its efficacy or enforceability. While it is too early to comprehensively assess the efforts of the CERC, it is increasingly evident that the CERC provides a model for collaborative clean energy RD&D that is unique in the history of U.S.-China collaborations in this area. The TMP may ultimately play an important role in building trust among. the consortia participants, which could lead to even more constructive collaborations in the future, and serve as a model for future bilateral cooperation agreements. Without sustained support, and continued attention to IP concerns, it will be even harder for China and the United States to make progress towards true cross-national research collaborations which ultimately could produce considerable global benefits, particularly in the clean energy field.

This analysis quantifies the day-today and embodied energy consumption of four different neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, to examine how built environment variations influence various sources of urban energy consumption. A microsimulation combines models for petroleum use (from driving) and residential and commercial power and natural gas use with rigorously measured building stock and infrastructure materials quantities (to arrive at embodied energy). Results indicate that the more suburban neighborhoods, with mostly detached single-family homes, consume up to 320% more embodied energy, 150% more operational energy, and about 160% more total life-cycle energy (per capita) than a densely developed neighborhoods with mostly low-rise-apartments and duplexes. Across all neighborhoods, operational energy use comprised 83 to 92% of total energy use, and transportation sources (including personal vehicles and transit, plus street, parking structure, and sidewalk infrastructure) made up 44 to 47% of the life-cycle energy demands tallied. Energy elasticity calculations across the neighborhoods suggest that increased population density and reduced residential unit size offer greatest life-cycle energy savings per capita, by reducing both operational demands from driving and home energy use, and from less embodied energy from construction. These results provide measurable metrics for comparing different neighborhood styles and develop a framework to anticipate energy-savings from changes in the built environment versus household energy efficiency.

J. Beyond the creative city: cognitive-cultural capitalism and the new urbanism, Regional Studies. Creativity is a concept whose time has come in economic and urban geography. It is also a concept that calls for enormous circumspection. An attempt is made to show that the interdependent processes of learning, creativity and innovation are situated within concrete fields of social relationships. Because much existing research on creative cities fails adequately to grasp this point, it tends to offer a flawed representation of urban dynamics and leads in many instances to essentially regressive policy advocacies. Cognitive-cultural capitalism is a more robust theoretical framework through which contemporary urbanization processes can be described. The framework of cognitive-cultural capitalism shapes the peculiar logic of learning, creativity and innovation that are observed in cities today but also has many wider and deeper impacts on urban outcomes. It has important policy implications so a critique of current policy stances derived from creative city ideas is also provided.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Scott, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",ajscott@ucla.edu,"Scott, Allen John/A-8111-2008",,,,,,121,161,202,2,203,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This study applies the concept of socio-technical regime to identify factors which have made this path so erratic. We examine four stages in China's solar PV policy from mid-1990s to 2013 and show that each is characterized by different combinations of policy program. These changes in government policy and in the resultant trajectory of the solar PV sector are attributed to three main sets of variables. The most important of these are events which shape the wider policy priorities of China's government. Secondary factors include the government's poor management of the policy interaction between the domestic solar PV manufacturing industry and the deployment of solar PV across the country, as well as policy learning within government. The general lesson from this study is that the development path of a single element of a national strategy for the low-carbon transition is likely to be erratic, subject as it is to a range of political and economic forces, and to experimentation and learning.

Therefore, defining the social conditions determines the success of a mining project. Two communes were chosen for a public opinion study: Kleszczow, where the Betchatow mine is located, and lloczew, where a lignite deposit will soon be developed. The analysis shows, as opposed to other areas in Poland that have been projected for development, that both local communities are characterised by a high level of acceptance for lignite mining. In both cases,awareness about the profits was stronger than anxiety about the investment's negative effects. However, most inhabitants could not assess the mining company's diligence concerning its responsibility for mining damages as well as the diligence of external experts assessing the environmental impacts of excavation. Most respondents also could not assess if the legal regulations of public participation in the decision process were sufficient, but the negative opinions outweighed the positive ones. From the perspective of the energy policy, dialogue-type social communication is needed for every case of a new energy-mining project.

Regarding the electricity-GDP nexus, the empirical results support evidence on the feedback hypothesis for Russia and the conservation hypothesis for South Africa. However, a neutrality hypothesis holds for Brazil, India and China, indicating neither electricity consumption nor economic growth is sensitive to each other in these three countries. Regarding the GDP-CO2 emissions nexus, a feedback hypothesis for Russia, a one-way Granger causality running from GDP to CO2 emissions in South Africa and reverse relationship from CO2 emissions to GDP in Brazil is found. There is no evidence of Granger causality between GDP and CO2 emissions in India and China. Furthermore, electricity consumption is found to Granger cause CO2 emissions in India, while there is no Granger causality between electricity consumption and CO2 emissions in Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa.

Effectively engaging stakeholders and setting appropriate policies requires insights into current public perceptions of this issue. Using a nationally representative U.S. sample (N=1061), we examine public perceptions of hydraulic fracturing including: top of mind associations; familiarity with the issue; levels of support/opposition; and predictors of such judgments. Similar to findings on other emerging technologies, our results suggest limited familiarity with the process and its potential impacts and considerable uncertainty about whether to support it. Multiple regression analysis (r(2)=.49) finds that women, those holding egalitarian worldviews, those who read newspapers more than once a week, those more familiar with hydraulic fracturing, and those who associate the process with environmental impacts are more likely to oppose fracking. In contrast, people more likely to support fracking tend to be older, hold a bachelor's degree or higher, politically conservative, watch TV news more than once a week, and associate the process with positive economic or energy supply outcomes. Based on these findings, we discuss recommendations for future research, risk communication, and energy policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A cost-driven forecasting model for basic chemicals production is developed, accounting for regional production costs, demand growth and stock turnover. The model determines the global production capacity placement, implementation of energy-efficient Best Practice Technology (BPT) and global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the period 2010-2030. Subsequently, the effects of energy and climate policies on these parameters are quantified. About 60% of new basic chemical production capacity is projected to be placed in non-OECD regions by 2030 due to low energy prices. While global production increases by 80% between 2010 and 2030, the OECD's production capacity share decreases from 40% to 20% and global emissions increase by 50%. Energy pricing and climate policies are found to reduce 2030 CO2 emissions by 5-15% relative to the baseline developments by increasing BPT implementation. Maximum BPT implementation results in a 25% reduction. Further emission reductions require measures beyond energy-efficient technologies. The model is useful to estimate general trends related to basic chemicals production, but improved data from the chemical sector is required to expand the analysis to additional technologies and chemicals.

This paper evaluates the reasons for this and on-going relevance of Peak Oil, considering variations in predictive dates for the phenomenon supported by technological, economic and political issues. Using data from agencies, the validity of each position is assessed looking at reserves, industrial developments and alternative fuels. The complicating issue of demand is also considered. The conclusions are that, supported by commercial interests, an unsubstantiated belief in market and technical solutions, and a narrow paradigmatic focus, critics of Peak Oil theory have used unreliable reserve data, optimistic assumptions about utilisation of unconventional supplies and unrealistic predictions for alternative energy production to discredit the evidence that the resource-limited peak in the world's production of conventional oil has arrived, diverting discussion from what should be a serious topic for energy policy: how we respond to decreasing supplies of one of our most important energy sources.

The second was one of stagnation in aggregate consumption - stagnation that resulted from a fall in the consumption of milk and persistent growth in the consumption of derivatives. Another important feature of this second phase was that the variety of consumer goods greatly increased.

The analysis is primarily focused on the UK, but is international in application. The paper is based on both the analysis of secondary data and information on actions taken by ports to reduce their emissions, with the latter data collected for the main UK ports via their published reports and/or via interviews. Only a small number of ports (representing 32% of UK port activity) actually measure and report their carbon emissions in the UK context. The emissions generated by ships calling at these ports are analysed using a method based on Department for Transport Maritime Statistics Data. In addition, a case example (Felixstowe) of emissions associated with HGV movements to and from ports is presented, and data on vessel emissions at berth are also considered. Our analyses indicate that emissions generated by ships during their voyages between ports are of a far greater magnitude than those generated by the port activities. Thus while reducing the ports' own emissions is worthwhile, the results suggest that ports might have more impact through focusing their efforts on reducing shipping emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a natural heterogeneous, multiphase and disperse body whose complex properties and characteristics must be known in detail in order to decipher the complicated mechanisms of excess water movement towards the drainage systems. Draining excess water can improve the saline fluid regime of soil in the sense required by crop and natural resources protection of soil and groundwater. Soil is a porous medium with physical features that are variable in time and space which influences certain features of the water flow through its mass. Sometimes these features prevent the formulation of mathematical laws describing these processes, requiring approximations of the physical process in order to formulate it mathematically. For this reason, the approach to water movement through saturated soil to the drainage systems requires the simplification of the actual physical processes and the way they can be expressed through contemporary specialist knowledge. Description of water transfer through the saturated soil requires a dynamic behavior law expressing the permanent existence of a univocal relationship between speed and acceleration, together with the continuity law that describes the process quantitatively. The original approaches to problems of leakage through the soil to the drainage systems in order to determine the technical elements of the planning that is presented in this paper are based on a concept of modern physics focused on the experience accumulated in the theory and practice of drainage. Thus, the water flow through the saturated soil to the drainage system is a case of plane-parallel motion of the fluid particles moving in transverse planes that are perpendicular to the drain axis. The analytical solutions applied in solving this problem are applicable only under certain conditions imposed by the geometry of the field that studies the filtration movement or values that can be imposed by flow rate or hydraulic conductivity. Numerical solutions have the advantage that approximation can be as fine as desired, which determined precision results. The numerical method is applied by using the following methodology (the complex boundary integral equations method).","[Hontus, Adelaida Cristina; Tindeche, Cristiana; Marcuta, Alina; Marcuta, Liviu] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,,adelaidahontus@yahoo.com; tindeche_cristina@yahoo.com; alinamarcuta@yahoo.com; liviumarcuta@yahoo.com,"Liviu, Marcuta/AAC-1356-2019; HONTUS, ADELAIDA/HTP-6007-2023; Marcuta, Alina/C-9614-2015; Marcuta, Liviu/HTQ-7864-2023; Alina, Marcuta/V-4604-2019; Tindeche, Cristina/HTQ-7212-2023","HONTUS, ADELAIDA/0009-0000-6394-4517; Marcuta, Alina/0009-0000-8933-9155; Marcuta, Liviu/0009-0005-9413-7175; Tindeche, Cristina/0009-0000-2401-1300",,,,,5,1,1,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-2-1,,,,2014,,,,,,,956,966,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BA9EM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339308100100,0

For regression analysis between the response part and an explanatory subcomposition such coordinates are required that enable assigning coordinates to both the response variable and one of the covariates simultaneously. Moreover, as all coordinates contain measurement errors, the use of ordinary least squares regression for parameter estimation would lead to biased results.

It is composed of three simultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equations with three state variables, which express the interest rate, the investment demand, and the price index, in particular. We have already introduced time dependent constitutive coefficient representing rate of investment instead of time invariant one. Further, we also admit more complex construction of right hand side terms including time delayed response of state variables, which yields the system with more general structure. In such case, the initial value problem turns to initial history problem, in general. We start with the simplest analytic form of the lagged terms, which assumes three intensities and three delays given. Numerical investigation of model with different forms of investment rate function and lagged structure is reported in detail. In particular, we are focused on analysis of influence of different initial history functions upon generated trajectories and their convergence to trajectories generated by corresponding initial value problems with neglected delays.

Thus, the boom of the Spanish economy relied on the construction sector producing a bubble of the property sector. As it occurred in other Western economies, the property bubble was enlarged by speculative construction and dramatically rising prices (average annual increases about 15%), but also the increase of the maturity of the loans causing high levels of indebtedness of the Spanish construction industry (Bank of Spain) for the period of time 2000-2006. Doubtless to say the construction sector bubble was maximized by the significant increase in private debt from householders and developers/builders promoted by a kindly fine financial system. However, this escalation ended with the international financial crisis, bringing construction companies to a default situation since their liabilities exceed the values of their assets, firmly affecting the banking system. In this context, we propose a model to forecast the bankruptcy of the companies belonging to the construction sector in Spain. For this purpose we select a sample of Spanish companies of the construction sector, then we build a database composed by economic and financial information from the companies selected. Then, we apply multivariate analysis in order to construct models to predict the bankruptcy of the representative sample of companies. Thus, we compare our model to previous models developed by Altman's (1968).

The first one is the analytical calculation based on costs of shortage and superfluous inventory units. The second possibility is to use Monte Carlo simulation. The second way of the calculation will be described in detail because the first one is based on the well-known inventory model.

Studies of decision-making process of parliamentary voting from the mathematical point of view usually cover studies on power and influence of coalitions. As a measure of players' power, the concept of power indices was introduced in the second half of the last century. One of the widely used power indices - Banzhaf power index - also called Penrose-Banzhaf or Banzhaf-Coleman power index - is based on the concept of 'swing voters' in possible coalitions. The Banzhaf power index is derived from the assumption of random voting. However, real world results differ from theoretical assumptions. For example Gelman, Katz and Bafumi (2004) and Gelman, Katz and Tuerlinckx (2002) have shown that the assumption is violated in large voting bodies. In order to fit real world conditions, adjustments of the index were done by Hu (2006), who proposed add weighted marginal contributions to power indices. This article applies Hu's ideas to calculate power in a real voting, namely the data from the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Parliament with the emphasis on the State Budget voting issues.","[Mielcova, Elena] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic; [Mielcova, Elena] CERGE EI, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences,"Mielcová, E (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",mielcova@opf.slu.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,655,660,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900113,0

The most recent federal CES proposal from former Senator Bingaman would transform the way electricity is produced and result in substantial reductions in CO2 emissions with small national average electricity price effects through 2025. After 2025, electricity prices would increase substantially. The alternative compliance payment (ACP) for clean energy credits will be binding, so actual deployment of clean energy will fall short of the intended targets, and cumulative emissions reductions by 2035 will be 12 percent smaller than they would be without an ACP. The small utility exemption from the CES requirements equates to roughly $29 billion in avoided electricity expenditures by the customers of exempted utilities in 2035 alone. Excluding power generated by existing nuclear and hydroelectric facilities from CES compliance responsibility raises electricity prices in competitive regions to the benefit of owners of existing nuclear and hydroelectric capacity.

Moreover, it is possible to infer that Opportunistic types are more strongly driven by fear of rejection (strategic concerns) and have weaker fairness preferencess than Fair types.","[Vesely, Stepan] Masaryk Univ, Dept Psychol, Fac Arts, Brno, Czech Republic; [Vesely, Stepan] Brno Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Brno University of Technology,"Vesely, S (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Psychol, Fac Arts, Arne Novaka 1, Brno, Czech Republic.",stepan.vesely@seznam.cz,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,PALACKY UNIV,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC, KRIZKOVSKEHO 8, OLOMOUC, 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-4209-9,,,,2014,,,,,,,1074,1077,,,,,,4,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BC9GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356417900184,0

Estimation is achieved using Bayesian techniques with Gibbs and the generalized direct sampling (GDS). The model is applied to analyze land development decisions for undeveloped parcels over a 6-year period in Austin, Texas. Results suggest that GDS is a useful method for uncovering parameters whose draws may otherwise fail to converge using standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. Estimation results suggest that residential and commercial/civic development tends to favor more regularly shaped and smaller parcels, which may be related to parcel conversion costs and aesthetics. Longer distances to Austin's central business district increase the likelihood of residential development, while reducing that of commercial/civic and office/industrial uses. Everything else constant, distances to a parcel's nearest minor, and major arterial roads are estimated to increase development likelihood of commercial/civic and office/industry uses, perhaps because such development is more common in less densely developed locations (as proxied by fewer arterials). As expected, added soil slope is estimated to be negatively associated with residential development, but positively associated with commercial/civic and office/industry uses (perhaps due to some steeper terrains offering view benefits). Estimates of the cross-alternative correlations suggest that a parcel's residential use utility or attractiveness tends to be negatively correlated with that of commercial/civic, but positively associated with that of office/industrial uses, while the latter two land uses exhibit some negative correlation. Using an inverse-distance weight matrix for each parcel's closest 50 neighbors, the spatial autocorrelation coefficient is estimated to be 0.706, indicating a marked spatial clustering pattern for land development in the selected region.","[Wang, Yiyi] Montana State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Kockelman, Kara M.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Damien, Paul] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Informat Risk & Operat Management, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Kockelman, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",yiyi.wang@ce.montana.edu; kkockelm@mail.utexas.edu,"Kockelman, Kara/ABF-7223-2021; wang, yiyi/GWZ-5830-2022",,,,,,33,16,19,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Plentiful by-product - C5 fraction will produce in the process of producing ethylene with petroleum hydrocarbon through pyrolysis. The output of C5 fraction is 10%-20% of that of ethylene. C5 fraction contains over 30 multiple components with the similar boiling point, including isoprene, cyclopentadiene and pentadiene. The content of the three is high, accounting for 40%-50%. Meanwhile, the three substances are fundamental raw materials used to produce resin, rubber, spice, medicine and other fine chemical products. Fraction output of C5 as a by-product of ethylene also grows rapidly. Since the substance used to split C5 fraction consist of more than 20 components with very similar boiling point which can easily form the azeotrope. It is difficult to isolate qualified C5 diolefin.

We have profiled Cameroon, a country where modern bioenergy remains largely untapped due to a lack of availability of biomass data and gaps in existing policies. This study assessed the biomass resource potential in Cameroon from sustainably extracted agricultural and forest residues. We estimated that environmentally benign residues amount to 1.11 million bone dry tons per year. This has the potential to yield 0.12-0.32 billion liters of ethanol annually to displace 18-48% of the national consumption of gasoline. Alternatively, the residues could provide 0.08-0.22 billion liters of biomass to Fischer Tropsch diesel annually to offset 17-45% of diesel fuel use. For the generation of bioelectricity, the residues could supply 0.76-2.02 TW h, which is the equivalent of 15-38% of Cameroon's current electricity consumption. This. could help spread electricity throughout the country, especially in farming communities where the residues are plentiful. The residues could, however, offset only 3% of the national consumption of traditional biomass (woodfuel and charcoal). Policy recommendations that promote the wider uptake of modern bioenergy applications from residues are provided. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2007, the European Commission adopted a proper energy policy for Europe supported by several documents and included an action plan to meet the major energy challenges Europe has to face. A farsighted diversified yearly mix of energies was suggested to countries, aiming at increasing security of supply and efficiency, but a wide and systemic view of energy interchanges between states was missing. In this paper, a Small-World methodology of analysis of Interchange Energy-Networks (IENs) is presented, with the aim of providing a useful tool for planning sustainable energy policies. A proof case is presented to validate the methodology by considering the European IEN behaviour in the period of economical crisis.

It compares energy-system changes and mitigation costs from a global and two national energy-system models under two global emission pathways with medium likelihood of meeting the 2 C target: a least-cost pathway and a pathway that postpones ambitious mitigation action, starting from the Copenhagen Accord pledges. Both pathways have similar 2010-2050 cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis shows that postponing mitigation action increases the lock-in in less energy efficient technologies and results in much higher cumulative mitigation costs. The models agree that carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear energy are important mitigation technologies, while the shares of biofuels and other renewables vary largely over the models. Differences between India and China with respect to the timing of emission reductions and the choice of mitigation measures relate to differences in projections of rapid economic change, capital stock turnover and technological development. Furthermore, depending on the way it is implemented, climate policy could increase indoor air pollution, but it is likely to provide synergies for energy security. These relations should be taken into account when designing national climate policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Lucas, Paul L.; van Ruijven, Bas J.; den Elzen, Michel G.

It develops a set of useful parameters for analyzing and comparing hybrid plants, it studies the case of hybridizing Brayton cycles with current solar technologies and shows a tentative extrapolation of the results to integrated combined cycle systems (ISCSS). In particular, three points have been analyzed: the technical requirements for solar technologies to be hybridized with Brayton cycles, the temperatures and pressures at which hybridization would produce maximum power per unit of fossil fuel, and their mapping to current solar technologies and Brayton cycles. Major conclusions are that a hybrid plant works in optimum conditions which are not equal to those of the solar or power blocks considered independently, and that hybridizing at the Brayton cycle of a combined cycle could be energetically advantageous.

Recent years have witnessed a shift toward third-party-owned (TPO) business models, in which the absence of a cash purchase price obscures data interpretation. Appraisals-often based on estimates of the average fair market value across a diverse fleet of systems-are one way TPO prices are reported. Scope: This study investigates residential PV system price drivers to improve the accuracy, consistency, and relevance of PV price-tracking efforts. Our econometric approach evaluates system price drivers using California Solar Initiative data, controlling for system, installer, and geographic variables. Conclusions: We find that reported prices for confirmed appraised systems are $1.13/W higher than non-appraised systems and do not respond to hypothesized price drivers. For non-appraised systems, we find preliminary evidence of market distortions based on the impact of the incentive level, module cost and household income on reported price. Further, unspecified installer heterogeneity-possibly due to differences in products, cost structure or reporting practices-is a substantial price driver. Using estimates, we develop a price model to approximate non-appraised system prices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These vehicles are promoted as providing distinct consumer and public benefits at the expense of grid electricity. However, the specific benefits or impacts of PHEVs ultimately relies on consumers purchase and vehicle use patterns. While considerable effort has been dedicated to understanding PHEV impacts on a per mile basis few studies have assessed the impacts of PHEV given actual consumer use patterns or operating conditions. Instead, simplifying assumptions have been made about the types of cars individual consumers will choose to purchase and how they will drive and charge them. Here, we highlight some of these consumer purchase and use assumptions, studies which have employed these assumptions and compare these assumptions to actual consumer data recorded in a PHEV demonstration project. Using simulation and hypothetical scenarios we discuss the implication for PHEV impact analyses and policy if assumptions about key PHEV consumer use variables such as vehicle choice, home charging frequency, distribution of driving distances, and access to workplace charging were to change.

Weather affects both these renewable resources and the demand for electricity. The dominant large-scale pattern of Euro-Atlantic atmospheric variability is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), associated with positive correlations in wind, temperature and precipitation over northern Europe. The NAO's effect on wind-power and demand in the UK and Norway is examined, focussing on March when Norwegian hydropower reserves are low and the combined power system might be most susceptible to atmospheric variations. The NCEP/NCAR meteorological reanalysis dataset (1948-2010) is used to drive simple models for demand and wind-power, and 'demand-net-wind' (DNW) is estimated for positive, neutral and negative NAO states. Cold, calm conditions in NAO- cause increased demand and decreased wind-power compared to other NAO states. Under a 2020 wind-power capacity scenario, the increase in DNW in NAO- relative to NAO neutral is equivalent to nearly 25% of the present-day average rate of March Norwegian hydropower usage. As the NAO varies on long timescales (months to decades), and there is potentially some skill in monthly predictions, we argue that it is important to understand its impact on European power systems.

We find that Chinese and international crude oil prices changed synchronously while Chinese refined oil prices follow the changes of international oil prices with the time difference being about 1 month to 2 months. Further, Australian coal prices Granger causes Chinese coal prices, and there is a high correlation between them. The U.S. electricity price is influenced by the WTI crude oil price, the U.S. gasoline price and the HenryHub gas price. Due to the unreasonable price-setting mechanism and regulation from the central government, China's terminal market prices for both electricity and natural gas do not reflect the real supply-demand situation. This paper provides quantitative results on the correlation between Chinese and international energy prices to better predict the impact of international energy price fluctuations on China's domestic energy supply and guide the design of more efficient energy pricing policies. Moreover, it provides references for developing countries to improve their energy market systems and trading, and to coordinate domestic and international energy markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Higgins, PAT",,,,"Higgins, Paul A. T.",,,Frameworks for pricing greenhouse gas emissions and the policy objectives they promote,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Decision-making; Climate change; Mitigation,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECONOMICS; PRICES,"Four cost-effective frameworks for pricing greenhouse gas emissions currently receive widespread attention: cap-and-trade, emission fees, and hybrid cap-and-trade approaches that include upper or lower limits on permit prices (price ceilings or floors). This paper develops a fifth framework that uses an emission fee with an upper limit on the quantity of emissions a quantity ceiling and compares the impact of each framework on emission prices and quantities. Cap-and-trade with a price ceiling minimizes price increases for emitting activities in all cases whereas an emission fee with a quantity ceiling maximizes emissions reductions. Thus, the choice of framework influences policy outcomes because each framework is more or less suited to particular policy goals. Whether pursuing one potential policy goal serves society's interests best depends on the eventual consequences of climate damage and emissions pricing, which are uncertain when policy choices are made. Policy updating over time may reduce but likely cannot entirely eliminate the differences in outcome that arise due to framework choice. Therefore, the best framework for emissions pricing depends on subjective preferences regarding the relative importance of different policy objectives, most notably whether one is more risk averse to climate damages or emissions price increases.

The result shows that firms have better environmental compliance because they are 'pushed' into compliance by the internal driver of human capital and 'pulled' to be environmental friendly by the external force of social human capital stock. This finding is robust when we take into account the possible endogeneity of human capital. In addition, evidence from this study suggests that the current situation of weak implementation of environmental supervision and evasion of environmental monitoring could be improved by promotion of internal and external human capital.

Moreover, there are abundant green energy resources reserved in Taipei. If they were fully developed, there would be 13,040 GWh electricity generated per year, resulting in a total of 937 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions abatement. The development of the green energy industry in this city not only can bring significant energy-saving and carbon-reducing benefits, but also may create huge derivative business opportunities. For example, the total output values of the solar PV and electric vehicles industries would be as high as 700 billion yuan. In this study, through Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis, we concluded that the top priorities for Taipei for the development of green energy industries are building energy conservation and electrified transportation, specifically, the following four items: electric vehicles, Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lighting, inverter air conditioning, and Energy Service Company (ESCO). Meanwhile, Taipei is a domestic and international key of politics, transportation, technology, commerce, and finance. Taipei is very likely to become an internationalized green energy industrial hub, achieving the 3E goals of economic prosperousness, environmental protection, and energy security.

In addition, this data includes variables that - to the authors' knowledge - have not been tested through other work.

We report the findings from a case-control survey which compares residents living with/without turbines in their community to understand the relative importance of these variables as predictors of turbine support. Ontario is the context for this study as it is a place where the pace of turbine installations is both very high and extremely politicized. As expected 69% of residents in the case community would vote in favour of local turbines yet surprisingly, only 25% would do so in the control community. Though the literature suggests that aesthetic preferences best predict turbine support the key predictors in this study are: health risk perception, community benefits, general community enhancement, and a preference for turbine-generated electricity. Concern about intra-community conflict is high in both the case (83%) and control (85%) communities as is concern about the fairness of local economic benefits (56% and 62%, respectively); yet neither is significant in the models. We discuss the implications of these findings particularly in terms of the consequences of a technocratic decide-announce-defend model of renewable facility siting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is based on a representative household sample of fourteen European countries covering the period 1994-2001. These data are merged with country-specific transaction tax data and aggregate homeownership rates. Similar to previous microeconomic studies, the results indicate that homeownership reduces job mobility as well as the probability of becoming unemployed or economically inactive. It is found, however, that this effect is severely mitigated by two factors. First, it decreases when aggregate homeownership rates are higher. Thus, homeowners have larger job tenures, but more so in countries with low homeownership rates. Second, transaction costs on the housing market are positively associated with the probability of becoming unemployed.","[De Graaff, Thomas] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Leuvensteijn, Michiel] Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"De Graaff, T (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",tgraaff@feweb.vu.nl; M.van.Leuvensteijn@cpb.nl,,"de Graaff, Thomas/0000-0002-1782-9742",,,,,35,8,8,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In the hydrogen economy, the hydrogen is delivered to the customers and is then converted into electricity and heat by fuel cells. This environmentally friendly decentralized power network consists of fuel cell manufacturers, hydrogen producers, and the purchasers of fuel cells and hydrogen. We present the specific characteristics of networks - two-sided market effects - and describe their effectiveness of establishing a network. Because the coordination of these effects additionally helps to implement the hydrogen economy locally, we consider an intermediary in the network. To fulfil this task we model a Bass diffusion process of fuel cells and hydrogen producers. The simulations indicate that including and coordinating the network effects can accelerate the diffusion of fuel cells and hydrogen supply significantly fuel cell installations can be doubled in the first 5 years.

For several years especially Novatek expanded. More recently, Rosneft has emerged as a key player, not least through its purchase of TNK-BP. This article begins with an overview of the companies in the Russian gas sector, their resource bases and capacities, and subsequently examines whether differences in field development costs and export market access may make it rational for Gazprom to continue ceding market share to the NGPs. With rising costs of Gazprom's queue of greenfield developments, any delays in Gazprom's investment program may be compensated through increased NGP production. The article argues that the NGPs are ready to fill the gap, may be allowed to do so and are already increasing their market share in an increasingly competitive market. The stage may now be set for a continued gradual transformation of the Russian gas market, in which the interests of Gazprom and the NGPs may be complementary or may be pitted against each other, but those of the Russian Federation are in any case likely to be better fulfilled than in the past.

The target requires a total contribution from biofuel of about 8-27 GL in 2025 depending on blending ratios. In energy terms, these are equivalent to 232-782 PJ or about 40-135 million barrels crude oil, which constitute roughly around 3.3-11.0% of the estimated liquid fossil fuel oil annual consumption in that year. The results imply that it may have detrimental environmental impact, as it requires 5.2 million ha of palm oil and sugar cane plantations. On the positive side, achieving the target offers potential new employment opportunities of about 3.4 million jobs, particularly in the agricultural sector relevant to liquid biofuel production.

In doing so we provide both short-run and long-run elasticity estimates for electricity demand. Recent developments in nonstationary panel estimation techniques allow for heterogeneity in the coefficients while examining the direction of causality among electricity consumption, electricity prices, and income growth. In addition to the full sample, we also disaggregate the sample into three sectors: commercial, industrial, and residential. The short-run results provide evidence in favor of the growth hypothesis for the aggregate sample, as well as for the industrial sector. For the residential and commercial sectors, the conservation hypothesis is supported. Long-run results favor the conservation hypothesis. To ascertain differences in electricity demand relating to electricity intensity we also examine states based on their efficiency in electricity consumption. Overall, the results yield in favor of the growth hypothesis for low intensity states and conservation hypothesis for high intensity states. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Fiscal planning requires an inflation-adjusted revenue stream and predictable real interest rate earnings on fund balances. A prompt solution satisfying political constraints requires compromise between the overlapping but distinct goals of seven different sets of interests at the federal level. Absent such compromise, there will be delay until sufficient support for one of three strategies evolves: (1) force the Yucca Mountain repository on Nevada, (2) open a centralized storage facility without coupling to repository licensing, or (3) follow a consent-based process for repository licensing.

It probes into the public's views toward governments' risk communication regarding climate change, citizens' participation in decision-making, and their trust in the capacity of governments toward risk governance, as well as their attitude towards corporate social responsibility. For analysis, we developed ten types of perceptions under three dimensions: namely the severity of climate change (Type 1), the development of sustainable society (Types 2, 3, 4 and 5), and the risk governance and communication (Types 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10) to discuss whether the Taiwanese public's perception of climate change was prepared for a socially reflective paradigm shift. Regarding the three dimensions in the questionnaire design, although this study individually measured the public's risk perception, there was a high correlation between the variance analysis results among the three dimensions. This could systematically explain the potential change of the governance paradigm in Taiwanese society concerning structural transformation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

At present, the contribution of gas is around 83% of total power generation, which is much higher than other traditional fuel sources. To reduce this single-source dependency on gas, Bangladesh needs to initiate alternative option to sustain its mid-term power generation-mix in addition to achieve its long-term energy security. Government of Bangladesh has already initiated a new master plan for the development of power generation under fuel-diversification scenario. In this view, local coal production and imported coal would assist the power planners to reduce the sole dependency on gas-driven power plants. In addition, cross-border hydropower import from Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal would also be a vital policy imperative to maintain the country's long-term energy security. Nonetheless, adding extra power to production side is certainly essential, demand side management through efficient energy use and energy conservation could also be of assistance to the release the existing crisis to a greater extent.

In this reply, we disagree with and will refute some of the points raised in their comments. The model that we established was based on the mature economic theory; with the variable selections all having economic implications. Considering the economic development stage, China's urbanization will speed up and this will have significant effect on energy consumption. Therefore, urbanization is an indispensable variable for analyzing energy demand in China. The scenario design only in terms of the GDP is sufficient for illustrating energy demand trend in China to be understood in a way by most of the people. Although energy forecast is not that precise, it has an important implication for energy policy design, especially for China which is in transition.

The paper describes a simple probabilistic model of the costs of synthetic crude oil produced from Canadian oil sands. Synthetic crude oil is obtained by upgrading bitumen that is first produced through mining or in-situ recovery techniques. This forward-looking analysis quantifies the effects of learning and production constraints on the costs of supplying synthetic crude oil. The sensitivity analysis shows that before 2035, the most influential parameters are the learning parameter in the case of in-situ bitumen and the depletion parameter in the case of mined bitumen. After 2035, depletion dominates in both cases. The results show that the social cost of CO2 has a large impact on the total costs of synthetic crude oil, in particular in the case of synthetic crude oil from in-situ bitumen, due to the carbon intensity of the recovery techniques: taking into account the social cost of CO2 adds more than half to the cost of producing synthetic crude oil from mined bitumen in 2050 (mean value), while the cost of producing synthetic crude oil from in-situ bitumen more than doubles.

This work sought to determine the impact of lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery siting on economic performance and minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) for both east and west coast North American fuel markets. Facility sites included the pine-dominated Pacific Northwest Interior, the mixed deciduous forest of Ontario and New York, and the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo. Feedstock scenarios included both plantation (poplar, willow, and eucalyptus, respectively) and managed forest harvest. Site specific variables in the techno-economic model included delivered feedstock cost, ethanol delivery cost, cost of capital, construction cost, labour cost, electricity revenues (and co-product credits), and taxes, insurance, and permits.

We arrive at the following: The self-employment decision is to a major extent guided by factors unobservable in register data.

Under the plan, NYS's 2030 all-purpose end-use power would be provided by 10% onshore wind (4020 5-MW turbines), 40% offshore wind (12,700 5-MW turbines), 10% concentrated solar (387 100-MW plants), 10% solar-PV plants (828 50-MW plants), 6% residential rooftop PV (similar to 5 million 5-kW systems), 12% commercial/government rooftop PV (similar to 500,000 100-kW systems), 5% geothermal (36 100-MW plants), 0.5% wave (1910 0.75-MW devices), 1% tidal (2600 1-MW turbines), and 5.5% hydroelectric (6.6 1300-MW plants, of which 89% exist). The conversion would reduce NYS's end-use power demand similar to 37% and stabilize energy prices since fuel costs would be zero. It would create more jobs than lost because nearly all NYS energy would now be produced in-state. NYS air pollution mortality and its costs would decline by similar to 4000 (1200-7600) deaths/yr, and $33 (10-76) billion/yr (3% of 2010 NYS GDP), respectively, alone repaying the 271 GW installed power needed within similar to 17 years, before accounting for electricity sales.

A better understanding of the adoption and diffusion of energy-efficient and renewables-based residential heating systems (RHS) is of high policy relevance, particularly against the background of climate change, security of energy supply and increasing energy prices. In this paper, we explore the multi-dimensionality of the homeowners' motivation to decide between competing RHS. A questionnaire survey (N=2440) conducted in 2010 among homeowners who had recently installed a RHS provides the empirical foundation. Principal component analysis shows that 25 items capturing different adoption motivations can be grouped around six dimensions: (1) cost aspects, (2) general attitude towards the RHS, (3) government grant, (4) reactions to external threats (i.e., environmental or energy supply security considerations), (5) comfort considerations, and (6) influence of peers. Moreover, a cluster analysis with the identified motivational factors as segmentation variables reveals three adopter types: (1) the convenience-oriented, (2) the consequences-aware, and (3) the multilaterally-motivated RHS adopter. Finally, we show that the influence of the motivational factors on the adoption decision also differs by certain characteristics of the homeowner and features of the home. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For a manufacturing-based economy such as China's to continue to grow, it needs an adequate supply of inexpensive energy. To date, this energy growth has primarily come from coal, but China's indigenous coal supplies are now falling short of the amount needed to support this growth. In this situation, the status of China's future coal supply will be very important for China's future economic development. Our analysis shows that China's ultimate recoverable coal reserves equal 223.6 x 10(9) MT, and its production will peak between 2025 and 2030, with peak production of approximately 3.9 x 10(9) MT. The extent to which China can import coal in the future is uncertain. With rising coal demand, this combination is likely to create a significant challenge to China's future economic development.

Foreign direct investment and intervention by local governments reduced carbon dioxide emissions, but urbanization significantly increased the emissions. Thus, industrial structural adjustment is an important component of the development of a low-carbon economy. In the context of industrial structural transformation, an effective way to reduce a region's carbon dioxide emissions is to promote the upgrading and optimization of industrial structure through technical progress. Tighter environmental access policies, selective utilization of foreign direct investment, and improvements in energy efficiency can help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Financial incentives are mainly focused on the introduction of specific technologies, rather than behavioural change. While the declared goal of financial support schemes very often is to save energy or reduce harmful emissions rather than to foster new technologies per se, it is often encountered that such financial support for energy efficient technologies may not ensure real energy savings due to the rebound effect and various market barriers. In the area of renewable energies it is common for financial support to be given to power producers for the verified production of renewable electricity, in the form of a guaranteed financial incentive (feed-in tariff). In the energy efficiency policy research little attention has been paid to the possible use of a feed-in tariff' in the form of a financial incentive based on the kWh saved by the end-user.

While there are many efforts in biological or biochemical fuels production, there are also ways to convert electrical energy to hydrocarbon and petrochemical intermediates that compliment an assortment of electrical energy storage and conversion pathways. An electrical replacement for hydrocarbons must have all of the desirable qualities of hydrocarbons without the environmental and energy security consequences. These qualities should include accessibility, low energy investment, reasonable energy density, portability, chemical versatility, and combustibility. To that end, a background on energy requirements for electrochemical pathways to petrochemical intermediates will be provided, followed by an analysis of the electrical infrastructure required to support large scale adoption.

Our empirical framework considers the arrival process of new bidders as well as the distribution of bidders' valuations of objects being auctioned. By observing the timing of bidder arrival, the model is identified even when the number of potential bidders is stochastic and unknown. The relevance of our approach is illustrated with an empirical application using a unique dataset of art auctions on eBay. Our results suggest a higher impact of sellers' reputation on bidders' valuations than previously reported in cross-sectional studies but the impact of reputation on bidder arrival is largely insignificant. Interestingly, a seller's reputation impacts not only the actions of the bidders but the actions of the seller as well. In particular, experience and a good reputation increase the probability of a seller posting items for sale on longer-lasting auctions, which we find increases the expected revenue for the seller.

An HEV LCPC model was established to evaluate HEV market prospects in China compared with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV). The Kluger HV, a full-hybrid HEV sports utility vehicle (SIN), aimed at the Chinese market, was simulated as the 2010 model's technology details were well publicized. The LCPC of the Kluger HV was roughly the same (about 1.06 times) as that of its comparable ICEV (Highlander SUV). This aligns with other compact and midsize HEV cars (e.g., Toyota Prius, Honda Civic and Toyota Camry HEV) in China. With oil prices predicted to rise in the long-term, the advantage of HEVs energy saving will partly compensate the high manufacturing costs associated with their additional motor/battery components. Besides supporting technology development, enabling policy should be implemented to introduce HEV technology into taxi fleets and business cars. This technology's cost-competitiveness, compared with traditional ICEVs, is advantageous for these higher mileage vehicles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to utilise this potential, effective policy measures need to be adopted to remove the existing barriers and create incentives. For that purpose, the cost effective energy saving options together with an optimal level of savings and expected environmental benefits have to be identified. The paper reports on a study that analyses these questions by including heat-saving measures in buildings into an energy system optimisation model of the Danish heat and power sector. The achieved optimal level of heat savings reaches 11% of projected heat demand in 2025 under the model assumptions. Moreover, the analysis reveals the importance of considering energy conservation options in a system wide perspective. Furthermore, the results suggest that changes in the energy generation sector are the prime driver behind the reduction of environmental externalities of energy. Heat savings in buildings play only a small role under model assumptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The most important factor behind the dieselization was probably the market entrance of a number of low-consuming models. Towards the end of the period a growing number of diesel models were able to meet the 120 g CO2 threshold applicable to environment cars that cannot use ethanol or biogas. This helped such models increase their share of the diesel car market from zero to 41 per cent. Dieselization appears to have had only a minor effect on annual distances driven. The higher average annual mileage of diesel cars is probably to a large extent a result of a self-selection bias. However, the Swedish diesel car fleet is young, and the direct rebound effect stemming from a lower variable driving cost may show up more clearly as the fleet gets older based on the assumption that second owners are more fuel price sensitive than first owners.

Policies that promote diesels like preferential fuel taxes, fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas emission standards can produce higher emissions of diesel particulate Matter if diesel particulate filters or equivalent emission control technology is not in place. This can undermine the expected climate benefits of dieselization and increase impacts on public health. This paper takes a historical look at Europe to illustrate the degree to which dieselization and lax controls on particulate matter can undermine the potential benefits sought from diesel vehicles. We show that countries on the dieselization pathway can fully capture the value of diesels with the adoption of tailpipe emission standards equivalent to Euro 6 or Tier 2 for passenger cars, and fuel quality standards that limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel to no greater than 15 ppm. Adoption of these policies before or in parallel with adoption of fuel consumption and greenhouse gas standards can avert the negative impacts of dieselization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is then of prime importance to know the cost of improving the quality for a distribution system operator. In this paper, we focus on one dimension of quality, the continuity of supply, and we estimated the cost of preventing power outages. For that, we make use of the parametric distance function approach, assuming that outages enter in the firm production set as an input, an imperfect substitute for maintenance activities and capital investment. This allows us to identify the sources of technical inefficiency and the underlying trade-off faced by operators between quality and other inputs and costs. For this purpose, we use panel data on 92 electricity distribution units operated by ERDF (Electricite de France - Reseau Distribution) in the 2003-2005 financial years. Assuming a multi-output multi-input translog technology, we estimate that the cost of preventing one interruption is equal to 10.7 for an average DSO.

The analysis concludes that Reflexiones is basically a translation-adaptation of a French work by the economist Jacques Accarias de Serionne that aims at promoting a shift on the economic policy of the Spanish Monarchy, either in the peninsula or in the colonial territories, in order to rationalize Public Finances, solving monetary distress caused by the coming to Spain of precious metals and transforming the old protectionist and industrialist policies inherited from Uztariz and Ulloa into a new strategy of economic growth based on the agrarian development and the free trade.

If the group does not meet its target, only the agents that meet their individual target are rewarded. This incentive scheme is applied in the UK Climate Change Agreements. There is only a difference in outcome between group and individual rewards if performance is stochastic. Group rewards lead to lower abatement than individual rewards if targets are realistic, i.e. if they have a high probability of being reached. Given the strictness of the targets, the agents prefer group rewards. The principal might want to use group rewards because they require less information, out of fairness concerns, or to combine strict targets with weak enforcement. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Under the risk-neutral measure, for example, this can be observed from variation across time in the shape of Black Scholes implied volatility smiles. This article investigates model characteristics that are consistent with variation in the shape of return distributions using a stochastic volatility model with a regime-switching feature to allow for random changes in the parameters governing volatility of volatility, leverage effect, and jump intensity. The analysis consists of two steps. First, the models are estimated using only information from observed returns and option-implied volatility. Standard model assessment tools indicate a strong preference in favor of the proposed models. Since the information from option-implied skewness and kurtosis is not used in fitting the models, it is available for diagnostic purposes. In the second step of the analysis, regressions of option-implied skewness and kurtosis on the filtered state variables (and some controls) suggest that the models have strong explanatory power for these characteristics.","[Durham, Garland] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Park, Yang-Ho] Fed Reserve Board, Risk Anal Sect, Washington, DC 20551 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Durham, G (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",garland.durham@colorado.edu; yang-ho.park@frb.gov,,"Park, Yang-Ho/0000-0002-5865-7123",,,,,35,10,10,2,25,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Conceptualizing the region in what sense relational?, Regional Studies. Recently, the question of how to conceptualize the region seems to have created a division in geographical scholarship between those propagating the primacy of a relational view, on the one hand, and those defending the relevance of a territorial view, on the other. This paper argues that two main factors have impeded a fruitful discussion, to the extent that even some points of convergence have been neglected. First, the two strands have drawn, sometimes implicitly, on incommensurable philosophical assumptions. Second, scholars in favour of a relational view have at times made statements that do not fit well (some of) their philosophical sources of inspiration. The paper suggests the task of conceptualization is readdressed by following consistently a discoursetheoretical relational ontology.","[Varro, Krisztina; Lagendijk, Arnoud] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Sch Management, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Varró, K (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Sch Management, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",k.varro@fm.ru.nl; a.lagendijk@ru.nl,,,,,,,44,51,52,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

How do groups mobilize to overcome the often formidable barriers highlighted in the existing literature? Drawing on original qualitative research of 100 community energy groups in Scotland, including six in-depth case studies, we explain how effective mobilization occurs and the political dynamics surrounding such mobilization. To capture these dynamics, we adapt theories offered by literature on social movements, with a particular focus on resource mobilization theories. Applying our adapted framework, we identify two particular sets of resources shaping community energy mobilization: (i) structural resources, which refer to the broad political context structuring and constraining opportunities for community energy mobilization; and (ii) symbolic resources-less tangible resources used to galvanise participants. We investigate to what extent our case study groups were able to draw upon and exploit these resources. We find that structural resources can either facilitate or hinder mobilization; what matters is how state resources are exploited and constraints mitigated. The use of symbolic resources was highly effective in aiding mobilization. Each of the groups examined - despite their considerable variation - effectively exploited symbolic resources such as shared identity or desire for strong, self reliant communities.

This paper selects 87 countries that are members of the World Energy Council from 2005 to 2007. The input variables are industry and population, while the output variances are gross domestic product (GDP) and the amount of fossil-fuel CO2 emissions. The result shows that countries' efficiency ranking among their own region presents more implied volatility. In view of the Technology Gap Ratio, Europe is the most efficient of any region, but during the same period, Asia has a lower efficiency than other regions. Finally, regions with higher industry (or GDP) might not have higher efficiency from 2005 to 2007. And higher CO2 emissions or population also might not mean lower efficiency for other regions. In addition, Brazil is not OECD member, but it is higher efficiency than other OECD members in emerging countries case. OECD countries are better efficiency than non-OECD countries and Europe is higher than Asia to control CO2 emissions.

Particular attention is given to how property values are affected by leak and cleanup activity at a LUST site, the severity of contamination, the presence of a primary exposure pathway (i.e., private groundwater wells), and publicity surrounding a LUST site.

Whilst the term gained widespread acceptance with the publication of the UK's Fuel Poverty Strategy in 2001, little is known about the origins of the term itself. This paper traces the earliest formulations of the concept, focusing particularly on the 10% needs to spend threshold which was adopted in 1991 and remains in place some 20 years later. This paper argues that understanding more about the origins of this threshold yields a more critical understanding of why fuel poverty targets in the UK have not been reached, and enables a more informed approach to setting realistic targets for the future. It also provides an opportunity to explore regional disparities in UK fuel poverty prevalence, highlighting the extent to which rigid adherence to a 10% threshold has created an unstable regional mosaic of over-estimation and under-estimation.

Using an unbalanced panel data of 70 electricity-generating firms. across 15 Organisations of Economic Co-operation and Development countries from 1990 to 2008, this paper empirically examines the impacts of entry liberalization (allowing third party access, establishing a wholesale market, and deregulating a retail market), vertical unbundling, privatization, and firm size on R&D investments. Entry liberalization is associated with a decline in R&D investment. Establishing a wholesale market exhibits the greatest negative effects on R&D investment. Regulated TPA and retail market deregulation also decrease R&D. The effect of privatization is not independently salient but interacts with a wholesale pool to lower R&D investments. Large firms spend more on R&D investment than small firms. Results indicate that the restructuring of the electricity industry reduces R&D investment, which may be detrimental to the reliability and the efficiency of the electricity system as well as to the creation and maintenance of the innovation capabilities necessary to address demand and environmental concerns.

In Pennsylvania, the Penn Security Fuels Initiative required 2% biodiesel (B2), effective on January 1, 2010, with higher blending levels required in the future if production thresholds are met. This study quantifies the environmental impacts of biodiesel blends to meet increasing regional biodiesel demand. A process life cycle model was developed using data collected from collaboration with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. For PennDOT, both in-state and out-of-state production scenarios were analyzed to estimate the possible environmental impacts of biodiesel blends. The results show that fertilizer usage in the agricultural phase, soy oil extraction and refining, feedstock and fuel transportation, and fuel combustion in the use phase are main contributors to biodiesel's life cycle environmental impacts for all blends. Comparing biodiesels with ultra low sulfur diesel, significant environmental tradeoffs exist between global warming potential and eutrophication. For Pennsylvania, an in-state farming and processing preference has the lowest environmental impacts for B5. However, the limited area of farmlands in Pennsylvania may not satisfy the state's biodiesel needs with higher blending levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides investing in additional 'conventional' assets (e.g. cables), grid operators can also invest in innovative 'smart solutions' like local storage capacities or voltage regulation appliances, which may be a more suitable way of integrating RES-E. This paper investigates the influence of incentive regulation on the investment decision of grid operators to integrate RES-E. We describe the technical and regulatory background, explain the advantages of 'smart solutions' and present an approach for comparing investment scenarios. As an example, we calculate the profitability of investments in a case study of the German electricity market. We apply Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to show the influence of the investment alternatives on grid operator efficiency objectives. We demonstrate that under current 'standard' incentive regulation, the grid operators gain profitability by avoiding investments and - if they are forced to invest - by not implementing 'smart solutions'. The results highlight the need to consider innovation in the regulation design. Further research should investigate specific instruments that can be used to account for innovation. Our brief discussion of such instruments provides a starting point. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this post-hoc analysis, we characterize the energy burden of North American emergency medical services (EMS) agencies and estimate the potential marginal damage costs arising from their emissions as an example of how and why health services matter in environmental and energy policy, and how and why environmental and energy policy matter to health services. We demonstrate EMS systems are energy intensive, and that vehicle fuels represent 80% of their energy burden while electricity and natural gas represent 20%. We also demonstrate that emissions from EMS operations represent only a small fraction of estimated health sector emissions, but for EMS systems in the United States the associated marginal damage costs are likely between $2.7 million and $9.7 million annually. Significant changes in the supply or price of energy, including changes that arise from environmental and energy policy initiatives designed to constrain fossil fuel consumption, could potentially affect EMS agencies and other health services.

First, it extends the spatial Durbin model to panel data allowing for non-spherical disturbances and proposes two alternative estimators based on ML techniques. While one of the estimators exhibits more degrees of freedom, the other is computationally less burdensome. Results from a Monte Carlo study reveal that both estimators have satisfactory small sample properties also in cases when the error structure is in effect spherical.

This paper proposes a holistic method (HMEEB) for assessing and certifying energy efficiency of buildings based on the D-S (Dempster-Shafer) theory of evidence and the Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach. HMEEB has three main features: (i) it provides both a method to assess and certify building energy efficiency, and exists as an analytical tool to identify improvement opportunities; (ii) it combines a wealth of information on building energy efficiency assessment, including identification of indicators and a weighting mechanism; and (iii) it provides a method to identify and deal with inherent uncertainties within the assessment procedure. This paper demonstrates the robustness, flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, using two examples to assess the energy efficiency of two residential buildings, both located in the 'Hot Summer and Cold Winter' zone in China. The proposed certification method provides detailed recommendations for policymakers in the context of carbon emission reduction targets and promoting energy efficiency in the built environment. The method is transferable to other countries and regions, using an indicator weighting system to modify local climatic, economic and social factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop transition scenarios for meeting this goal in California's transportation sector, with focus on light-duty vehicles (LDVs). We explore four questions: (1) what options are available to reduce transportation sector GHG emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050; (2) how rapidly would transitions in LDV markets, fuels, and travel behaviors need to occur over the next 40 years; (3) how do intermediate policy goals relate to different transition pathways; (4) how would rates of technological change and market adoption between 2010 and 2050 impact cumulative GHG emissions? We develop four LW transition scenarios to meet the 80in50 target through a combination of travel demand reduction, fuel economy improvements, and low-carbon fuel supply, subject to restrictions on trajectories of technological change, potential market adoption of new vehicles and fuels, and resource availability. These scenarios exhibit several common themes: electrification of LDVs, rapid improvements in vehicle efficiency, and future fuels with less than half the carbon intensity of current gasoline and diesel. Availability of low-carbon biofuels and the level of travel demand reduction are swing factors that influence the degree of LDV electrification required. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Urban planners and policy makers have been proposing telecommuting as part of travel demand management (TDM) programs to reduce congestion. Based on small samples, several empirical studies have found that telecommuting has a substitution effect (although small) on commute travel, and have thus argued that policies promoting telecommuting might be promising in reducing travel. Using data from the 2001 and 2009 National Household Travel Surveys (NHTS), this study involves two large national samples to try to more accurately identify the impact of telecommuting on workers' travel patterns. Through a series of empirical tests, this research investigates how telecommuting influences workers' one-way commute trips, daily total work trips, and daily non-work trips, and tries to provide some answers to a question that has been discussed for some years-namely, whether telecommuting and personal travel are complements or substitutes. The results of these tests suggest that telecommuting has been an important factor in shaping personal travel patterns over the 2001-2009 period, and that telecommuting indeed has a complementary effect on not just workers' one-way commute trips, but also their daily total work trips, and total non-work trips.","[Zhu, Pengyu] Boise State Univ, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, Community & Reg Planning Program, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Zhu, Pengyu] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Pengyu] Univ So Calif, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, Los Angeles, CA USA",Idaho; Boise State University; Zhejiang University; University of Southern California,"Zhu, PY (通讯作者)，Boise State Univ, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, Community & Reg Planning Program, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA.",pengyuzhu@boisestate.edu,,"Zhu, Pengyu/0000-0002-0892-3606",,,,,40,97,108,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Electricity generated by fossil fuels is responsible for almost half of the country's emissions. Keeping with the Kyoto Protocol, the UAE decided to integrate nuclear energy into the electricity scheme to mitigate CO2 emissions as declared by the government (Embassy-of-UAE, 2009; ENEC, 2010b). This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the UAE's proposed nuclear energy strategy in mitigating CO2 emissions from the built environment up to year 2050. The IAEA's simulation model MESSAGE is used to estimate the energy demand and CO2 emissions in the UAE up to year 2050. Several energy supply/fuels scenarios are modeled and simulated including the following: Business as Usual (BaU), the UAE proposed nuclear strategy (APR1400) as well as 12 more aggressive Clean Energy Era (CEE) proposed scenarios. Nuclear energy, especially in its extreme CEE scenario (8NPPs), was found to be more practical option in mitigating CO2 than renewable energy and carbon capture and sequestration among the simulated scenarios. Nuclear energy also demonstrated an economic viability. The cost of electricity produced from nuclear energy was calculated to be 3.2 cents/kWh, significantly less than the current cost of 8.15 cents/kWh for electricity generation from fossil fuels in the UAE.

A system dynamics model is developed to estimate the energy requirements to move water from the water source to the distribution laterals of the Las Vegas Valley and to analyze the carbon footprint associated with it. The results show that at present nearly 0.85 million megawatt hours per year (MWh/y) energy is required for conveyance of water in distribution laterals of the Valley from Lake Mead resulting in approximately 0.53 million metric tons of CO2 emissions per year. Considering the current mix of fuel source, the energy and CO2 emissions will increase to 1.34 million MWh/y and 0.84 million metric tons per year, respectively, by the year 2035.

The spillover effects are understood here as positive externalities of publicly funded R&D, demonstration and deployment (RDDD) activities that may be revealed at the companies' level in the form of newly created knowledge stock; development of innovative products/processes with broader market applications; strengthening of R&D, manufacturing and marketing capabilities; etc. An integrated compound real options model is proposed that allows to estimate the strategic net social present value of fusion RDDD programme taking into account the different types of spillover benefits along with the hidden real options value arising due to uncertainty and managerial flexibility. It was found that the value of spillover effects, modelled as expansion option, could represent a significant proportion of the overall socio-economic value of fusion RDDD programme (nearly 20%). This paper clearly demonstrates that, besides a high-level mission to assure sustainable energy supply, fusion RDDD programme may yield substantial net socio-economic benefits that may be at least two times higher compared to the expected RD&D costs, and hence the pursuit of even more ambitious programme is economically justified.

To economists this should be no surprise yet it seems that the role of fuel taxation as an instrument of climate policy has not been fully appreciated. It is however one of the few policy instruments that, since several decades, has actually reduced fuel consumption appreciably. Thanks to taxation (mainly in Europe and Japan), carbon emissions are considerably lower than they would have been otherwise. In future where carbon emissions are to be cut drastically, this instrument will be crucial. There is however much opposition to the instrument. This opposition uses various arguments, for instance that fuel taxes hurt the poor since they are strongly regressive. We however find that the choice of country and methodology turns out to be of great consequence. We study seven European countries-France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Serbia, Spain and Sweden and do find some evidence of regressivity but the evidence is very weak. It does not apply when lifetime income is used and it does not apply to the poorest country in the group. The best one-line summary is probably that the tax is approximately proportional.

A careful evaluation, however, reveals challenges to market development that should be addressed in order to make the rollout of a post-2012 CDM more effective. We conducted firm-level interviews covering 82 CDM plants in the sugar and cement sectors in Brazil and India, focusing on how individual managers understood the potential benefits and risks of undertaking clean development mechanism (CDM) investments. Our results indicate that the CDM operates in a far more complex way in practice than that of simply adding a marginal increment to a project's internal rate of return. Our results indicate the following: first, although anticipated revenue played a central role in most managers' decisions to pursue CDM investments, there was no standard practice to account for financial benefits of CDM investments; second, some managers identified non-financial reputational factors as their primary motivation for pursuing CDM projects; and third, under fluctuating regulatory regimes with real immediate costs and uncertain CDM revenue, managers favored projects that often did not require carbon revenue to be viable. The post-2012 CDM architecture can benefit from incorporating these insights, and in particular reassess goals for strict additionality and mechanisms for achieving it. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

South Korea, as one of the largest consumers of energy, is no exception and has shown its determination to pursue green growth in the future. In order to do so, South Korea plans to substitute fossil fuel with alternative sources in electricity generation. However, the key constraint to green growth is the high cost faced by renewable electricity generation. Fortunately, nuclear energy can serve as an economic alternative to fossil fuel. To achieve CO2 emission reduction and faster economic growth, it is wise to analyze prospects of alternatives using experience curve framework. The results and industry background are consistent for nuclear technology, and the results suggest that nuclear should serve as the main substitute. Consideration of policy risk inherent in renewable also strengthens the argument. Renewable technologies, on the other hand, showed overstated learning capacity that is partially inconsistent with technological background. Nevertheless, the renewable (photovoltaic and fuel cell(2)) should help nuclear marginally in substituting fossil fuel in South Korea's Electricity Generation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This article identified major factors affecting the growth of China's coal industry, immediate targets, economic policies, as well as structural reforms of the sector. Authors have divided its developing process into three stages: rapid growth of coal industry (1979-1992); close-down of small-scale coal mines (SCMs) (1993-2001); resource consolidation (2002-present). At the first stage, led by the 'two-leg walking' strategy, SCMs grew significantly, which eased the pressure of energy shortage. From the transition of planned economy to market economy, major state-owned coal mines (MSCs), which were not consistently profitable, would have to learn how to withstand severe competitions and survive. As a result, the central government took several measures to try to keep them alive. This situation was not changed until 2001. Large-scaled coal mine groups were then established by the government when China entered the WTO. MSCs were encouraged to merge with others to form a certain scale, as a way to compete with giant overseas. So a trial was firstly implemented in Shanxi province.

Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (JESSICA), one of the financial engineering instruments (FEI) within European Union cohesion policy framework in the 2007-13 period, created scope for developing cooperation between sub-national authorities and financial institutions and private investors. Anchored in the literature on multilevel governance, this paper examines how the implementation of this instrument has affected the patterns of sub-national governance in Poland and Spain. Despite stimulating learning processes and the emergence of unprecedented cross-sectoral partnerships, the implementation was hampered by numerous obstacles, underlining the limitations of multilevel governance and of FEI as tools for promoting urban development.","Univ Vienna, Inst European Integrat Res, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Dabrowski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Inst European Integrat Res, Strohgasse 45 DG, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",m.m.dabrowski@tudelft.nl,,"Dabrowski, Marcin/0000-0001-6775-0664",,,,,44,11,11,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This article attempts to identify the conditions for making the coming years of the EU ETS a success. It draws historical lessons from the eight years the scheme has been in operation, and then presents the various interventions by the public authorities currently under discussion in order to revive the market. Finally, the article proposes to draw lessons from monetary policy by outlining what might be the mandate of an Independent Carbon Market Authority, with responsibility for the dynamic management of the supply of allowances, and whose main mission would be to ensure the optimal linkage between the different temporal horizons of the climate strategy.

We quantify the effectiveness of energy service demand reduction in the building, transport, and industry sectors using the Asia-Pacific Integrated Assessment/Computable General Equilibrium (A1M/CGE) model for the period 2015-2050 under various scenarios. There were two major findings. First, a 25% energy service demand reduction in the building, transport, and basic material industry sectors would reduce the GDP loss induced by climate mitigation from 4.0% to 3.0% and from 1.2% to 0.7% in 2050 under the 450 ppm and 550 ppm CO2 equivalent concentration stabilization scenarios, respectively. Second, the effectiveness of a reduction in the building sector's energy service demand would be higher than those of the other sectors at the same rate of the energy service demand reduction. Furthermore, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis of different socioeconomic conditions, and the climate mitigation target was found to be a key determinant of the effectiveness of energy service demand reduction measures. Therefore, more certain climate mitigation targets would be useful for the decision makers who design energy service demand reduction measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we explore the social acceptability of forest-based biorefineries in Maine using random utility modeling to identify how project attributes and citizen characteristics interact to affect level of support. Using a statewide sample (Statewide) and a subsample of mill towns (Mill Towns), we found that: (1) in both samples, individual characteristics had similar coefficients and significance levels except for pro-environment attitudes; (2) the coefficients related to the industry's negative attributes were notably different between the two samples, while positive attributes were not; (3) in both samples, positive industry attributes such as producing products from a sustainable resource and increased economic development were the most influential variables in determining the level of support for a new biorefinery in an individual's community; and (4) in general, Mill Town respondents were more accepting of potential negative attributes such as increased levels of truck traffic, odor, noise, and air and water pollution.

This paper focuses on dynamic counterfactual predictions and impulse-response functions derived from appropriate econometric models. These provide insight regarding the question of whether responses to economic shocks are transitory or whether they have a permanent effect. Analysis shows that output shocks have had permanent effects on productivity so that economies have tended not to return to the pre-shock path but rather adjust to new levels. This suggests that the current recession will be embodied permanently within the memory of some of Europe's leading economies as a hysteretic effect.","[Doran, Justin] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland; [Doran, Justin; Fingleton, Bernard] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University College Cork; University of Cambridge,"Doran, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland.",justin.doran@ucc.ie; bf100@cam.ac.uk,"Fingleton, Bernard/GZA-5738-2022","Fingleton, Bernard/0000-0001-7359-643X; Doran, Justin/0000-0002-9875-901X",,,,,36,12,13,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

This effect causes countries that are otherwise identical to follow very different emissions paths as they grow, due only to differences in the positions they occupy along the growth path. Emissions from a country of any given income depend on when it reaches that income level relative to other countries moving along the same income growth path. This variation across countries arises whenever the damage function is strictly convex in the level of global emissions. In such a setting, the emissions level for a country at any point in time depends on the level of emissions from all other countries at that time. This means that a country of given income will behave differently depending on whether other countries have high emissions (at the peak of their emissions paths) or low emissions (at the early or late stages of their emissions paths). The behavior of any individual country, at any point in time, therefore depends on its relative position in the global income distribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Mitigation will require a concerted effort to change household energy behaviour electricity use, transportation and food consumption patterns. A first step to changing behaviour is to better understand current behaviour and its intrapersonal (knowledge and attitudes), interpersonal (norms, communication and behaviour) and contextual (demographics and geography) correlates. To date, our understanding of the energy behaviours of children is limited. To begin to fill this gap, we report the results of a survey on the electricity, transportation and food-related energy behaviours of 323 fourth- and fifth-grade girls and their parents in 31 Girl Scout troops in Northern California. Our findings show positive attitudes and perceived norms toward energy-saving behaviours among child and adult respondents, but low or moderate levels of knowledge, communication, and behaviour, particularly for behaviours that require adult assistance. Girls' choices about electricity behaviours appear to be governed by intrapersonal and interpersonal influences, while transportation behaviour is constrained by geographic context. Food-related behaviour, particularly meat consumption, was not readily modelled. Policy and education-related implications for future interventions aimed at enhancing children's energy-saving behaviours are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

VAR and Granger-causality methods are used to analyze causal interfaces, whereas the volatility of electricity prices is studied with basic and asymmetric AR-GARCH models. Among the main results, the marginal rate at which carbon prices feed into electricity prices is shown to be ca. 135% in the EEX and Nord Pool markets, where electricity and carbon prices display bidirectional causality, and 109% in the UK. Therefore, generators in these markets internalized the cost of freely allotted emission allowances into their electricity prices considerably more than the proportionate increase in costs justified by effective carbon intensity. Moreover, electricity prices in France are found to Granger-cause the carbon price. This study also shows how European electricity prices are deeply linked to coal prices among other factors, both in terms of levels and volatility, regardless of the underlying fuel mix, and that coal was marginally more profitable than gas for electricity generation. EU policies aimed at increasing the carbon price are likely to be crucial in limiting the externalities involved in the transition to a low-carbon system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, we propose a new empirical methodology allowing a time-varying dynamic correlation measure between the stock market index and the oil price series. We use the frequency approach proposed by Priestley and Tong (1973), that is the evolutionary co-spectral analysis. This method allows us to distinguish between short-run and medium-run dependence.

This index is an alternative tool to capture the diverse characteristics of the electricity industry in order to analyze performance after deregulation. Using the competitiveness index, we analyze the effect of regulation change in specific economic environments represented by the level of economic development, energy intensity, and manufacturing share, for example. According to the results, deregulation generally increases competitiveness, but the effect depends on the economic environment and the type of regulation. Deregulating entry and vertical integration to increase competitiveness is more effective in countries where the level of economic development, energy intensity, and manufacturing share are low.

LEAP has been used to forecast electricity demand for the target year 2030, for the state of Maharashtra (India). Holt's exponential smoothing method has been used to arrive at suitable growth rates. Probable projections have been generated using uniform gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate and different values of elasticity of demands. Three scenarios have been generated which include Business as Usual (BAU), Energy Conservation (EC) and Renewable Energy (REN). Subsequent analysis on the basis of energy, environmental influence and cost has been done. In the target year 2030, the projected electricity demand for BAU and REN has increased by 107.3 per cent over the base year 2012 and EC electricity demand has grown by 543 per cent. The estimated values of green house gas (GHG) for BAU and EC, in the year 2030, are 245.2 per cent and 152.4 per cent more than the base year and for REN it is 46.2 per cent less.

After taking into consideration the data of every sector of the national economy in Sino-USA trade, energy embodied in the import and export trade between China and America was calculated to verify the real energy flows in Sino-USA trade. The research results suggest the following: China is the net exporter of embodied energy in Sino-USA trade, and coal, crude oil and natural gas are the major components. In 1997-2011, the net exports of China's embodied energy totaled 1523,082,200 t of standard coal, the amount of China's energy consumption increased by 895,527,900 t of standard coal, and America's energy consumption decreased by 11,871,200 t of standard coal as a result of Sino-USA trade.

The upper-level problem corresponds to the PM, whereas the lower-level decisions are made by GENCOs. We consider that some GENCOs are green energy producers, while others are black energy producers. Policy makers incentivize green energy producers to generate energy through the payment of optimal time-varying subsidy price. The policy maker's main objective is to maximize an overall social welfare that includes factors such as demand surplus, energy cost, renewable energy subsidy price, and environmental standards. The lower-level problem corresponding to the GENCOs is based on maximizing the players' profits. The proposed QFIT policy differs from the FIT policy in the sense that the subsidy price-based contracts offered to green energy producers dynamically change over time, depending on the physical properties of the grid, demand, and energy price fluctuations. The integrated problem solves for time-varying subsidy price and equilibrium energy quantities that optimize the system welfare under different grid and system conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper derives and analyzes dynamically consistent extraction equilibria in a two-period discrete-time Truly Stackelberg (TS) model of non-renewable resource extraction, where firms move sequentially within each period and where both the leader and follower have market power. We show how the leader may be able to manipulate extraction patterns by exploiting resource constraints. Whether the leader wants to speed up its own production relative to the Coumot-Nash (CN) equilibrium depends on the shape of its iso-profit curve, which is affected by the two firms' relative stock endowments and relative production costs.

Since 2009 technology banding has been added, meaning that different technologies are rewarded with a different number of certificates. We analyze these two different renewable obligation policies in a mathematical representation of an electricity market with random availabilities of renewable generation outputs and random electricity demand. We also present another, alternative, banding policy. We provide revenue adequate pricing schemes for the three obligation policies. We carry out a simulation study via sampling. A key finding is that the UK banding policy cannot guarantee that the original obligation target is met, hence potentially resulting in more pollution. Our alternative provides a way to make sure that the target is met while supporting less established technologies, but it comes with a significantly higher consumer price. Furthermore, as an undesirable side effect, we observe that a cost reduction in a technology with a high banding (namely offshore wind) leads to more CO2 emissions under the UK banding policy and to higher consumer prices under the alternative banding policy.

This paper provides insights to the origins of public opposition that can impede the adoption of low-carbon technologies by investigating how perceptions are shaped by local economic interests and individual cultural worldviews. The research considers both carbon capture and storage and wind energy technologies because they differ in maturity, economic impact and resource base. Further, for each technology, the research examines support for two types of policies: deployment in local community and public funding for research and development. Results indicate the influence of economic interests and cultural worldviews is policy specific. Individual cultural worldviews do not affect support for the deployment of technology, but they do significantly influence a person's support for publicly funded research and development. Conversely, local economic interests have a significant role in determining support for deployment, while they do not affect support for research and development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A one-cent increase in the neighbors' cigarette tax rate implies a contemporaneous cigarette tax increase of around 0.24 cents. However, identifying the source of interaction is key to its normative assessment. Our empirical analysis-spanning the period 1992-2006-finds that cigarette tax interdependence is politically driven: only states with non-term-limited governors react (providing evidence of yardstick competition), basically as the election year approaches. We also show this political motivation is in accordance with List and Sturm's (Q J Econ 121:1249-1281, 2006) hypothesis of single-issue voters: politicians tend to favor smokers when they are non-term limited, being this effect counteracted when they are term limited.","[Esteller-More, Alejandro] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Esteller-More, Alejandro] IEB, Barcelona, Spain; [Rizzo, Leonzio] Univ Ferrara, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Rizzo, Leonzio] IEB, Ferrara, Italy",University of Barcelona; University of Ferrara,"Esteller-Moré, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",aesteller@ub.edu; leonzio.rizzo@unife.it,,"Rizzo, Leonzio/0000-0001-8099-8699",,,,,41,9,9,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, little attention has been paid to investigate them jointly, which can not only prevent fall of energy services cost and thereby rebound effect but reduce the associated macroeconomic costs. This study thus employs a 20 sector CGE model to explore separately the impacts of carbon tax and its coordinated implementation with energy efficiency improvement on the Pakistan economy. The country underwent enormous pressure of energy security issues as well as climate change fallouts in the last couple of years and can be regarded as a suitable candidate for energy/environmental conservation policies to be considered at a broader context with more concrete efforts. The simulation results show that the impact of carbon tax on GDP is negative but resulting reductions in pollutant emissions are relatively high. Moreover, the GDP is expected to grow comparatively positive when analyzed with improvements in energy efficiency, with even higher decline in energy consumption demand and so emissions. This simultaneous economic and environmental improvement would thus have positive implications regarding sustainable development of the country. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study, carried out at three different altitudes of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWLS), explored forest resource-use patterns to understand rural peoples' dependency on the adjacent forests. A total of six forests were selected and the seven dependent villages were surveyed for the study of forest resource use patterns in relation to their socioeconomic status. Average fuelwood and fodder consumption were found to be 2.42 kg/capita/day and 43.96 kg/household/day respectively which was higher than the earlier reported values. Average fuelwood consumption by temporary dhaba (roadside refreshment establishments) owners (52.5 kg/dhaba/day) is much higher than the permanent villagers. Average cultivated land per family was less than 1 ha (0.56 ha). Inaccessibility of the area and deprived socio-economic status of the locals are largely responsible for the total dependency of the local inhabitants on nearby forests for fuelwood, fodder and other life supporting demands. Extensive farming of fuelwood trees on less used, barren land and establishment of fodder banks could be the alternative to bridge the gap between the demand and supply. Active participation of local people is mandatory for the conservation of these forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Malik, Zubair A.; Bhatt, A.

Consequently, agricultural energy and agrochemical inputs have been significantly increased to improve food security and to increase the income of farmers in the regions where the GFGP was implemented. In analysis of the sustainability of the agricultural system affected by the GFGP, it is essential to consider both economic profitability and environmental sustainability. Using Yanchi County as a case study area, this study used an emergy synthesis to examine the sustainability of the agricultural system before and after the GFGP in Northwest China. We found that the total emergy input and energy output of the agricultural system in the study area increased from 1991 to 2008; however, the sustainability of the system declined, and this decline was especially evident after the GFGP was launched in 2001. Increasing inputs of non-renewable purchased resources will not only reduce the effectiveness of the GFGP in Northwest China, but also hinder the implementation of the energy-saving and emission-reduction policy that China launched in 2005. We suggest that sustainable agricultural development in Northwest China should be based on effective use of renewable resources and development of a low-carbon agricultural economy.

However, decision makers are understandably reluctant to act in the absence of solid data and results supporting a policy position. This paper proposes a methodology to measure the energy efficiency of farms based on the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. In a manner similar to the cost framework, we decompose energy efficiency measurements into technical and allocative efficiencies in energy contents of inputs. In this study, we replace input prices used in traditional economic efficiency measurements by their energy content. We use the energy efficiency model to explore the optimal input-mix that produces the current outputs at minimum energy-consumption. We demonstrate that this decomposition can help policy makers design accurate energy policies. However, the uncertainty of the data and, more particularly, the energy content of the inputs leads us to recommend using the methodologies to calculate the bounds of efficiency to obtain more plausible and robust results.

This would be the result of an ever increasing importance of exploitation of scale economies. However, since that time, small-scale self-employment rates have increased in many industrialized countries. This raises the question to what extent scale economies are still important in modern economies. Using data for 23 OECD countries over the period 1972-2008, we test the importance of scale economies in determining average firm size as proxied by the employment to self-employment ratio. We control for several other determinants of firm size, including the rate of urbanization. We also allow the relation to differ across levels of economic development. Our results suggest that notwithstanding the rise of small-scale self-employment observed in many countries over the last few decades, economies of scale and scope continue to play an important role in advanced economies.","[Congregado, Emilio; Golpe, Antonio A.] Univ Huelva, Huelva, Spain; [van Stel, Andre] Panteia EIM, Zoetermeer, Netherlands",Universidad de Huelva,"Congregado, E (通讯作者)，Univ Huelva, Huelva, Spain.",congregado@uhu.es; a.van.stel@panteia.nl,"Congregado, Emilio/H-8465-2012; Golpe, Antonio/F-6995-2016; Congregado, Emilio/AAE-2138-2019","Golpe, Antonio/0000-0003-0360-1541; Congregado, Emilio/0000-0001-7409-0799; Van Stel, Andre/0000-0003-4512-654X",,,,,76,2,3,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, these resources have alternative uses and their accessibility is limited, which tends to decrease their competitiveness with respect to other forms of energy. Hence, the key question of woody biomass use for energy is not the amount of resources, but rather their price. In this study we consider the question from the perspective of energy wood supply curves, which display the available amount of woody biomass for large-scale energy production at various hypothetical energy wood prices. These curves are estimated by the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), which is a global partial equilibrium model of forest and agricultural sectors. The global energy wood supply is estimated to be 0-23 Gm(3)/year (0-165 EJ/year) when energy wood prices vary in a range of 0-30$/GJ (0-216$/m(3)). If we add household fuelwood to energy wood, then woody biomass could satisfy 2-18% of world primary energy consumption in 2050. If primary forests are excluded from wood supply then the potential decreases up to 25%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Scenarios like Desertec, which partially rely on solar power imports from the Middle East and North Africa, may be attractive for decarbonisation, but raise concerns about terrorists interrupting supply by attacking the long, unprotected transmission lines in the Sahara. In this paper, I develop new methods and assess the European vulnerability to terrorist attacks in the Desertec scenario. I compare this to the vulnerability of today's system and a decarbonisation scenario in which Europe relies on gas imports for electricity generation. I show that the vulnerability of both gas and electricity imports is low, but electricity imports are more vulnerable than gas imports, due to their technical characteristics. Gas outages (and, potentially, resulting blackouts) are the very unlikely consequence even of very high-number attacks against the gas import system, whereas short blackouts are the, potential consequence of a few attacks against the import electricity lines. As the impacts of all except extreme attacks are limited, terrorists cannot attack energy infrastructure and cause spectacular, fear-creating outages. Both gas and electricity import infrastructure are thus unattractive and unlikely terrorist targets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Pantelleria, situated between Sicily and Africa, owns a large potential in terms of renewable energy resources, although there are some obstacles in turning it into a Near Zero Energy system. Starting from a deep energy system audit, the study proposes the project for a near zero energy island, through the efficient transformation of the different existing natural energy resources into electrical energy and heat: the solar, the wind-based and the geothermal systems. In this way, the island can be turned into an almost autonomous system. The main difficulties connected to the implementation of the project can be identified in the national energy policies as well as in the specific local situation, characterized by a strong private monopole on generation and distribution of electrical energy which has no incentive for supporting the costs connected to the energy requalification of the island. On the other hand, the local administrations, involved in the project through bottom-up European policies, do not have the cultural and economic tools to go on with the implementation.

The economy has a fixed number of regions, and there are a production sector and a public sector in a region. The production sector provides goods in perfectly competitive markets. The public sector, which is financed by the regional government's tax incomes, supplies regional public goods. The public goods affect both firms and households. We show the existence of a unique equilibrium in the dynamic system. We simulate the equilibrium of 3-region economy and examine effects of changes in some parameters on the spatial economy. The comparative statics analysis provides some important insights. For instance, as the technologically least advanced region (TLAR) improves its productivity or amenity, the national output and wealth are reduced, and more people are attracted to the region from the more productive regions. The labor forces in the TLAR's two sectors are increased, and the labor forces in the other two regions are reduced. The change pattern for the capital distribution is similar to the change in the population distribution. The output levels of the two sectors in the TLAR are increased and in the other two regions are reduced. The TLAR's total and per capita expenditures on public goods are increased; the other two regions' total and per capita expenditures are reduced. The per-worker output level, wealth and consumption level per capita, wage rate in the TLAR are increased, and those variables in the other two regions are reduced. The lot size falls and the land rent rises in the TLAR, and the trends are opposite in the other two regions.","Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, Beppu, Oita 8748577, Japan",Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University,"Zhang, WB (通讯作者)，Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific Univ, 1-1 Jumonjibaru, Beppu, Oita 8748577, Japan.",wbz1@apu.ac.jp,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Furthermore, this study applies Grey forecasting model to forecast precipitation in different provinces, and then sets up different scenarios for precipitation based on the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios and results from PRECIS (Providing Regional Climate projections for Impacts Studies) model. The most important result found in this research is the increasing hydropower vulnerability of the poorest regions and the main hydropower generation provinces of China to climate change. Other main empirical results reveal that the impacts of climate change on the supply of hydropower generation in China will be noteworthy for the society. Different scenarios have different effects on hydropower generation, of which A2 scenario (pessimistic, high emission) has the largest. Meanwhile, the impacts of climate change on hydropower generation of every province are distinctly different, of which the Southwest part has the higher vulnerability than the average level while the central part lower.
