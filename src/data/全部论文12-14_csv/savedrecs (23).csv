This paper sets up a model where national and multinational firms choose tax-efficient financial structures and countries compete for multinational firms through statutory tax rates and thin capitalization rules that limit the tax-deductibility of internal debt flows. In a symmetric tax competition equilibrium, each country chooses inefficiently low tax rates and inefficiently lax thin capitalization rules. We show that a coordinated tightening of thin capitalization rules benefits both countries, even though it intensifies competition via tax rates. When countries differ in size, the smaller country not only chooses the lower tax rate but also the more lenient thin capitalization rule.

For example, such models arise when treatment is not randomly assigned and outcomes are binary. The estimators we compare are the two-stage least squares linear probability model, maximum likelihood estimation, control function estimators, and special regressor methods. We specifically focus on models and associated estimators that are easy to implement. Also, for calculating choice probabilities and regressor marginal effects, we propose the average index function (AIF), which, unlike the average structural function (ASF), is always easy to estimate.","[Lewbel, Arthur; Yang, Thomas Tao] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Dong, Yingying] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA",Boston College; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Lewbel, A (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",lewbel@bc.edu,,"Lewbel, Arthur/0000-0003-3864-2618; Yang, Thomas Tao/0000-0001-8908-7736",,,,,34,109,129,2,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Small rich economies face significant policy challenges due to proportionately greater economic volatility than larger economies. These economies usually choose some form of fixed exchange rate regime, particularly in the very small economies where the per capita cost of independent monetary policy is relatively high. When such countries do choose a free or managed floating regime, they appear to derive no benefit from those regimes; their exchange rate volatility seems to rise without any significant change in fundamental economic volatility.

Moreover, prices respond more rapidly to cost increases than to cost decreases. We develop a search theoretic model which is consistent with this evidence and allows for additional testable predictions. Our results are based on the assumption that buyers do not observe the sellers' costs, but know that cost changes are positively correlated across sellers. In equilibrium, a change in price is likely to induce consumer search, which explains sticky prices. Moreover, the signal conveyed by a price decrease is different from the signal conveyed by a price increase, which explains asymmetry in price adjustment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The quality is known to all the firms, but only to some buyers. The quantity-setting firms can manipulate the price to signal quality. Because there is only one price in a market for a homogeneous good, each firm incompletely controls the price-signal through the quantity decision. We characterize the unique signaling Cournot equilibrium in which the price signals quality to the uninformed buyers. We then compare the signaling Cournot equilibrium with the full-information Cournot equilibrium. Signaling is shown to increase the equilibrium price. Moreover, under certain conditions regarding the composition of buyers, the number of firms, and the distribution of costs across firms, the effects of signaling and market externality cancel each other. In other words, the profits under signaling Cournot equal the profits of a cartel in a full-information environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from the 2008-09 global financial crisis,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Crisis; Early warning; Emerging markets; Leading indicators; Reserves; 2008,CURRENCY CRISES; CONSEQUENCES; INSTABILITY,"We investigate whether leading indicators can help explain the cross-country incidence of the 2008-09 financial crisis. Rather than looking for indicators with specific relevance to the recent crisis, the selection of variables is driven by an extensive review of more than eighty papers from the previous literature on early warning indicators. Our motivation is to address suspicions that indicators found to be useful predictors in one round of crises are typically not useful to predict the next round. The review suggests that central bank reserves and past movements in the real exchange rate were the two leading indicators that had proven the most useful in explaining crisis incidence across different countries and episodes in the past. For the 2008-09 crisis, we use six different variables to measure crisis incidence: drops in GDP and industrial production, currency depreciation, stock market performance, reserve losses, and participation in an IMF program. We find that the level of reserves in 2007 appears as a consistent and statistically significant leading indicator of who got hit by the 2008-09 crisis, in line with the conclusions of the pre-2008 literature. In addition to reserves, recent real appreciation is a statistically significant predictor of devaluation and of a measure of exchange market pressure during the current crisis. We define the period of the global financial shock as running from late 2008 to early 2009, which probably explains why we find stronger results than earlier papers such as Obstfeld et al. (2009, 2010) and Rose and Spiegel (2009a,b, 2010, 2011) which use annual data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the managerial performance efficiency of 367 manufacture firms in Taiwan utilizing the two-stage data envelopment analysis technique. The empirical results indicate that the scale of the firms does play an important role in influencing the operating efficiency. One can increase the firm's performance by consolidating with other smaller units to achieve the optimal size. By employing a profitability/marketability matrix, this study better characterizes the operating performance of the firms.

This new estimation method is suggested since the mean squared error (MSE) of the commonly used maximum likelihood (ML) method becomes inflated when the explanatory variables of the regression model are highly correlated. Using MSE, the optimal value of the shrinkage parameter is derived and some methods of estimating it are proposed. It is shown by means of Monte Carlo simulations that the estimated MSE and mean absolute error (MAE) are lower for the proposed Liu estimator than those of the ML in the presence of multicollinearity. Finally the benefit of the Lie estimator is shown in an empirical application where different economic factors are used to explain the probability that municipalities have net increase of inhabitants.

We present a new labor discipline model incorporating Veblen effects in which hours are determined by employers and subject to complete contracts but employee work effort is not. We show that while Veblen effects increase the hours sought by employees, the hours selected by profit-maximizing employers may exceed that preferred by employees, who may then seek to reduce work hours by means of collective bargaining or governmental intervention. We also identify conditions under which employees will prefer longer hours than offered by employers. Using newly available data on top income shares, and on work hours from 10 major industrial economies and covering the entire past century we test two hypotheses: that increases in the relative incomes of the very rich are associated with increased hours, while increases in the political representation of workers have the opposite effect. The estimated effects are large in economic magnitude, highly significant and robust to alternative econometric specifications, including country and time fixed effects. Using an alternative data set covering the last third of the past century we show that these results are robust to the inclusion of a measure of taxation and find that decentralized trade union bargaining (but not centralized bargaining) may raise working hours.

Both localization and urbanization economies are hypothesized to foster agglomeration and growth, but recent meta-analyses of this burgeoning body of empirical research show that the results are ambiguous. Recent overviews show that this ambiguity is fueled by measurement issues and heterogeneity in terms of scale of time and space, aggregation, growth definitions and the functional form of the models applied. Alternatively, in this paper, we argue that ambiguity may be due to a lack of research on firm-level performance in agglomerations. This research is necessary because the theories that underlie agglomeration economies are microeconomic in nature. Hierarchical or multilevel modeling, which allows micro levels and macro levels to be modeled simultaneously, is becoming an increasingly common practice in the social sciences. As illustrated by detailed Dutch data on firm-level productivity, employment growth and firm survival, we argue that these approaches are also suitable for reducing the ambiguity surrounding the agglomerationfirm performance relationship and for addressing spatial, sectoral and cross-level heterogeneity.","[van Oort, Frank G.] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Burger, Martijn J.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Knoben, Joris] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tilburg University,"van Oort, FG (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"Knoben, Joris/ABB-4605-2020; Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020","Knoben, Joris/0000-0001-8603-8066; Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X",,,,,82,70,74,0,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Because of the government's inevitable attempts to reduce high or rapidly growing budget deficits, the deficit may contain a substantial component that periodically collapses, which renders the standard unit root tests biased toward stationarity. We apply a newly proposed recursive unit root test for explosiveness, which is known to be powerful to the periodically collapsing component. Although the evidence for explosiveness we found herein is not overwhelming, this study should at the very least serve as a warning against a blind application of standard unit root tests to budget deficits, which may harbor components that periodically collapse.

It argues that if the goal of economics is to maximize human happiness, then approaches that directly address social phenomena and community building, rather than utility and income maximization by individual economic actors, are more promising and indeed rational. The fair trade movement, insofar as it supports community-based cooperatives, can play an important role in this process. However, the real story behind successful cooperatives is often more about the nature of the rural peasant community that supports it. Viewing economic decision making through the lens of the Mirembe Kawomera coffee cooperative in Uganda reveals a market that is socially embedded in a community rich in social capital, or more appropriately social productive power of labor, rather than one that constitutes a separate market sphere. When economic incentives encompass a more holistic set of costs and benefits, even those that may be less tangible, economic activity and strong community tend to be mutually reinforcing.","Scripps Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Scripps College,"Auerbach, NN (通讯作者)，Scripps Coll, 1030 Columbia Ave, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",nneiman@scrippscollege.edu,,,,,,,41,7,7,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

In theory and economic practice, three directions have been traced regarding the evaluation of forecasts performance: the analyse of accuracy, bias and efficiency. Using the forecasted values on medium run of inflation rate and unemplyment rate through the period from 2004-2010 in Romania, we get a better degree of accuracy and a lower efficiency for forecasts made by National Commission of Forecasting comparing to those based of Dobrescu model used by Institute of Economic Forecasting. Following the international tendency, the forecasts are, in all cases, biased because of difficulties in precise anticipation of shocks which affect the economy. Forecasts performance is indestructible related by their uncertainty, RMSE, the measure of evaluating the accuracy being used in building forecast intervals based on historical errors. For forecasted values of inflation rate published by National Bank of Romania we propose a new way of building forecast interval in order to take into account the economic shocks.","Acad Econ Studies, Fac Cybernet Stat & Econ Informat, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Bratu, M (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Fac Cybernet Stat & Econ Informat, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaela_mb1@yahoo.com,"Simionescu, Mihaela/L-1249-2016","Simionescu, Mihaela/0000-0002-6124-2172",,,,,25,8,8,0,10,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Evidence to support these arguments is provided from recent biofortification experiments in Uganda and Mozambique.

The latter are modelled by allowing a worker's marginal utility of leisure to be increasing in the leisure time taken by other workers. Coordination takes the form of internalising the leisure externality and other relevant constraints (e.g., labour demand). The extent of openness is measured by the degree of capital mobility. We find that: coordination lowers equilibrium work hours and raises the wage rate; there is a U-shaped (inverse-U-shaped) relationship between work hours (wages) and the degree of coordination; coordination is welfare improving; and, the gap between the coordinated and uncoordinated work hours (and the corresponding wage rates) is affected by the extent and nature of openness.

A first explanation is that consumers with higher incomes demand higher quality goods with higher prices. A second explanation is that wealthier people exhibit an increased willingness to pay for necessary goods as more goods enter the consumption set in a hierarchic demand system, and can thus be charged higher markups. A third explanation is that consumers with higher incomes are more finicky regarding their preferred variety in an ideal variety framework and can thus be charged higher markups. We discriminate between these three theories by focusing on the effect of income inequality on trade prices. Based on a large dataset with bilateral HS6 level data on 1260 final goods categories from more than 100 countries between 2000 and 2004, we find a highly significant negative effect of income inequality on unit values. This contradicts both the demand for quality and finickyness theories, while providing support for the increased willingness to pay theory linked to hierarchic demand. These findings on income inequality do not falsify the quality expansion model and the ideal variety model per se. However, the results do argue for place of importance of hierarchic demand.

The estimates based on a translog production function indicate that outsourcing provision augments productivity of both skilled and unskilled labor and contributes positively to wage inequality. The model predicts that a 1% increase in outsourcing provision leads to a rise in wage differentials by nearly 2.5%. The robustness check further reveals that the impacts of services provision on wage inequality are more pronounced than those of materials provision. These results highlight the importance of outsourcing provision as a new explanation of the widening skilledunskilled wage gap in developing countries which typically emerge as a hub of outsourcing provision.,"[Chongvilaivan, Aekapol] Inst SE Asian Studies ISEAS, Reg Econ Studies Programme, Singapore 119614, Singapore; [Thangavelu, Shandre M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Chongvilaivan, A (通讯作者)，Inst SE Asian Studies ISEAS, Reg Econ Studies Programme, 30 Heng Mui Keng Terrace, Singapore 119614, Singapore.",ecssmt@nus.edu.sg; aekapol@iseas.edu.sg,"Thangavelu, Shandre/ABC-9025-2021; Chongvilaivan, Aekapol/W-7941-2019",,,,,,19,10,12,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This paper interrogates some of the key aspects of much of the conventional wisdom concerning the transfer of technology and the knowledge exchange process in general. It analyses the results from two unique surveys: a survey of the UK academic community that generated more than 22,000 responses; and a stratified survey of businesses that generated more than 2,500 responses. The results suggest that much of the conventional wisdom concerning knowledge exchange involving academia is too narrowly confined or is misinformed. First, there is an excessive focus in much of the academic and policy discourse on commercialisation and technology transfer-there are many knowledge exchange mechanisms used by academics-these include commercialisation processes but also many other 'hidden' connections. Second, the focus on the science base ignores that knowledge exchange involves academics from all disciplines. Third, the preoccupation with improving innovation and business performance tends to ignore that knowledge exchange involves partners from the public and third (not for profit) sectors as well as private sector businesses. Fourth, the main constraints that hinder or limit the knowledge exchange process include a lack of time, insufficient internal capability to manage relationships and insufficient information to identify partners. Problems concerning cultural differences between academics and business, and disputes concerning intellectual property are not prominent. Overall, the paper suggests that the notion of an academic 'ivory tower' seems to be a myth as far as the UK is concerned. It also suggests that a strategic focus on strengthening connections between academia and the rest of society may generate long-term benefits, but it will also face challenges and should not distort or divert from the wider foundations of scholarship on which the success of universities are built.","[Hughes, Alan] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",University of Cambridge,"Hughes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Ctr Business Res, Top Floor,Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",a.hughes@jbs.cam.ac.uk,,,EPSRC [EP/H00274X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/E017304/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E017304/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/H00274X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,72,116,129,2,90,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The objectives of this paper are to: (a) provide a conceptual review of learning curve model specifications; and (b) conduct a meta-analysis of wind power learning rates. This permits an assessment of a number of important specification and data issues that influence these learning rates. The econometric analysis builds on 113 estimates of the learning-by-doing rate presented in 35 studies. The meta-analysis indicates that the choice of the geographical domain of learning, and thus the assumed presence of learning spillovers, is an important determinant of wind power learning rates. We also find that the use of extended learning curve concepts, e.g., integrating public R&D effects, appears to result in lower learning rates than those generated by so-called single-factor learning curve studies. Overall the empirical findings suggest that future studies should pay increased attention to the issue of learning and knowledge spillovers in the renewable energy field, as well as to the interaction between technology learning and R&D efforts.

The model fits the data remarkably well. The estimation shows that productivity shocks are the main driver of fluctuations in the labour market, with cyclical movements in the separation rate playing only a subordinate role. The parameter estimates are broadly consistent with those found in the literature. To replicate the volatility of unemployment and vacancies, the model estimates require a high replacement ratio and a low bargaining power for workers, in addition to two extraneous sources of uncertainty. The estimates are robust to a relaxation of the prior information and small changes in the underlying model specification, which suggests that the data are informative and that the model is well specified.

Models with these two features have recently become popular, but we know little about the best ways to implement them numerically. To fill this gap, we solve the stochastic neoclassical growth model with recursive preferences and stochastic volatility using four different approaches: second- and third-order perturbation, Chebyshev polynomials, and value function iteration. We document the performance of the methods in terms of computing time, implementation complexity, and accuracy. Our main finding is that perturbations are competitive in terms of accuracy with Chebyshev polynomials and value function iteration while being several orders of magnitude faster to run. Therefore, we conclude that perturbation methods are an attractive approach for computing this class of problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We develop an overlapping generations two-sector exogenous growth model in which RER determination may depend on the country's capacity to borrow from international capital markets. The country faces a constraint on capital inflows. With high domestic savings, the RER only depends on the productivity spread between sectors (Balassa-Samuelson effect). If the constraint is too tight and/or domestic savings too low, the RER depends on both net foreign assets (transfer effect) and productivity.

J,"Cotton, C",,,,"Cotton, Christopher",,,Pay-to-play politics: Informational lobbying and contribution limits when money buys access,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Political contributions; Contribution limits; Access; Costly information disclosure,CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS; CONGRESSIONAL VOTES; PROOF; COMPETITION; INTERESTS; MODEL; CAPS,"We develop a game theoretic model of informational lobbying between two interest groups and a politician, in which the politician can require political contributions in exchange for access. The analysis considers three claims: (1) the rich have better access to politicians than less-wealthy groups, (2) this access advantage makes the rich better off and skews policy in their favor, and (3) contribution limits can reduce the rich group advantage and result in less-skewed policy. We show that the rich do have better access, with the politician always offering access to the rich groups and only sometimes offering access to the less-wealthy group. This does not, however, mean that the rich group is better off or that policy is biased in its favor. The politician sets access fees to extract the greatest amount of rent from the political process. When only the rich group has access, its expected benefit from gaining access is fully offset by its payment to the politician. In this case, the less-wealthy interest group who is not targeted by the politician is better off. Contribution limits decrease the politician's ability to extract rent, which improves the payoffs of rich interests and decreases politician payoffs. Finally, the paper presents a novel benefit of contribution limits: they can encourage the formation of lobby groups or the search for evidence, which results in more evidence disclosure and better policy.

To explain why this is the case, a number of hypotheses have been proposed in the literature. The key novelty of our study consists in a simultaneous assessment of the contribution to trade from geographical, policy and institutional factors, during the EU pre-accession period (1997-2004). An augmented gravity model is proposed and estimated for a reference group of 82 countries employing the Poisson and Tobit estimation techniques. We find that the low quality of economic institutions in the SEE and CIS countries contributed to a considerable proportion of their below potential international trade.

Following the onset of the subprime tremors in July 2007, the risk premia (spreads) on bonds issued by eurozone sovereigns rose from historically low levels; but they rose largely in tandem across the eurozone membership along with global banking stresses. The rescue of the US investment bank, Bear Stearns, in March 2008, oddly enough, marked the start of a distinctively European banking crisis accompanied by increased differentiation of countries within the eurozone. With the greater expectation of public support for distressed banks, the spreads that a sovereign paid tended to rise following evidence of stress in its domestic financial sector. This was especially so in countries with lower growth prospects and higher debt burdens. But there was as yet no feedback from banks to sovereigns. Finally, as the limits of fiscal support for domestic banks became clearer, and coinciding with the nationalization of Anglo Irish in January 2009 but gathering steam with evidence of the Greek sovereigns distress in May 2010, sovereign weaknesses also came to be quickly transmitted to a more pessimistic assessment of the financial sectors prospects, creating the potential of mutual destabilization.","[Mody, Ashoka] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; Int Monetary Fund, European Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Mody, A (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,"Sandri, Damiano/0000-0002-3771-001X",,,,,16,76,82,1,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0266-4658,,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Banks face troubles in keeping their present or acquiring new financial sources, when central bank tightens its monetary policy. Banks characterized by differences in size, capitalization, liquidity and ownership face different levels of informational asymmetry and are therefore differently affected by changes in monetary policy. If larger, better capitalized, more liquid, state owned and/or domestically owned banks respond weaker to changes in monetary policy it is possible to argue that bank lending channel is effective. This hypothesis is tested on a panel of annual data for individual Slovenian banks in the period between 1993 and 2007 using general method of moments.

In particular we study the links between the actions and preferences of the actors. We show that quaternary rules (unlike binary rules, where only two actions -yes or no- are possible) leave room for manipulability (i.e., strategic behaviour). Thus a preference profile does not in general determine an action profile.

It never occurred to me in those years that one day I would edit the journal. While doing so is a privilege and a pleasure, I equally confess that it's no small weight to be the custodial parent of one of our profession's most beloved offspring. No less intimidating is the task of stipulating what this upstart youth has accomplished in its first 25 years and 100 issues in print. Like any empiricist, I recognize that the counterfactual world that would exist without the JEP is unknowable, but my strong hunch is that our profession would be worse off in that counterfactual world.

Our results indicate that examining the relationship separately for functional categories of government expenditures and based on differences in incomes across countries provide important details on the relationship between the two variables not found elsewhere in the literature. Our causality tests provide little or no support for a causal relationship between openness and aggregate or disaggregated government expenditure. Similar results are obtained when our sample is split into low income versus high income countries. The only evidence of a robust, statistically significant, positive causal relationship is found between openness and education expenditures in low income countries. In no case is there a positive causal relationship between social security and openness. This leads us to conclude that there is no evidence to support the relationship suggested by Rodrik (1998).

Consistent with the price pattern indicating that the block transactions are seller-initiated, the overall market reaction is negative. However, we find a different market reaction to block transactions when the buyer is represented by China International Capital Corporation (CICC), the number one investment bank in China which counts many foreign institutional investors as its clients.

It argues that to the extent that property owners employ wage laborers to produce for the market for a profit, they are capitalist, even if they may not reinvest their profit in technology. In this situation, wage-labor is formally subsumed under capital. The transition from this stage to real subsumption of labor, which signifies capitalist development with technological change, is not, however, automatic, as Marx tended to assume. It is mediated by class struggle, which occurs in the context of geographically varying factors, such as state interventions. Uneven development, seen as the uneven transition to real subsumption, is partly a product of place-specific outcomes of class struggle. The paper thus emphasizes the relation between class struggle and dynamics of capitalism including technological change. The conceptual arguments are illustrated with empirical evidence from India. The implications of the arguments for radical development theory and politics are also briefly explored.","[Das, Raju J.] York Univ, Fac Grad Studies, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON MP3 1PJ, Canada; [Das, Raju J.] York Univ, Dept Dev Studies, Toronto, ON MP3 1PJ, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Das, RJ (通讯作者)，York Univ, Fac Grad Studies, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON MP3 1PJ, Canada.",rajudas@yorku.ca,,,,,,,57,26,30,2,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The GA searches for the optimal solution in the entire set of financial constraints without looking for partial derivatives of the utility function. Whereas most financial problems require a non-linear and time-varying model, the GA, with its survival principle of offspring chromosomes, is better suited to this type of problem than local optimisation methods. The performance of the GA is compared with two non-linear models, namely the quadratic mean-variance (QMV), which maximises the portfolio mean-variance, and the quadratic variance minimisation (QVM), which minimises the portfolio variance. The results show that neither the QMV nor the QVM takes into account the domestic investors' risk attitude towards investing in foreign equities and therefore does not provide any international diversification benefits. In addition, the bootstrapping scenario of 10,000 simulations reveals that neither the QMV nor the QVM outperforms the GA in terms of Sharpe ratio and flexibility in dealing with investors' risk attitude towards investing in foreign equities denominated in foreign currencies.","[Kabundi, Alain; Mwamba, John Muteba] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Kabundi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ, Cnr Kingsway & Univ Rd,Auckland Pk,POB 524, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa.",akabundi@uj.ac.za; johnmu@uj.ac.za,"Mwamba, John Weirstrass Muteba/I-5479-2014","Mwamba, John Weirstrass Muteba/0000-0002-8002-1156",,,,,35,4,8,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

I use computationally efficient techniques based on mechanism design, genetic algorithms and maximum likelihood to estimate and statistically test these models of financial constraints. Using occupational choice data from Thai villages I find evidence that the saving only regime is rejected in favor of regimes allowing for borrowing and/or insurance, especially in higher-wealth data stratifications. A direct test between the borrowing and insurance regimes reveals that neither can be rejected in favor of the other. Allowing ex-ante lotteries over wealth improves the explanatory power of the model. I also find evidence for differences in the best fitting regimes by region, wealth, and access to formal credit.

(2004) use a vector error correction model (VECM) for the current float nominal exchange rate and relative price data and claim that the sluggish purchasing power parity (PPP) reversion is primarily driven by the nominal exchange rate, not by relative price adjustment, which is at odds with the conventional sticky-price models. Our major findings are as follows. First, we suggest cases where VECMs are of limited usefulness, even when all the variables in the system are not weakly exogenous. Second, using century-long exchange rates, we find that the relative price plays an important role for PPP reversion when real shocks occur. Third, protracted hump-shaped responses of real exchange rates are frequently observed when there is a relative price shock, leading to sluggish adjustments toward PPP. Nominal exchange rate shocks generate humped dynamics much less frequently. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Tariff revenue, which is external to firms, drives a wedge between the private and social gains to offshoring and integration.","[Ornelas, Emanuel] London Sch Econ, Managerial Econ & Strategy Grp, London WC2A 2AE, England; Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Ornelas, E (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Managerial Econ & Strategy Grp, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",e.a.ornelas@lse.ac.uk,"ornelas, emanuel/A-7413-2014",,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,16,16,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

The two-dimensional dominance criteria introduced by Atkinson and Bourguignon (RES, 1982) are used to compare the distributions of private and public goods before and after equalization payments. Because the distribution before equalization is not observable, it is simulated on the basis of various scenarios that specify both its financing by the federal government and its utilization by provincial governments. The main result of the paper is that, for most scenarios, equalization transfers have an ambiguous normative impact on the distribution of well-being among Canadians and that, for some scenarios, equalization transfers actually worsen this distribution of well-being.","Univ Rennes 1, Ctr Rech Econ & Management, F-35065 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Tarroux, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, Ctr Rech Econ & Management, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France.",benoit.tarroux@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Furthermore, establishments taken over by US multinationals (but not by non-US multinationals) increased the productivity of their IT.

We find that legalizing torture in strong-evidence cases has offsetting effects on agency incentives to counter terrorism by means other than torture. It lowers these incentives because the agency may come to rely on torture to avert attacks. However, it also increases these incentives because other efforts may increase the probability of having strong enough evidence to warrant the use of torture. Legalizing torture in strong-evidence cases is more likely to reduce non-torture efforts if these efforts are more effective at stopping attacks and less effective at turning up strong evidence when the suspect is guilty. If it reduces non-torture efforts, it can reduce security and is more likely to do so if the attack threat is higher. Moreover, if torture is used in strong-evidence cases even if torture is banned, legalizing torture in strong-evidence cases necessarily reduces security if it reduces non-torture efforts. Lastly, it can increase incentives to torture even in weak-evidence cases a slippery slope. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, market forces drive down the firms' profits to a constrained competitive benchmark if and only if the comparability structure satisfies a property that we interpret as a form of frame neutrality.

The government optimally overpays for the legacy assets and cleans up the market of its weakest assets, through a mixture of buybacks and equity injections, and leaves the firms with the strongest legacy assets to the market. The government reduces adverse selection enough to let the market rebound, but not too much, so as to limit the cost of intervention. The existence of a market imposes no welfare cost.","Univ Toulouse, TSE, FR-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Tirole, J (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, TSE, 21 Allees Brienne, FR-31000 Toulouse, France.",jean.tirole@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,48,96,116,0,80,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,,,AM ECON REV,Am.

In many cases this U-shape is robust (with a well-known exception the pattern evident in some U.S. data sets if few independent variables are included). However, a lively debate is currently ongoing about its true shape. This paper discusses the identification problem of age, time, and cohort effects. It suggests a simple way to interpret estimates of age variables in a first-difference framework. Building on McKenzie's (2006) methodology, the paper shows that no extra assumptions are needed in order to identify the second derivative of well-being to age, i.e. to estimate the changes in the actual age and well-being relationship. An empirical application, using a large German data set, finds that human well-being is convex in age until after midlife, which is approximately consistent with a U-shaped pattern through life, and not with the concave relationship sometimes found in U.S. studies.

Among others, if labor endowment is of intermediate size, there are two saddle-point steady states, and the initial stock of the public good determines the long-run trade pattern. We also add a gains-from-trade analysis to McMillan's model and demonstrate that if the economy has a comparative advantage in a good with productivity less sensitive to the public intermediate good, the economy may lose from trade at the steady state.","[Yanase, Akihiko] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Int Cultural Studies, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808576, Japan; Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Tohoku University; Nagoya University,"Yanase, A (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Int Cultural Studies, Aoba Ku, 41 Kawauchi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808576, Japan.",yanase@intcul.tohoku.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23243049, 21243023, 21730180] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,15,8,8,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0020-6598,,,INT ECON REV,Int.

The object of this study was the students so that we can evaluate the leadership style of a teacher and to observe the influence of leadership style on the academic performance of students. An estimated sample of 250 students was asked for volunteer contribution, out of which 212 students contributed to the research by filling out the questionnaires. All these students have been taught by a researcher, a faculty member at Hailey College of Commerce, University of Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. These students were further categorized on the basis of a tenure they have been taught by the said teacher. 111 students have been taught for 1 semester, 70 students for 2 semesters and 31 students were those who assessed the leadership style after 1 year of their class interaction with the teacher. Questionnaire consisted of 3 portions for the assessment of a leadership style of the teacher; indication of their own self-efficacy level and their perceived academic performance. Study concluded that there is a significant effect of transformational leadership style of a teacher and students' self-efficacy on the students' academic performance and presumed that the moderator (self-efficacy) does not really moderate the effects of the predictor (teacher's transformational leadership style) on the outcome variable (students academic performance).","[Ahmed, Ishfaq; Qazi, Tehmina Fiaz; Jabeen, Shaista] Univ Punjab, Halley Coll Commerce, Lahore, Pakistan",University of Punjab,"Ahmed, I (通讯作者)，Univ Punjab, Halley Coll Commerce, Quaid E Azam Campus, Lahore, Pakistan.",,,,,,,,55,0,0,0,29,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

This assessment is usually carried out under the implicit assumption of technological inertia: incumbents cannot change their technologies in response to entry. We remove this assumption by modeling a game where, before quantity competition, firms choose technologies. We identify parameter configurations where, after entry, the incumbent(s) changes technology. This leads either to a higher price after entry or to a dampening effect on price reduction. This effect is shown to be relevant when evaluating the welfare gains from measures intended to foster competition by increasing the number of competitors. The converse proposition could be stated for evaluating the social costs of mergers.","[Garella, Paolo G.] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Bacchiega, Emanuele] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy",University of Milan; University of Bologna,"Garella, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",emanuele.bacchiega@unibo.it; paolo.garella@unimi.it,"Garella, Paolo/AAE-5743-2020","Garella, Paolo/0000-0002-6830-4786; BACCHIEGA, EMANUELE/0000-0002-7822-6486",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Yet, further investigation of the investment uncertainty relationship and the role of irreversibility provides support for the view that the negative association between uncertainty and investment increases with the degree of irreversibility.

We investigate a simple model where downstream competitors outsource to a common upstream supplier out of their incentive to better exploit scale economies. We find that the efficiency gain of outsourcing in virtue of economies of scale helps to internalize R&D spillovers, which tends to enhance outsourcing firms' R&D incentives. On the other hand, outsourcing also mitigates downstream competition, which imposes an ambiguous impact on outsourcing firms' R&D incentives. The aggregate effect is that outsourcing enhances R&D investments only when R&D spillovers are sufficiently large, or when upstream economies of scale are sufficiently small.","[Chen, Yutian] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Sen, Debapriya] Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Chen, YT (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",Yutian.Chen@csulb.edu; dsen@arts.ryerson.ca,,"Sen, Debapriya/0000-0002-1950-7915",,,,,33,2,2,0,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Moreover, the stylized models used in optimal tax analyses are not appropriate for practical policy advice. This paper proposes a method of examining income tax reforms designed to move towards an optimal structure. It uses a behavioural microsimulation model in which the full extent of population heterogeneity is represented along with all the details of highly complex tax and transfer systems. The approach is illustrated using the Australian microsimulation model MITTS. The results show that welfare changes for the Australian income tax structure are not symmetric with respect to increases and decreases in tax rates. In addition, the extent of inequality aversion was found to play a much larger role in the determination of the direction of tax rate changes than the form of the welfare metric or the specification of adult equivalence scales.","[Creedy, John] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Herault, Nicolas] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",nherault@unimelb.edu.au,"Herault, Nicolas/K-7080-2012","Herault, Nicolas/0000-0003-2080-0390",,,,,43,10,10,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In our three-stage gift-exchange experiment, the employer can express respect by giving the employee costly symbolic rewards after observing his level of effort. We study whether symbolic rewards are used by the employers mainly to praise employees or as a coordination device to build relational contracts by manipulating the balance between labor demand and supply in the market. We find that a high proportion of long-term relationships have been initiated by the assignment of symbolic rewards. However, the assignment of symbolic rewards decreases when it becomes clear that the relationship is durable, suggesting that employers mainly use symbolic rewards as a coordination device to initiate relational contracts. Compared to the balanced market condition, assigning symbolic rewards in initial relationships is less likely when there is excess demand in the market and more likely when there is excess supply, i.e., when the relationship is more valuable. Receiving symbolic rewards increases the employees' likelihood of accepting to continue the relationship with the same employer. It also motivates them to increase their effort further but only when the market is balanced. Overall, the ability to assign symbolic rewards does not give rise to higher profits because it is associated with lower rents offered to the employees on average, leading to lower effort levels.

Direct links are costly but being connected is valuable. The game-theoretic basis for our experiment is the model of Bala and Goyal (2000). They distinguish between two scenarios regarding the flow of benefits through a network, the so-called 1-way and 2-way flow model. Our main results show that the prediction based on Nash and strict Nash equilibrium works well in the 1-way flow model but fails largely in the 2-way flow model. We observe a strong learning dynamic in the 1-way flow model but less so in the 2-way flow model. Finally, costs of a direct link have a positive impact on the occurrence of (strict) Nash networks in the 1-way flow model but a negative impact in the 2-way flow model. In our discussion on possible explanations for these results we focus on strategic asymmetry and asymmetry with respect to payoffs. We find that the latter asymmetry, i.e., payoff inequity, plays an important role in the network formation process.","[Falk, Armin] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Kosfeld, Michael] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Bonn; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Falk, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",,,"Kosfeld, Michael/0000-0003-2427-0825",,,,,54,26,29,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

We consider a case where two or more contestants bid for a prize in a stochastic contest where all bidders value the prize equally. We show that, whenever a Tullock contest yields under-dissipation, the auctioneer's revenue can be increased by optimally fixing the number of tickets. In particular, in a stochastic contest with proportional probabilities, it is possible to obtain (almost) full rent dissipation. We test this hypothesis with a laboratory experiment. The results indicate that, as predicted, revenue is significantly higher in a lottery with rationing than in a standard lottery. On the other hand, an alternative rationing mechanism that does not limit total expenditures fails to increase revenue relative to a standard lottery. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We measure income uncertainty as the variance of linear projection errors at various future horizons, up to 25 years ahead, conditional on only the information available to households when the projection is made. Our uncertainty estimates change substantially over the life cycle. We calibrate an income process to match our estimates, allowing the variances of both transitory and persistent shocks to change over the life cycle.

An Empirical Study of SMEs,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,exports; managerial perceptions; structural equations,INTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS; PERFORMANCE; EXPANSION; BARRIERS; FIRMS,"During the last two decades, the phenomenon of company internationalization has acquired remarkable attention (Saboniene, 2009). Different aspects such as globalization, the dilution of trade barriers, or the significant increase in economic-business transactions in the euro zone have prompted many SMEs to consider international development as a core component of their managerial strategy (Saboniene, 2009; Shamsuddoha et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2010). According to Simpson and Kujawa (1974) The decision to export is a combination of the right stimulus and the right perception of the factors involved in the export process itself. That sentence demonstrates the importance of managerial perceptions of exports to the creation of the environment necessary for the stimuli to have the desired effect. The importance of entrepreneurs and international managers has been dealt with in many studies, which have found a relationship between a positive and intense international development and the entrepreneur's international attitude, motivation, orientation, experience and network (Andersson & Wictor, 2003). The relevance of the perception of exports in the field of business management can have a key impact on the exporting behavior of SMEs. In particular, it can determine the decision to implement an export policy, as well as the policies applied to consolidate exports. This paper covers two main aspects. First, the extents to which managerial perceptions of exports affect the decision to export, and second, for these SMEs which are already exporters, we study the managerial perceptions that can help to consolidate their commitment to exports. To this aim, some scales based on structural equations to measure the perception of the advantages and disadvantages of exporting are developed and validated. Both analyses are carried out considering whether the SMEs involved are family businesses or not, so that the results obtained can also explain the potential impact of this fact.","[Fernandez Ortiz, Ruben] Univ La Rioja, Logrono 26006, La Rioja, Spain; [Arteaga Ortiz, Jesus] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Granada,"Ortiz, RF (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Logrono 26006, La Rioja, Spain.",aruben.fernandez@unirioja.es; jarteaga@dede.ulpgc.es; amihi@ugr.es,"Fernández, Rubén/AAA-4521-2019; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906",,,,,40,11,12,0,30,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Real estate market trends are strong indicator of trends in the entire economy. Trends on the real estate markets have changed notably in recent years. As early as two years ago, the main characteristics of these real estate markets were domination of demand over offer, quick sales of apartments and a lack of choosiness on the part of buyers, all of which was accompanied by rising real estate prices, which has not abated in nearly two decades. Over the past two years, the conditions have changed notably: transactions are few, offer is dominating over demand, buyers are choosy, while apartment prices are falling. In the past, little attention has been paid to the problems we are about to study. Some researches have been conducted; however, none were developed so as to be applicable to the entire territory of Slovenia. For the very facts stated above, we decided to study and present the impact factors on the Slovenian real estate market using a practical example. The answers obtained through a structured survey questionnaire give rise to several questions. One of these questions is also what the primary factors are and how to form the best selection thereof. To determine them, it was our task to monitor the key factors. We obtained some of the information from past research and put them into the time context. Determining the goals and strategies, we elaborated a plan of the system for establishing the factors, and monitored the volatility of the selected indicators. Included into the research were also investors, real estate owners, tenancy right holders, real estate users, administrators, managers, tenants, real estate agencies and companies, design and construction companies, as well as other individuals across Slovenia, with varying durations of work experience and varying education levels. With the research that follows, we wanted to present the factors which most affect the real estate prices on the Slovenian real estate market, resulting in their rise or fall respectively. The role, significance and usage of the assessed parameters on the real estate market are important for efficient operation of construction company. There is a growing interest for modifying and determining the causes of the assessed parameters. Knowledge of conditions on the real estate market is extremely important for efficient and successful operation of an organisation. An analysis of the real estate market and the operation of construction companies represent a starting point for revamping it. The goal of the research is to define the factors that must be taken into account for an analytical forecast of future trends in the fluctuation of real estate prices. We have established that the main group of impact factors is associated with economic growth, interest rates, construction quality, speed of real estate sales and accessibility of funding sources.","[Golob, Ksenija; Bastic, Majda; Psunder, Igor] Univ Maribor, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Golob, K (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Smetanova 17, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",ksenija.golob1@gmail.com; majda.bastic@uni-mb.si; igor.psunder@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,25,20,20,0,47,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The results suggest that the distributions of General Practitioner (GP) services and any physician visits in Australia were generally pro-poor, whereas the distributions of specialist visits, dentist visits and any ambulatory visits were pro-rich. The computed indices demonstrate that the introduction of Medicare in 1984 had a pro-poor effect on the utilization of GPs, any physician visits and any ambulatory visits.

The interest-rate mark-ups of banks are predicted to follow a life-cycle pattern over the age of the borrowing firms. Because of endogenous bank monitoring by competing banks, borrowing firms initially face a low mark-up, and thereafter an increasing mark-up as a result of informational lock-in, until it falls for older firms when the lock-in is resolved. By applying a large sample of predominantly small unlisted firms and a new measure of asymmetric information, we find that firms with significant asymmetric-information problems have a more pronounced life-cycle pattern of interest-rate mark-ups. Additionally, we examine the effects of concentrated banking markets on interest-rate mark-ups. The results indicate that the life cycle of mark-ups is mainly driven by asymmetric-information problems and not by concentration.

This architecture typically involves some commonality of tax bases between higher- and lower-level authorities. This process points to the existence of vertical externalities, i.e. of an inefficiently high degree of taxation. The central purpose of this paper is to explore the distribution of taxing powers among tiers of governments, and to analyze the nature and the consequences of the vertical externality that arises when different levels of government share joint property tax bases. To that end, the multi-principal theory is highly relevant since the different layers of government can be regarded as competing power centres. We provide a simple taxation model and consider a structure of overlapping governments that co-occupy a same tax base. We show that an independent behaviour of both levels of government results in the cumulated tax rate being too high with respect to a cooperative solution. Actually, when she independently makes her choice and unilaterally raises her tax rate, each level of government ignores the losses of fiscal receipts that other levels will suffer from the induced contraction of the shared tax base. Hence she under-valuates the social marginal cost of raising tax revenue from the common tax base. However, information asymmetry tends to lower the global level of taxation as some rents have to be given up to firms in order to make them reveal their private feature.","Univ Pau & Pays Adour, F-64016 Pau, France",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,"Lachet-Touya, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pau & Pays Adour, CATT Ave Doyen Poplawski,BP 1633, F-64016 Pau, France.",,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,8,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

In each period, a ruler from an incumbent dynasty is challenged. If he survives, he hands over power to a (biological or ideological) offspring. He can control his offspring's chances of surviving future threats, by choosing how competent and loyal administrators to hire, and how many. The society can stay for a long time on a volatile path where subsequent dynasties of rulers regularly replace one another, each purging the preceding dynasty's competent administrators, replacing them with loyalists, thus keeping competence bouncing around a low level. This may be followed by an endogenous transition to a path without such purges and a simultaneous rise in competence.","York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Lagerlöf, NP (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",lagerlof@econ.yorku.ca,,"Lagerlof, Nils Petter/0000-0002-8857-3262",,,,,44,1,1,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

If we compare the evolution of income in the business and non-business sector in the Czech Republic, we find the significant inequality between them, especially at the times of changing of economic growth with economic slowdown. Czech business sector develops with a different trend than the non-business sector. While the non-business sector is managed by the tables and by the administrative decision and officials, the business sector reacts very quickly to current events in the economy. The work aims to explain these differences and to outline the trend in average wages of Czech business and non-business sector in the future to make it clear that the inflexibility of wages in some phases of the economic cycle has significant consequences for the income asymmetry.","[Langhamrova, Jitka; Simpach, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Demog, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Langhamrová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Demog, W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",langhamj@vse.cz; ondrej.simpach@vse.cz,"Langhamrová, Jitka/Z-2115-2019",,,,,,16,2,2,0,0,TECH UNIV KOSICE,KOSICE,"FAC ECONOMICS, INST REGIONAL & COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, KOSICE, 00000, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-1225-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,113,122,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3LJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359860200012,0

In almost common value auctions, a seller suffers great revenue losses due to the aggravated winner's curse problem. In our modified model, the inside bidders are more sensitive to the signals sent by the seller, and by revealing the information about the object valuation, the seller faces the trade-off between the benefit of increased competition and that of higher bids by weak inside bidders. For instance, a low message will attract the potential entrants into the auction, as a result of greater winning opportunity, and a high message will encourage the weak since bidders to bid more aggressively, as a result of increased valuation. Under quite plausible conditions, there exists an informative equilibrium in this cheap talk game, which will either increase the expected revenue of the auction, or the efficiency of final allocation.","Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham DH1 3HP, England",Durham University,"Li, DZ (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham DH1 3HP, England.",daniel.li@durham.ac.uk,"Li, Daniel Z./W-1994-2018",,,,,,13,0,0,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The contest takes place amidst China's desire to avoid significant appreciation of its currency to protect its export markets and yuan value of its state-owned foreign financial assets. But investments of CIC are not merely regarded by the state as an instrument to influence the value of the yuan, they also reflect the state's attempt to better utilize its foreign exchange reserves to improve the nation's energy and resource security, and promote development of domestic industry. CIC's foreign investments have attracted global attention, but its support for China's SOEs through its banks might turn out to be more significant.","[Liew, Leong H.] Griffith Univ, Dept Int Business & Asian Studies, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [He, Liping] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Griffith University; Beijing Normal University,"Liew, LH (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Int Business & Asian Studies, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",L.Liew@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,61,7,9,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

A random walk algorithm is used to explore the polytope containing the admissible combinations for the unknown technical coefficients of the disaggregated IO table. These combinations are then used to construct the probability distribution of the coefficients of the inverse Leontief matrix. The methodology is illustrated by disaggregating the electricity production sector of China's 2007 IO table and by looking at the probability distribution of the CO2 emission intensity factors of the sectors of the economy.","[Guan, Dabo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Legault, Julien] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Lindner, Soeren] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Guan, Dabo] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Guan, Dabo] Univ Cambridge, St Edmunds Coll, Cambridge, England","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Leeds; University of Cambridge","Guan, DB (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang, Peoples R China.",d.guan@leeds.ac.uk,"Guan, Dabo/Y-2406-2019","Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403",,,,,29,52,59,6,70,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The results support the empirical finding of a weak link in poor countries between sexual behavior, HIV frequency, and HIV knowledge.

There may also be adjustments to economic structure independent of policy intervention due to changes in population, consumption patterns, and global markets. The overall effectiveness of specific mitigation policy will partly depend on these indirect and exogenous changes to economic structure. This study develops a new measure linking economic development with its environmental effects. The technical cost of GHG mitigation under economic growth in an economy is calculated by combining traditional input-output (IO) analysis and a linear programming based sensitivity analysis. The approach is applied to Northern Ireland (NI), producing an isoemission matrix that maps emission-neutral expansion paths for the economy. The measurement provides an indicator of the demand for technical improvement to achieve GHG mitigation at a national or regional level. The flexibility and transparency of the approach make it useful for evaluating potential GHG mitigation strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, in first-price auctions, there tends to be overbidding for large valuations, but underbidding for small valuations. We show that the experimental evidence can be rationalized by a simple extension of the standard auction model, where bidders anticipate (constant) positive or negative emotions caused by the mere fact of winning or losing. Even if the emotional (dis-)utilities are very small, the revenue-maximizing reserve price r* might be significantly different from the standard model.

These ideas have played an important part in discussions of spontaneous order within Austrian economics, particularly by Hayek drawing on arguments dating from Mill and Menger, although with other traditions such as that of Bohm-Bawerk not relying on such ideas. Philosophical discussions of these terms are considered that raise questions about the relationship between the emergent whole and the lower level parts that comprise it. A major issue is the role of these ideas and processes within evolution, with Hayek in particular moving strongly towards identifying their linkage, something advocated by many non-Austrian economists and non-economists as well.

This study introduces a self-rated health variable called morbidity that describes individual needs for health care - healthy individuals need less health care than sick ones - and that is measured through personal interviews conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In addition, stationary properties of the series are considered in order to understand the effect of shocks to expenditure behaviour on health care. Stationary test results show that we should not only use differenced values for the model variables but also incorporate time-specific effects into the model. Using the appropriate specification and accounting for the time effect, we find evidence supporting the hypothesis that the share of healthcare expenditure in GDP rises with the increased need for health care. The need for health care is also found to be more important than per capita GDP when explaining the change in the share of healthcare expenditures for the examined countries.","[Solakoglu, Ebru Guven] Bilkent Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Civan, Abdulkadir] Fatih Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Fatih University,"Solakoglu, EG (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",egsolakoglu@bilkent.edu.tr,,"Civan, Abdulkadir/0000-0003-2969-5195; Solakoglu, Ebru Guven/0000-0001-7541-3123",,,,,38,1,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Three aggregation issues are inherent in such decomposition studies, namely sector aggregation, spatial aggregation and temporal aggregation. This study, as an extension of our previous work on the first two issues, focuses on the third or temporal aggregation. An empirical study using the emission data of China from 1997 to 2007 is presented to illustrate the problems involved.

We use a representative data-set to examine how the NFA varies with the development stages of different countries. We also investigate the determinants of NFA and the composition of external asset and liability. We have obtained some important findings. First, the change of NFA follows an inverse U-shaped curve with the increase of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. This means that the most-watched global imbalance may decrease with economic development in the future. Second, industrial structure, openness to international market, inflation, development of domestic financial market and public debt are important factors that affect the ratio of NFA/GDP and compositions of external asset and liability. Third, the NFA/GDP ratio in China is currently at the early stage of the inverse U-shaped curve and is expected to decrease in the future. As for the compositions of external asset and liability, China is holding too much asset in the form of foreign exchange reserves (FER) and too much liability in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI). In contrast to some existing views, we believe that the restrictions on capital mobility, rather than NFA, affect the composition of external asset and liability. This study sheds some light on the imbalance issue and the corresponding policy-making.","Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Sun, WK (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Room 837,Mingde Main Bldg, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",sunwk_r@126.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The lack of an objective measure of news content ensures that such charges remain controversial.

I examine determinants of circulation of the three major weekly news magazines across the US and find that Newsweek and Time have higher circulation in liberal markets while US News has higher circulation in conservative markets.

We study a repeated linear public-good game with punishment opportunities and a parameter change after the first ten (of twenty) rounds. Our data shows that cooperation among subjects who had experienced a higher marginal return on public-good contributions or low punishment costs in rounds 1-10 rapidly deteriorated in rounds 11-20 once these incentives were removed, eventually trending below the level of cooperation in the control group. This suggests the possibility of temporary incentives backfiring in the long run. This paper ties in with the literature highlighting the potentially adverse effects of the use of incentives.

For the claimants, Chinese export restrictions on various raw materials, of which the country is a major producer, create shortages in foreign markets increasing the prices of these goods. China defends export limitations by presenting them as a natural resource conserving policy. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the dispute with the help of a model of a monopoly extracting a non-renewable resource and selling it on both the domestic and foreign markets. The theoretical results focus on the effects of imposing an export quota on quantities, prices and price distortion. Given the crucial importance of demand elasticities in this theoretical understanding of the conflict, the empirical part of the paper provides estimates of import demand elasticity of the parties for each product concerned in the case. The model and the empirical results challenge the ideas that an export quota always favors conservation of natural resource, that a higher foreign price necessarily follows this policy and that it inherently increases price distortion and therefore discrimination.

Using household fixed-effects to control for influences at the household level, we show that orphans do not only fare worse than non-orphans because they tend to live in poorer households, but that they are also at a disadvantage compared to non-orphans within the same household. They lag behind in education and are more often malnourished and stunted. (The coefficients on the health outcomes are only statistically significant for some of the countries and some of the health measures, however.) Moreover, we show that non-orphaned children not living with a biological parent are also worse off compared to biological children of the same caregivers. Educational gaps are particularly evident for children whose mother is deceased or absent. The additional effect of paternal death or absence is rather modest or insignificant in most countries.","[Coneus, Katja; Muehlenweg, Andrea M.; Stichnoth, Holger] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany; [Muehlenweg, Andrea M.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Labour Econ, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Leibniz University Hannover; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Coneus, K (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, L 7,1,POB 10 34 43, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",KaConeus@web.de; andrea.muehlenweg@yahoo.de; stichnoth@zew.de,,,,,,,23,13,15,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We first characterize basic empirical patterns in modes of civil case disposition in Slovenian local courts. We then examine court-level determinants of the incidence of in-court settlements versus trial-based judgments. Consistent with the theory that both judges and disputing parties take into account their respective private benefits and costs when choosing their preferred mode of case disposition, we find evidence that the incidence of in-court settlements versus trial-based judgments increases with the number of all case filings per judge. Thus, court resources and demand for court services influence not only total court output, as previously established in the literature, but also how cases are disposed of.

To do so, I use a set of Swedish individual survey data on the preferences for local public services of both politicians and voters, which provides an opportunity to investigate how information affects voters' ability to match their preferences with those of their politicians. The results indicate that more informed voters are more likely to vote for politicians with similar preferences for local public services and, on the aggregate level, that the left-wing parties would have received 1-3 percentage points fewer votes if all voters had been equally well-informed.","[Nordin, Mattias] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Nordin, Mattias] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala Ctr Fiscal Studies, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University; Uppsala University,"Nordin, M (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Box 513, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",Mattias.Nordin@nek.uu.se,,,,,,,49,8,10,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

This explanation arises in the context of a two-stage model in which mergers are endogenously determined before firms compete in the product 's market.

Before 1850, both nations were ruled by stable dictators who relied on bureaucrats to govern their domains. We hypothesize that agency problems increase with the geographical size of a domain. In a large domain, the ruler's inability to closely monitor bureaucrats creates opportunities for the bureaucrats to exploit taxpayers. To prevent overexploitation, the ruler has to keep taxes low and government small. Our dynamic model shows that while economic expansion improves the ruler's finances in a small domain, it could lead to lower tax revenues in a large domain as it exacerbates bureaucratic expropriation. To check these implications, we assemble comparable quantitative data from primary and secondary sources. We find that the state taxed less and provided fewer local public goods per capita in China than in Japan. Furthermore, while the Tokugawa shogunate's tax revenue grew in tandem with demographic trends, Qing China underwent fiscal contraction after 1750 despite demographic expansion. We conjecture that a greater state capacity might have prepared Japan better for the transition from stagnation to growth.","[Sng, Tuan-Hwee] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Moriguchi, Chiaki] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan",National University of Singapore; Hitotsubashi University,"Sng, TH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",tsng@nus.edu.sg; chiaki@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,"Sng, Tuan-Hwee/0000-0001-6374-0565",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22223003] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,143,39,42,4,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

The study draws information on demographic variables, various financial outcomes including individual credit scores, time and risk preferences, and personality traits, from both population data and experimental data. The results suggest that smokers make poor decisions and experience worse outcomes with personal finances vis-a-vis non-smokers. This relationship is robust to controlling for a myriad of variables, including characteristics that are known to be correlated with smoking. Thus, smoking status contains more precise information about individuals that are not fully captured by available noisy economic and psychological measures. Since available estimates of personality traits have substantial measurement error, smoking status may effectively capture residual information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The interplay of within-group free-riding and across-group competition allows for a wide variety of equilibria, according to how well groups overcome internal free-riding. In contrast with the existing literature, we derive equilibria of a symmetric model in which multiple agents per group are active. Our findings differ qualitatively from those of the individualistic all-pay auction: rents are not necessarily dissipated in equilibrium, total expected efforts vary across equilibria, and participation is expected to be greater. Moreover, equilibria with greater symmetry of behavior within a group are shown to have more wasted effort but also greater payoffs as overall efforts are lower. In contrast to standard economic intuition, free-riding can be beneficial for players as it reduces competition among groups.

We consider a continuous-time, two-country endowment economy, where the level of financial integration is captured by a proportional tax on foreign dividends. Despite the investor heterogeneity induced by this tax, we obtain approximate closed-form expressions for asset prices, and characterize equity holdings and the joint process followed by country-level stock returns in equilibrium. Our model is consistent with a broad range of empirical findings on international financial integration. When the (endogenous) cross-country return correlation is high, small frictions in equity markets can generate a substantial home bias in portfolios. In the baseline version of our model, the cross-country return correlation is driven by the fundamental correlation and portfolio rebalancing. In a two-good extension of the model, the adjustment of relative good prices can generate a high stock return correlation even for a low level of fundamental correlation, magnifying the impact of the financial friction on portfolios. We assess the quantitative performance of the model in a calibration exercise using data from G7 countries. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, students displaced from relatively low-performing schools experience achievement gains. The displacement of students and teachers creates modest negative spillover effects on the receiving schools, however. Hence, the closing of low-performing schools may generate some achievement gains for displaced students, but not without imposing spillover effects on a large number of students in receiving schools.

This benefits borrowers if protection can only be bought with an insurable interest, but can increase the cost of debt and crowd out productive lending if protection can be purchased as a bet on default. We also show that the possibility of speculation on default may cause multiple equilibria and exacerbate the problem of rollover risk.","[Che, Yeon-Koo] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Sethi, Rajiv] Columbia Univ Barnard Coll, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Sethi, Rajiv] Santa Fe Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; The Santa Fe Institute,"Che, YK (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ye2271@columbia.edu; rs328@columbia.edu,"Koo, Yeon/Q-3792-2019; Sethi, Rajiv/AAH-3961-2020","Sethi, Rajiv/0000-0003-2631-5644",,,,,41,22,26,0,13,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

We test our hypothesis using data from an in-play soccer betting market, where new events (goals) are clearly and exogenously defined, and the degree of surprise can be directly quantified (goals scored by underdogs are more surprising).

Thus researchers typically rely on observational designs to evaluate program impacts. To assess the ability of observational designs to replicate the results of experimental designs, researchers use design-replication studies. In our design-replication study, we use data from a large-scale, randomized field experiment that tested the effectiveness of normbased messages designed to induce voluntary reductions in water use. We attempt to replicate the experimental results using a nonrandomized comparison group and statistical techniques to eliminate or mitigate observable and unobservable sources of bias. In a companion study, Ferraro and Miranda (2013a) replicate the experimental estimates by following best practices to select a non-experimental control group, by using a rich data set on observable characteristics that includes repeated pre- and post-treatment outcome measures, and by combining panel data methods and matching designs. We assess whether non-experimental designs continue to replicate the experimental benchmark when the data are far less rich, as is often the case in environmental policy evaluation. Trimming and inverse probability weighting and simple difference-in-differences designs perform poorly. Pre-processing the data by matching and then estimating the treatment effect with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression performs best, but a bootstrapping exercise suggests the performance can be sensitive to the sample (yet far less sensitive than OLS without pre-processing).

For the case of the DAX, the major German stock index, the empirical analysis strongly underpins time variation of risk compensation. The MPR is conditioned upon the EURIBOR, a national and an international term spread, returns of the Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-Index (DOW), and a dummy variable hinting at excess activity of noise traders.

The paper analyses whether shifting government purchases between tradable and non-tradable goods could help reduce external fluctuations without large swings in the overall fiscal stance. The policy rules considered are budgetary-neutral in the sense that the overall level of government expenditure is kept constant. We compare the policy rules to fiscal devaluation as a strategy to reduce external imbalances and find that state-dependent changes in the composition of government purchases between tradables and non-tradables can stabilise excessive fluctuations in the event of economy-wide supply and demand shocks. Contrary to fiscal devaluation, the expenditure-shifting rule faces a trade-off between stabilising domestic activity and enhancing household welfare, on the one hand, and reducing excessive fluctuations in external positions, on the other hand. The excess volatility of domestic variables associated less volatility in the external position implies welfare losses for standard specifications of household utility.

The model is simulated with the realized and forecasted changes in the working-age population ratio, the TFP growth, and government spending in Japan.

The paper also describes the potential contributions of linking existing and new empirical research on water resource adaptation with IAMs. The importance of further empirical economic and political-economic research on the role of water management institutions in adaptation, or maladaptation, to climate change emerges as an important theme.

However, there is a need for a theoretical basis that describes the innovation process based on complexity. In this essay, we propose a multilevel micro-meso-macro framework that aims to meet this need and further the discussion on complexity. In this framework, the rule is adopted as an analytical concept and used to establish a bridge between the several theories employed. Two gaps are identified in the innovation process: the first is related to the simplicity with which complexity is generally treated, and the second refers to a lack of focus on the rules embedded in the theories used in innovation. The goal of this theoretical essay is to propose a multilevel micro-meso-macro framework, based on the rules and principles of complexity, which can be used to analyze the innovation process. As a result, we propose a new framework in which the innovation rules and the interactions between those rules are detailed and based on principles of complexity.","[Pacheco Dias, Marcelo Fernandes] Univ Fed Pelotas, Dept Adm, BR-96010610 Pelotas, RS, Brazil; [Pedrozo, Eugenio Avila; da Silva, Tania Nunes] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Adm, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Pelotas; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Dias, MFP (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Pelotas, Dept Adm, Rua Gomes Carneiro 1, BR-96010610 Pelotas, RS, Brazil.",mfpdias@hotmail.com; eapedrozo@ea.ufrgs.br; tnsilva@ea.ufrgs.br,"Dias, Marcelo/A-2131-2010; DIAS, MARCELO FERNANDES PACHECO/AAE-1458-2019; Pedrozo, Eugenio/H-5339-2016","Dias, Marcelo/0000-0003-4610-0819; DIAS, MARCELO FERNANDES PACHECO/0000-0003-4610-0819; Pedrozo, Eugenio/0000-0002-4751-707X",,,,,38,8,8,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This can generate a time-inconsistency problem. From an ex-ante perspective, Courts will have the ex-post temptation to be excessively lenient. This observation is at the root of the rule of precedent, known as stare decisis. Stare decisis forces Courts to weigh the benefits of leniency towards the current parties against the beneficial effects that tougher decisions have on future ones. We study these dynamics and find that stare decisis guarantees that precedents evolve towards ex-ante efficient decisions, thus alleviating the Courts' time-inconsistency problem. However, the dynamics do not converge to full efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The identifying assumptions are motivated by a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model. Controlling for real and nominal factors, we find that capital investment-specific shocks explain 70 percent of fluctuations of R&D investment, while R&D technology shocks explain 30 percent of the variation of aggregate output, net of R&D investment. Technology shocks jointly explain almost all the variation of output in the R&D sector and 78 percent of the variation of output in the rest of the economy.

Empirical tests have ignored two issues: the large variation in cross-country trade/GDP ratios, which is likely to induce substantial cross-country differences in coefficients when net foreign assets are scaled by GDP, and the reverse causality associated with valuation effects. A real exchange rate appreciation reduces the absolute value of NFA denominated in foreign currency relative to domestic GDP, because of the sizeable component of non-tradable goods in domestic GDP. This endogeneity biases the test results. New tests are implemented that address these issues. The valuation effect bias is found to be significant. The new tests nevertheless still support the existence of a long-run positive relationship between NFA and real exchange rates.","[Bleaney, Michael; Tian, Mo] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Bleaney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",michael.bleaney@nottingham.ac.uk,"Tian, Mo/X-9280-2019","Tian, Mo/0000-0001-9084-0203",,,,,15,5,5,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

By allowing current taxpayers to influence their own future social security benefits, the positive intertemporal tax linkage provides political support for social security. Moreover, this positive tax linkage leads to a negative correlation between wage inequality and the size of a nation's social security system, consistent with the empirical pattern observed across OECD countries.","[Chen, Kaiji] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Song, Zheng] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Emory University; University of Chicago,"Chen, KJ (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",kaiji.chen@emory.edu; zheng.michael.song@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,7,7,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

In our data, a significant reduction in the wage gap has been accompanied by a relative increase in injury risk for some groups of workers, e.g. low-skilled female workers. The decreased gender wage gap for these workers does not necessarily imply an overall improvement in their labor market outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses this information shock associated with the World Cup to show that visibility has a significant impact on trade flows. In isolating the visibility effect, two identification problems are solved. Match outcomes in the World Cup are subject to significant uncertainty. This uncertainty, when combined with controls for economic development, makes World Cup success exogenous to exports. By contrast, hosting the World Cup is potentially endogenous owing to self-selection issues. The paper exploits FIFA's host selection policy to construct exogenous instruments for hosting.

We claim that this omission may have harmful consequences. Should interest rates close to zero persistently decrease natural interest rates that would mean a fall in TFP growth and more limited central bank's capacity to influence aggregated demand and price dynamics. We explain that interest rates close to zero may persistently reduce the natural interest rate because in the economy, requiring post-crisis restructuring, they impede the process of restructuring and facilitate forbearance lending, which crowds viable economic agents out of credit through a number of channels. To reduce these risks, the central bank could voluntarily set a lower bound for interest rates cuts at, for instance, 2%. The boundary appropriate for a given economy should be a function of its growth rate and interest rates in the pre-crisis period. We argue that irrespectively of the central bank's credibility such a change in the monetary policy conducting in economies requiring post-crisis restructuring would bring better outcomes than keeping interest rates close to zero.","[Cizkowicz, Piotr] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Rzonca, Andrzej] Warsaw Sch Econ, Natl Bank Poland, Monetary Policy Council, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Warsaw School of Economics; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Cizkowicz, P (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",pcizko@sgh.waw.pl; andrzej.rzonca@nbp.pl,,,,,,,54,2,2,1,16,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Particularly, we identify organizational forms within the population according to two different perspectives: an operational one and an institutional one. We argue that deregulation influences the relative importance of each of these dimensions at determining the set of firms that can be considered direct competitors, and the intensity with which they compete. Our findings show that the use of these two perspectives is of utmost importance to understand the evolution of competition in contexts where deregulation takes place. As our arguments predict, we show that, during the regulated period, competition was based on institutional definitions of organizational forms. However, after deregulation, competition progressively focused on operational definitions of organizational form. Our findings confirm the relevance of deregulation at shaping competitive interdependences within an industry.","[Gomez, Jaime] Univ la Rioja, Generes Res Grp, Dept Econ & Empresa, Logrono 26004, Spain; [Orcos, Raquel] Univ Zaragoza, Univ San Pablo CEU, Dept Econ Empresa, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Palomas, Sergio] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Direcc & Org Empresas, Generes Res Grp, Zaragoza 50018, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja; San Pablo CEU University; University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Orcos, R (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Univ San Pablo CEU, Dept Econ Empresa, Julian Romea 23, Madrid 28003, Spain.",jaime.gomez@unirioja.es; raquel.orcossanchez@ceu.es; spalomas@unizar.es,"ORCOS, RAQUEL/ABF-8188-2020; Gomez, Jaime/C-6929-2014; Palomas Dona, Sergio/K-2371-2014","Gomez, Jaime/0000-0003-0603-5725; Palomas Dona, Sergio/0000-0001-8406-3540",,,,,89,4,5,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This game is known to lack equilibria in pure strategies, while the mixed-strategy equilibria are hard to characterize. We explore families of heuristic rules for individual price-setting behavior and the resulting market patterns, through simulations of agent-based models and laboratory experiments. Overall, the individual pricing strategies observed experimentally can be represented approximately by a sales-based simple rule. In the experiments, average market prices tend to converge from above and approach a state resembling a steady state, with slow aggregate price variations and low price dispersion around an average near the competitive level. However, that configuration can be disturbed occasionally by excursions triggered by discrete price raises of some agents. Salient features of experimental results can be described by simulations where agents use sales-based heuristics with parameters calibrated from the experiments. The results obtained here suggest the existence of useful complementarities between analytical, experimental and agent-based simulation approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We do something nice for someone and they do something nice in return. Several motives might underlie such behavior, including altruism, strategic motives, and direct or indirect positive reciprocity. It is not yet well-understood how these fit together to affect behavior, how they interact in various institutional structures, and how they play out over time. We use a laboratory experiment to study the elements and dynamics of favor trading in a particular setting: the private provision of a public good. In our experiment, giving subjects the ability to practice targeted reciprocity by making a simple, low-cost change in information provision increases contributions to the public good by 14 %. Subjects reward group members who have previously been generous to them and withhold rewards from ungenerous group members. Strategic concerns cannot explain all of this behavior, and it must be at least partly due to direct reciprocity. When someone cannot directly benefit from favor trading, he gives much less to the public good. People thus excluded from the circle of reciprocity provide a clean and strict test of indirect reciprocity. Contrary to previous studies in the literature, we do not observe indirect reciprocity.","[Jacobson, Sarah] Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Petrie, Ragan] George Mason Univ, ICES, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Williams College; George Mason University,"Jacobson, S (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, 24 Hopkins Hall Dr, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",Sarah.A.Jacobson@williams.edu; rpetrie1@gmu.edu,"Petrie, Ragan/AAQ-2892-2021","Petrie, Ragan/0000-0002-9101-1666",,,,,47,7,7,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

However, studies have namely dealt with the relationship between financial and energy markets. With the recent changes in market conditions, investors, policy-makers and interest groups are giving special attention to food market. This paper aims at analyzing shock transmission between international food, energy and financial markets and to provide some insights into the volatility behavior during the past years and discuss its implications for portfolio management. To do this, we present a new time varying parameter VAR (TVP-VAR) model with stochastic volatility approach which provides extreme flexibility with a parsimonious specification. We resort also to a generalized vector autoregressive framework in which forecast-error variance decompositions are invariant to the variable ordering for the assessment of total and directional volatility spillovers. Our main findings suggest that volatility spillovers increase considerably during crisis and, namely after mid-2008, when stock markets become net transmitter of volatility shocks while crude oil becomes a net receiver. Shocks to crude oil or MSCI markets have immediate and short-term impacts on food markets which are emphasized during the financial crisis period. Moreover, we show that augmenting a diversified portfolio of food commodities with crude oil or stocks significantly increases its risk-adjusted performance. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V.

Players can communicate costlessly at each stage: communication can be public, private or a mixture of both. Payoffs are assumed to be sensitive to unilateral deviations. First, for any network, a folk theorem holds if some Joint Pairwise Identifiability condition regarding payoff functions is satisfied.

Recently, there has been renewed debate within the literature about whether these switching costs lead to higher prices. We build a theoretical model of dynamic competition and solve it analytically for a wide range of switching costs. We provide a simple condition which determines whether switching costs raise or lower long-run prices. We also show that even if switching costs reduce prices in the long run, they may still increase prices in the short run. Finally, switching costs redistribute surplus across time, and as such are shown to sometimes increase consumer welfare.","Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31015 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Rhodes, A (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse, France.",andrew.rhodes@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,27,31,35,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The sample countries are segmented into three separate panels: a developed bank-based panel, a developed market-based panel, and an emerging bank-based panel. Empirical estimates support the existence of long- and short-run stock market wealth effects in both groups of developed countries, with the effect being particularly strong in the developed market-based countries. A moderate long-run housing wealth effect is confirmed only for the developed bank-based countries, while a very strong short-run housing wealth effect is present in the developed market-based countries.

At this level, a choice decision is defined in terms of a set of alternatives representing different 'varieties' of a particular product differentiated mainly by their quality attributes rather than just prices. Individuals making these choice decisions are also differentiated by their socioeconomic characteristics rather than just income level. DC models therefore are rich in details which are relevant for policies at a microeconomic and intra-sectoral level. In contrast, continuous demand (CD) models are specialized in describing aggregate behaviour at an intersectoral level. DC and CD models are therefore complements rather than substitutes and increasingly, there is a need to combine the use of both types of models to look at activities at a microeconomic and intra-sectoral level but at the same rime measuring the impacts of these activities at a macroeconomic and economy-wide level. Using both of these types of models within a single framework (such as that of a spatial general equilibrium model) requires solutions to some theoretical and empirical issues because the two types of models are based on different theoretical approaches and also use different types of data. This paper looks at these issues and presents a way of overcoming the differences and combines the specialisations of both types of models in a coherent and consistent manner. The paper also presents an empirical study to illustrate the usefulness of the methodology suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

They foresee a fundamental shift of economic and political power away from the West that will transform the world economy and global politics. I argue that, notwithstanding emerging Asia's undoubted economic achievements, this claim is premature and potentially misleading for three main reasons: implicit in many of these claims are implausible historical analogies with earlier eras of European and American dominance; linear projections of continued Asian growth outperformance may not be realised in practice; and even if rapid growth were to be sustained, the domestic and external obstacles to the collective global influence of Asia will probably remain profound. The implication is that businesses, citizens and policy-makers, especially those operating in the Asian region, will face a much more uncertain and challenging environment than is sometimes acknowledged.","[Walter, Andrew] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Walter, Andrew] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Govt, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Walter, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",Andrew.walter@unimelb.edu.au,"Walter, Andrew/AAG-1700-2020","Walter, Andrew/0000-0003-1538-7896",,,,,25,1,1,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

Applying input output (10) techniques, we calculate these emissions in (1) a standard model, (2) a regionally disaggregated model, taking into account that export production is concentrated in more advanced and more emission efficient provinces and (3) in a model with export processing, taking into account that almost half of the Chinese exports rely on a large share of imported intermediates and little domestic value and emissions added. We compare year 2007 emissions embodied in Chinese exports in a unified framework. We also report emissions embodied in Chinese imports used for intermediate production of exports by combining calculations for China with data from global ID models. We find that both a model with 30 provinces (1730 Mt CO2) and a model accounting for export processing (1630 Mt) yield lower Chinese emissions embodied in exports compared to the standard model (1782 Mt). In the regional model, emissions are even lower (1522 Mt), if interprovincial trade is not taken into account. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The results suggest that low trade openness, shallow financial markets, and current account imbalances increase the likelihood that a sudden stop will be followed by a currency crash.

Examples are a temporary fiscal stimulus funded permanently through an increase in the stock of base money and permanent QE - an irreversible, monetized open market purchase by the Central Bank of non-monetary sovereign - debt. Three conditions must be satisfied for helicopter money always to boost aggregate demand. First, there must be benefits from holding fiat base money other than its pecuniary rate of return. Second, fiat base money is irredeemable - viewed as an asset by the holder but not as a liability by the issuer. Third, the price of money is positive. Given these three conditions, there always exists - even in a permanent liquidity trap - a combined monetary and fiscal policy action that boosts private demand - in principle without limit. Deflation, 'lowflation' and secular stagnation are therefore unnecessary. They are policy choices.","Citigroup Global Markets Inc, New York, NY 10013 USA",,"Buiter, WH (通讯作者)，Citigroup Global Markets Inc, 388 Greenwich St, New York, NY 10013 USA.",willem.buiter@citi.com,,,,,,,47,25,27,1,21,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,AUG 21,2014,8,,,,,,,,201428.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-28,0.0,,,52,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AP9OG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342408500001,0

One is the use of tax thresholds to partition taxpayers into those who are liable to pay tax and those who are not. The other is the notion of 'informality' as a central challenge for tax design and implementation. Several insights emerge. First, the results make clear that the term 'informal' as used in the literature is imprecise and can consequently be very misleading: the models reveal a range of compliant and non-compliant behaviors with very different welfare and revenue implications. Second, the various forms of behavior considered suggest optimal thresholds generally higher than would otherwise be the case, with quite complicated implications for the associated patterns of (non)-compliance. Third, when (as is realistic) firms and individuals face multiple tax and non-tax obligations, the setting of optimal thresholds is considerably more complex.","[Kanbur, Ravi] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA; [Keen, Michael] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Cornell University; International Monetary Fund,"Keen, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",sk145@cornell.edu; mkeen@imf.org,,,,,,,37,23,25,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We address this question using 1970-2010 national balance sheets recently compiled in the top eight developed economies. For the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France, we are able to extend our analysis as far back as 1700. We find in every country a gradual rise' of wealth-income ratios in recent decades, from about 200-300% in 1970 to 400-600% in 2010. In effect, today's ratios appear to be returning to the high values observed in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (600-700%). This can be explained by a long-run asset price recovery (itself driven by changes in capital policies since the world wars) and by the slowdown of productivity and population growth, in line with the beta=s/g Harrod-Domar-Solow formula. That is, for a given net saving rate s = 10%, the long-run wealth-income ratio beta is about 300% if g = 3% and 600% if g = 1.5%. Our results have implications for capital taxation and regulation and shed new light on the changing nature of wealth, the shape of the production function, and the rise of capital shares.","[Piketty, Thomas] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; London Sch Econ, London, England; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA",Paris School of Economics; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Piketty, T (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",,"MOTREB, ayoub EL/AAB-1710-2019",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,49,438,484,6,126,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We simulate two alternative growth scenarios: a balanced one in which China's productivity grows at the same rate in each sector, and an unbalanced one in which China's comparative disadvantage sectors catch up disproportionately faster to the world productivity frontier. Contrary to a well-known conjecture (Samuelson 2004), the large majority of countries experience significantly larger welfare gains when China's productivity growth is biased toward its comparative disadvantage sectors.

In this paper, I introduce incumbent policy persistence in a dynamic game of electoral competition between two policy-motivated parties and characterise the long-run outcomes of its Markov perfect equilibria. Incumbents' reduced policy flexibility leads to alternation in power and policy dynamics that converge to alternations at policies equally preferred by the median voter. Convergence of policies towards the median is a robust equilibrium outcome while convergence to the median is not; while alternations far from the median are never limits of equilibrium dynamics, alternations close to the median can be reached only if policy dynamics start exactly there. I show that these results are robust to voters being forward-looking and to limited policy commitment by parties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Tighter deadlines and higher penalties induce higher effort, but increase the agent's risk. We model how these contract terms affect the work rate and time-to-completion in a procurement setting, characterizing the efficient contract design. Using new micro-level data on Minnesota highway construction contracts that includes day-by-day information on work plans, hours worked and delays, we find evidence of ex post moral hazard: contractors adjust their effort level during the course of the contract in response to unanticipated productivity shocks, in a way that is consistent with our theoretical predictions. We next build an econometric model that endogenizes the completion time as a function of the contract terms and the productivity shocks, and simulate how commuter welfare and contractor costs vary across different terms and shocks. Accounting for the traffic delays caused by construction, switching to a more efficient contract design would increase welfare by 22.5% of the contract value while increasing the standard deviation of contractor costs-a measure of risk-by less than 1% of the contract value.","[Lewis, Gregory] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lewis, Gregory; Bajari, Patrick] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bajari, Patrick] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Lewis, G (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,35,40,47,3,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

I can then investigate differences for constrained and unconstrained blocks close to the quota limits and test for sorting around the limits. I find that price differences are between 3% and 5%.

We used a world trade computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with endogenous FDI from Japan to China to quantify the impact of the power crisis on the Japanese manufacturing sectors.

For this, we employ a general-equilibrium model with overlapping generations and individuals who differ in their abilities. At the first stage, governments can choose the quality of education and the financing system. At the second stage, individuals make their education and migration decisions given the governmental framework for higher education and the mobility assumptions. In a closed economy and in the presence of imperfect credit markets, a mix of tax- and fee-financing is optimal. In integrated labor markets, countries have an incentive to attract skilled workers and to free-ride on education provided by other countries. When only skilled workers are mobile, there is a suboptimal shift from taxes to fees and the number of students is too low. When also students can migrate, there is a countervailing force such that maintaining the optimal financial mix becomes possible.","[Demange, Gabrielle] Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France; [Demange, Gabrielle] CESifo, F-75014 Paris, France; [Fenge, Robert] Univ Rostock, D-18057 Rostock, Germany; [Fenge, Robert] CESifo, D-18057 Rostock, Germany; [Uebelmesser, Silke] Univ Jena, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Uebelmesser, Silke] CESifo, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Paris School of Economics; University of Rostock; Ifo Institut; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Ifo Institut,"Demange, G (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",demange@pse.ens.fr; Robert.Fenge@uni-rostock.de; silke.uebelmesser@uni-jena.de,,"Uebelmesser, Silke/0000-0001-5889-9061",,,,,28,14,14,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Furthermore, in the presence of an audience, the contributions to the public goods do not diminish when the game is repeated in the effort-required environment.

Results of these analyses indicate general anticipation of decreased total project costs in case of international sharing of armaments projects, along with increased project transparency, which can be viewed as one of the generators of decreased total costs.

J,"Leong, W; Hensher, DA",,,,"Leong, Waiyan; Hensher, David A.",,,Relative advantage maximisation as a model of context dependence for binary choice data,JOURNAL OF CHOICE MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Relative advantage maximisation; Random regret minimisation; Binary choice data; Marginal willingness to pay,REGRET MINIMIZATION,"In recent years we have seen a burgeoning literature, within a discrete choice modelling setting, focussing on capturing increased behavioural realism in decision making through the use of alternative specifications of the utility function. One notable example is the increasing popularity of the random regret minimisation (RRM) model, in which respondents are assumed to choose the alternative that minimises the negative emotions associated with decision making. In this paper, we discuss a 'relative advantage maximisation' (RAM) model, which shares some similar characteristics to the RRM model in terms of how contextual effects in the choice set are accounted for. The key feature of the RAM model is the relative advantage component which frames the comparison of an attribute against its counterparts in all other alternatives in the choice set as either an advantage or a disadvantage. The relative advantage is so named because of the assumption that it is the advantage of an alternative relative to the sum of its advantage and disadvantage that matters in the utility function. Although the RRM model has been successfully applied to choice sets with three or more alternatives, with binary choice data, one significant limitation to its scope is that the RRM model collapses to the standard RUM model. This is not the case with the RAM model, and so the notion of context dependency is still meaningfully preserved under RAM. Using the MNL model, we find that the RAM model performs no worse than the RUM model in all six binary choice datasets analysed. In some cases, a small but significant improvement in model fit is observed. However, more advanced models such as the error components and random parameters logit present a more empirically mixed picture for the RAM model. Marginal willingness to pay (WTP) measures derived from the RAM model are also discussed. Differences may be negligible in the MNL case, but not necessarily so for the random parameter logit.

Comparison with the findings in Hochberg et al. (2007) indicates that networks are more important for investment performance in China than in the US.

Moreover, there exist policy combinations of trade and investment liberalisation, whereby the domestic firms' profitability is traded off with the host country's social welfare when the foreign firm provides a service through FDI or through outsourcing, respectively.

We identify the necessary conditions under which pooling contracts are optimal, and we characterize the optimal fixed price and the optimal quantity of health services according to the value of the fixed costs.","[Mougeot, Michel; Naegelen, Florence] Univ Franche Comte, UFR SJEPG, CRESE, F-25000 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte,"Naegelen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, UFR SJEPG, CRESE, 45 D Ave Observ, F-25000 Besancon, France.",michel.mougeot@univ-fcomte.fr; florence.naegelen@univ-fcomte.fr,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,7,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

The model is applied to predict the U.S. and German business cycle recession and expansion periods.

A redistribution policy generally causes lower growth, but less so when economic efficiency is higher. The model implies that high (endogenous) tax rates may not necessarily imply low growth. The paper shows that the long-run cross-country relationship between growth and endogenous policy is generally not clear-cut. But it is shown that this relies on conditions that can be used for identification in empirical research.

We assume that the traded (non-traded) sector uses skilled (unskilled) labour for production. The theoretical model reveals that the real exchange rate (RER) response to a productivity shock depends on the countries' relative abundance of skilled labour: a rise in traded productivity leads to a higher RER appreciation in a country whose relative skilled labour rate is high. Using panel data, structural break tests confirm that the skilled versus unskilled labour ratio may be a significant splitting variable. In the long run, the relationship between productivity and RER may be positive or negative, as suggested by the theoretical model, depending on the country's relative abundance of skilled labour.

Bargaining ends when proposers are unable or unwilling to amend the existing default, which is then implemented. Our main goal is to study the policies that can be implemented from any initial default in a pure-strategy stationary Markov perfect equilibrium for an interesting class of environments including multidimensional and infinite policy spaces. It is convenient to start by characterizing the set of immovable policies that are implemented, once reached as default. These policies form a weakly stable set and, conversely, any weakly stable set is supported by some equilibrium. Using these results, we show that minimum-winning coalitions may not form and that a player who does not propose may nevertheless earn all of the surplus from agreement. We then consider how equilibrium outcomes change as we vary the order in which players propose, the identity of proposers, and the set of winning coalitions. First, if the policy space is well ordered, then the committee implements the ideal policy of the last proposer in a subset of a weakly stable set, but this result does not generalize to other cases. We also show, surprisingly, that a player may prefer not to be given the opportunity to propose and that the set of immovable policies may shrink as the quota increases. Finally, we derive conditions under which immovable policies in semi-Markovian equilibria form a consistent choice set.","[Anesi, Vincent; Seidmann, Daniel J.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Anesi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",vincent.anesi@nottingham.ac.uk; daniel.seidmann@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Seidmann, Daniel/0000-0003-1252-324X; Anesi, Vincent/0000-0003-4424-2581",,,,,44,15,16,1,16,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Beginning with a brief examination of the origins of 'mercantilism' and the evolution of perceptions of it, we examine the various readings proposed of 'mercantilist' writings (classical 'reconstruction', the German historical school and then contemporary work). The 'deconstruction' undertaken here does not aim to demonstrate that pre-classical writings were devoid of any conceptualisation or internal coherence. However, contemporary readers must make some effort to grasp the concepts used and engage with the proposals made. To this end it might be useful to propose an initial classification of authors based on their social position. The paper identifies different categories of writers and proposes new combinations of authors, reflecting the range of economic, and especially monetary, thinking of the period, with reference to the position of those authors relative to the spheres of government in Europe. This categorisation takes account of the social position of the authors, so as to identify any implications it might have for their concerns and their proposals. We first identify three categories of writers who are generally outside those spheres (late scholastics, economic philosophers and pamphleteers); then two categories of 'insiders' (officers of the mint and treasury administrators). The closeness of authors to the regime significantly influenced their writings.","[Blanc, Jerome] Univ Lyon 2, F-69365 Lyon 07, France; [Desmedt, Ludovic] Univ Bourgogne, Cemf LEG CNRS, F-21004 Dijon, France",Universite Lyon 2; Universite de Bourgogne,"Desmedt, L (通讯作者)，Pole Econ Gest, 2 Bd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France.",Ludovic.Desmedt@u-bourgogne.fr,,"Blanc, Jerome/0000-0003-4761-7086",,,,,106,4,4,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We show that even when aid is systematically misallocated, aid recipients may match official classifications of needy households if agents deviate from allocation rules in ways that are difficult to monitor. Agent behavior is therefore best understood by comparing aid along dimensions of need that are visible to the principal with those that are difficult to observe outside the village. We do this by using data on a panel of 943 households observed over six rounds of the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey. In support of our model, we find that while the demographics of aid recipients do match official criteria, disbursements are increasing in pre-aid consumption, self-reported power and involvement in village-level organizations. We conclude that the extent to which food aid insulates some of the world's poorest families from agricultural shocks depends on a nuanced interaction of policy constraints and informal structures of local power.

Conflicting results exist in the case studies examining the most advanced countries, partly due to the deterrent effect of clean technology adoptions on industry migration. To minimize the clean technology effect, we examine the pattern of South Korean FDI over 2000-2007, the period that Korean firms relied on old production technologies despite facing rapidly strengthened environmental standards. A difference-in-differences type identification strategy circumvents other potential confounders. We find strong evidence that polluting industries tend to invest more in countries with taxer environmental regulations in terms of both the amount of investment (intensive margin) and the number of new foreign affiliates (extensive margin). A similar finding is obtained when imports are analyzed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Results demonstrate that the direct impact of household characteristics on residential energy consumption is significantly smaller than the corresponding impact from the buildings. However, accounting for the indirect impact of household characteristics on energy consumption, through choice of the housing unit characteristics, the total impact of households on energy consumption is just slightly smaller than that of buildings.

Three socioeconomic groups are involved: two elite groups and workers, whose preferences regarding trade policy and income taxation are derived from a simple open-economy model. The critical point is that income taxation induces a rich-poor/elite-workers political cleavage, while trade policy opens the door to intra-elite conflict. In this model, when there is no intra-elite conflict, changes in trade policy are associated with political transitions. Coups (democratizations) open up the economy if and only if both elite groups are pro-free-trade (protectionist). However, in the presence of intra-elite conflict, autocracies respond to popular revolts by changing trade policy and reallocating political power within the elite (to the elite group with the same trade policy preference as the workers) rather than offering to democratize the country. The change in trade policy is credible because the elite group with the same trade policy preference as the workers controls the autocracy. Moreover, in the presence of intra-elite conflict, coups tend to result in the maintenance of the existing trade policy unless popular demands are extremely radical and/or the elite group with the same trade policy preference as the workers is exceptionally weak.

Using an analytically tractable small open economy model, we characterize the impact of the trade composition on the policy trade-off and on the role played by the exchange rate in correcting for price misalignments. Contrary to models where openness can be summarized by the degree of home bias, we find that openness can be a poor proxy of the welfare impact of alternative monetary policies. Using input-output data for 25 countries we document substantial differences in the import and non-tradable content of final demand components, and in the role played by imported inputs in domestic production. The estimates are used in a richer small-open-economy DSGE model to quantify the loss from an exchange rate peg relative to the Ramsey policy conditional on the composition of imports.

These bounds are explicit expressions that involve type-sensitivity, optimism, and payoff characteristics. Our results generalize and clarify the well-known uniqueness result of global games (Carlsson and van Damme, 1993).

The author, who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, argues that single. policies adopted only at a global scale are unlikely to generate sufficient trust among citizens and firms so that collective action can take place in a comprehensive and transparent manner that will effectively reduce global warming. Furthermore, simply recommending a single governmental unit to solve global collective action problems is inherently weak because of free-rider problems. For example, the Carbon Development Mechanism (CDM) can be 'gamed' in ways that hike up prices of natural resources and in some cases can lead to further natural resource exploitation. Some flaws are also noticeable in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) program. Both the CDM and REDD are vulnerable to the free-rider problem. As an alternative, the paper proposes a polycentric approach at various levels with active oversight of local, regional, and national stakeholders. Efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions are a classic collective action problem that is best addressed at multiple scales and levels. Given the slowness and conflict involved in achieving a global solution to climate change, recognizing the potential for building a more effective way of reducing green house gas emissions at multiple levels is an important step forward. A polycentric approach has the main advantage of encouraging experimental efforts at multiple levels, leading to the development of methods for assessing the benefits and costs of particular strategies adopted in one type of ecosystem and compared to results obtained in other ecosystems. Building a strong commitment to find ways of reducing individual emissions is an important element for coping with this problem, and having others also take responsibility can be more effectively undertaken in small- to medium-scale governance units that are linked together through information networks and monitoring at all levels.

We discuss two specific contexts in which such incentives arise. In the first, refraining from the activity causes others to attach higher value to it because it becomes scarce. In the second, restraint serves to conceal the actor's intrinsic motivation. In both cases, not engaging in the activity causes others to offer larger rewards. Our theory yields the testable prediction that such effects are likely to occur when a motivated actor enjoys a sufficient degree of 'market power.' (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Standard economic theory, specifically, has defined work as a means to income and consumption; it has failed to grasp the importance of work as an end in its own right. The aim of the paper is to develop an alternative conception of work that captures the formative impacts of work on the well-being of workers. The paper firstly outlines and criticises the different definitions of the disutility of work found in economics. It then offers a critical assessment of happiness research on work. The idea that the effects of work on worker well-being can be captured by job satisfaction data and that the importance of work can be reduced to a subjective feeling in the heads of individual workers - two key aspects of happiness research - are challenged. The final part of the paper develops novel ideas about how the economics of work should progress in the future. The section proposes a needs-based conception of work and then uses this conception to make the case for collective intervention aimed at enhancing the quality of work life.","Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Spencer, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",das@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,13,17,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2014,67,2,,,,,280,294,,10.1111/kykl.12054,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AI9TG,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337279300007,0

In this article, we measure the effect of grade retention on Spanish students' achievement by using data from Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). We find that grade retention has a negative impact on educational outcomes, but we confirm the importance of endogenous selection which makes observed differences between repeaters and nonrepeaters appear about 14% lower than they actually are. The effect on scores of repeating is much smaller (-10% of nonrepeaters' average) than the counterfactual reduction that nonrepeaters would suffer had they been retained as repeaters (-24% of their average). Furthermore, those who repeated a grade during primary education suffered more than those who repeated a grade in secondary school, although the effect of repeating at both times is, as expected, larger.","[Ignacio Garcia-Perez, J.; Hidalgo-Hidalgo, Marisa; Antonio Robles-Zurita, J.] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"García-Pérez, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",jigarper@upo.es,"Garcia Perez, J Ignacio/JWP-2410-2024; Garcia Perez, Jose Ignacio/D-2755-2009; Hidalgo, Marisa/K-1164-2014","Garcia Perez, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-9074-7313; Robles-Zurita, Jose/0000-0002-3862-8798; Hidalgo, Marisa/0000-0001-9813-7766",,,,,31,49,58,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Simple theory thus suggests that an unregulated vehicle fleet is inefficiently heavy. Using three separate identification strategies we show that, controlling for own-vehicle weight, being hit by a vehicle that is 1000 pounds heavier generates a 40-50% increase in fatality risk. These results imply a total accident-related externality that exceeds the estimated social cost of US carbon emissions and is equivalent to a gas tax of $0.97 per gallon ($136 billion annually). We consider two policies for internalizing this external cost, a weight-varying mileage tax and a gas tax, and find that they are similar for most vehicles. The findings suggest that European gas taxes may be much closer to optimal levels than the US gas tax.","[Anderson, Michael L.; Auffhammer, Maximilian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Anderson, Michael L.; Auffhammer, Maximilian] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Anderson, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Anderson, Michael/0000-0002-4079-1965",,,,,48,68,82,1,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We allow for the number of regressors to be larger than the sample size. To make informative inference feasible, we require the model to be approximately sparse; that is, we require that the effect of confounding factors can be controlled for up to a small approximation error by including a relatively small number of variables whose identities are unknown. The latter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by selecting approximately the right set of regressors. We develop a novel estimation and uniformly valid inference method for the treatment effect in this setting, called the post-double-selection method. The main attractive feature of our method is that it allows for imperfect selection of the controls and provides confidence intervals that are valid uniformly across a large class of models. In contrast, standard post-model selection estimators fail to provide uniform inference even in simple cases with a small, fixed number of controls. Thus, our method resolves the problem of uniform inference after model selection for a large, interesting class of models. We also present a generalization of our method to a fully heterogeneous model with a binary treatment variable. We illustrate the use of the developed methods with numerical simulations and an application that considers the effect of abortion on crime rates.","[Belloni, Alexandre] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Chernozhukov, Victor] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hansen, Christian] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Duke University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago,"Belloni, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1061841] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,63,577,758,13,93,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

While natural disasters are different from other economic events; the research concerns that the impact on macroeconomic performance from disasters is increasing substantially. Consequently, one may consider disasters similar to economic frustration (Okuyama, 2003) such as a recession phase in a business cycle, while some research findings show natural disasters can bring about some long-term economic benefits, which potentially may lead to Schumpeterian gale of creative destruction. Motivated by this, the paper utilises a Post-Keynesian framework and uses historical data Structural VAR model, and impulse response analysis to explore the relationship between natural disasters, productivity and investment within a two-simultaneous equation system, then it attempts to examine if findings lead to creative destruction (or broken window). The finding allows to conclude that occurrence of major natural disasters in the state of QLD do appear to have resulted in improved innovation, indicating the technology is improving, as a result of the natural disaster, this can be due to increase in the speed at which new innovations are brought to market.

Our results confirm that China is a net carbon exporter, but also reveal that China's exports are relatively less polluting than China's imports: the big carbon surplus embodied in trade is due to China's large scale of exports and its high carbon emission intensity compared to its trade partners. In a second step, we directly study the determinants of the comparative advantage of China's international trade with the purpose of verifying whether the increase of the carbon burden in China is due to the transfer of the comparative advantage of the polluting sectors from Annex I countries to China, according to the hypothesis of carbon leakage'. Our analyses confirm that China's comparative advantages are more concentrated in the less polluting, labor-intensive sectors, although, dynamically speaking, this economy also experienced a tendency of comparative advantage increases in carbon-intensive sectors for its trade with European countries owing to their increase (decrease) of carbon intensity, but not for the trade with the carbon club countries such as the US and Japan. This finding seems to provide a first piece of supportive evidence for the existence of carbon leakage' phenomenon. Our conclusion also reveals that current international production division is organized with little consideration for the environmental performance of the producers in different countries; this organizational issue might be the principal reason for the current, often-observed BEET surplus in international trade of the non-Annex I country, while the transfer of a comparative advantage in the carbon-intensive sectors plays only a marginal role.","[He, Jie] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Econ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Fu, Jingyan] Jinan Univ, Dept Int Trade & Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Sherbrooke; Jinan University,"He, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Econ, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",Jie.He@usherbrooke.ca,,,,,,,38,12,12,2,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In this paper, we first develop a formal model of hybrid instruments and show that, for a given pair of countries, firms in at least one country and sometimes in both can avoid taxes on investment in the other country with a cross-border hybrid instrument. We then investigate why countries tend to allow the use of hybrid instruments for tax avoidance and show that even if effective anti-avoidance rules are available, there exists a global policy equilibrium in which no country uses such rules.

It shows that women's fertility and their labor supply when young are affected by such policies. The overall effect can be decomposed into an opportunity-cost effect and a consumption-smoothing effect that each impact fertility as well as labor supply in opposite directions. Using survey data, the paper provides some evidence that in the member states of the European Union the consumption-smoothing effect is dominant.","[Korn, Evelyn] Univ Marburg, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Wrede, Matthias] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-90402 Nurnberg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Wrede, M (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Findelgasse 7, D-90402 Nurnberg, Germany.",korn@wiwi.uni-marburg.de; matthias.wrede@wiso.uni-erlangen.de,,"Korn, Evelyn/0000-0002-6477-3649; Wrede, Matthias/0000-0001-8376-517X",,,,,37,4,4,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In a competitive market their firms lack efficiency and are therefore forced to leave. We present new empirical evidence for this prediction by studying the survival of start-up firms in longitudinal matched employer-employee data. We find that firms with strong preferences for discrimination approximated by a low share of female employees relative to the industry average have significantly shorter survival rates. This is especially relevant for firms starting out with female shares in the lower tail of the distribution. Competition at the industry level additionally reduces firm survival and accelerates the rate at which prejudiced firms are weeded out. We also find evidence for employer learning as highly discriminatory start-up firms that manage to survive submit to market powers and increase their female workforce over time.","[Weber, Andrea] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Zulehner, Christine] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria; [Zulehner, Christine] Wifo Vienna, Vienna, Austria",University of Mannheim; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Weber, A (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",a.weber@uni-mannheim.de; christine.zulehner@jku.at,"Weber, Andrea/V-4530-2018","Weber, Andrea/0000-0001-8444-4538; Zulehner, Christine/0000-0002-5591-3830",,,,,44,21,26,2,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Specifically, we find that a long-run cointegrated relationship exists between renewable energy consumption per capita, real GDP per capita, carbon emissions per capita, real coal prices, and real oil prices with the respective coefficients positive and statistically significant. A structural break in the cointegrating relationship appears in 2002 which coincides with the establishment of the Energy and Environment Partnership with Central America initiative to expand the use of renewable energy sources. Recognizing the regime shift in 2002, we estimate a nonlinear panel smooth transition vector error correction model to show that for the post-2002 period, the influence of renewable energy consumption per capita upon real coal and oil prices strengthened relative to the pre-2002 period as well as a greater sensitivity of real GDP per capita to carbon emissions per capita.

The Qing Empire (1644-1911), the world's largest national economy before 1800, experienced a tripling of population during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with no signs of diminishing per capita income. While the timing remains in dispute, a vast gap emerged between newly rich industrial nations and China's lagging economy in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. Only with an unprecedented growth spurt beginning in the late 1970s did this great divergence separating China from the global leaders substantially diminish, allowing China to regain its former standing among the world's largest economies. This essay develops an integrated framework for understanding that entire history, including both the divergence and the recent convergent trend. We explain how deeply embedded political and economic institutions that contributed to a long process of extensive growth before 1800 subsequently prevented China from capturing the benefits associated with the Industrial Revolution. During the twentieth century, the gradual erosion of these historic constraints and of new obstacles erected by socialist planning eventually opened the door to China's current boom. Our analysis links China's recent development to important elements of its past, while using recent success to provide fresh perspectives on the critical obstacles undermining earlier modernization efforts, and their eventual removal.","[Brandt, Loren] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Ma, Debin] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ma, Debin] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Rawski, Thomas G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",University of Toronto; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Brandt, L (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,382,126,140,9,109,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

We investigate pricing problems of both infinite- and finite-maturity stock loans under a hyper-exponential jump diffusion model. In the infinite-maturity case, we derive closed-form formulas for stock loan prices and deltas by solving the related optimal stopping problem explicitly. Moreover, we obtain a sufficient and necessary condition under which the optimal stopping time is finite with probability one. In the finite-maturity case, we provide analytical approximations to both stock loan prices and deltas by solving an ordinary integro-differential equation as well as a complicated non-linear system. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the approximation methods for both prices and deltas are accurate, fast, and easy to implement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While current project management techniques are well defined in terms of content and process to manage the budget-scope-time constraint, availability of organization resources and ability to adopt project governance strategies in a changing business environment, like incorporating sustainability in business process is ambiguous, literature has not explored how to cope with a normative situation like sustainability. We consider Small-to-Mid-Size-Construction-Organizations (SMSCOs), which makes up the largest portion of the project-based industry and are most impacted by new government regulations, as our population of interest. This paper addresses two primary objectives in relation to organizational resources available for SMSCOs: to identify an organization's shortcomings in undertaking a sustainable project, and to identify means for improving organizational readiness to cope with governance of sustainable projects. A case study with a SMSCO to understand activities, resource availability, and how to improve organization readiness to undertake projects related to sustainability is discussed. A conceptual framework is presented for the adoptive project governance process to ensure resource constrained organizations like SMSCO's can align better to govern such projects.","[Ghosh, Saumyendu; Skibniewski, Mirosiaw J.; Negahban, Sam] Univ Maryland, Univ Coll, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Skibniewski, Mirosiaw J.] State Maryland, Dept Gen Serv, Off Energy Performance & Conservat, Baltimore, MD USA; [Negahban, Sam] Acad Sci Inst Theoret & Appl Informat, Gliwice, Poland; [Kwak, Young Hoon] Brawner Builders, Baltimore, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland University College; University of Maryland College Park; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Theoretical & Applied Informatics of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Ghosh, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Univ Coll, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",sghosh12@umd.edu,"Skibniewski, Miroslaw J./P-5310-2018; Ghosh, Saumyendu/GNM-9191-2022; Kwak, Young Hoon/A-9002-2009","Skibniewski, Miroslaw/0000-0002-7102-753X; Kwak, Young Hoon/0000-0003-3042-4130",,,,,45,9,11,1,58,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The purpose of the research is to inform the design of effective and efficient payments-for-ecosystem services schemes to safeguard north Australia's biodiversity values. It promotes the contractual provision of biodiversity conservation services by farmers, in particular pastoralists operating in Australia's tropical savannas. The paper focuses on the discrete choice experimental (DCE) aspects. The DCE is employed to estimate farmers' preference heterogeneity for supplying ecosystem services, specifically their willingness to accept remuneration for the on-farm conservation of biodiversity, based on potential programme attributes. The design of the choice experiment draws on best practice standards (Hoyos, 2010), a recognition of the benefits of embedding design in a consultative process (Klojgaard et al., 2012) and recent advances in accounting for response certainty (Brouwer et al., 2010; Hensher et al., 2012). DCE design decisions relating to attribute selection, attribute levels, alternatives and choice tasks are explained based on literature, focus group discussions, expert input and an iterative process of Bayesian D-efficient DCE design. Additional design aspects include measuring choice certainty and stated attribute attendance, embedding the DCE within a discrete-continuous approach, capturing relevant respondent-related attributes with socio-economic-psychological questions and scales, and devising appropriate data collection logistics.

It is shown that this model has similar stability properties, under statistical and evolutionary learning, as a model without a confidence affect. From this setup, I introduce Expectational Business Cycles where output fluctuates due to learning, heterogeneous forecasting models and random changes in the efficient forecasting model. Agents use one of two forecasting models to forecast future variables while heterogeneity is dictated via an evolutionary process. Increased uncertainty, due to a shock to the structure of the economy, may result in a sudden decrease in output. As agents learn the equilibrium, output slowly increases to its equilibrium value. Expectational business cycles tend to arrive faster, last longer and are more severe as agents possess less information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Prices ending with nine are also sticky: price-setters change them with a significantly lower probability; rivals underbid these prices more seldom if they represent the cheapest price on the market, and we observe higher price jumps by price leaders for these price points.

Solow showed that constant levels of consumption could be sustained in the face of exhaustibility if there is sufficient substitutability between produced and natural factors of production. Hartwick then proved that underpinning this result is a saving rule-set investment in produced capital equal to the value of resource depletion at each point in time. A large literature has shown that a comprehensive measure of the change in real wealth-net saving-plays a central role in determining whether current well-being can be sustained. In particular, current declines in real wealth signal that future well-being will also decline, a result that has been confirmed empirically using data for developing countries. Changes in wealth and sustainability are therefore joined at the hip. The current composition of wealth serves to define the policy challenges that countries face in achieving sustainable development. If substitution possibilities are limited between natural and other factors of production, as one might expect, then technical progress is a necessary complement to policies for sustainability.","[Hamilton, Kirk] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Hartwick, John] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Queens University - Canada,"Hamilton, K (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.e.hamilton@verizon.net; hartwick@econ.queensu.ca,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,16,16,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

His analysis is based on the stochastic discount factor. We show that in situations in which the stochastic discount factor is applicable, it is optimal for society to devote only a finite amount of resources to protect against climate change. For general assumptions on the investment returns, cost-benefit analysis must consider the joint distribution of the marginal utility of future consumption and marginal returns to investment in the different future states of nature. We explore the range of situations under which challenges for applying cost-benefit analysis under uncertainty remain. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This debate assumes, first, that there is a meaningful definition of class, and second, that the thresholds which define relatively homogeneous groups in terms of pre-determined sociological characteristics can be found empirically. This paper aims at proposing a view of the middle class based on vulnerability to poverty. Following this approach the paper exploits panel data to determine the amount of comparable income -associated with a low probability of falling into poverty- which could define the lower bound of the middle class. It looks at absolute thresholds, challenging the view that people just above the poverty line are actually part of the middle class. In an analogy with poverty measurement, there is a degree of arbitrariness in the definition of specific thresholds, but the concept behind them is clear and economically meaningful. The estimated lower-threshold is used in cross-section surveys to quantify the size and the evolution of middle classes in Chile, Mexico, and Peru over the past two decades. The evidence also shows that the middle class has increased significantly in all three countries. There is an important group of people, however, who cannot be defined as middle class from this perspective, but remain vulnerable to fall back into poverty.","[Lopez-Calva, Luis F.] World Bank, Latin Amer & Caribbean Vice Presidency, Poverty Equ & Gender Unit, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Ortiz-Juarez, Eduardo] UNDP, Reg Bur Latin Amer & Caribbean, New York, NY 10017 USA",The World Bank,"López-Calva, LF (通讯作者)，World Bank, Latin Amer & Caribbean Vice Presidency, Poverty Equ & Gender Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",lflopezcalva@worldbank.org; eduardo.ortiz@undp.org,,"Ortiz-Juarez, Eduardo/0000-0001-8825-5937",,,,,25,96,111,5,39,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Gambia, and Madagascar. We build on a simple agricultural household production model and we propose an extension to include adjustments in labor income. Our approach, which can be implemented without repeated cross-sections of household level data, suits well the data constraints in SSA It also allows us to capture the heterogeneity in trade protection at the tariff line level. The pro-poor bias indicators suggest that SSA's trade policies tend to be biased in favor of poor households, as these policies redistribute income from rich to poor households. This is because protection increases the agricultural prices of goods that are sold by African households and this effect dominates both the impacts of higher consumption prices and the strong Stolper-Samuelson effects that benefit skilled over unskilled workers.

The economic perspective presented here shows how the gift of life, albeit noble and often motivated by altruism, is heavily influenced by standard economic forces including supply and demand, economies of scale, and moral hazard. These forces, shaped by technological advances, have driven the evolution of blood donation markets from thin one-to-one marriage markets in which each recipient needed a personal blood donor, to thick, impersonalized, diffuse markets. Today, imbalances between aggregate supply and demand are a major challenge in blood markets, including excess supply after disasters and insufficient supply at other times. These imbalances are not unexpected given that the blood market operates without market prices and with limited storage length (about six weeks) for whole blood. Yet shifting to a system of paying blood donors seems a practical impossibility given attitudes toward paying blood donors and concerns that a paid system could compromise blood safety. Nonetheless, we believe that an economic perspective offers promising directions to increase supply and improve the supply and demand balance even in the presence of volunteer supply and with the absence of market prices.","[Slonim, Robert] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Wang, Carmen] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Garbarino, Ellen] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney; Harvard University; University of Sydney,"Slonim, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",robert.slonim@sydney.edu.au,,"Slonim, Robert/0000-0002-9513-4970",,,,,44,44,55,2,22,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Most third parties who can profit from punishment punish the senders regardless of how the senders behave. However, when they have to provide explanations for their punishment decisions, significantly more third parties punish senders if and only if senders lie, and senders are also more likely to perceive punishment as legitimate and behave honestly.

The data and model support one cointegrating relationship between the prices of domestically produced ethanol, imported ethanol, and other relevant products (gasoline, crude oil, and corn). The rejection of weak exogeneity of the imported ethanol price and corn price implies that these two prices would adjust to changes in the price linkage. Those empirical findings indicate that the impact of eliminating trade barriers on the imported ethanol price would spillover to the domestic ethanol price and subsequently to corn price.

The method assumes that output can be represented by a non-linear model of unobserved components, where disturbances consist of a mixture of normal distributions. In this document, we apply thisalgorithm to Peruvian GDP using quarterly data from 1980 until 2011. As a result of this analysis, we choose the UC-CN model, which presents a mixture of normals in the disturbances of the trend and cycle component of output. The obtained trend clearly reflects the structural change undergone in the early 1990s. After a steep decrease of the trend or potential GDP as a result of drastic adjustment measures, output grew in a more stable way in the following years. In the same way, one can observe an increase in the growth rate of potential GDP from 2002 onwards, which coincides with the monetary reforms that took place at the time. Finally, the obtained cycles are consistent with the evolution of the Peruvian economy and of recession periods that have been traditionally identified. A comparison with other methods of decomposition is also provided.","[Guillen, Angel; Rodriguez, Gabriel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Lima, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Rodríguez, G (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Av Univ 1801,Lima 32, Lima, Peru.",angel.guillen@pucp.pe; gabriel.rodriguez@pucp.edu.pe,"Rodríguez, Gabriel/F-3230-2012","Rodríguez, Gabriel/0000-0003-1174-9642",,,,,74,2,2,0,22,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

We use data for 23 OECD countries over the period 1960-2009 and distinguish between multilateral and bilateral aid, grants and loans, recipient characteristics such as income and political institutions, tied and untied aid, and aid by sector. The results show that leftist governments increased the growth of bilateral grant aid, and more specifically grant aid to least developed and lower middle-income countries. Our findings confirm partisan politics hypotheses because grants are closely analogous to domestic social welfare transfer payments, and poverty and inequality are of greatest concern for less developed recipient countries.

Each return series is modeled by AR-(FI) GARCH univariate model. Then, we fit the GPD distribution to the tails of the residuals to model marginal residuals distributions. The extreme value copula to the lid residuals is fitted and we simulate from it to construct N portfolios and estimate VaR. As a first step, the method is applied to a two-dimensional energy portfolio. In second step, we extend method in trivariate context to measure VaR of three-dimensional energy portfolio. Dependences between residuals are modeled using a trivariate nested Gumbel copulas. Methods proposed are compared with various univariate and multivariate conventional VaR methods. The reported results demonstrate that GARCH-t, conditional EVT and FIGARCH extreme value copula methods produce acceptable estimates of risk both for standard and more extreme VaR quantiles. Generally, copula methods are less accurate compared with their predictive performances in the case of portfolio composed of exchange market indices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by the recent literature that distinguish between skills and tasks, we argue that the impact of multinational and foreign ownership on the demand for labor is better captured by focusing on job tasks rather than education. We use Swedish matched employer-employee data and find that changes of local firms to both foreign and Swedish multinationals increase the relative demand for non-routine and interactive job tasks in the targeted local firms. Hence, in a high-income country, both inward and outward FDI have a task upgrading impact on local firms. The effect is primarily driven by wage effects leading to increased wage dispersion for workers with different non-routine and interactive task intensity. We also show that the effect is not the same as skill upgrading since dividing employees by educational attainment does not capture changes in the relative labor demand. Hence, our results suggest a new aspect of the labor market consequences of FDI. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

What is the reason for this development and why is it rather different by country? There are two approaches to explain this. Traditional economic theory explains why it makes sense to allow deficits of public budgets in certain situations, which might result in a limited amount of public debt. It also shows the conditions for the sustainability of public finances namely that public debt stays below certain limits and, in particular, does not - in the long run - increase faster than GDP. Following the recommendations of this approach, public budget surpluses should be run in economic upswings to compensate for deficits in recessions. By contrast, politico-economic approaches explain why democratic governments have incentives to allow deficits even in periods of economic upswings. In the long run, this can lead to ever-increasing public debt. To prevent this, institutional provisions are necessary. In this respect, Swiss debt brakes at the national and cantonal levels as well as the new German rules are of particular interest.","[Kirchgaessner, Gebhard] Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Int Econ & Appl Econ Anal, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Kirchgässner, G (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, SIAW HSG, Bodanstr 8, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",gebhard.kirchgaessner@unisg.ch,,,,,,,62,6,6,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

These tests may be used to test the null hypothesis of non-stationarity against the alternative that some or all of the time series in the system of equations follow a stationary exponential smooth transition autoregressive (ESTAR) process. In contrast to previous research we relax the assumption that the cross-correlation structure is driven by a common-factor and consider an endogenous correlation structure. Based on the size and power results from the Monte Carlo simulations we recommend using the Wald version of our cross-sectional dependent robust nonlinear panel unit root (CDR-NPU) method. Finally, in an empirical application we demonstrate that our more powerful nonlinear method, in contrast to previous methods, can provide support for PPP even in smaller samples. In consistency with the univariate tests in Bahmani-Oskooee et al. (2008) our CDR-NPU tests support the theory that less industrialized economies exhibit stronger and more distinct nonlinear adjustment patterns towards PPP. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It also produces a short-lived liquidity effect' and helps explain the negative comovement between bonds and stocks. In addition, I find evidence suggesting the existence of a money demand function characterized by small output and interest rate elasticities. By its turn, the central bank's policy rule follows closely the dynamics of the money markets.

This study analyses 10 born global SMEs using a multiple-case-study method. Multiple sources of data are used, including semi-structured in-depth interviews, a questionnaire and secondary data. It is found that factors that influence born global internationalisation are made up of the interplay of three major factors, namely the individual founder/manager specific characteristics, firm-specific resources and the external environment. The most important factor that emerged was the entrepreneurial orientation of founders/managers. This study also found that born global firms do not follow a stepwise-entry strategy. Due to the largely qualitative nature of the study, the findings cannot be statistically generalised to other similar contexts. Nonetheless, theoretical generalisation is possible. An integrated framework of the factors that drive born global internationalisation is presented, together with an overview of born-global-entry strategies.","[Kaur, Sulina] Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Sandhu, Manjit Singh] Monash Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management, Selangor, Malaysia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Sandhu, MS (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management, Sunway Campus, Selangor, Malaysia.",manjit.sandhu@monash.edu,"Sandhu, Manjit/AAE-8329-2020",,,,,,81,24,26,2,76,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We compare participants to nonparticipants as well as participants of both schemes directly. Our article benefits from access to rich administrative data from the German Federal Employment Agency. When comparing participants to nonparticipants, results suggest that the individual JSA does not affect participants' employment prospects at all and that the course JSA even decreased their employment chances. At the same time, differences in these effects can be ascribed to programme design differences and to differences in the groups of participants. Therefore, we compare both programmes directly to each other, that is, we use the other programme participants as a comparison group, respectively.

When ability is not ex-ante observable and contracts are incomplete, managerial selection imposes a cost, as managers facing the risk of being replaced choose a sub-optimally low level of long-term investment. This generates a trade-off between selection and investment that has implications for the choice of contractual relationships and institutions. Our analysis shows that rigid long-term contracts sacrificing managerial selection may prevail at early stages of economic development and when heterogeneity in ability is low. As the economy grows, however, knowledge accumulation increases the return to talent and makes it optimal to adopt flexible contractual relationships, where managerial selection is implemented even at the cost of lower investment. Measures of investor protection aimed at limiting the bargaining power of managers improve selection under short-term contracts.

I consider a situation where the buyer may or may not have private information about his valuation at the time the contract is offered. Is the seller (strictly) better off as compared to the standard situation? The answer depends crucially on the specific model. In the 2-types model, unless the probability (that the buyer is uninformed) reaches a critical threshold, the seller is unable to benefit from the buyer's ignorance. In the continuum-types model, on the other hand, optimal expected profit is strictly higher than in the standard model whenever this probability is positive. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The algorithm accounts for three complications that naturally arise in trading scenarios: (1) combinatorial matching of traders, (2) trader heterogeneity, and (3) discreteness in abatement technology. The algorithm establishes as detailed a reduced-cost benchmark as possible for the sub-basin by distinguishing a specific pattern of trade among would-be market participants. As such, the algorithm provides a benchmark against which an actual pollution market's performance could conceivably be compared. We find that a benchmarked trading pattern for a potential Cub River WQT market - where each source, point or nonpoint, would be required to reduce its pollution loadings - may entail some point sources selling abatement credits to nonpoint sources.

It shows that the notions of cause and independence used to discuss the relationships between the variables of The General Theory in the chapter are related to the concept of independence for knowledge, which concerns logical connections between arguments rather than material connections between events. We demonstrate that such logical connections are rediscussed in chapters 1921 by the use of a two-stage methodology, which allows for probable repercussions between factors heretofore taken as independent and removes the simplifying assumptions previously introduced. After stressing the methodological continuity this method provides with the analysis of credit cycles in A Treatise on Money, we argue that chapter 18 is an indispensable tool to decode the text structure of The General Theory and show that Keyness economic theory is in truth an analytical method allowing readers to emulate his efforts to grasp the complexity of the economic material.","[Carabelli, Anna M.] Univ Piemonte Orientale A Avogadro Alessandria, Novara, Vercelli, Italy; [Cedrini, Mario A.] Univ Turin, I-10153 Turin, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; University of Turin,"Carabelli, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Campus Luigi Einaudi,Lungo Dora Siena 100A, I-10153 Turin, Italy.",mario.cedrini@unito.it,,"Cedrini, Mario Aldo/0000-0003-1059-4458",,,,,67,20,20,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We estimate a model of the cognitive development process of children nested within an otherwise standard model of household behaviour. The household makes labour supply decisions and provides time and money inputs into the child quality production process during the development period. Our empirical results indicate that both parents' time inputs are important for the cognitive development of their children, particularly when the child is young. Money expenditures are less productive in terms of producing child quality. Comparative statics exercises demonstrate that cash transfers to households with children have small impacts on child quality due to the relatively low impact of money investments on child outcomes and the fact that a significant fraction of the transfer is spent on other household consumption and the leisure of the parents.","[Del Boca, Daniela] Univ Torino NYU, Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy; [Flinn, Christopher] NYU, Coll Carlo Alberto, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Wiswall, Matthew] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Collegio Carlo Alberto; New York University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Del Boca, D (通讯作者)，Univ Torino NYU, Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy.",,,"Flinn, Christopher/0000-0002-7904-1782",,,,,17,154,214,1,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Using longitudinal survey data of registrants for the GMAT exam and school level information from other sources, we create, in the context of graduate management education, multiple indices of school quality, and estimate the effect of these quality measures on multiple indicators of career success. In particular, we create quality measures of MBA programs based on: (1) institutional and curricular factors, (2) characteristics of the student body, and (3) characteristics of the faculty. We create aggregate quality indices by combining individual proxies using factor analysis. We also extend the literature by considering the effects of quality on both earnings and non-monetary outcomes, namely attainment of managerial goals relative to initial individual expectations, self-assessed skill gains, and various measures of job satisfaction. We include several unique individual control variables, and further control for unobserved heterogeneity through the use of instrumental variables and individual fixed effects. Results indicate that the quality of peers and schools may matter most for earnings. When individual fixed effects are included, estimates of quality premiums diminish somewhat, though the estimated premium associated with school quality increases, emphasizing the importance of controlling for selection into programs of varying quality. School quality is also an important predictor of several non-pecuniary outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, we consider the following four offshoring types: outsourcing from South, insourcing from South, outsourcing from North and insourcing from North. Unlike previous studies, we give particular attention to the comparison between outsourcing from North and insourcing from South and find that firms outsourcing from North are more productive than firms sourcing from their own affiliates in South. We offer three critical conditions to incorporate our empirical findings into the standard firm heterogeneity model: the fixed cost is higher for insourcing than for outsourcing and is higher in North than in South, the headquarters receive a larger share of the final revenue through insourcing than through outsourcing, and sourcing from North guarantees better profitability (or a bigger share) in the market for the headquarters than sourcing from South. Thus, this article contributes to the literature by identifying a new productivity order.","[Han, Jae-Joon] Inha Univ, Grad Sch Business, Inchon, South Korea; [Lee, Hongshik] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Lee, Joonhyung] Univ Memphis, Dept Econ, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",Inha University; Korea University; University of Memphis,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",Honglee@korea.ac.kr,,"Lee, Hongshik/0000-0002-7189-2494; Lee, Joonhyung/0000-0002-6924-6012",,,,,31,1,1,3,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It presents economic models that rationalize the evidence and unify the treatment effect and family influence literatures. The evidence on the empirical and policy importance of credit constraints in forming skills is examined. There is little support for the claim that untargeted income transfer policies to poor families significantly boost child outcomes. Mentoring, parenting, and attachment are essential features of successful families and interventions that shape skills at all stages of childhood. The next wave of family studies will better capture the active role of the emerging autonomous child in learning and responding to the actions of parents, mentors, and teachers.","[Heckman, James J.; Mosso, Stefano] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Heckman, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jjh@uchicago.edu; smosso@uchicago.edu,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD054702, R37 HD065072] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,143,334,419,10,144,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Often, this mapping is obtained by inverting a mapping from the parameter to the population distribution. If the inverse mapping is discontinuous, then estimation of the parameter usually presents an ill-posed inverse problem. Such problems arise in many settings in economics and other fields in which the parameter of interest is a function. This article explains how ill-posedness arises and why it causes problems for estimation. The need to modify or regularize the identifying mapping is explained, and methods for regularization and estimation are discussed. Methods for forming confidence intervals and testing hypotheses are summarized. It is shown that a hypothesis test can be more precise in a certain sense than an estimator.

Yet, the Japanese government bond continues to enjoy low and stable interest rates. The most plausible explanation for such an apparent anomaly is that the bonds are predominantly held by the Japanese residents, who are willing to absorb increasing amount of Japanese Government Bonds (JGB) without requiring high yields. Even if the Japanese residents continue to invest their new saving into the government bonds, however, Japan's fiscal situation is not sustainable, which this paper shows through simulations under various scenarios. In all of the scenarios that assume the fiscal policy stance of the Japanese government does not change in the future, we find that the amount of government debt will exceed the private sector financial assets available for the government debt purchase in the next 10years or so. The paper also shows that sufficiently large tax increases and/or expenditure cuts in the future would put the government debt on a sustainable path. Thus, if the market believes that Japan will embark on such fiscal consolidation in the next 10years, at most, the low JGB yields are justifiable. If and when the expectation changes, however, a fiscal crisis can be triggered even before the government debt hits the ceiling of the private sector financial assets.

This paper gives a comprehensive answer for the most important benchmark used in the modern debate: technical change is factor-augmenting and materializes in a neoclassical economy with competitive firms equipped with a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function. I establish that the effect of labor-augmenting technical change crucially hinges on whether the economy's capital endowment exceeds or falls short of its amount of efficient labor. This distinction determines the sign of the effect for sufficiently small values of the elasticity of substitution. In the former case, labor-augmenting technical progress must increase the equilibrium wage. In the latter case the equilibrium wage is reduced. In both cases, technical progress increases the price of capital. Overall, the analysis stresses that not only the elasticity of substitution but also the degree of diminishing returns, the distribution parameters of the CES, and the level of the efficient capital intensity matter for the effect of labor-augmenting technical change on real factor prices. Mutatis mutandis, these considerations carry over to the case of capital-augmenting technical change.","[Irmen, Andreas] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Irmen, Andreas] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Irmen, Andreas] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Law Econ & Finance, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",University of Luxembourg; Ifo Institut; University of Luxembourg,"Irmen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",airmen@uni.lu,,"Irmen, Andreas/0000-0003-0410-8855",,,,,22,2,2,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Using multiple model specifications, we show that the estimated social effects are not driven by simultaneity or common unobserved factors but are consistent with the hypothesis of social learning. We also find that the importance of social effects decreases significantly with households' familiarity with the NCMS as well as with the development of alternative information channels, which further ascertains that the primary mechanism for the social effects is social learning.

The reform implies that public sector workers born on January 1, 1950, or later face a considerable reduction in their pension rights, while workers born before this threshold date can still retire under the old, more generous rules. Using unique matched survey and administrative panel data on male public sector workers born in 1949 and 1950, we find strong and persistent effects on job satisfaction that are sizable compared to income effects on well-being. The drop in satisfaction is strongly affected by social comparisons with colleagues. Treated workers are less affected by the reform when the treatment group is larger in the organization where they are employed. Moreover, the social comparison effect is especially prevalent in organizations that stimulate their employees to work full-time and in teams. We also find evidence that the major part of the social comparison effect is non-monetary. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In early stages, this type of cooperation is limited to cross-border cooperation between regions with common cultural identity, such as the Baltic Sea Region and Central Europe. We can conclude that, although transnational clusters would be a great benefit, it is unlikely that they occur spontaneously. The European Community facilitates transnational cluster cooperation, through different tools that could offer greater benefits.

For instance, benefit of infrastructure can be shared with many stakeholders especially with the poor ones in a remote area. Hence, a good infrastructure can lower market access restriction, opportunity costs and increase the likelihood of participating in the benefit of international trade. However, existing studies have mainly focused on the traditional determinants of trade costs such as distance and border effects overtime. The role of infrastructure towards trade costs was largely overlooked. Infrasfructure is not just limited to public utilities but also includes information and communication technology (ICT), political and social network, and some aspect of soft infrastructure such as management practice, operating procedures and policies development. Some studies proved that infrasfructure has significant and relatively large impact on trade flows especially in telecommunication infrastructure. Infrastructure development is important as a tool to speed up the economic integration within the region particularly in the area of international trade and investment. Efficient infrasfructure can expand linkages to supply chain by lowering trade costs and increasing value added that is translated into potential profitability. As infrastructure expands, it motivates regional cooperation in infrastructure development, intraregional trade and broadens the investment that eventually lower the trade costs among countries. Following recent empirical studies that emphasize the importance of infrasfructure, this paper examines the role of infrasfructure in explaining trade costs in ASEAN-5 member countries namely Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Arguably, countries with good infrasfructure will have less trade costs and this empirical study aims at shedding a light on the role of infrastructure towards trade costs by grouping infrasfructure into four types which are land, sea, air and ICT and utilities infrastructures. The rationale behind this is that this approach allows us to disentangle and estimate the role of the different modes of infrastructure towards trade costs. The analysis is based on panel data from 1980 to 2009. There are several important conclusions emerging from this analysis. First, in full sample observation, internet appears to be the most deterministic variable of trade costs in ASEAN-5. This finding is congruent with the view that the better the ICT infrastructure the more accessible information about the foreign market the traders will gain thus decreasing the costs to trade. In separate model, rail route significantly decreases trade costs in these regions. This support the empirical results that improvements in basic infrasfructure increase the accessibility of goods form producer to consumer thus, lowering the trade costs significantly. Others such as paved road, energy, gasoline and diesel consumption used in road sector are equally important in explaining the trade costs through these regions.","[Ramli, Mohd Khairul Rafiz; Ismail, Normaz Wana] Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Ramli, MKR (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",mkrafz@gmail.com; nwi@upm.edu.my,"Ismail, Normaz Wana/F-7528-2017","Ismail, Normaz Wana/0000-0002-0865-256X",,,,,39,3,3,3,48,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Researchers and practitioners are trying to find a way to increase the efficacy of the project's outcomes in terms of shortening the project's duration, lowering budgetary costs and meeting the scope. Although several publications have been written on that topic, there is still no common solution in place. However, more in-depth research related to the specific type of projects or industries is being conducted and this paper seeks to incorporate additional knowledge into that contemporary field. Furthermore, this is of growing importance in modern, turbulent times, where the expectations of profiting from lessons learned are ever increasing. Following the current market demands, in the article a new, innovative approach is proposed to manage the expectation that future projects will have a shorter duration. Therefore, the idea of creating specific roadmaps is proposed, which should help the decision makers improve the efficacy of project management in the company, where the process of such improvement is measured using the maturity levels assessment concept. Based on the world-wide quantitative studies in the construction, information technology and machinery industries, specific roadmaps for each industry were determined.

Although our preliminary estimation results imply the existence of the weak form of tax smoothing for Turkey, further tests indicate the violation of exogeneity of permanent government spending, which is a requirement for the tax smoothing hypothesis to hold. Our causality tests indicate that permanent government spending is not exogenous due to the causality running from lagged tax rates to permanent government spending. Therefore, we conclude that our results provide evidence against the tax smoothing hypothesis.

The inequality of net worth, after almost two decades of little movement, was up sharply from 2007 to 2010. Relative indebtedness continued to expand from 2007 to 2010, particularly for the middle class, though the proximate causes were declining net worth and income rather than an increase in absolute indebtedness. In fact, the average debt of the middle class actually fell in real terms by 25 percent. The sharp fall in median wealth and the rise in inequality in the late 2000s are traceable to the high leverage of middle-class families in 2007 and the high share of homes in their portfolio. The racial and ethnic disparity in wealth holdings, after remaining more or less stable from 1983 to 2007, widened considerably between 2007 and 2010. Hispanics, in particular, got hammered by the Great Recession in terms of net worth and net equity in their homes.

We adopt the Timing of Events approach to identify this dynamic treatment effect using monthly calendar data from a representative sample of Flemish (Belgian) youth who started searching for a job right after leaving formal education. We find that overeducation is a trap. By accepting a job for which one is overeducated rather than only accepting adequate job matches, monthly transition rates into adequate employment fall by 51-98%, depending on the elapsed unemployment duration. These findings challenge the career mobility thesis and imply that the short-term benefits of policies that generate quick transitions into employment must be traded-off against the long-term costs of an inadequate job match.

Both theory and evidence suggest that while patents can have a partial equilibrium effect of improving incentives to invent, the general equilibrium effect on innovation can be negative. A properly designed patent system might serve to increase innovation at a certain time and place. Unfortunately, the political economy of government-operated patent systems indicates that such systems are susceptible to pressures that cause the ill effects of patents to grow over time. Our preferred policy solution is to abolish patents entirely and to find other legislative instruments, less open to lobbying and rent seeking, to foster innovation when there is clear evidence that laissez-faire undersupplies it. However, if that policy change seems too large to swallow, we discuss in the conclusion a set of partial reforms that could be implemented.","[Boldrin, Michele; Levine, David K.] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Boldrin, Michele; Levine, David K.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Boldrin, M (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",mboldrin@artsci.wustl.edu; david@dklevine.com,,,,,,,48,191,214,1,131,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

By exploiting the rich nature of the dataset, we provide a model with well-defined statistical properties that compares favourably with the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) dating points. Combining the results of the parametric approach followed in the Markov-switching model and the non-parametric approach followed by the SARB should allow for a robust turning point analysis.

In particular, we show that moral hazard is not necessarily outright fraud, but a gradual adjustment of the willingness to work, depending on preferences and the conditions stated in the insurance contract.

The returns to being uncivic are increasing in the generosity of unemployment insurance; but this generosity is decreasing in the number of uncivic individuals. In this context, I determine the evolution of preferences across generations and show that cultural heterogeneity is sustained over the long-run. The dynamics of cultural transmission can generate a long lag between the introduction of unemployment insurance and an increase in people's willingness to live off government-provided benefits. Hence, it offers an explanation to the 'European unemployment puzzle' due to the coexistence of generous unemployment insurance and low unemployment in the 1950s and 1960s.","Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Michau, JB (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",Jean-Baptiste.Michau@polytechnique.edu,,,,,,,51,6,6,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We extend the standard tax competition model by replacing the unit demand assumption with iso-elastic demand. As a result, not only the level of the equilibrium tax, but also the slope of the tax reaction function depends positively on the size of the country. The new implication is tested on panel data in first differences for 16 countries of Western Europe. The results provide strong evidence for strategic interaction in the setting of diesel excises and confirm the effect of country size on the response to tax changes in neighbouring countries. Strategic interaction between EU countries intensified in the mid-1990s and drove small European countries to set lower diesel tax rates. These results explain why the EU's minimum tax policy has failed to harmonise diesel tax rates.","Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Inst Econ, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Paizs, Laszlo] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Reg Ctr Energy Policy Res, Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Corvinus University Budapest,"Paizs, L (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Inst Econ, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.",paizs.laszlo@krtk.mta.hu,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,14,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Although the merit-order effect is only one of several consequences of renewable production on the electricity system, it is crucial to determine its size for the economic evaluation of renewable energies. In this paper we present a comprehensive overview of relevant past research results on the price effect of renewables. Additionally, we conduct a new empirical analysis of the price effect of renewable production for the Austrian-German region, a market that clearly qualifies for a merit-order effect analysis given its characteristics. Based on the review and our own analysis, we show that the merit-order effect varies depending on the region and the assessment method chosen. We also find that the size of this effect is less dispersed throughout different markets than previously suggested by the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Extensive margin reflecting the level of variety becomes a significant factor for China's export and is slightly higher than intensive margin. The empirical results indicate that emerging industrial countries have gradually become the important new markets for China's export variety. As for the variables affecting variety growth, trade barriers are found to play a dominant role as invisible constraints, and small and medium enterprises contribute significantly to variety growth, while foreign investment and market-oriented reforms have become the driving force. Moreover, trade variety has been identified as the third factor of economic growth, in addition to the two traditional factors (capital and labor).","[Zhao Yong-Liang; Liu De-Xue; Pu Hua-Lin] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang Zi-Hui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Zhao, YL (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",ericjue@sohu.com,,,,,,,32,3,4,0,20,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

When there is unobserved heterogeneity, the direction of the bias this causes is known only in a few restrictive examples. In this paper, I show that ignoring unobserved heterogeneity in a first price sealed bid auction with symmetric independent private values gives bounds on several quantities of economic interest under surprisingly general conditions. The results apply to certain quantities related to expectations of valuations, including bidder profits (which can be used to recover bid preparation costs in entry models) and the efficiency loss of assigning the object randomly. I then turn to estimation of these bounds, and show that, when only the winning bid is available, the rate of convergence can be slower than the square root of the number of auctions observed and depends on the number of bidders. These results apply more generally to estimation of functionals of a distribution from repeated observations of an order statistic and may be of independent interest. I apply these methods to bound the efficiency loss from replacing a set of procurement auctions for highway construction in Michigan with random assignment.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Armstrong, TB (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",timothy.armstrong@yale.edu,,,,,,,34,8,12,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

This article documents and analyzes changes in income volatility using data for 11 industrialized countries, 22 industries and 35years (1970-2004). The article has four main findings. First, the unconditional volatility of labor income has declined in parallel to the decline in macroeconomic volatility. Second, the industry-specific, idiosyncratic component of labor income volatility has hardly changed. Third, cross-sectional heterogeneity is substantial. If anything, the labor incomes of high- and low-skilled workers have become more volatile relative to the volatility of capital incomes. Fourth, the volatility of labor income relative to the volatility of capital income declines in the labor share.

These corrections are based on higher-order asymptotic expansions of the GMM estimators and produce improved point and interval estimates in moderately long panels. Under asymptotic sequences where the cross sectional and time series dimensions of the panel pass to infinity at the same rate, the uncorrected estimators have asymptotic biases of the same order as their asymptotic standard deviations.

We then present an econometric analysis to assess how the probability of compliance to the OFT request to withdraw the RPM can be affected by the specific features of the relevant economic context in which this restraint has taken place.","[Giovannetti, Emanuele] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Cambridge CB1 1PT, England; Univ Verona, I-37100 Verona, Italy",Anglia Ruskin University; University of Verona,"Giovannetti, E (通讯作者)，Anglia Ruskin Univ, East Rd, Cambridge CB1 1PT, England.",emanuele.giovannetti@anglia.ac.uk,"Giovannetti, Emanuele/O-3007-2019; Giovannetti, Emanuele/A-4507-2014","Giovannetti, Emanuele/0000-0002-1231-7510; Giovannetti, Emanuele/0000-0002-1231-7510; MAGAZZINI, LAURA/0000-0003-2482-1789",,,,,29,3,3,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

Using six data sets, from Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we construct beauty measures in a number of different ways. Beauty raises happiness: A one standard-deviation change in beauty generates about 0.08 standard deviations of additional satisfaction/happiness among men, 0.07 among women. The finding is robust to a rare opportunity to measure it using an instrumental variables approach. Accounting for a wide variety of covariates, particularly educational, marital, and labor-market outcomes that might be affected by beauty, the gross effects are roughly halved, with small reductions arising from the impact of beauty on monetary outcomes.

When monetary prizes were offered for achieving the highest saving rates within a particular month, average savings increased by $80 (a 30% increase in savings rate) while income and attendance at case management meetings remained unchanged. However, repeating the competition in the following month had no effect because responsive savers selected out of the shelter after the first month. In summary, while a savings competition can increase savings in the short run, its effect may be limited to the intensive margin and may diminish with repetition.

We address this question by studying the Tea Party movement in the United States, which rose to prominence through coordinated rallies across the country on Tax Day, April 15, 2009. We exploit variation in rainfall on the day of these rallies as an exogenous source of variation in attendance. We show that good weather at this initial, coordinating event had significant consequences for the subsequent local strength of the movement, increased public support for Tea Party positions, and led to more Republican votes in the 2010 midterm elections. Policy making was also affected, as incumbents responded to large protests in their district by voting more conservatively in Congress. Our estimates suggest significant multiplier effects: an additional protester increased the number of Republican votes by a factor well above 1. Together our results show that protests can build political movements that ultimately affect policy making and that they do so by influencing political views rather than solely through the revelation of existing political preferences.","[Madestam, Andreas] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stockholm University; Harvard University,"Madestam, A (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,,52,138,180,3,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

This unique reform nullified the taxation of retained earnings and maintained corporate income tax only on distributed profits. We investigate the outcome of the reform by comparing the performance of the affected firms in Estonia with that of firms from Latvia and Lithuania, the two other Baltic countries. We use firm-level financial data and the difference in differences approach for our analysis. The results are consistent with an increase in holdings of liquid assets and lower use of debt financing after the reform. A positive relationship of the reform with post-reform investment and productivity has also been found. The results point to a stronger effect on smaller firms.

We extend the analysis of intergroup versus interindividual decision-making by running both one-shot and repeated sessions of a simple two-player sequential market game (Stackelberg duopoly). Whereas in one-shot markets we find no significant differences in the behavior of groups and individuals, in repeated markets we find that the behavior of groups is further away from the subgame-perfect equilibrium of the stage game than that of individuals. To a large extent, this result is independent of the method of eliciting choices (sequential or strategy method), the matching protocol (random- or fixed-matching), and the econometric method used to account for observed first- and second-mover behavior. We discuss various possible explanations for the differential effect that the time horizon of interaction has on the extent of individual and group players' (non)conformity with subgame perfectness.

The political cycle is formed by the major local meetings of legislative bodies held every year in all provinces of China. This is because the government has a strong incentive to maintain social stability during the meetings and to focus on economic growth in other times. We test how such cycles affect coalmine fatality using monthly data at the provincial level between 2000 and 2010. We find that the number of accidents and casualties were significantly lowered during the local events of two sessions after controlling for other time fixed effects. The temporary reduction of accidents seemed to have been achieved by controlling production rather than by improving safety measures. The magnitude of the cycle for accidents is enlarged in provinces where media exposure is stronger and where the vice governor in charge of safety is faced with a possible extension to another term in the current post.

This paper proposes a revised hybrid model built upon empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based on the feed-forward neural network (FNN) modeling framework incorporating the slope-based method (SBM), which is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of crude oil prices. Three commonly used multi-step-ahead prediction strategies proposed in the literature, including iterated strategy, direct strategy, and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) strategy, are examined and compared, and practical considerations for the selection of a prediction strategy for multi-step-ahead forecasting relating to crude oil prices are identified. The weekly data from the WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil spot price are used to compare the performance of the alternative models under the EMD-SBM-FNN modeling framework with selected counterparts. The quantitative and comprehensive assessments are performed on the basis of prediction accuracy and computational cost. The results obtained in this study indicate that the proposed EMD-SBM-FNN model using the MIMO strategy is the best in terms of prediction accuracy with accredited computational load.

New evidence from a generalized spectral test,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Crude oil markets; Weak-form efficiency; Generalized spectral test,WEAKLY EFFICIENT; FUTURES; PRICES; SPOT,"This paper utilizes the newly developed method of a generalized spectral test to examine the weak-form efficiency of the main worldwide crude oil markets. The generalized spectral test, unlike other methods, can detect both linear and nonlinear serial dependence in the conditional mean and allows for different forms of unknown conditional heteroscedasticity. By using a rolling sample approach instead of an analysis of different time periods, we find that the efficiency of oil markets may depend on time periods. The main global crude oil markets reach weak-form efficiency in the long-term and the degree of efficiency of global oil markets changes over time. Among the oil markets examined in this study, the Brent and the WTI oil markets possess the highest efficiency levels, whereas the Daqing oil market has the lowest efficiency level. Apparent anti-synchronization is detected between the efficiency of Brent and WTI markets in recent years, whereas synchronization is found between the efficiency of Daqing and Dubai oil markets during the last decade.

For that purpose, we consider a partial equilibrium framework where a representative firm chooses the investment effort and the pollution level in response to an environmental policy composed of a pollution standard, an inspection probability and a fine for non-compliance. We find that the fine should strictly decrease with the investment effort when (i) there are administrative costs of sanctioning; (ii) the optimal policy induces non-compliance; and (iii) either the fine is sufficiently convex in the degree of non-compliance or the investment effort decreases marginal abatement costs significantly.","Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Arguedas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",carmen.arguedas@uam.es,"Arguedas, Carmen/H-4170-2016","Arguedas, Carmen/0000-0002-2719-6918",,,,,33,13,14,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

First, it sets out to underline a learning-by-exporting effect in Spanish firms between 1991 and 2002. It further seeks to outline the conditions allowing firms to benefit from these spillover effects. Using a propensity score matching method, a group of firms having entered the export market (treatment group) is compared with a similar group of non-exporting firms (control group), and difference-in-differences regressions are carried out. The results show a cumulative productivity differential of 32% for the first four years of exporting, with continuous improvement in productivity. After three years of exporting, productivity gain is still approximately 10%. This study shows that increases in capacity utilisation and competitive pressure from foreign markets are insufficient to explain this causal link between exporting and total factor productivity (TFP). It is thus possible to deduce the presence of a learning-by-exporting effect, benefiting firms with sufficiently qualified employees and which are already engaged in international relations (due to foreign suppliers and/or foreign equity participation).","[Augier, Patricia; Dovis, Marion] Aix Marseille Univ, DEFI, F-13290 Aix En Provence, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Augier, P (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, DEFI, Route Milles, F-13290 Aix En Provence, France.",patricia.augier@univmed.fr,,,,,,,33,3,3,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Focusing on the German pension system which is purely earnings related, we increase the degree of progressivity and compute the optimal mix between flat and earnings-related pensions. We find that a flat-rate pension share of roughly 30% maximizes aggregate economic efficiency, since improved insurance provision dominates higher labor supply distortions. Disability risk significantly increases the optimal progressivity level, while endogenous retirement has important macroeconomic implications. Since our results are robust for a wide range of parameter specifications, they indicate that at least in Germany a move towards more redistribution within the pension system is efficient.

We develop an ex-post accounting framework to measure this and provide trends for European countries based on a recent multi-sector input-output model of the world economy. We find that gross exports overestimate the competitiveness of economies that rely heavily on imported intermediates, and this bias has increased over time. Based on GVC incomes, we find that revealed comparative advantage of the EU27 is shifting to activities related to the production of non-electrical machinery and transport equipment, and away from non-durables. We also find that the number of jobs involved (GVC jobs) is declining and increasingly carried out by high-skilled workers outside the manufacturing sector, highlighting the uneven distributional consequences of production fragmentation. The results show that a GVC perspective on competitiveness is needed to better inform the policy debates on globalization. Marcel P.

We find that both bank-specific risk and foreign exchange rate risk are positively related with OBS activities. This indicates that OBS activities increase bank-specific and foreign exchange risk exposures of the banks in Turkey. The positive relationship might serve as a warning to bank's speculative action using OBS transactions in the market. The results also indicate that OBS activities, due to its hedging perception, improve bank's stock returns but have a negative impact on return on equity.

Incentives of advisors and clients may not be aligned, when fees are used by financial institutions to steer advice. We experimentally investigate whether voluntary contract components can reduce the conflict of interest and increase truth telling of advisors. We compare a voluntary payment upfront, an obligatory payment upfront, a voluntary bonus afterwards, and a three-stage design with a voluntary payment upfront and a bonus after. Advisors are most truthful, when mutual opportunities to reciprocate exist, and when the voluntary payment is largest. Our analysis identifies the third stage bonus payment as the key feature for success as it allows for an interplay of reciprocal behavior between clients and advisors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The causal linkage between oil and stock markets is modelled using a vector autoregressive model with time-varying parameters so as to reflect changes in Granger causality over time. A Markov switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) model, in which causal link between the series is stochastic and governed by an unobservable Markov chain, is used for inferring time-varying causality. Although we do not find any lead-lag type Granger causality, the results based on the MS-VAR model clearly show that oil futures price has strong regime prediction power for a sub-grouping of S&P 500 stock index during various sub-periods in the sample, while there is a weak evidence for the regime prediction power of a sub-grouping of S&P 500 stock indexes. The regime-prediction non-causality tests on the MS-VAR model show that both variables are useful for making inference about the regime process and that the evidence on regime-prediction causality is primarily found in the equation describing a sub-grouping of S&P 500 stock market returns. The evidence from the conditional non-causality tests shows that past information on the other series fails to improve the one step ahead prediction for both oil futures and stock returns.

The first is called 'lean against the wind,' which refers to fact that the monetary authority contracts (expands) aggregate demand below capacity when the actual rate of inflation is above (below) target. The second is 'the divine coincidence,' which means that stabilizing the rate of inflation around its target is tantamount to stabilizing output around its full employment level. The third proposition is that of stability. This means that the inflation target is part of an equilibrium configuration which generates convergence following any small disturbance to its initial conditions. These propositions are derived from a closed economy setting which is not representative of the countries that have actually adopted inflation targeting frameworks. Currently there are 27 countries, 9 of which are classified as industrialized and 18 as developing countries that have explicitly implemented a fully fledged inflation targeting regime (FFIT). These countries are open economies and are concerned by the evolution of the external sector and the exchange rate as proven by their interventions in the foreign exchange markets. We show that these three core propositions and the practice of inflation targeting are inoperative in an open economy context.","[Caldentey, Esteban Perez] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile; [Vernengo, Matias] Cent Bank Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Vernengo, Matias] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Caldentey, EP (通讯作者)，Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,35,3,4,1,5,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Another advantage is that the upper bound is robust to certain forms of endogenous technology response to changes in schooling.

I develop a dynamic economy-wide model of Taiwan with a detailed set of technology options in the power sector to examine the implications of adopting different carbon and nuclear power policies on CO2 emissions and the economy. Without a carbon mitigation policy, limiting nuclear power has a small economic cost for Taiwan, but CO2 emissions may increase by around 4.5% by 2050 when nuclear is replaced by fossil-based generation. With a low-carbon target of a 50% reduction from year 2000 levels by 2050, the costs of cutting CO2 emissions are greatly reduced if both carbon sequestration and nuclear expansion were viable. This study finds that converting Taiwan's industrial structure into a less energy-intensive one is crucial to carry out the non-nuclear and low-carbon environment. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find that a large share of firms, almost 20%, are not classified as expected based on a comparison of their statements of activities with the assigned industry codes. This result is robust to analyses on different levels of aggregation and is validated in an additional survey. It is well known from earlier literature that industry classification systems are not perfect. This paper provides a quantification of the flaws in classifications of firms. Moreover, it is explained why the classifications of firms are imprecise. The increasing complexity of production, inertia in changes to statistical systems and the increasing integration of manufacturing products and services are some of the primary and interrelated explanations for this lack of precision. We emphasise, however, that such classification problems are not resolved using a 'technical fix'. Any statistical classification method involves a number of tradeoffs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is unknown whether the preferences of volunteer participants are representative of the population from which the participants are drawn, or whether they differ due to selection bias. To answer this question, we measured the preferences of 1,173 students in a classroom experiment using a trust game and a lottery choice task. Separately, we invited all students to participate in a laboratory experiment using common recruitment procedures. To evaluate whether there is selection bias, we compare the social and risk preferences of students who eventually participated in a laboratory experiment to those who did not, and find that they do not differ significantly. However, we also find that people who sent less in a trust game were more likely to participate in a laboratory experiment, and discuss possible explanations for this behavior.","[Cleave, Blair L.; Nikiforakis, Nikos] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Nikiforakis, Nikos] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany; [Slonim, Robert] Univ Sydney, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Slonim, Robert] IZA, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Melbourne; Max Planck Society; University of Sydney,"Nikiforakis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",n.nikiforakis@gmail.com,,"Slonim, Robert/0000-0002-9513-4970",,,,,11,49,52,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

We use inflation expectations derived from the quarterly surveys conducted by the Bureau of Economic Research from 2001Q1 to 2011Q4. Using these data, we estimate the model assuming that private sector expectations are a linear function of the inflation target and lagged inflation. The results indicate that economic agents' expectations largely depend on lagged inflation. This suggests that the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has not been successful in anchoring expectations of the private sector since the adoption of the inflation targeting (IT) regime in 2000. We also find evidence indicating that the SARB's implicit inflation target lies above the upper bound of the official IT band. Finally, it appears that the SARB has been more concerned about output stabilisation than inflation stabilisation.","[Kabundi, Alain] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Schaling, Eric] Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; University of Witwatersrand,"Kabundi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Aucland Pk, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",akabundi@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,12,17,17,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Answers in neoclassical and new institutional economics are identified and critiqued. The analysis shows that selective assumptions in both fields produce distinctly market-favoring and more competition is better than less conclusions. The paper generalizes these assumptions and demonstrates organization-favoring and less competition is better positions are equally plausible. The paper also argues that part of the market-favoring bias in these fields stems from failure to distinguish between conditions of market failure and organizational success. Given these problems in extant theory, this paper develops an alternative institutional theory of economic organization, drawing principally on ideas of Walton Hamilton and John Commons. This proposed alternative shows that the optimal level of competition occurs at an intermediate level in the competition/cooperation spectrum (a mixed economy) and varies with five key determinants of the economic order.","[Kaufman, Bruce] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Kaufman, Bruce] Griffith Univ, Ctr Work Org & Wellbeing, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Kaufman, Bruce] Griffith Univ, Dept Human Resources & Employment Relat, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Kaufman, Bruce] Univ Hertfordshire, Work & Employment Res Unit, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Griffith University; Griffith University; University of Hertfordshire,"Kaufman, B (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Loughborough, Leics, England.",,,,,,,,123,5,5,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

While the former basically measure changes between two points in time, the later essentially check whether these changes have been large enough to reach a prespecified target. These indices overcome some of the shortcomings of other conceptually related measures that have been proposed in the literature. Using data from the UN Statistical Office for the new indices, our results suggest that: i) On average, countries have only bridged about 23 % of the gap towards complete achievement of the MDGs, and ii) The best performing countries have only bridged around 40 % of that gap. The observed evolution has been relatively small and highly uneven across countries and dimensions, therefore posing an important challenge for international development agencies and national governments who aim to promote progress in the different MDGs.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Demog, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centre d'Estudis Demografics (CED),"Permanyer, I (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Demog, Edifci E-2, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",inaki.permanyer@uab.es,"Permanyer, Inaki/M-3571-2015","Permanyer, Inaki/0000-0002-7051-5144",,,,,31,2,4,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The pressure exerted through the activities of populations in its basin is starting to have a strong impact; and coastal areas are now exposed to pollution from various origins. Having long served as a buffer between East and West, the Baltic has become a zone of contact. The recent growth in maritime transportation there raises questions about the sea's future that concern both the European Union and Russian Federation.

We show that these techniques are very sensitive to variable definition, choice of additional variables in the model, sample periods and size, and the introduction of structural breaks. The relationship between energy and growth may also have changed over time - energy causes output in the full sample while output causes energy use in recent smaller samples. Energy prices have a more robust causal impact on both energy use and output. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Exporters are more productive, more likely to survive and, hence, more likely to repay loans. A higher repayment probability causes creditors to charge lower interest rates, which stimulates exporters to switch to cost-reducing capital-intensive technologies. A reduction in international trade costs stimulates exporting firms to switch to more efficient capital-intensive technologies, while non-exporters stick to less capital-intensive ones. This within-industry change in the composition of technologies reinforces the productivity advantage of exporters and contributes further to industry-wide productivity improvement. The results of model simulations highlight that 5-10% of total welfare and productivity gains of trade liberalization can result from the adoption of new technologies by existing firms in the industry, thus amplifying the effect of resource reallocation arising from firms' entry and exit.","York Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Liberal Arts & Profess Studies, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",York University - Canada,"Stoyanov, A (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Liberal Arts & Profess Studies, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",andreyst@yorku.ca,,,,,,,27,4,6,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The dataset includes 59,855 households, of whom only 10,829 report to have saved and invested. Hence, we first estimate a logit model to identify the characteristics of the households that have saved. Next, we estimate a multinomial logit model where the investment alternatives for the households are real estate, gold, foreign exchange, bank accounts, capital market investments, and investing into own business. The factors affecting the portfolio choices are the variables representing various aspects of households' demographic, socioeconomic and residential location characteristics. The inflation level nearly doubled during the study period in Turkey. Hence, we also analyse the effects of inflation on households' saving and portfolio choice decisions. The results of our logit model support the view that the inflation can increase the household savings on condition that the other macroeconomic factors are constant. Furthermore, inflation is also found to increase the probability of investing in capital market instruments. Households' incomes, education levels, occupation, place of residence (rural/urban), car ownership and household size are found to be significant variables in explaining the variation in households' saving and portfolio choice behaviour.","Bulent Ecevit Univ, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-67100 Zonguldak, Turkey",Bulent Ecevit University,"Temel Nalin, H (通讯作者)，Bulent Ecevit Univ, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-67100 Zonguldak, Turkey.",halimetemel@gmail.com,"Temel Nalin, Halime/CAF-7032-2022",,,,,,56,8,8,3,45,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Models with additive fixed effects for workers and establishments are fit into four subintervals spanning the period from 1985 to 2009. We show that these models provide a good approximation to the wage structure and can explain nearly all of the dramatic rise in West German wage inequality. Our estimates suggest that the increasing dispersion of West German wages has arisen from a combination of rising heterogeneity between workers, rising dispersion in the wage premiums at different establishments, and increasing assortativeness in the assignment of workers to plants. In contrast, the idiosyncratic job-match component of wage variation is small and stable over time. Decomposing changes in mean wages between different education groups, occupations, and industries, we find that increasing plant-level heterogeneity and rising assortativeness in the assignment of workers to establishments explain a large share of the rise in inequality along all three dimensions.

By presenting a stylized three-country model of trade under oligopoly, we show that there exists a maximum limit of RoO below which forming an FTA is welfare-improving. In examining external tariff reductions under FTA, we take into account the constrained conditions that optimal tariffs set by member countries effectively induce the intrabloc exporters to comply with RoO. This approach rules out trade regime switches and helps identify the economic determinants of establishing an effective and welfare-improving FTA with RoO. We further examine whether an FTA with RoO increases total trade or whether the extra trade arises at the expense of nonmembers. Our simple model has implications for economic factors that foster or impede regional economic integration under imperfect completion.","[Chang, Yang-Ming; Xiao, Renfeng] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Chang, YM (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",ymchang@ksu.edu,,,,,,,27,3,3,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In each of the studies, we presented a choice between an effortless but boring job and an effortful but enjoyable job. Study 1 found that participants were willing to accept lower wages to work at the effortless job, but they preferred the effortful job. This preference reversal is explained by the greater consideration wage setters gave to effort. Study 2 is a consequential lab experiment, in which participants were assigned to work at a job based on the wage they set. Those whose wage demands led them to be assigned to the effortless job experienced lower enjoyment than those who were assigned to the effortful job. Study 3 demonstrates that preference reversal was not attenuated by drawing attention to the hedonic experience afforded by work. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, a simple model based on output gaps demonstrates that the decline in business cycle synchronization during the recovery from the global financial crisis was exceptionally steep by historical standards. We posit two potential reasons for this exceptionally steep decline. First, financial markets during this recovery improved from particularly distressed conditions relative to previous downturns. Second, monetary policy during the recovery from the crisis was constrained in developed economies by the zero bound, but less so in Asia. To test these potential explanations, we examine the implications of an increase in corporate bond spreads similar to that which took place during the recent European financial crisis in a three-region open-economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. Our results confirm that global business cycle synchronization is reduced when zero-bound constraints across the world differ. However, we find that the impact of reduced financial contagion actually goes modestly against our predictions.","[Leduc, Sylvain; Spiegel, Mark M.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Leduc, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, 101 Market St,MS-1130, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",sylvain.leduc@sf.frb.org,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We show that, in an economy where preferences and technology adapt over time, multiple long-term outcomes are mainly brought about by different distributive rules governing the assignment of innovative rents between workers and entrepreneurs. We robustly establish that a successful transition to a two-sector economy is ensured by a balanced distribution restoring the co-ordination of investment and consumption plans. Instead, when innovative rents are too concentrated in favor of either workers or entrepreneurs, the system does not fully accomplish the transition and unemployment might emerge, in contrast, with the standard view of a negative relationship between real wages and employment.

Using a medium-scale New Keynesian model, we compare the effects of disinflations of different speed and timing, implemented through either a money supply rule or an interest rate rule. In terms of transitional output loss, cold-turkey disinflations under an interest rate rule are less costly than those under a money supply rule and are accomplished more rapidly. Furthermore, gradual or anticipated disinflations deliver lower sacrifice ratios. From a welfare perspective, despite the temporary economic contraction, the transitional welfare loss is quantitatively negligible, so that disinflations are overall welfare-improving. The overall welfare gain is not affected by how the disinflation is actually implemented: what really matters is the achievement of a permanently lower inflation rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using annual data over the 1980-2005 period for 22 OECD countries, we find that, only in Portugal, unemployment negatively causes immigration, while in any country, immigration does not cause unemployment.

To study the economic consequences of the reform we develop a simple coordination game where the effects of investor protection on corporate valuation vary with equilibria. Then, using firm-level daily stock return data, we find that the Finnish stock market generally reacts negatively to news of increased investor protection and workload, whereas news of delays in implementation of reform generate largely positive market responses.

We use a rich firm-product level dataset providing both revenue and quantities of all products produced, exported and imported for a large panel of Danish manufacturing firms over the period 1999-2006. With this detailed information, we compute a firm level price index to deflate our measure of output and compare our productivity measures when we deflate output with an industry-level deflator. We find that firms only importing have a large productivity premium, but not firms only involved in exporting, while firms involved in both importing and exporting are the most productive. The international trade premia are found to be significantly larger when output is deflated with our firm-specific price index rather than the traditional sector-level PPI, suggesting that pricing heterogeneity plays an important role in productivity measurement. We also find evidence of a self-selection into exporting but not into importing. Finally, we detect the presence of learning by exporting only when we control for pricing heterogeneity; when looking at learning by importing, we find a positive effect in the long run, but the effect is lower when we deflate revenue with a firm-specific price index. These results suggest that pricing heterogeneity can significantly affect the way we measure productivity and our assessment about the link between productivity and trade. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, it has been shown that much of the estimated annual VAT regressivity is due to the income under-reporting bias inherent in sample surveys. This bias is particularly important in emerging European countries due to a high shadow economy and the evasion of direct income taxes, which suggests household expenditures as a more meaningful indicator of well-being than registered income. Furthermore, theoretical considerations favor the lifetime incidence approach, whereby VAT is estimated to be proportional or mildly progressive. A micro-simulation analysis of the Serbian expenditure survey data yields incidence estimates in line with the existing literature from other countries. We show that a significant presence of own-source (small) farming production of food in many emerging European countries, including Serbia, presents an important progressivity-enhancing buffer compared to the VAT incidence in developed European countries. We conclude that the common beliefs of inherently inequitable VAT taxation are vastly overstated and poorly founded in the economic reality of emerging European countries such as Serbia, where VAT can be most adequately described as being mildly progressive.

In a second stage, we investigate the effect of nonperfect information processing in this setting.

The second approach is based on the decomposition of changes in the ReynoldsSmolensky index into changes in the average tax rate and variations in progressivity. Nonetheless, this decomposition between the average tax rate and progressivity may be further exploited to obtain some information that can be relevant to assess tax reforms. The main aim of this study is to draw up some indicators that can be useful to quantify the effects of non-revenue neutral tax reforms.

Moreover, the results suggest that monetary policy contributed considerably to the unsustainable precrisis developments in housing and credit markets.

In a large, nationally representative sample in the UK, the National Child Development Study, data were collected at birth, in childhood (age 11), and adulthood (age 50) to examine the effects of family social background, childhood ability tests scores, adult personality traits, educational and occupational attainment on current earnings. Results showed that for men, parental social status and trait Conscientiousness had modest but significant and direct influence in their earnings in adulthood; whereas for women the traits of intellect and emotional stability had modest but significant and direct influence in their financial well-being in adulthood. For both men and women, childhood intelligence had a significant and direct effect on adult earnings, and family background and childhood intelligence in part predicted adult earnings mediating through educational qualifications and occupational prestige. The strongest predictor of adult earnings was current occupational prestige. The gender wage differential and its implications are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This paper, which addresses these issues, develops a simultaneous model of the copper market at the LME, with representation of the activities of hedgers, speculators and consumers. This model produces post-sample forecasts of the spot price which outperform conventional benchmarks, thus providing evidence against the efficient market hypothesis. Model-derived forecasts are employed as the foundation of a trading program which produces risk-adjusted profits (net of commission costs) for holding periods of one week and one month, thus fulfilling the 'sufficient condition' for market inefficiency. This study, therefore, provides new insights into price determination on the LME copper market, and resolves the ambiguity of previous research regarding the efficiency of that market. This is the first application of the model forecasting approach to the question of performance of the market for copper.","[Avsar, S.

In this paper, we examine the role of both host and home country characteristics in FDI. To do so, we constructed a firm-level database of outward FDI from Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Our empirical analysis yields two main findings. First, host countries with better environment for FDI, in terms of larger market size, smaller fixed entry costs and lower wages, attract more foreign investors. Second, firms from home countries with higher wages are more likely to invest abroad. An interesting and significant policy implication of our empirical evidence is that policy-makers seeking to promote FDI inflows should prioritize countries with higher wages.","[Hayakawa, Kazunobu] Japan External Trade Org, JETRO Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand; [Lee, Hyun-Hoon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Chunchon 200701, South Korea; [Park, Donghyun] Asian Dev Bank, Dept Econ & Res, Mandaluyong City, Philippines",Kangwon National University; Asian Development Bank,"Lee, HH (通讯作者)，Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Chunchon 200701, South Korea.",hhlee@kangwon.ac.kr,"Hayakawa, Kazunobu/HZM-4324-2023; Hayakawa, Kazunobu/T-9427-2019","Hayakawa, Kazunobu/0000-0003-0032-9060;",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330087] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,11,13,15,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

As for mobility between income classes, the proportion of households remaining in the poor class for a long period of time in Japan is close to the average for EU countries. The panel estimation of its effect on wages shows that the raising of the minimum wage is statistically significantly associated with an increase in wages of non-regular workers, in particular, female, but does not seem to decrease employment. The result shows that for male non-regular workers, firm-provided training promotes their transition to regular employment, and that for female non-regular workers, occupational training promotes their transition to regular employment at different firms.","Keio Univ, Tokyo 108, Japan",Keio University,"Higuchi, Y (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Tokyo 108, Japan.",,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24000003] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,61,6,7,0,42,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

Using Korean disaggregate export data (HS 10-digit level), this paper finds that export participation depends on destination-specific factors such as destination income, distance, local distribution cost, and fixed entry costs associated with the destination language, institution, and information.

At the same time, the specific features of the EU context also heavily influence the nature and logic of the changes, whereby legal and institutional matters linking Cohesion Policy to other EU policies all play an important role.","[McCann, Philip; Ortega-Argiles, Raquel] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"McCann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",p.mccann@rug.nl; r.ortega.argiles@rug.nl,"Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/AAG-1944-2020; Ortega-Argiles, Raquel/HLG-1131-2023; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/0000-0002-7783-2230; McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654",,,,,161,82,85,2,106,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We use economic experiments to test contract theory and assess the empirical relevance of two possible confounding factors that may explain why the theory has not received stronger empirical support. First, parameters of interest may be biased if agents self-select into projects with differing risk profiles based on risk preferences. Second, differing levels of market power on either side of the market could shift contract terms in ways contrary to theoretical predictions. In general, we find support for classical contract theory augmented to accommodate market power and self-selection based on risk preferences. We also find evidence for a third confound in the form of the characteristics of agents not party to the transaction affecting the terms of the contract. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For the overall market index, an increase in oil price return significantly reduces return, and an increase in oil price return volatility significantly reduces volatility. An advantage of looking at sector returns rather than a general index of stock returns is that sectors may well differ markedly in how they respond to oil price shocks. The energy and material sectors (as expected) and the financial sector (surprisingly) are out of step (in different ways) with results for the other sectors and for the overall index. A rise in oil price increases returns in the energy and material sectors and an increase in oil price return volatility increases stock return volatility in the financial sector. Explanation for the negative (positive) association between oil return (oil return volatility) and returns (volatility of returns) in the financial sector must be based on the association via lending to and/or holdings of corporate bonds issued by firms with significant exposure to oil price fluctuations and their speculative positions in oil-related instruments.","[Ratti, Ronald A.] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Hasan, M.

These indices, under appropriate parametric restrictions, are sensitive to two distinct forms of inter-personal inequality. The first form of inequality is concerned with the dispersion of each dimensional achievement across the population. The second is concerned with the association or correlation across dimensions, reflecting the observation that the correlation of individual components of well-being across dimensions is relevant for social welfare evaluation. It is shown that many existing multidimensional welfare indices are closely related to this new class. Statistical tests are developed to verify the significance of the evaluations generated by these indices. Finally, the class of indices is applied to Indonesian data to analyze the impact on financial crisis on the country's social welfare using two waves of Indonesian Family Life Surveys (IFLS).","Univ Oxford, Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat OPHI, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 3TB, England",University of Oxford,"Seth, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat OPHI, Dept Int Dev, 3 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TB, England.",suman.seth@qeh.ox.ac.uk,"Seth, Suman/ABE-1498-2020","Seth, Suman/0000-0002-2591-6977",,,,,52,20,21,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Our analysis is based on a novel data set of administrative records covering the universe of 24 million migrants who entered Ellis Island, New York between 1892 and 1924. We use these records to measure inflows into New York, and then scale-up these figures to estimate migrant inflows into America as a whole. Combining these flow estimates with census data on the stock of foreign-born in America in 1900, 1910 and 1920, we conduct a demographic accounting exercise to estimate out-migration rates in aggregate and for each nationality-age-gender cohort This exercise overturns common wisdom on two fronts. First, we estimate flows into the US to be 20% and 170% higher than stated in official statistics for the 1900-10 and 1910-20 decades, respectively. Second, once mortality is accounted for, we estimate out-migration rates from the US to be around .6 for the 1900-10 decade and around .75 for the 1910-20. These figures are over twice as high as official estimates for each decade. That migration was effectively a two-way flow between the US and the sending countries has major implications for understanding the potential selection of immigrants that chose to permanently reside in the US, their impact on Americans in labor markets, and institutional change in America and sending countries.

Pro-reform attitudes have lost ground between 2006 and 2010 in Central and Eastern European countries that were hit by a negative economic shock. By contrast, they have increased in the CIS. Although on average, individual exposure to the crisis is associated with lower support to democracy and markets, it drives the demand for liberal reforms among groups of the population that were most excluded from the political-economic system in place, the youth particularly, in countries that lag behind in terms of liberalization and, where institutions are corrupt.

ICA is related to the search for latent information: in it, independent components (ICs) from the observed data and selected statistically unrelated ICs are used as new input, intermediate, and output variables for the NSBM. The NSBM is then used in the investigation of multiple-dimension efficiencies, along with operating performance, in the Taiwanese domestic banking sector.

Taking advantage of the cross-sectional and time-series variation in individual Mexican bank balance sheets, I find that the deposits and loans of banks that have a larger share of foreign currency deposits are less sensitive to domestic monetary shocks, particularly for small banks. The results also suggest that banks with a larger foreign deposit share are more sensitive to foreign (U. S.) monetary shocks and Mexican country risk. The results indicate a novel way in which monetary policy has real effects in a partially dollarized economy: Not only are banks unable to easily replace insured deposits with other sources of funds because of information frictions (the conventional bank lending channel), but they are also unable to fully offset a loss of domestic currency deposits with foreign currency deposits.","Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City,"Mora, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, 1 Mem Dr, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA.",nada.mora@kc.frb.org,,,,,,,31,8,8,0,11,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,,,J APPL ECON,J.

According to our estimates, the overall Gini for China increased from 1980/81 to 2008. The rural Gini increased at an exponential rate of 1.2% while the urban Gini rose at a rate of 2.7%. To overcome weaknesses in the existing Gini decomposition methodology, we use the method developed by Podder and Mukhopadhaya (2002. The Changing Pattern of Sources of Income and Its Impact on Inequality: The Method and Its Application to Australia, 197594. Economic Record 77 (238): 24251). In rural China, the results show that household operations are the major component of rural disposable income, while the share of wage income is also high. Income from household operations is inequality reducing, as is the case with transfers. The dominant contributors to inequality are wages and property income. Arguably, the optimal way to reduce inequality is policy-induced increases in transfers and the household operations that help the poor. In the urban sector, wage and salary income have the maximum share in total disposable income. The results show that further increases in the wage share in urban sector will increase total inequality in China.","Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Mukhopadhaya, P (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",pundarik.mukhopadhaya@mq.edu.au,"Mukhopadhaya, Pundarik/J-9074-2019","Mukhopadhaya, Pundarik/0000-0002-7052-4606",,,,,46,7,7,5,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

In the long-run, a 1% increase in income reduces energy intensity by -0.45% to -0.35%. Long-run industrialization elasticities are in the range 0.07 to 012.

Agents with anticipatory preferences, linked through an interaction structure, choose how to interpret and recall public signals about future prospects. Wishful thinking (denial of bad news) is shown to be contagious when it is harmful to others, and self-limiting when it is beneficial. Similarly, with Kreps-Porteus preferences, willful blindness (information avoidance) spreads when it increases the risks borne by others. This general mechanism can generate multiple social cognitions of reality, and in hierarchies it implies that realism and delusion will trickle down from the leaders. The welfare analysis differentiates group morale from groupthink and identifies a fundamental tension in organizations' attitudes towards dissent. Contagious exuberance can also seize asset markets, generating investment frenzies and crashes.","[Benabou, Roland] Princeton Univ, NBER, CEPR, CIFAR,IZA, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bénabou, R (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, NBER, CEPR, CIFAR,IZA, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,88,126,149,1,163,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The empirical analysis uses detailed data on terrorism, natural disasters, and other relevant controls for 176 countries from 1970-2007 to illuminate several key disparities in a postdisaster target choice of terrorists. The results indicate that natural disasters incite both transnational and domestic terrorism; however, evidence is found for dissimilar motivations between the two. While both types of terrorism increase after disasters, transnational attacks against the government increase immediately following the disaster, suggesting an impetus to exploit weakened hard targets during the chaos. Conversely, domestic terrorism against the government takes longer to manifest, suggesting a period of time for which the public recovers and assesses the government's response.","[Berrebi, Claude] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federmann Sch Publ Policy & Govt, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Ostwald, Jordan] USAF, San Angelo, TX 76904 USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force,"Berrebi, C (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federmann Sch Publ Policy & Govt, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",berrebi@rand.org; jostwald@gmail.com,"Ostwald, Jordan/JZC-9576-2024","Berrebi, Claude/0000-0002-1350-5062",,,,,50,24,28,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Agents are aware of the possibility of regime changes and their beliefs matter for the law of motion underlying the macroeconomy. Monetary policy is identified by repeated fluctuations between a Hawk and a Dove regime, with the latter prevailing in the 1970s and during the recent crisis. To explore the role of agents' beliefs I introduce a new class of counterfactual simulations: beliefs counterfactuals. If, in the 1970s, agents had anticipated the appointment of an extremely conservative Chairman, inflation would have been lower and the inflation-output trade-off more favourable. The large drop in inflation and output at the end of 2008 would have been mitigated if agents had expected the Federal Reserve to be exceptionally active in the near future.","Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Bianchi, F (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,"Bianchi, Francesco/AAA-1310-2020",,,,,,45,107,132,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

One possible explanation for this is that entrepreneurs have distinctive preferences for working alone rather than in teams.

Utilizing a diverse subject population with a high proportion of active entrepreneurs, we use a team production experiment to directly examine whether entrepreneurs prefer to work alone or in a team. The experiment also measures an important determinant of entrepreneurs' performances within teams, and their relative tendency to free-ride. The data indicate that entrepreneurs, while no more likely to free-ride on their teammates, are substantially more interested in working alone than similar non-entrepreneurs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Rebel leaders choose between conventional tactics that are heavily reliant on mobilization, irregular tactics that are less so, and withdrawal from conflict. The model yields the following results, among others. Increased nonviolent opportunity has a nonmonotone effect on the use of irregular tactics. Conflict has option value, so irregular campaigns last longer than the rebels' short-term interest dictates, especially in volatile military environments. By demonstrating lack of rebel capacity and diminishing mobilization, successful counterinsurgencies may increase irregular violence.

We propose a new explanation for these patterns in which the self-selection of heterogeneous workers determines sector productivity. We formalize our theory in a general-equilibrium Roy model in which preferences feature a subsistence food requirement. In the model, subsistence requirements induce workers that are relatively unproductive at agricultural work to nonetheless select into the agriculture sector in poor countries. When parameterized, the model predicts that productivity differences are roughly twice as large in agriculture as non-agriculture even when countries differ by an economy-wide efficiency term that affects both sectors uniformly.","[Lagakos, David] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Waugh, Michael E.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; New York University,"Lagakos, D (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, 501 E Orange St,CPCOM 412A, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",laga-kos@asu.edu; mwaugh@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,59,159,194,10,80,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

The framework describes a population of boundedly rational electricity producers who decide each period on the allocation of profits among different energy technologies. They tend to invest in below-average cost energy technologies, while also devoting a small fraction of profits to alternative technological options and research on recombinant innovation. Energy technologies are characterized by costs falling with cumulative investments. Without the latter, new technologies have no chance to become cost competitive. We study the conditions under which a new energy technology emerges and technologies coexist. In addition, we determine which investment heuristics are optimal in the sense of minimizing the total cost of electricity production. This is motivated by the idea that, while diversity contributes to system adaptability (innovation) and resilience to unforeseen contingencies (keeping options open), a high cost will discourage investments in it.","[Safarzynska, Karolina] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Environm & Reg Dev, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

However, there is limited information on the nature and extent of social capital, and how it influences the diffusion of water system innovations at community level. This paper explores the role of social capital on the uptake of water system innovations in the Makanya watershed. Information on role of social capital in the diffusion of water systems innovations was analysed using data collected through key informants interviews, focus group discussions and structured questionnaire. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to analyse the data and the results were summarized in tables and figures. Results show that the social capital elements, which are key to adoption of WSIs are group belonging and information pathways. Group belonging was significant in the diffusion of terraces at P<0.001 in the upland and P<0.1 at watershed level. Information and communication pathways were not significant in the diffusion of terraces but were significant (P<0.01) in the diffusion of ndivas and diversion canals. This paper recommends the inclusion of these parameters in the design of uptake and up-scaling strategy for WSIs especially in the study area. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Tumbo, S.

Consistent with earlier studies, we find that the oil price falls with an unexpected rise in either U.S. or international ex-ante real interest rates. When the ex-post real interest rate is used, the oil price only falls with rises to short-term rates (3 months or less). Additionally, the response of the oil price to long-term ex-ante real interest rates must include the period through the mid-2000s for the inverse relationship to appear. In contrast, the oil price consistently falls with unexpected rises in short-term real interest rates throughout the entire sample. We draw two conclusions from the results. The first is that the oil price is consistently responsive to short-term U.S. and international real interest rates, underlying the importance of storage. Second, oil prices have become more responsive to long-term real interest rates over time.

Relying on a semi-parametric generalized additive model, we estimate both reduced and structural forms for total factor productivity growth. We consider three measurements of frontier: the economy with the highest level of productivity growth, the world productivity growth and the productivity growth of the USA. We obtain a U-shape relation between productivity growth and the proximity to the world productivity growth. The relation between productivity growth and human capital displays an inverted U-shape form (res. U-shape) when the proximity to the highest productivity growth is used (res. the proximity to productivity growth of the USA). Total staff in R&D has an inverted W-shape effect on productivity growth. The share of R&D expenditure funded by government and from abroad impact positively the growth of productivity. However, the increase in government spending on R&D has a greater impact on productivity growth when the former is weak, and a smaller impact when R&D spending is already high. International trade has a positive effect on productivity growth. Specification tests show that our semi-parametric models provide a better approximation of the data compared to the parametric analogue, revealing a high degree of nonlinearity governing productivity growth.

The study goes beyond the conventional use of first and second moments of returns and uses the timevarying equity price of risk methodology to measure the level of convergence of the financial sectors in the countries of interest. More specifically, Kalman filter convergence tests are applied to the weekly equity price of risk data to measure the interconnectedness between these countries' and the US finance sectors. Results indicate the presence of short-term timevarying interconnectedness of the finance sectors of France. Germany and the UK with that of the US and steady-state longer term interconnectedness only between Germany and the US.

We analyze the performance of a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms between 1998 and 2006, relating it to firm age. We find evidence that firms improve with age, because ageing firms are observed to have steadily increasing levels of productivity, higher profits, larger size, lower debt ratios, and higher equity ratios. Furthermore, older firms are better able to convert sales growth into subsequent growth of profits and productivity. On the other hand, we also found evidence that firm performance deteriorates with age. Older firms have lower expected growth rates of sales, profits and productivity, they have lower profitability levels (when other variables such as size are controlled for), and also that they appear to be less capable to convert employment growth into growth of sales, profits and productivity.

Two are the salient features of our study: first, the total energy consumption has been adjusted for qualitative differences among its constituent components through the thermodynamics of energy conversion. In doing so, we rule out the possibility of a misleading inference with respect to causality due to aggregation bias. Second, the investigation of the causal linkage between economic growth and the adjusted for quality total energy consumption is conducted within a non-linear context. Our empirical results reveal significant unidirectional both linear and non-linear causal linkages running from total useful energy to economic growth.

Output is limited to customer loans. The profit function is based on output and selected inputs. Risk-avoidance (using the capitalization ratio) depends on micro and micro(*)macro interactive variables. The SUR method is used to test the hypothesis that the two functions are interdependent. Also, a single reduced-form equation is derived from the SUR model to analyze the volatility of the capitalization ratio. Five European countries and their banks for the period 1991-2001 are used to run the regressions and to test the hypothesis. The individual statistical results were generally consistent with similar results found in the literature. The Breusch-Pagan test of independence was rejected. A key finding from the volatility analysis suggests that bank profit rates are inversely related to the volatility of the banks' capitalization ratios as measured by their variances.

Despite this severe moral-hazard problem, this article shows the seller will invest with positive probability in equilibrium and that trade will occur with positive probability. The outcome of the game is sensitive to the distribution of bargaining power between the parties, with a holdup problem existing if the buyer has the bargaining power. A consequence of the holdup problem is surplus-reducing distortions in investment level. Perhaps counterintuitively, in many situations, this distortion involves an increase in the expected amount invested vis-a-vis the situation without holdup.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hermalin, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",hermalin@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,0,11,14,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

However, year-on-year regressions of a log-linearized gravity model estimated by the ordinary least squares (OLS) method usually suggest that the negative impact of distance on trade is rising since the 1950s during the late 20th century. These seemingly counter-intuitive results may occur due to the omission of the extensive margin as well as the neglect of the Jensen's inequality. This paper investigates these two potential solutions but that only the second seems to work. After considering Jensen's inequality, the distance effects declined over the period 1950-1999. In addition, this paper proposes a simple theoretical model to identify trade costs. The empirical results also show a declining trend of trade costs over the same time period. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Market based price discovery and different renewable support schemes are seen as key solutions in achieving the desired future production mix. Most liquid power markets use marginal cost based price discovery where the price is set by marginal costs of the last producer needed to cover all load, usually a fossil fuel power plant. At the same time the majority of new investments are made with significant help from government support schemes in renewable production capacities, which have very low marginal costs. The increasing share of renewable production will thus impact price levels in day-ahead markets. This paper analyses the potential impact of more renewable electricity production on price discovery in the NordPool Spot market, which already has a high share of renewable electricity traded.

In the best-case scenario index education is weighted considerably more than the other two components, per capita income and life expectancy, relative to the weight that it gets in the official equally-weighted index. It also turns out that the improvement in the official HDI is mainly driven by improvements over time in the education index, the component moving fastest relative to its targets, when compared with per capita income and life expectancy.

Search, or the ability to keep good projects and reject bad ones, attracts low-ability agents into entrepreneurship. The model also explains why low-profit firms do not always exit.

This paper discusses whether this feature would result in an asymmetric relationship between housing prices and monetary policy. This paper first uses the loss aversion behavior of traders to assess the viability of housing price rigidity in the housing market and to deduce further that if downward housing price rigidity actually existed, then the impact of monetary policy on housing prices should be asymmetric. For empirical tests, this paper uses data from the UK housing market and then uses-the money supply as the proxy variable of monetary policy. The relationships between these two variables are observed. This paper performs estimation using both traditional and threshold error correction models by comparing the coefficients of both models. The results indicate that housing price is indeed asymmetrically adjusted to money supply. When housing prices increase to reflect a loose monetary policy, a modification behavior is evident. Conversely, housing prices cannot easily reflect a tight monetary policy. This result indicates that housing prices tend to overreact in upturn and underreact in downturn. The results imply that when implementing relevant policies for the housing market, the government should consider the asymmetry of housing price changes. Otherwise, the situation can easily result in the creation of a bubble or the collapse of the housing market because of incorrect policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Outsourcing affects the wage gap through direct as well as indirect channels. While outsourcing decreases the effective wage of skilled workers in the services sector, owing to inter-sectoral labour mobility, its overall impact on the equilibrium skilled wage is positive. Through an increase in the size of external economies in the industrial sector, outsourcing can reduce the unskilled wage. In overall terms, outsourcing of skill-intensive tasks increases the skilled unskilled wage gap. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The paper aims to provide quantitative estimates of the potential impact of the euro zone debt crisis on merchandise exports as well as on economic growth and poverty reduction efforts in the region. The results indicate that a one-percentage-point fall of output growth of the euro zone would result in a total export loss of $166 billion. In addition, the protectionist threats could further increase the loss in exports by $27 billion. On social development, the disorderly euro zone debt crisis scenario would prevent 8.19 million people to get out of poverty and another 1.15 million would be pushed back into poverty as per the $1.25-a-day poverty line. The paper illustrates that macroeconomic policy space appears adequate in most economies that tend to be more heavily affected by the euro zone debt crisis.

However, a large share of these are wholesalers. This suggests that the number of producers selling their products abroad might be much greater than that suggested by a simple count of the firms directly reporting their exports. This paper sheds light on the role of wholesalers in international trade. Our model uses very general assumptions to show that intermediated exporters may contribute significantly to the extension of countries' export opportunities. The model predicts a twofold role in international trade. First, wholesalers alleviate the difficulty of reaching less-accessible markets. Second, they help less-efficient firms to supply foreign markets, thus increasing the number of exported varieties at the aggregate level. We use French firm-level export data to provide empirical support for these two predictions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Given its changing borders and turbulent history, Poland provides a fertile setting for an examination of the contributions of history-related factors to regional variation in economic and social outcomes. In this paper we focus on academic achievement and find that economic dislocation following the transformation from communism and the absence of long-lasting social institutions as a result of population relocation appear to have had substantial adverse effects on academic achievement in some regions.

According to the original model, a speculative attack on a high debt level issued abroad triggers external debt default. Here, it is possible to inflate away the domestic debt to avoid the external debt default. We consider two possibilities for domestic debt denomination: (i) local currency and (ii) common currency. In the second case, inflation depends on a monetary union decision. Our numerical results show that to have a debt share denominated in a common currency is optimal when the refinancing risks are highly correlated across union members. Otherwise, the best is to keep the domestic debt denominated in local currency. Finally, the extreme case of having all debt issued abroad and denominated in a foreign currency is suitable when, under alternative regimes, suboptimal inflation motivated by political factors is likely. Although the paper was originally developed for emerging market economies, it sheds some light on the recent Eurozone crisis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This fact-coming from utilitarianism and the neo-classics-is not new. But by doing this, firms don't recognize that they cause a huge amount of negative externalities with an extreme impact on the ecosystem. The consequences are a decreasing quality of the environment and natural resources, resulting in social costs (diseases, epidemics, life quality reduction) and ecological costs (degradation of air, water and soil, and ozone depletion). It is evident that every production process has an impact on the environment when it extracts resources from the environmental system and inserts waste into it. The ecosystem has its limits and its own complex rules, based on biochemical, geochemical, physical, oceanographic etc. processes. The environmental system has the unique capacity to assimilate waste and to regenerate. How can enterprises drive their processes in a socially and environmentally friendly manner? How could economic interests balance with social and environmental incentives? The concept of sustainable development can give some answers. Our way of life, which has become greener in recent years is a step towards sustainability: we produce green products. We use green IT. We live in green homes. But is that really a sustainable path? Technological progress can help to implement strategies and apply principles for sustainable competitive positioning and long-term success for sustainable enterprises. This paper gives an insight into the complexity of our world system, and the interdependences between enterprises and the natural environment. By applying a simple world model the author tries to develop a concept which is the basis to explain what does sustainability really means. The World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) contributed the most frequently quoted definition. At the end of this article some green examples are shown and strategies for successful sustainable enterprises are developed.","Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Informat Syst 1, Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Barbian, D (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Informat Syst 1, Nurnberg, Germany.",dina.barbian@wiso.uni-erlangen.de,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,38,46,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000005,0

At the core of this vindication story is the escape dynamics, recurrent sliding away from the path leading to the time-consistent suboptimal equilibrium level of inflation and toward the low-inflation, optimal, time-inconsistent Ramsey outcome: by recurrently estimating a reduced-form model, in fact, the policy maker could periodically learn an approximate version of the natural rate hypothesis and therefore be induced to disinflate the economy. Two elements seem important in this story: the type of model used by the policy maker to represent the economy, whether structural or reduced-form, and the policy specification, whether derived taking the private sector's expectations as given or as endogenous to the policy design. Although Sargent (1999) stresses the first element, we find that it is instead the second aspect that is crucial to generate recurrent periods of low inflation: the policy maker has to recognize the endogeneity of the private sector's expectations and refrain from exploiting ephemeral short-run trade-offs between inflation and unemployment.","Univ Manchester, Econ DA, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Berardi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Econ DA, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",michele.berardi@manchester.ac.uk,"Berardi, Michele/ABD-2410-2020","Berardi, Michele/0000-0001-8145-5207",,,,,17,3,3,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

However, many industrial workers are not able to work until they have reached the increased retirement age. This problem is decreasing social security, increasing workers anxiety regarding the future and influencing the quality and timing of production processes. Disruptions and lower quality items produced in one activity cell of a supply chain can have a ripple effect throughout an entire supply chain. To solve this problem, we should put in place supplementary occupational pension schemes, which would compensate firms for the depreciated ability of their elderly workers to work when they have reached the previous retirement age but have not yet reached the new, higher retirement age. This article is introduces a model that is based on extended MRP Theory. The model can be used as a basis for negotiations between employers and employees to keep production at the same level of quality. The trade-off between higher contributions to supplementary occupational pension schemes and lower added values is considered. Contributions enable the early retirement of industrial workers at one or more workplaces in a supply chain, while lower added value is the result of lower quality and the perturbed timing of items that are produced in one or more activity cells of a supply chain: these issues have a ripple effect throughout an entire supply chain.

We investigate whether the pre-announcement run-up of prices can be explained by rumours in the media and the percentage of capital previously owned by the bidding firm, among other factors. We examine cumulative abnormal returns in an event window of 60 days prior the acquisition announcement, with the event date adjusted for the previous disclosure of news about the acquisition, in the media. We compute a run-up index, and find that there are abnormal positive returns before the announcement date, confirming previous studies.

Concretization of the concepts and indicators of IC, IC analysis in the higher education institutions of Latvia, based on the evaluation of IC components of academic management and marketing aspects in international trade has been carried out in the study. The study aims to characterize the higher education product intellectual value components and their changes according to modern academic management requirements. The objective of the study is to develop recommendations for the management of higher education of Latvia in order to ensure the demand for intellectual capacity on the local and export market. The research problem pertains to what has to be altered in the higher education programs, in the student achievement assessment system, the organization of the study process, based on international experience and export demand. Methods used in the study: monographic international literature review, comparative data analysis, internal customer (consumer) needs analysis, content analysis, evaluation of higher education academic personnel and expert evaluation. Models, structures and methodologies for IC measurement, evaluation and application, mainly used in corporate marketing analysis, created by different scientists exist and function more or less successfully in the theory and practice of the world. The end of the 90s may be historically considered a precursor for IC implementation in the practice of higher education institutions. A more serious focus was dedicated to IC research starting from 2005. At present, many countries see the international academic mobility and education mobility programs as the critical aspects of experience exchange, intellectual capital increase, maintaining of competitiveness and strengthening of mutual cooperation in a globalised world. The assessment of IC however is still insufficiently included in the academic management of higher education institutions, as well as up to now a single IC model for application in the practice of the universities has not been created. The authors conclude that of the traditional three IC components (human capital, structural capital and relationship capital) some indicators can be found in the reviews of Latvian universities, whereas a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the country IC measurements is not available and has not been carried out. The analysis of IC commenced at the higher education institutions of Latvia should be continued and visibility and application of IC has to continue to be included in the development planning documents, studies and university annual reports, as well as reflected in the national legislation, because IC constitutes the uniqueness of the higher education institution and ensures its competitiveness on the market.","[Brenca, Airita] Univ Latvia, Dept Educ Sci, Fac Educ Psychol & Art, Riga, Latvia; Univ Latvia, Dept Dev & Planning, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia; University of Latvia,"Brenca, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Dept Educ Sci, Fac Educ Psychol & Art, Riga, Latvia.",airita.brenca@inbox.lv; rasma.garleja@lu.lv,,,,,,,27,4,6,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,495,505,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000057,0

We find that MSMEs receiving a cash flow or collateral loan in the past are more likely to receive the same type of loan (and larger sized) in the future and that cash flow loans may be the preferred form of credit. Both types of loans are related positively to most performance indicators, enabling the MSMEs for instance to be more profitable and expand production. The cash flow loans also appear to be particularly attractive credit delivery schemes for micro and small enterprises.

To realize the maximized profits through such collaborations, it is important to have a fruitful and healthy collaboration. S&T collaboration platform in Wenzhou, China, is a new fashioned form. This paper analyzes the collaboration relationship and explores the influence of collaboration on private SMEs. Based on a survey of 523 private SMEs and 61 higher education institutions, the results indicate that private SMEs can improve economic performance through the collaborations with higher education institutions on the platform. Furthermore, the economic performance of private SMEs is positively related with the collaborated projects. In other words, the number of the collaboration projects is one of the factors that affect the economic performance (i.e. the more collaboration, the better economic performance). The results have also revealed that SMEs that choose different collaboration models on the platform will produce different effects on the economic performances of enterprises. In addition, the major barriers to the collaboration have been analyzed from two perspectives in this study. Among all the collaboration barriers between universities and private SMEs, Lack of efficient communication channel and Unreasonable transfer cost for the R&D achievements of universities have been identified as the most important factors. Meanwhile, the performances of the five communication mechanisms (i.e. coordination mechanism, supervision mechanism, transmission mechanism, propaganda mechanism and guarantee mechanism) have also been examined with the aim of devising policies and proposing a possible solution to improve the collaboration efficiency between higher education institutions and industry.","[Chen, Feiyu; Wu, Chong; Yang, Weining; Zhang, Wei] Harbin Inst Technol, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Chen, FY (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, 92 West Dazhi St, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.",feiyuchen@outlook.com,,,,,,,25,2,5,2,27,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

For nearly 30 years there has been a prevailing consensus supporting the hypothesis that a retrovirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), is the unique and exclusive cause of a pandemic of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS); that HIV spreads heterosexually; and that all who acquire it will inevitably and inexorably develop AIDS and eventually die. This article shows that whilst this hypothesis is widely and uncritically held the epidemiological data collected impartially and globally are consistent with other hypotheses where anomalies are fewer. There are substantial resource implications. The findings suggest that resources should, especially in African countries, be directed away from research into HIV and use of anti-retroviral drugs and vaccines into projects to improve basic living conditions in the areas of water quality, basic hygiene and nutrition, where recurrences of other lethal diseases overlap with HIV/AIDS.","[Craven, B.

Parental methamphetamine (meth) use grew significantly during the same period. While child welfare workers and law enforcement claim that parental meth use contributes to foster care growth, the evidence for a causal effect has not been determined. This paper presents the first evidence of a causal effect of meth on foster care admissions using two exogenous supply-side interventions in meth markets from the late 1990s for identification. First, we find that restrictions on meth precursor distribution caused meth use (proxied by white meth self-referred treatment cases) to decline 4.1%. Second, using two-stage least squares, we estimate a positive elasticity of foster care cases with respect to meth use of 1.54. We also estimate elasticities of 1.03 and 1.49 for cases of child neglect and parental abuse, respectively. These results suggest that child welfare policies should be designed specifically for the children of meth-using parents.

We use the model to study a bilateral trade flow influenced significantly by learning and reputation, namely U.S. imports of Japanese cars over the period 1961-2004. Numerical simulations replicate the trade flow in a robust fashion. Including the Voluntary Export Restraint in our simulations predicts U.S. imports decreased by 2.46 million cars over the years 1981-1984. Since learning and reputation building require time, predicted short run trade patterns can be quite different than those predicted in the long run. We apply this idea to understand the change in Japanese market share in the U.S. automobile market. We also explore the importance of sectorial differences in the speed of learning and reputation building on predicted trade patterns. Lastly, we examine how the extent of asymmetric information existing between importers and exporters changes under different trade policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This article contributes to the debate on the money demand stability and presents further evidence of a structural shift in the US money demand function. The switching regression technique developed by Goldfeld and Quandt (1972) shows that the US money demand function displays a gradual structural break during the 1994-1995 period. The traditional Goldfeld money demand model was estimated by the nonlinear optimization methods. Consumer and corporate interest rates were included in the model specifications. In all specifications, the results show a two-regime money demand model with a significant structural shift common to the 1994-1995 period. The study period from 1966: I to 2009: IV suggests that any identified shift is the most significant break in the series. Thus, this study demonstrates that the most significant transition from the first to the second regime is gradual rather than abrupt, as suggested by the previous studies. We believe that the cause of the gradual break may be associated with the US recession in the 1992-1993 period. This finding suggests that a two-regime demand model can be used in US money demand analysis and forecasting in future.","[Karemera, David] S Carolina State Univ, Sch Business, Orangeburg, SC 29117 USA; [Davis, Bobby] Florida A&M Univ, Sch Business & Ind, Tallahassee, FL 32302 USA",South Carolina State University; State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University,"Karemera, D (通讯作者)，S Carolina State Univ, Sch Business, Orangeburg, SC 29117 USA.",karemera@scsu.edu,,,,,,,17,1,2,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Estimates are based on a difference-in-differences methodology that compares final and mid-term exam scores after the switch, with final and mid-term exam scores before the switch. The empirical findings suggest that the shift of final exams to the end of the academic year had a negative effect on student achievement.

Research suggests that complexity in the aid process undermines its effectiveness in inducing more students into college. A previous Tax Policy and the Economy paper showed that most of the data items in the aid application did not affect the distribution of aid and that the much shorter set of variables available in IRS data could be used to closely replicate the existing distribution of aid. This added momentum to a period of discussion and activity around simplification in Congress and the US Department of Education. In this article, we provide a 5-year retrospective of what has changed in the aid application process, what has not, and the possibilities for future reform. While there has been some streamlining in the process of applying for aid, it has fallen far short of its goals. Two dozen questions were removed from the aid application and a dozen added, reducing the number of questions from 127 to 116. Funding for college has also been complicated by the growth of a parallel system for aid: the tax system. A massive expansion in federal tax incentives for college, in particular the American Opportunity Tax Credit, has led to millions of households completing paperwork for both the IRS and the US Department of Education in order to qualify for college funding.","[Dynarski, Susan; Wiederspan, Mark] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Scott-Clayton, Judith] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Columbia University,,,"Dynarski, Susan/GOP-1216-2022",,,,,,62,18,20,0,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60 ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",1537-2650,,978-0-226-09779-4,TAX POL EC,,,2013,27,,,,,,161,+,,10.1086/671247,0.0,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJH56,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328232500007,0

This is accomplished through an integrated approach to organizational design and function emphasising innovation, operational, supply chain, customer-related, human capital, financial, marketplace, societal, and environmental performance. The intent of this approach is to ethically, efficiently and effectively (E3) integrate 3E (equity, ecology, economy) Triple Top Line strategy throughout enterprise culture and activities to produce Triple Bottom Line 3P (people, planet, profit) results that are simultaneously pragmatic and innovative. Many factors critical to SEE are treated seriously by the balanced scorecard or by organizational excellence models such as those behind notable international quality awards. Other such factors are addressed by, for example, the Global Reporting Initiative or in the annual Communication of Progress reports expected of United Nations Global Compact members. Various approaches to production of a single integrated model have been tried, all with limited success. A model of a first kind adds a sustainability module to an excellence model, a model of a second kind adds an excellence module to a sustainability model, and a model of the third kind aims at integration from the start. A model of the third kind referred to as a Springboard to SEE is proposed that explicitly integrates sustainability and excellence from strategy through results and back to strategy, that is, continuously. The Springboard aims to translate the 3E Triple Top Line strategy into 3P Triple Bottom Line results. Enterprise success in this effort must be assessed in order to provide performance feedback, suggest necessary changes, and point the organization toward next best practices and sources of competitive advantage. Toward that end Springboard assessment uses maturity scales and a SEE NEWS Report that combines graphical NEWS Compasses and companion SWOT Plot Narratives that focus on enterprise strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats relative to SEE performance. Sustainability in essentially any context may be regarded as a capacity to endure. As with many concepts, sustainability has become so vaguely defined and so broadly used that conversations surrounding sustainability often become unfocused, with many voices using words that sound the same, but to which undetected differences in meaning or intent have been attached. It is often only much later, at the point where strategy must be defined and implemented and resources committed, that such differences are revealed. Herein then, sustainability is the capacity to endure. Contextually, enterprise sustainability should manifest as economic viability and contribute to both societal and environmental sustainability. Exceptional enterprises should excel within this context, means for which are suggested. In all the objective is to foster continuously relevant and responsible organizations.","[Edgeman, Rick; Eskildsen, Jacob] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Edgeman, R (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark.",rledge@asb.dk; eskildsen@asb.dk,"Edgeman, Rick/AAE-9251-2019",,,,,,39,0,0,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,123,131,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000015,0

As a result, input choices may differ systematically across firms in ways that are unrelated to their productive efficiency. We propose an accounting framework that allows us to assess empirically the magnitude of the loss in aggregate resources due to such misallocation. To a second-order approximation, the framework requires only information on the dispersion in borrowing costs across firms, which we measure-for a subset of U.S. manufacturing firms-directly from the interest rate spreads on their outstanding publicly-traded debt. Given the observed dispersion in borrowing costs, our approximation method implies a relatively modest loss in efficiency due to resource misallocation-on the order of 1 to 2 percent of measured total factor productivity (TFP). In our framework, the correlation between firm size and borrowing costs has no bearing on TFP losses under the assumption that financial distortions and firm-level efficiency are jointly log-normally distributed. To take into account the effect of covariation between firm size and borrowing costs, we consider a more general framework, which dispenses with the assumption of log-normality and which implies somewhat higher estimates of the resource losses-about 3.5 percent of measured TFP. Counterfactual experiments indicate that dispersion in borrowing costs must be an order of magnitude higher than that observed in the U.S. financial data, in order for misallocation-arising from financial distortions-to account for a significant fraction of measured TFP differentials across countries.

We build a model with multiple destination countries and show that immigration policy in one country is influenced by measures adopted abroad as migrants choose where to locate (in part) in response to differences in immigration policy. This interdependence gives rise to a leakage effect of immigration policy, an international externality well documented in the empirical literature. In this environment, immigration policy becomes strategic and unilateral behavior may lead to coordination failures, where receiving countries are stuck in welfare inferior equilibria.

The successful development of renewable energy industry in Iowa is concomitant with increase in freight traffic and is likely to have significant impacts on transportation infrastructure condition and increased maintenance expenses for the state and local governments. The primary goal of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of employing the Neural Networks (NN) methodology to forecast the impacts of Iowa's biofuels and wind power industries on Iowa's secondary and local road condition and maintenance-related costs in a panel data framework. The data for this study were obtained from a number of sources and for a total of 24 counties in clusters in Northern, Western, and Southern Iowa over a period of ten years. Back-Propagation NN (BPNN) using a Quasi-Newton second-order training algorithm was chosen for this study owing to its very fast convergence properties. Since the size of the training set is relatively small, ensembles of well-trained NNs were formed to achieve significant improvements in generalization performance. The developed NN forecasting models could identify the presence of biofuel plants and wind farms as well as large-truck traffic as the most sensitive inputs influencing pavement condition and granular and blading maintenance costs. Pavement deterioration resulting from traffic loads was found to be associated with the presence of both biofuel plants and wind farms. The developed NN forecasting models can be useful in identifying and properly evaluating future transportation infrastructure impacts resulting from the renewable energy industry development and thus help Iowa maintain its competitive edge in the rapidly developing bioeconomy.","[Gopalakrishnan, Kasthurirangan; Gkritza, Konstantina Nadia] Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Gopalakrishnan, K (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 354 Town Engn Bldg, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",rangan@iastate.edu,"Gopalakrishnan, Kasthurirangan/A-8336-2009; Gkritza, Konstantina/B-3188-2011","Gkritza, Konstantina/0000-0002-6598-4771",,,,,37,1,2,0,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Comparing views on corruption in terms of the problem of agency and the problem of rent-seeking we argue that corruption in general is the problem of legal setting and its enforcement and, if badly established, it does not promote economic growth. To verify the theoretical argument we present empirical Granger causality test to demonstrate that corruption precedes economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe. This means that legal setting and its enforcement rather allow for rent-seeking than promote economic growth. As a consequence we emphasize the necessity to focus on institutional framework to fight corruption and support economic growth.","[Grochova, Ladislava; Otahal, Tomas] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Grochová, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ladislava.grochova@mendelu.cz; tomas.otahal@mendelu.cz,"Otáhal, Tomáš/AAJ-4174-2020; Issever Grochova, Ladislava/E-6841-2013","Issever Grochova, Ladislava/0000-0002-9983-4077",,,,,54,4,4,1,22,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The estimated parameter vector reveals that the one-by-one relationship that is required for solvency does not prevail for the sub-periods before and after the first break, however it prevails for the sub-period after the second break.

A growing economy needs more energy, which is exacerbated by growing population. Evidence suggests that financial development can reduce energy use by increasing energy efficiency. Economic growth and energy consumption in Malaysia have been rising in tandem over the past several years. The three public policy objectives of Malaysia are: economic progress, population growth and financial development. It is of interest to the policymakers to understand the dynamic interrelation among the stated objectives. The paper explores the existence of a long run relation among energy use, aggregate production, financial development and population in Malaysia; and causality using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The results suggest that energy consumption is influenced by economic growth and financial development, both in the short and the long run, but the population-energy relation holds only in the long run. The findings have important policy implications for balancing economic growth vis-a-vis energy consumption for Malaysia, as well as other emerging nations.

Our findings support the two features of the opportunistic approach. First, we find that the models that include an intermediate target that reflects the recent history of inflation rather than simple inflation target improve the fit of the models. Second, the data supports the view that the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) behaves with some degree of nonresponsiveness when inflation is within the zone of discretion but react aggressively otherwise.

This paper complements the scarce empirical literature by testing his conjecture on South African household data and finds that Black and Coloured households spend relatively more on visible consumption than comparable White households. Following the approach of Charles et al. (2009), this paper explores whether the differences in visible expenditures can be explained with a signaling model of status seeking. Moreover, it is assessed to which extent positional concerns motivate conspicuous consumption. Although the socially contingent share in visible consumption increases with income, different incentives to consume conspicuously seem to explain that, at every level of income, Black households spend relatively more on visible consumption than comparable White households. In contrast to the findings of Charles et al. (2009) where differential spending on conspicuous consumption can be found also within each group separately, the model's core hypothesis fails to hold within the group of White South Africans.

The U.S. monetary policy shock is defined as unexpected change in Effective Federal Funds Rate (FFR). We use a time varying parameter factor augmented VAR approach (TVP-FAVAR) to study the EFFR shocks together with a large data set of 265, major financial, macroeconomic and trade variables for U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, UK, Japan, Australia, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland and New Zealand. Our main findings are as follows. First, negative U.S. monetary policy shocks have considerable negative impact on GDP growth in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Sweden while most of the other member countries benefits. Second, the transmission to GDP growth has increased in OECD countries since the early 1980s. We also detect a more depressed GDP over medium term in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, Norway and Sweden over the recent global financial crisis. Third, the size of U.S. monetary policy shocks during financial turmoil periods were unusual than normal periods and varies overtime. The financial crisis (2008-2009) is evidenced by decline in residential investment in the U.S. and propagation of this shock to Canada, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand over the recent period.

I find that international macroeconomic comovements can be generated by news about the future TFP in the US. Unlike previous studies, I show that the response of the Canadian or Japanese TFP to a US news shock is important for generating the boom observed in the empirical analysis. The estimated preference parameters indicate that eliminating the wealth effect on hours worked is important.

For simple pay-off options they can be viewed as an approximation of famous Black-Scholes option valuation formula. By increasing the quantity of periods in binomial model (i.e. decreasing the length of the period), the results converge to the continuous model. However this approximation is very computationally costly, thus the analytical solution to the valuation is preferable. Nevertheless, the analytical solution does not exist for more complicated pay-off options. In the article we assume the valuation of project with the possibility to change the quantity of products produced. Some input parameters (concretely the volatility and initial cash-flows) are assumed to be uncertain and stated as a fuzzy numbers. Illustrative example is provided in the paper. In this example we examine the time complexity of the algorithm and the influence of the imprecision of input parameters on the appraisal imprecision. From the results it is apparent that the complexity of the model is quadratic.

The fact that RJVs can be both more profitable and yield higher expected net welfare than independent firms is surprising because it is derived from a model in which RJVs do not optimize over R&D investment.

We compare the current period with the classical period, both featured by a finance economy with developed financial markets and unregulated institutions. Beyond the differences determined by the monetary regime and concerning the central bank rate policy, we find similarities such as the enlargements of the set of counterparties and eligible collateral assets. Since the credit system is based on financial markets and innovations, central banks have a wider involvement that goes beyond a narrow conception of the lender of last resort that prevailed under a regulated banking system. We conclude that the historical roots of financial stabilisation by central banks in a finance economy have just been rediscovered, and that the functions of lender of last resort and market maker of last resort may be analytically integrated.","[Le Maux, Laurent] Paris St Denis Univ, Paris, France; [Scialom, Laurence] Paris W Nanterre Univ, Paris, France",,"Le Maux, L (通讯作者)，Paris St Denis Univ LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93200 St Denis, France.",laurent.le_maux@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,68,9,9,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Exploiting the persistence of this sharing system, we use the VAT share in 1995 as an instrument for the present fiscal incentives. We find that cities with higher fiscal incentives built significantly more sewage treatment capacity between 2002 and 2008.

As approximators of the corporate tax burden there will be considered tax quota on the capital and World Tax Index.

Based on alternative measures of currency misalignment, the study extends the literature by investigating the impact of an undervalued currency on services. The empirical findings show that together with productivity and income per capita, currency undervaluation significantly determines the total employment share of services. Another key finding is that conventional crosscountry determinants and the exchange rate undervaluation can only partially explain the underdevelopment of services activity in China and in other South-East Asian countries. In these countries, policies that aim at rebalancing the economy towards services should include elements to reform the domestic financial market, and the social security and healthcare systems.","European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Özyurt, S (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",Selin.Ozyurt@ecb.int,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2013,21,1,,,,,47,63,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12008.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,073MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313747300003,0

The main objective of this paper was to explore the possibilities for improvement of important business processes, such as supply chain management in fast moving consumer goods industry (FMCG) with the technique of business process reengineering (BPR) and business process improvement (BPI). Methodology used in this paper included a step approach in line with the Harvard Business School Business (HBS, 2010) process improvement supported with value stream mapping (VSM) lean tools. First, the authors made a review of available literature on business process reengineering and supply chain management. In continuation, there have been analyzed the technique of BPI according to the HBS and then integrated appropriate aspects and steps of BPI in supply chain process of domestic company. They included: financial analysis of company before BPI act; implementation of BPI and second financial analysis of company's performances after BPI implementation. The paper presents a case study research performed to point out the significance of BPR in supply chain management.

We suggest several explanations for the initial divergence and the post-98 convergence in support for transition between these three groups of countries, and show that economic growth, declining income inequality and improving quality of governance have contributed to increase the support for transition. In addition, we find that increased support for the market economy and democracy in the CIS is accompanied by a larger increase in trust towards the political institutions.

There is disagreement among economic historians about the effects of these wars on the trend of US economic growth. This paper aims to answer the following question. Did America as a neutral nation take advantage of economic possibilities caused by Europe at war through trade? To put it differently, this paper questions whether there was an export-led growth due to the war. To answer this question, we re-examined the export-led growth hypothesis for the period 1790-1860 using the ARDL methodology. Based on this methodology, a cointegrated relationship is found among the variables of real GDP, labor, exports and exchange rates. The results suggest that the economic growth of the US was not export-driven. In addition, parallel to the results of unit root tests with structural breaks, the coefficient of the dummy variable was statistically significant in the long run, implying that the war did have a significant effect on the economic growth trend of the US.","[Vergil, Hasan] Bulent Ecevit Univ, Dept Econ, Zonguldak, Turkey; [Ozgur, M.

The error correction framework extends the partial adjustment model by explicitly modelling changes in target leverage and past deviations from such target as determinants of firms' dynamic leverage adjustment process. We also augment our empirical models to test the pecking order theory. Using appropriate and advanced dynamic panel data methods, we find that UK, French and German firms adjust towards target leverage quickly in both the partial adjustment and error correction models, which is consistent with the trade-off theory. We further show that the trade-off theory explains these firms' capital structure decisions better than the pecking order theory in the models nesting the two theories.","Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Dang, VA (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, MBS Crawford House,Booth St W, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",Vietanh.Dang@mbs.ac.uk,"Dang, Viet/AAD-5449-2020","Dang, Viet/0000-0002-3719-3171",,,,,55,22,26,6,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Further, this study evaluates pro-poor growth policies in Pakistan during the period of 1964-2011. The regression model encompassing the impact of economic growth and inequality on poverty reflects that a 1% increase in income while keeping the distribution constant reduces poverty around 0.162% in rural, 0.256% in urban, 0.471% in national pooled and 0.276% in national weighted regression. An increase in Gini coefficient while holding the income constant tends to increase poverty in the national weighted by 2.641%, and in the national pooled around 1.721% respectively. Subsequently, at urban and rural regions, it creates proportionally more poor households in the urban areas (elasticity 1.231) than in the rural areas (elasticity 0.928). The study measures pro-poor growth index that captures gains and losses of growth rates due to changes in the distribution of consumption. The gains imply pro-poor growth, while the losses imply anti-poor growth. Total growth spells in this study are 180 including 20 surveys for rural, 20 surveys for urban and 20 surveys for overall Pakistan. However, the study used three different poverty measures i.e., household count (HHC), poverty gap (PG) and squared poverty gap (SPG), evaluating 60 surveys for each poverty measure. The results conclude that out of the 180 growth spells, 63 growth spells had negative growth rates and 117 spells had positive growth rates. Of the 117 spells when growth rates were positive, growth was pro-poor in 64 cases and anti-poor in 53 cases. In 25 out of 63 spells of negative growth rates, the poor suffered proportionally a greater decline in their consumption compared to the non-poor. Thus, growth processes have not generally been favorable to the poor. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, global economic databases such as GTAP treat energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries rather in aggregate, thereby missing potentially important details on the heterogeneity of these sectors. In this paper, we elaborate on the availability of data resources and methodological issues in disaggregating energy-intensive and trade-exposed sectors that receive larger attention in the public policy debate on unilateral emission regulation: non-ferrous metals, iron and steel and non-metallic minerals. Our sensitivity analysis revolves around three types of unobserved heterogeneity at the sub-sectoral level: trade elasticities, energy consumption and technology specifications. Drawing on the example of border tax adjustments, we find that for all given technology specifications and variation in energy shares, the biggest differences emerge from variations in Armington elasticities. Even moderate changes in Armington elasticities can alter the magnitude and the sign of the effects at the sectoral level. The implications of sub-sectoral disaggregation are not as pronounced for macroeconomic indicators and leakage as for sectoral indicators. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

According to the model, the only unambiguous beneficiaries of net neutrality regulation are content providers. Consumers are unambiguously worse off under net neutrality, while the effect on platform operators is ambiguous. In the aggregate, net neutrality may be either surplus-enhancing or surplus-reducing, because the gains to content providers (and possibly platform operators) may or may not outweigh the losses to consumers (and possibly platform operators), depending on whether certain parameter restrictions are satisfied. However, these restrictions are difficult to interpret, given that the structural parameters lack real-world analogs. In this Comment, I demonstrate that the assumptions underlying the authors' surplus-enhancing result imply a straightforward and testable hypothesis. Specifically, I show that the ratio of aggregate content provider profits to aggregate platform operator profits must be strictly less than 0.4 under net neutrality for the surplus-enhancing result to hold. For many parameter values, the upper bound to the profit ratio is significantly lower. Finally, I provide a brief empirical assessment of the relative profitability of content providers and ISPs. The balance of the empirical evidence reviewed provides little basis for assuming that the relative profitability constraint implied by the model is satisfied in practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, I estimate the intergenerational elasticity using an income dynamic model with intergenerational linkages. The model can explicitly account for sources of biases such as heterogeneous age profile and transitory shocks of changing variance over the lifecycle. The model can be identified through the covariance structure of earnings within individuals and across generations. Based on the models, I simulate the lifetime income of both generations and calculate the implied intergenerational elasticity. Using PSID data from the United States and GSOEP data from Germany, the estimated intergenerational elasticity of fathers and sons is substantially higher than those in the literature. The intergenerational elasticity is as high as 0.66 for the US and 0.48 for Germany. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Whether or not information about the winning bid is disclosed, all losing bidders regret not bidding 0. However, when feedback on the winning bid is provided, those bidders who lost at an affordable price may regret not bidding more. We show that the former effect causes bidders to lower their bids, while the latter effect causes bidders to raise their bids. Our experimental results indicate overbidding whether or not the winning bid is disclosed to losing bidders. However, disclosing the winning bid leads to even more aggressive bidding, increases revenues, decreases the frequency of dropouts and also leads to more efficient allocations.

Despite the marked increase in financial assistance from governmental as well as non-governmental sources in recent years especially, little is known about how well aid is currently distributed across Chinese universities and whether it is successfully reaching needy students. We use a unique randomly-sampled dataset of all local senior college students in one northwest province and a combination of non-parametric, semi-parametric and fixed effects methods to examine how various types of financial aid are currently distributed to students of different backgrounds across the university system. We also evaluate whether aid is reaching the main target population of low-income students. We primarily find that government-financed aid is allocated evenly across universities of varying selectivity and is reaching its target population of low-income students within universities. By contrast, university- and society-financed aid is not reaching low-income students. In addition, students in the most selective universities receive large implicit subsidies as they have high instructional costs, get more aid, and pay low tuition fees. Finally, a significant proportion of disadvantaged students do not seem to receive any type of aid. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

From this setting, this paper aims to analyze university students' consumer responses and motives attributed to CSR practices in business settings, just as the usefulness of academic background as segmentation variable. A survey study was conducted from a total sample of 400 Spanish undergraduates.

Site-choice models seek to explain site choice as a function of only the cost of visiting each site, the physical characteristics of the sites, income, and other characteristics of the individual. They ignore the influence of others on site choice. We find, using choice experiments, that having a companion and the companion's relative ability are critical determinants of site choice-what social psychology would predict. One will often choose a site less preferred in terms of its costs and characteristics if one has a companion of one's ability at the lesser site but not at the better site. Companions of comparable ability are preferred over companions that are better or worse. And, importantly, how one values the physical characteristics of sites depends on whether one has a companion. The magnitudes of our estimated companion effects suggest recreation-demand models that ignore them, all do, omit a critical endogenous variable. An implication is that observed trip patterns can be generated by social-interaction game playing (where I go depends on where you go and ...), not utility maximization in isolation. This paper does not model the game; it estimates a recreator's utility/reaction function with companion effects, showing the importance of the social component. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using an extended version of the integrated assessment model MARIA-23 (Multiregional Approach for Resource and Industry Allocation), we analyze nuclear fuel recycling options, carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS), and biomass utilization. To assess the potential implications of decreased social acceptance of nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident, additional scenarios including a nuclear power expansion limitation, are analyzed. We also evaluate MARIA-23 model simulation estimates of long-term contributions and interrelationships among nuclear power, biomass, and CCS. Finally, potential costs of nuclear limitation under carbon control policies are assessed. The simulation results in this paper suggest the following: (1) under the reference scenario, global GDP losses in climate limitation scenarios range from 1.3% per year to 3.9% per year in 2060, rising to between 3.5% per year and 4.5% per year in 2100; (2) the use of nuclear fuel reprocessing technologies increase rapidly in all carbon control policy scenarios; (3) under a scenario where the price of CO2 is $30 and nuclear power expansion is strictly limited, GDP losses increase significantly-from 4.5% per year to 6.4% per year by 2100; (4) nuclear power and CCS are substitute mitigation technologies. With nuclear power technology available CCS deployment reaches approximately 15,000 Mt-CO2 per year by 2010; without a nuclear power option, CCS deployment rises to more than 80,000 Mt-CO2 per year; and (5) biomass utilization cannot fully compensate for limitations to nuclear power expansion in policy scenarios. In addition to examining the role of these three technologies on global scales, we report results for several major Asian regions, namely Japan, China, and India. China tends to deploy nuclear power (if available) in response to rapidly growing power demands, in all scenarios while India tends to rely less on nuclear power. The potential cost of nuclear power limitation under global warming mitigation in Japan is estimated be significantly higher than in China or India. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The means by which monetary authorities influence prices and quantities can differ, but the obstacles to altering one rather than the other are not insuperable. Inflation is sluggish, and expectations of future interest ratesulong and short, nominal and realuare diverse and uncertain. These factors determine the limited power that monetary authorities enjoy when they conduct quantitative easing. But this policy is not as unconventional as some have claimed, and indeed can be viewed as broadly similar to conventional monetary measures. The impact of quantitative easing, however, could be very different depending on the underlying structure of the economy and the fiscal authorities' responses. Finally, we note some important caveats that must be borne in mind when trying to evaluate the impact of quantitative easing, particularly given the fact that the world's main financial markets are closely linked.","[Sinclair, Peter; Ellis, Colin] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Sinclair, P (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",p.j.n.sinclair@bham.ac.uk; c.ellis@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Today, with few if any exceptions, all countries are open. Croatia is a small and open economy characterized with strong import dependency and external imbalances, thus any serious fluctuation on a global market can endanger its economic stability. Terms of trade as the ratio of export to import prices is an important indicator which improvement can contribute to economic stability and long-term growth. Namely, stable terms of trade facilitate efficient resource allocation and reduce inflationary pressures. While movements in terms of trade trend affect domestic purchasing power and real income, significant terms of trade shocks can lead to macroeconomic instability. This paper adds up to a growing literature on the drivers of Croatian economic growth by examining how terms of trade and its fluctuations affect the economy. Particular attention is placed on the relationship between short and long-run growth perspective and the long-run consequences of the changes in income terms of trade. Empirical modelling is based on an augmented production function and was completed with the usage of cointegration equations and parsimonious error correction models, all suggesting results that are consistent with the theory.","[Skare, Marinko; Tomic, Daniel] Juraj Dobrila Univ, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia; [Simurina, Jurica] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula; University of Zagreb,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr; jsimurina@efzg.hr; dtomic@unipu.hr,"Tomić, Daniel/N-7647-2019; Šimurina, Jurica/H-9243-2018; Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019; Tomić, Daniel/AAD-8845-2020","Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096; Šimurina, Jurica/0000-0002-4806-8894; Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692; Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096",,,,,33,6,6,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In developing countries, demographic profiles, poverty, the labour market and public finances are such that a comprehensive approach to solidarity -combining contributory and non-contributory mechanisms- is essential. In 1981, Chile redesigned the contributory component of its system by means of private health-insurance companies. The rationale of private, individual insurance runs counter to the ethical imperatives of contracts based on social rights. In Europe, this dilemma has been tackled using risk-levelling mechanisms that resolve the conflict between accessibility, efficiency and selection. In Chile, competitive health insurance companies (lsapres) coexist with a solidarity-based State alternative, the National Health Fund (FONASA). The lsapres engage in aggressive risk selection. The challenge for health policy is to integrate the two systems to balance the principles of equivalence and solidarity.","[Uthoff, Andras] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile; [Miguel Sanchez, Jose] Univ Chile, Hlth Management Inst, Santiago, Chile; [Campusano, Rolando] Cent Bank Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile; Central Bank of Chile,"Uthoff, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile.",andrasut@gmail.com; sanchezb.josemiguel@gmail.com; rcampusano@bcentral.cl,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,19,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, CHILE",0251-2920,,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,DEC,2012,,108,,,,,141,159,,,,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,125KM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317538700008,0

A 3SLS model is used to estimate the simultaneous impact of education, income, and health on aggregated subjective well-being (SWB) as measured by state-level WBI. Over 80% of the variation in SWB across states can be explained by differences in education, income, health, age, trust, stress, temperature, religion, and rainfall. Higher education (college degree) has a relatively strong positive effect on SWB, but secondary education (high school) does not. We find no statistically significant educational spillover on SWB across state borders, which suggests that the positive effect of higher education on SWB is mostly due to private non-monetary benefits rather than positive externalities.

We find evidence of structural breaks in the unconditional variance of the stock returns series over the period, with high levels of persistence and variability in the parameter estimates of the GARCH(1,1) model across the sub-samples defined by the structural breaks. This indicates that structural breaks are empirically relevant to stock return volatility in South Africa. However, based on the out-of-sample forecasting exercise, we find that even though there structural breaks in the volatility, there are no statistical gains from using competing models that explicitly accounts for structural breaks, relative to a GARCH(1,1) model with expanding window. This could be because of the fact that the two identified structural breaks occurred in our out-of-sample, and recursive estimation of the GARCH(1,1) model is perhaps sufficient to account for the effect of the breaks on the parameter estimates. Finally, we highlight that, given the point of the breaks, perhaps what seems more important in South Africa, is accounting for leverage effects, especially in terms of long-horizon forecasting of stock return volatility.

The point is developed going back to the classical concepts of productive and unproductive labour. There are two dimensions of these concepts that we discuss. The first links the social efficiency of the financial sector to its role in the reproduction process, crucially distinguishing basic from non-basic uses. We argue that many financial services usually seen as services to production really consist of the provision of gambling facilities, and thereby have to be considered at best as luxury goods. When evaluated according to its reproductive capability, the service of arranging a gambling house cannot be seen as producing social value. A second sense in which the discussion of productive and unproductive labour casts light on the nature of some financial services is that connected to the conception of pure circulation costs, as different from costs of production proper. The amount of circulation costs varies with the varying intensity of the realisation problem. They are not defined by the production technique and are, in this sense, arbitrary.","[Barba, Aldo; de Vivo, Giancarlo] Univ Naples Federico II, I-80126 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Barba, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Econ, Via Cinthia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",albarba@unina.it,,,,,,,44,14,16,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Capacity building is achieved through the addition of production units that are durable and lumpy and whose cost is irreversible. While building their capacity over time, firms compete a la Cournot in the product market given their installed capacity. There is no exogenous order of moves, no commitment regarding future decisions, and no finite horizon. We investigate Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) paths of the investment game, which may include episodes during which firms invest at different times, a preemption pattern, and episodes in which firms invest simultaneously, a tacit collusion pattern. These episodes may alternate and are typically several. When firms have yet to invest in capacity, the sole pattern that is MPE-compatible is a preemption episode: firms invest at different times but have equal value. The first such investment may occur earlier and therefore be riskier than socially optimal. When both firms hold capacity, tacit collusion episodes may be MPE-compatible: firms invest simultaneously at a postponed time (hence holding back production in the meantime), thereby generating an investment wave in the industry. Such investment episodes are more likely with higher demand volatility, faster market growth, and lower cost of capital (discount rate). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we focus our attention on three players: a large speculative bank (hereinafter called Speculator), having immediate access to the market of government bonds, the European Central Bank (ECB) and a State in economic crisis, with a high public debt In this regard, we will analyze the interaction between these three subjects: the Speculator, our first player, the ECB, our second player, and the State, our third player. The financial crisis, that hit the market of European government bonds, showed us that large speculators can influence the financial markets and benefit from the creation of arbitrage opportunities caused by themselves. In this way, the default probability of States in economic difficulty increases significantly and alarmingly. We already heard to talk about concepts like spread and public debt, which has crippled the economies of great States, for instance Italy. In this paper we propose on financial transactions the introduction of a tax, which hits only the speculative profits. We show how the above tax would probably be able to avert the speculation. For this purpose, we compare the different behaviors adopted by the Speculator and by the ECB in case of absence or presence of the tax, with the consequent effects on the State that sells its government bonds, paying particular attention to the movement of the game equilibria. In fact, with the introduction of our tax, all equilibria of the game become excellent for the State in economic difficulty. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model has two key features that jointly drive the result: (i) some agents are altruistic (or ethical), (ii) among the agents who prefer any given candidate, the fraction of altruistic agents is uncertain. When deciding whether to vote or not, an altruistic agent compares her private voting cost with the expected contribution of her vote to the welfare of the society. Under suitable homogeneity assumptions, the asymptotic predictions of my model coincide with those of Feddersen and Sandroni [12] up to potential differences between the respective parameters that measure the importance of the election. I demonstrate with an example that these homogeneity assumptions are not necessary for qualitative predictions of my model. I also show that when the fractions of altruistic agents are known, turnout rates will typically be close to zero in a large election, despite the presence of altruism. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

After receiving noisy, but unbiased performance feedback, participants in an experiment overestimate their own scores on a quiz and believe their feedback to be 'unlucky', estimating that it under-represents their score by 13%. However, they exhibit no such overconfidence in non-ego-relevant beliefs-in this case, estimates of others' scores. Comparing subjects' belief-updating to the Bayesian benchmark, we find that this 'unlucky feeling' is largely due to overconfident priors, with biased updating driving overconfidence only among the participants with the worst-calibrated beliefs. This suggests that social comparisons contribute to the biased response to feedback on relative performance observed in other studies. While feedback improves performance estimates, this learning does not translate into improved estimates of subsequent performances. This suggests that beliefs about ability are updated differently than beliefs about a particular performance, contributing to the persistence of overconfidence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We measure violence with data on individual-level victimizations from the U.S. National Crime Victimization Survey. We examine the effects of a number of different alcohol control policies in reducing violent crime. These policies include the retail price of beer, drunk driving laws and penalties, keg laws and serving and selling laws.

Such games possess properties that can often yield simple characterizations of equilibrium aggregates without requiring that one solves for the equilibrium strategy profile. When payoffs have a quasi-linear structure and a degree of symmetry, we construct a self-generating maximization program over the space of aggregates with the property that the solution set corresponds to the set of equilibrium aggregates of the original n-player game. We illustrate the value of this approach in common-agency games where the players' strategy space is an infinite-dimensional space of nonlinear contracts. We derive equilibrium existence and characterization theorems for both the adverse selection and moral hazard versions of these games. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We incorporate habit formation into intertemporal consumption decision and modify the Calvo price setting to include indexation to past inflation. The message conveyed from this study can be viewed as twofold. First, full stabilization of domestic prices or the output gap is not optimal policy. This is because stabilization of the output gap leads to serial correlation in domestic inflation, whereas under full stabilization of domestic prices the output gap displays some serial correlation. It is, however, shown that at the zero inflation steady state, stabilizing domestic prices is equivalent to stabilizing the output gap. Second, in the presence of foreign income shock inflation and the output gap are more stable under flexible CPI inflation targeting than under other alternative policy regimes considered.

It is assumed that the private goods and the public good are weakly separable. It is demonstrated that if all of the private goods are weak gross complements to each other, then the Laffer effect does not exist, in other words, higher tax rates can always achieve more tax revenue. In contrast, if all of the private goods are strict gross substitutes, then the Laffer effect does exist. Moreover, if all of the private goods are weak gross substitutes, then the government cannot fully acquire the leisure endowment through taxes on consumption goods.

Drawing from a unique geo-referenced dataset of unemployment spells in the Paris region over an extensive period of time (1993-2003), we are able to measure the direct effect of the program on unemployment duration, distinguishing between short- and medium-term effects. This is done by implementing an original two-stage empirical strategy using individual data in the first stage and aggregate data and conditional linear matching techniques in the second stage. We show that although the enterprise zone program tended to pick winners, it is likely to be cost-ineffective. It had a small but significant effect on the rate at which unemployed workers find a job (which is increased by a modest 3%). This effect is localized and significant only in the short run (i.e. at best during the 3 years that follow the start of the policy). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To estimate the pass-through of the value of an environmental amenity, I exploit the reduction in suspended particulate matter (PM10) due to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). Using instrumental variables at varying levels of spatial aggregation I find that the 1990 CAAA led to a significant increase in rents, but the estimated percentage effect is about half as large as that of owner-occupied housing values. Little of this difference is driven by income differences between renters and homeowners: when stratifying by income and comparing the effect of the 1990 CAAA on housing values and rents, point estimates suggest that half of the increase in value is passed on to renters in the form of higher rents. This suggests that pass-through may be incomplete, but landowners still capture much of the value of the air quality regulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Identification comes from the use of the 1990s Balkan wars (in Bosnia and Kosovo) as a source of exogenous variation in immigrant inflows to mitigate a possible Tiebout-type bias from endogenous mobility. An increase in foreign population is found to have a small negative effect on public education expenditures. The elasticity of education spending with respect to immigrant population share is -.15. The negative relationship between immigration and public spending on education is consistent with the empirical literature showing evidence on low levels of public good provision in heterogeneous and ethnic diverse societies.

In a first experiment, we find that higher report scores are associated with an increased use of the representativeness heuristic (overweighting sample information). We find no evidence of increased conservatism (overweighting prior information).

We estimate a structural model of sequential trading in which trading decisions are classified in five types: private-information based, noise, herd, contrarian and irresolute. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we estimate the posterior distributions of the structural parameters. This technique allows us to compare several non-nested models of trade arrival. We find that the model best fitting the data is that in which a proportion of trades stems from subjects who do not rely only on their private information once the difference between the number of previous buy and sell decisions is at least two. In this model, the majority of trades stem from subjects following their private information. There is also a large proportion of noise trading activity, which is biased towards buying the asset. We observe little herding and contrarianism, as theory suggests. Finally, we observe a significant proportion of (irresolute) subjects who follow their own private information when it agrees with public information, but abstain from trading when it does not.","[Cipriani, Marco] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Costantini, Riccardo; Guarino, Antonio] UCL, London, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; University of London; University College London,"Cipriani, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA.",marco.cipriani@ny.frb.org; riccardo.costantini.10@ucl.ac.uk; a.guarino@ucl.ac.uk,"Cipriani, Marco/JWA-1923-2024","Cipriani, Marco/0000-0003-1960-3963",ESRC [ES/D001129/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/D001129/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,8,6,7,0,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

A detailed classification of family structures is constructed that clarifies key differences among various types of diverse families, and facilitates equivalencies testing and pairwise comparisons across nontraditional family structures. The NSAF contains a large number of observations for less common, but growing, family structures such as single-father families, grandparent-headed households and cohabiters, which makes such detailed analyses feasible and allows further stratification by child age, gender and race. The data also contains information on child behavioral, educational and physical health outcomes, as well as extensive household characteristics, economic resources and parental behaviors and inputs. Results suggest that differences across nontraditional family structures are particularly prominent for child health outcomes and that the gender of the resident parent is empirically important, more so than the presence of a cohabiting or married step-parent. Children in single father families have lesser access to health care yet enjoy better health outcomes than those in other families, even after controlling for economic resources (and inputs). In contrast, few differences are found between grandparent-headed families and other non-parent families. While we explore alternative explanations for these results, our cross-sectional data and complex set of family structure variables preclude isolating causal relationships; instead, our analyses yield empirically important distinctions that point to promising avenues for future research.","[Conway, Karen Smith] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Li, Minghua] Franklin Pierce Univ, Business Adm Div, Rindge, NH 03461 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Conway, KS (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, McConnell Hall,15 Acad Way, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",ksconway@unh.edu; liming@franklinpierce.edu,,,,,,,46,17,25,1,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We show that more than half of the previously suggested FDI determinants are not robust and highlight theories that do receive robust support from the data. Our selection approach allows us to identify the determinants, of the margins of FDI (intensive and extensive), which are shown to differ profoundly.

Utilizing an econometric energy demand model, the (in)efficiency of each state is modeled and it is argued that this represents a measure of the inefficient use of residential energy in each state (i.e. 'waste energy'). This underlying efficiency for the US is therefore observed for each state as well as the relative efficiency across the states. Moreover, the analysis suggests that energy intensity is not necessarily a good indicator of energy efficiency, whereas by controlling for a range of economic and other factors, the measure of energy efficiency obtained via this approach is. This is a novel approach to model residential energy demand and efficiency and it is arguably particularly relevant given current US energy policy discussions related to energy efficiency.

This paper looks back at the major episodes in this history since World War II, including the initial freeing of monetary policy from war-related interest-pegging, the Federal Reserve's delayed but ultimately successful response to the inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s, the brief experiment with monetary aggregate targets, the extraordinary actions prompted by the 2007-9 financial crisis, and the current tentative exploration of inflation targeting. The paper concludes that the tension between the desire for rule-based policymaking and the practicalities that lead central bankers to preserve discretion in actual policy decisions does not admit of any easy, straightforward solution, and therefore that this tension is likely to persist into the Federal Reserve's next century too.

To this end, the gravity model was estimated through fixed effects model and panel cointegration analysis. It was found that the explanatory power of the latter has superseded the former one. For the case of EU, it was found that the intra-union trade-creation effect is approximately six times larger than extra-union effects. In NAFTA, exports to outside countries are significantly diverted. For MERCOSUR, on the other hand, results indicate that the integration has not contributed to intra-union trade. The members are still significantly dependent on extra-union imports, just like the members of AFTA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

At that time Peter's view was that contingent valuation was hopeless, while I was dubious but somewhat more optimistic. But 20 years later, after millions of dollars of largely government-funded research, I have concluded that Peter's earlier position was correct and that contingent valuation is hopeless. In this paper, I selectively review the contingent valuation literature, focusing on empirical results. I find that three long-standing problems continue to exist: 1) hypothetical response bias that leads contingent valuation to overstatements of value; 2) large differences between willingness to pay and willingness to accept; and 3) the embedding problem which encompasses scope problems. The problems of embedding and scope are likely to be the most intractable. Indeed, I believe that respondents to contingent valuation surveys are often not responding out of stable or well-defined preferences, but are essentially inventing their answers on the fly, in a way which makes the resulting data useless for serious analysis. Finally, I offer a case study of a prominent contingent valuation study done by recognized experts in this approach, a study that should be only minimally affected by these concerns but in which the answers of respondents to the survey are implausible and inconsistent.","MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Hausman, J (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jhausman@mit.edu,,,,,,,25,428,489,3,96,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We argue that this puzzling regularity may be attributed to players' perceptions of their opponents' skill or level of rationality. We first show theoretically that it is the case by modelling a two-stage game of capacity investment and pricing with bounded rational players. We then design an experiment in which we use the level of experience as a proxy for the level of rationality and match subjects with different levels of experience. We find significant differences in behavior depending on opponents' experience; moreover, players facing inexperienced players tend to choose higher capacities than they would otherwise.

The formal general equilibrium model is an extreme case in which every element is directly connected to every other and in which all potential external connections, including connections from the future, are incorporated in the data. The foundational assumption of this paper is that viable systems must be selectively connected, and that viable large systems are highly-decomposable assemblies of smaller systems. As Simon argued, quasi-decomposability has made evolution possible from the beginning of the universe. Economies are evolutionary systems, in which human intentionality is a novel feature which modifies but does not supersede the processes of novelty generation, selection and diffusion. The microfoundations for this study are found in the characteristics of the human brain as a system of selective connections. Human knowledge consists of domain-limited patterns imposed on events. Organization-selective connections-is thus basic; but the potential for human knowledge is greatly enhanced by specialisation between domains, combined with variation within each. Co-ordination and development, so often separated in economic theory, are interconnected; they are both ordered processes-not states, in which markets (alongside many other institutions) are prime sources of order.","Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Loasby, BJ (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",b.j.loasby@stir.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,12,14,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In addition, the number of firms is growing faster in clustered areas than non-clustered ones. Together these patterns suggest that China's industrialization process is largely cluster-based-a phenomenon in which a large number of highly interconnected firms are located within a well-defined geographic region.

Starting from the high-growth steady state, a positive impulse in the deficit ratio exerts an adverse effect on economic growth in the long run, after an initial rise.

This paper utilizes the early-warning framework to evaluate whether during the period of the Great Recession there has been a structural break in the relationship between fundamentals and exchange rates. This is done by extending an original data set from 1999 and including not only the most recent period, but also 17 new countries. The analysis considers two variations of the original early-warning system. First, two new methods are proposed to obtain the probability distribution of the early-warning indicator (conditional on the occurrence of a crisis)one fully parametric and one based on a novel distribution-free semi-parametric approach. Second, the original early-warning indicator is compared with a core indicator that includes only pseudo-financial variables (domestic credit/GDP, the real exchange rate, international reserves and the real interest-rate differential) and their performance is evaluated not only for currency crises during the Great Recession, but also for the Asian Crisis. The conclusion from all tests is that this time is different, i.e. early-warning systems based on traditional macroeconomic variables have not only failed to forecast currency crises during the Great Recession, but have also significantly worsened with respect to the period of the Asian crisis.","[De Arcangelis, Giuseppe] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Social Sci, Econ Sect, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Arduini, T (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Social Sci, Econ Sect, Rome, Italy.",g.dearcangelis@caspur.it,,"De Arcangelis, Giuseppe/0000-0002-2518-8535; Arduini, Tiziano/0000-0002-2574-7536",,,,,17,7,8,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

To understand this relationship we develop a theory of an economy where firms with heterogeneous demands use labor and knowledge to produce. Entrepreneurs decide the number of layers of management and the knowledge and span of control of each agent. As a result, in the theory, heterogeneity in demand leads to heterogeneity in productivity and other firms' outcomes. We use the theory to analyze the impact of international trade on organization and calibrate the model to the U.S. economy. Our results indicate that, as a result of a bilateral trade liberalization, firms that export will increase the number of layers of management. The new organization of the average exporter results in higher productivity, although the responses of productivity are heterogeneous across these firms. Liberalizing trade from autarky to the level of openness in 2002 results in a 1% increase in productivity for the marginal exporter and a 1.8% increase in its revenue productivity. Endogenous organization increases the gains from trade by 41% relative to standard models.

We model a population of agents from two exogenous and well defined social groups. Agents are randomly matched to play a reduced-form bargaining game. We show that this struggle for resources drives a conflict through the rational destruction of surplus. We assume that the population contains both rational players and behavioral players. Behavioral players aggressively discriminate against members of the other social group. The existence and specification of the behavioral player is motivated by the social identity literature. For rational players, group membership has no payoff-relevant consequences. We show that rational players can contribute to the conflict by aggressively discriminating and that this behavior is consistent with existing empirical evidence. Our paper relates to the empirical literature which finds that social heterogeneity tends to be increasing in economic variables which we interpret as indicating inefficiency. We provide an explanation that, as social groups compete for surplus, disagreement and inefficiency can result. Our work also relates to the social conflict literature, which examines the relationship between macro level factors such as unemployment and civil disturbances. This literature finds that the amount of social conflict tends to be increasing in the inequitability of the environment.","Rutgers State Univ, Camden, NJ 08102 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Camden,"Smith, J (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Camden, NJ 08102 USA.",smithj@camden.rutgers.edu,"Smith, John/GYJ-1302-2022; Smith, John/Y-2316-2019; Smith, John/HJB-2300-2022","Smith, John/0000-0001-6885-1117;",,,,,59,7,12,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The centrepiece of the study is the issue of the export premium, i.e. the size and productivity advantages of exporting firms compared to their purely domestic peers. We present evidence for the existence of sales, labour productivity and wage premia. These results are largely in line with the results found for other European countries. Furthermore we document the existence of large differences in these premia across industries and provide explanations for this finding. Our results are robust with regards to including additional firm control variables such as employment and R&D-related variables though the magnitudes of the export premia become much smaller. We also propose a new interpretation of the export premium estimation with firm fixed effects which we interpret as a result on export switchers.

The Johansen cointegration test suggests that PDI, the user cost of capital, public investment, FDI and economic growth are cointegrated in Malaysia. The Granger causality test reveals that there is hi-directional causality between the variables in the long run. Meanwhile, there is strong evidence of hi-directional causality between PDI and economic growth. In addition, the user cost of capital, PUB and FDI show hi-directional causality with PDI and GDP in the short run. For completeness, generalised variance decomposition is also generated and the results suggest that PDI and FDI are more important than the user cost of capital and PUB in explaining the variation in economic growth. Finally, the generalised impulse response function confirms that a shock to the GDP, PUB and FDI exerts a positive effect on PDI, while the user cost capital exerts a negative effect on PDI in Malaysia.","[Tang, Chor Foon] Univ Malaya, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,,bewahtan@gmail.com; tcfoon@yahoo.com,"Tan, Bee Wah/AAL-5374-2021; Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222",,,,,59,7,7,0,22,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Our first approach concerns a parameterized family that contains several important rules (Thomson in Soc Choice Welf 31:667-692, 2008). We give a condition that the parameters defining two members of the family should satisfy for one of them to Lorenz dominate the other. Our second approach exploits the concept of consistency (Young in Math Oper Res 12:398-414, 1987). We derive a criterion to deduce Lorenz domination for arbitrarily many claimants from Lorenz domination in the two-claimant case. Our third approach is based on the notion of an operator on the space of rules (Thomson and Yeh in J Econ Theory 143:177-198, 2008). We develop conditions under which operators preserve the Lorenz order, or reverse it.

The general features of the model can be summarised as follows: Calvo style nominal price rigidities, perfect exchange rate pass-through, complete international asset markets, rule of thumb price setters and distortionary taxation. The parameter estimates show that the monetary authority reacts to inflation but only weakly reacts to the output gap. The degree of interest rate smoothing is high.

Peak electricity demand occurs at the highest temperatures which are predicted to increase due to climate change. Understanding how newer buildings differ from older buildings improves forecasts of how peak electricity use will grow over time. Newer buildings are subject to stricter building energy codes, but are larger and more likely to have air conditioning; hence, the cumulative effect is ambiguous. This paper combines four large datasets of building and household characteristics, weather data, and utility data to estimate the electricity-temperature response of different building vintages. Estimation results show that new buildings (1970-2000) have a statistically significantly higher temperature response (i.e., use more electricity) than old buildings (pre1970). Auxiliary regressions with controls for tiered electricity prices, number of bedrooms, income, square footage, central air conditioning, ownership, and type of residential structure partially decompose the effect. Though California has had extensive energy efficiency building standards that by themselves would lower temperature response for new buildings, the cumulative effect of new buildings is an increase in temperature response. As new buildings are added, aggregate temperature response is predicted to increase. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The result that we establish takes the form of an analogue to the standard Hardy-Littlewood-Polya theorem for distributions of one cardinal attribute. More specifically, we identify the transformations of the distributions which guarantee that social welfare increases according to utilitarian unanimity provided that the utility function is concave in the cardinal attribute and that its marginal utility with respect to the same attribute is non-increasing in the ordinal attribute. We establish that this unanimity ranking of the distributions is equivalent to the ordered poverty gap quasi-ordering introduced by Bourguignon [12]. Finally, we show that, if one distribution dominates another according to the ordered poverty gap criterion, then the former can be derived from the latter by means of an appropriate and finite sequence of such transformations.

Our findings indicate that tax reforms are accompanied by large increases in labour supply that differ across demographic groups, with the bulk of the increase coming from married females.

Nonlinearity is justified by distortions due to the use of short selling, leverage, derivatives and illiquid assets for hedge fund strategies. Among nonlinear models, switching regime (STR) models are applied to reproduce the dynamics of hedge fund returns. This nonlinear multivariate modeling has the advantage of capturing the time-varying exposure of hedge fund strategies to risk factors, and of specifying the asymmetric relationship between hedge fund returns and risk. The findings are interesting and provide several contributions to the hedge fund literature. First, we show that the dynamics of hedge fund returns exhibit significant asymmetry and nonlinearity, indicating that they evolve and vary asymmetrically in accordance with stages in financial cycles. Second, hedge fund exposure to risk factors also varies over time, depending on the strategy and the regime. Finally, our modeling captures the most important changes in hedge fund exposure to risk factors induced by the recent global financial crisis (2008-2009). (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here we consider a model of diffusion where the individuals' behavior is the result of a strategic choice. We study a simple coordination game with binary choice and give a condition for a new action to become widespread in a random network. We also analyze the possible equilibria of this game and identify conditions for the coexistence of both strategies in large connected sets. Finally we look at how can firms use social networks to promote their goals with limited information. Our results differ strongly from the one derived with epidemic models and show that connectivity plays an ambiguous role: while it allows the diffusion to spread, when the network is highly connected, the diffusion is also limited by high-degree nodes which are very stable.

These phenomena are called spikes (upward movements) and drops (downward movements). Recent research has suggested that the dynamics of the electricity spot prices can be accurately described by hidden Markov Regime Switching (MRS) models. Regime switch models separate the ordinary dependence and the extreme (spike or drop) dependence. This is a crucial point since it is the extreme dependence that is of interest when computing risks. We fit a large number of MRS models to six European electricity markets (EEX, PowerNext, APX Power UK & NL, Nord Pool System & Sweden) in order to analyze the nature of the prices. The estimated regimes are then used to analyze the probability of an extreme event and the conditional probability for one market to experience an extreme event, conditional that another market is experiencing the same event. We find that the frequency of extreme events is positively related to the amount of renewable energy sources in the power system. It can be argued that the dependence results in this paper give an indication of what future dependence (for even more integrated markets with more renewable energy) will be. The integration of markets will lead to efficient sharing of reserves while the additional renewable energy will increase the need for reserves. The results are of interest when computing financial risks (e.g. VaR or expected shortfall), when designing reserves but also as an indication of the degree of integration between markets.

The setting is a middle income country with productivity growth driven by technology adoption and foreign capital goods stimulating spillover and catching up. The interaction of technology adoption and capital accumulation generates prolonged transition growth and strengthens the growth effect of increased openness. Model simulations reproduce the changing openness in South Africa 1960-2005. International sanctions and protectionism are represented by a calibrated tariff equivalent, and the counterfactual elimination of the tariff equivalent shows large potential for GDP growth. According to our preferred parameterization increased trade share by 10% points raises GDP level over time by about 12%. Separating the effects of openness between investment and productivity we find that almost 60% of the increase in GDP is due to increased productivity, partly because of interaction with higher investment.

First, the volatility of a firm's share price is exclusively driven by the volatility of the industry's market-size.

In this paper, we argue that in addition to the exchange rate itself, exchange rate uncertainty could also affect domestic consumption.

We analyze the rule formation of a sample of irrigation systems based on the ADICO syntax (Crawford & Ostrom, 1995; Ostrom, 2005). Farmer-managed irrigation systems generally are autonomous in devising their own rules based on local context considering the ideas, norms and beliefs shared within the community. Rule formation in agency-managed irrigation systems, however, is mostly done by external officials. Strong rule enforcement mechanisms were found in farmer-managed systems compared with agency-managed systems. Better rule enforcement created favorable conditions for collective action among the users and ensured better performance of the irrigation systems. Results imply that the formation of new rules should fully consider biophysical attributes as well as community beliefs and ideas.","[Bastakoti, Ram C.; Shivakoti, Ganesh P.] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology,"Bastakoti, RC (通讯作者)，Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand.",rcbastakoti@gmail.com,,"Bastakoti, Ram C/0000-0003-2456-5420",,,,,39,24,29,1,52,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

We claim two main contributions. First, we use more sophisticated measures of the degree of exposure to competition from immigrants than previously done. In addition to education, we focus on the protection derived from (self-assessed) investments in job-specific human capital and from specialization in occupations that are (objectively) intensive in communication tasks. Second, we explicitly account for the potential endogeneity arising from job search. Methodologically, we estimate by instrumental variables, an econometric model that allows for heterogeneity at the individual, regional and country level. Drawing on the 2004-2005 European Social Survey, we obtain the following main results. First, natives that dislike immigrants tend to work in low-immigration jobs, biasing OLS estimates. Second, working in jobs that require high levels of specific human capital leads to relatively more pro-immigration attitudes, although this effect is only found for respondents with more than 12 years of schooling. Third, the degree of manual (communicational) intensity of workers' occupations has a negative (positive) effect on their pro-immigration views. This effect is the most significant, both in a statistical and in a quantitative sense, and is distinct from the protection from immigrant competition provided by formal education. Overall our results suggest a large role for skill-based labor market competition in determining individual attitudes toward immigration.

The first redistributes additional revenue as extra income to households, while the second directs revenue into increased investment. We investigate immediate versus gradual subsidy removal, focusing on the transition dynamics at play. A purpose-built dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model is deployed with a unique Social Accounting Matrix of Iran. It is shown that rebating the extra revenue to households would adversely affect the labour market. Industries and employment contract due to the Dutch Disease effect and the more expensive fuel inputs. Channeling extra revenue into investment, however, considerably improves the labour market's fortunes in the long run via increased capital accumulation and shifts in industrial composition. Gradual subsidy removal allows for a smoother transition that minimizes short-run costs in the labour market. (C) 2011 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

First, the hypothesis of a long-run relationship between these variables is tested using bivariate cointegrated systems and employing the methodology of cointegration analysis. Second, causality tests utilizing standard Granger regressions and ECM models are carried out to determine the direction of causality between indicators of economic growth and financial development, and economic growth and trade openness. Lastly, the study comprises a period of seventy years, a first for a study of this kind on Bolivia.

Based on a critical assessment of the reliability and consistency of various primary data sources, we bring together a new database that provides trends in value added and employment at a detailed 35-sector level. Structural decomposition analysis suggests that for China, India and Russia reallocation of labor across sectors is contributing to aggregate productivity growth, whereas in Brazil it is not. This confirms and strengthens the findings of McMillan and Rodrik [NBER Working Paper 17143, 2011]. However, this result is overturned when a distinction is made between formal and informal activities within sectors. Increasing formalization of the Brazilian economy since 2000 appears to be growth-enhancing, while in India the increase in informality after the reforms is growth-reducing.

Using a decomposition framework recently developed by one of the authors, we determined that the major factors driving innovation inequality are population, economic development level, R&D, location and openness. The aggravated innovation inequality reflects the growth of China's innovation centers in the eastern region and their admission into the global innovation networks. The fact that R&D is a major factor driving the inequality suggests that, considered in the present study, the efficiency of R&D investment improved in certian regions during the period (19952006). Finally, geographic location and openness affect innovation inequality primarily through the coupled evolution of innovation capability and economic development, resulting in first-mover advantages to provinces of the eastern region.","[Fan, Peilei] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Wan, Guanghua] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Indian Ocean Econ, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ming] Fudan Univ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Michigan State University; Yunnan University of Finance & Economics; Fudan University,"Fan, PL (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",fanpeile@msu.edu; guanghuawan@yahoo.com; lm@fudan.edu.cn,"Fan, Peilei/ADY-3708-2022",,,,,,48,23,23,4,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2012,20,3,,,,,16,36,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01285.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,952BD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304763800002,0

General conditions are given for the prevalence of such stereotypes under correct expectations on exogenous uncertainty. In monotone selection games susceptible to winner's curse, naive behavioral equilibrium leading to aggravation of adverse selection has been shown to match plausible informational assumptions of experienced, but behaviorally biased, equilibrium play.

COOPER; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; ENERGY; COLLABORATION; OUTPUTS; MODELS; PRICE,"The economic concept of weak and strong disposability on undesirable outputs dominated the previous discussions on DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) radial measurement for environmental assessment. This study reexamines the economic concept from the perspective of corporate strategies on how to adapt a regulation change on undesirable outputs. The economic concept of disposability, conventionally accepted by production economists, is replaced by natural and managerial disposability in this study. The natural disposability implies an environmental strategy that a firm attempts to decrease an input vector to reduce a vector of undesirable outputs. Given the decreased input vector, the firm attempts to increase a vector of desirable outputs as much as possible. This type of strategy indicates negative adaptation. Meanwhile, the managerial disposability indicates an opposite strategy by increasing the input vector. This disposability expresses an environmental strategy by which a firm considers a regulation change on undesirable outputs as a new business opportunity. A firm attempts to improve its unified (operational and environmental) performance by utilizing new technology and/or new management. The strategy indicates positive adaptation. Considering the two types of disposability, this study discusses how to measure unified efficiency under natural and managerial disposability by DEA radial models. To document the practicality of the proposed DEA environmental assessment, this study applies it to compare the performance of U.S. coal-fired power plants under ISOs/RTOs (Independent System Operators/Regional Transmission Organizations) with that of the other power plants not belonging to any organization. This study identifies two empirical findings. One of the two findings is that the latter coal-fired power plants outperform the former power plants belonging to ISOs/RTOs in terms of three efficiency measures. This result indicates that ISOs and RTOs do not provide an effective coordination for coal-fired power plants at the level that can be found in the other power plants. The other finding is that there is technological improvement in the operation of coal-fired power plants. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We first introduce major economic theories of suicide and then present a summary of a variety of empirical studies from the socio-economic perspective. To shed light on the mixed empirical evidence, we employ a meta-regression method to investigate how the existing empirical results vary. We have identified a publication bias, not highlighted previously, in the existing literature with respect to several commonly employed socio-economic factors. Several characteristics of existing studies have been identified as influencing the qualitative outcome. We then discuss the recent developments in economic studies on suicide, on the basis of the authors ongoing project on suicide.

Third, the evolution of preferences for rewarding and the evolution of preferences for punishing influence each other decisively. Rewarders can invade a population of self-interested players. The existence of rewarders enhances the evolutionary success of punishers, who then crowd out all other preferences.

At the same time, member countries exhibited distinct non-synchronized output fluctuations, giving rise to a pattern of 'rotating slumps' (a term coined by Olivier Blanchard). This paper presents a stylized theoretical model of a monetary union which demonstrates how inflation differentials and relative output movements interact dynamically. A number of implications are derived from the model. In particular, national fiscal policies are shown to have an important role in containing internal macroeconomic disparities in a monetary union. An optimal fiscal policy rule is derived from the model for that purpose.","Univ Freiburg, Inst Allgemeine Wirtschaftsforsch, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Landmann, O (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Inst Allgemeine Wirtschaftsforsch, Pl Alten Synagoge, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",oliver.landmann@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Whereas the time path impacts only the transitional paths of aggregate quantities, it has both transitional and permanent consequences for wealth and income distribution. Hence, the growth-inequality tradeoff generated by a given discrete increase in productivity contrasts sharply with that obtained when the same productivity increase occurs gradually. The latter can generate a Kuznets-type relationship between inequality and per-capita income. Our results suggest that economies with similar aggregate structural characteristics may have different outcomes for income and wealth inequality, depending on the nature of the productivity growth path.

Our paper distinguishes itself from previous studies in several aspects. First, while previous studies concentrate on the viability of linear forecasting techniques, we evaluate the profitability of the forecasts of the self-exciting threshold autoregressive model (SETAR), and compare it with the conventional linear AR and MA trading rules. Second, the findings of market inefficiency in earlier studies mainly rest on the statistical significance of the autocorrelation or regression coefficients. In contrast, this paper directly examines the profitability of various trading rules. Third, our sample covers an extensive period of 1991-2010. Sub-sample analysis shows that positive returns mainly concentrate in the pre-SOE reform period, suggesting that China's stock market has become more efficient after the reform.

Stimulated by demand from urban areas, commercial networks are forming with high added value, as in the beef industry. Borrowing from methods for analyzing agricultural systems and from institutionalist approaches, this article recalls the major changes in the Kirghiz agro-pastoral system during collectivization and then decollectivization. By identifying the major types of private farms, their operational rationale and position in the beef industry, light is shed on the power relations that determine access to resources and an increased share of the value-added. When looking at how market transactions are actually carried out, we observe a flexible system, borne by the entrepreneurial strategies of big farms and merchants. The beef trade is a factor favoring the economic integration of farms at the local and regional levels.","Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre, ENS Lyon, Paris, France",Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON),"de la Martinière, R (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre, ENS Lyon, Paris, France.",raphaele.delamartiniere@gmail.com,,,,,,,65,1,1,0,5,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

We find that under perfect monitoring almost all groups coordinate at the payoff-dominant equilibrium. However, when individuals can only observe the actions of their immediate neighbors in a circle network, monitoring improves neither coordination nor efficiency relative to a baseline treatment without real-time monitoring. We argue that the inefficacy of imperfect monitoring is due to information uncertainty, that is, uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a neighbor's actions. Information uncertainty prevents individuals from inferring safely that their group has managed to coordinate from the available information.","[Nikiforakis, Nikos] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Deck, Cary] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Walton Coll Business, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Melbourne; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Nikiforakis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",cdeck@walton.uark.edu; n.nikiforakis@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,25,18,23,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Its main objective is to analyse the predicted probabilities of completing upper-secondary and tertiary education for individuals with different parental background, and the changes in these probabilities across birth cohorts extending from 1940 to 1980. The results suggest that the disparities in tertiary education opportunities in Italy tend to increase over time. By contrast, the gap in educational opportunity in Spain shows a marked decrease across the cohorts. Moreover, by using an intuitive decomposition strategy, the paper shows that a large part of the educational gap between individuals from different educational backgrounds is composed of the difference in the endowment of family characteristics. Specifically, it seems that more highly educated parents are more able to endow their children with a better composition of family characteristics, which accounts for a significant proportion of the observed disparities in educational opportunity.",,,,,"Di Paolo, Antonio/F-1800-2015","Di Paolo, Antonio/0000-0003-0000-7301",,,,,41,8,12,2,16,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

An ARDL bounds test approach is a suitable technique to examine energy-growth nexus, within the context of countries with both sporadic shocks (outliers) and permanent shocks (structural breaks). Empirical results suggest bidirectional causality between energy and growth in both the long-run and short-run, supporting the feedback hypothesis. The results reveal themselves to be robust to panel framework. An energy conservation policy will reduce GDP growth, while a saving phenomenon is observed, since one additional unit of product requires less than one unit of energy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, we apply the model with a Markov trend component to U.S. quarterly real GDP. The results suggest that the combination of a temporal disaggregation model with Markov switches leads to a successful representation of the data relative to the existing literature.

A teenage girl in Mississippi is four times more likely to give birth than a teenage girl in New Hampshire-and 15 times more likely to give birth as a teen compared to a teenage girl in Switzerland. We examine teen birth rates alongside pregnancy, abortion, and shotgun marriage rates as well as the antecedent behaviors of sexual activity and contraceptive use. We demonstrate that variation in income inequality across U.S. states and developed countries can explain a sizable share of the geographic variation in teen childbearing. Our reading of the totality of evidence leads us to conclude that being on a low economic trajectory in life leads many teenage girls to have children while they are young and unmarried. Teen childbearing is explained by the low economic trajectory but is not an additional cause of later difficulties in life. Surprisingly, teen birth itself does not appear to have much direct economic consequence. Our view is that teen childbearing is so high in the United States because of underlying social and economic problems. It reflects a decision among a set of girls to drop-out of the economic mainstream; they choose nonmarital motherhood at a young age instead of investing in their own economic progress because they feel they have little chance of advancement.","[Kearney, Melissa S.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Levine, Phillip B.] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA; [Kearney, Melissa S.; Levine, Phillip B.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Wellesley College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kearney, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",kearney@econ.bsos.umd.edu; plevine@wellesley.edu,,,,,,,58,191,282,5,91,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This article focuses on the medium-run effects of fuel economy regulation. We estimate consumers' willingness to pay for vehicle characteristics. We employ a novel empirical strategy that accounts for the characteristics' endogeneity by using variation of engine models used in vehicle models. The results imply that consumers value an increase in power more than an increase in fuel economy. Simulations of the effects of an increase in the CAFE standard suggest that regulatory costs are significantly smaller in the medium run than in the short run.","[Klier, Thomas] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Klier, T (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA.",thomas.klier@chi.frb.org; linn@rff.org,"Linn, Joshua/AAT-6768-2021","Klier, Thomas/0000-0002-6242-498X",,,,,25,79,113,3,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0741-6261,,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Since then, farmers' tax burdens have risen steeply and become a major challenge to the state legitimacy. How to account for the huge regional variation? Why were some localities able to tax more heavily than others? Based on a national survey of village governance in China, we examine farmers' burdens empirically and identify political and social factors that explain the local governments' ability to tax farmers. This paper suggests that developments since the 1990s have shown that it overstates local discretionary power and does not pay enough attention to societal forces in understanding local public finance.

Despite the absence of private valuations, asymmetric information, or risk aversion, bidder strategies do not converge to the Bertrand-Nash equilibrium strategies even in the long run. Deviations from equilibrium strategies depend on uncertainty regarding the value of the good, auction structure, the agents' learning model, and the number of bidders. Although individual agents learn Nash bidding strategies in isolation, the learning of each agent, by flattening the best-reply correspondence of other agents, blocks common learning. These negative externalities are more severe in second-price auctions, auctions with many bidders, and auctions where the good has an uncertain value ex post. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We present a model of music piracy with endogenous copying costs: consumers' costs of illegal downloads increase with the scarcity of a recording and are therefore negatively related to the number of originals sold. Allowing for a second source of revenues apart from record sales, we show that piracy can hurt some artists while benefiting others. Under plausible assumptions, piracy is beneficial to the most popular artists. However, this does not carry over to less popular artists, who are often harmed by piracy. We conclude that piracy tends to reduce musical variety. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
